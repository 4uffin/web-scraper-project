Ben Kenigsberg
New York Times
What gives the documentary an added edge is that the director implicates himself in the proceedings.

Scott Tobias
The Reveal
Apart from anything else, Predators is a clinic in documentary ethics, but Osit’s intellect doesn’t mute his pain, sensitivity and outrage. It’s a film for the heart and the head.
Rated: 4.5/5

Liz Shannon Miller
Consequence
The core question Predators aims to explore isn't the motivations of the original men who were caught in Hansen's trap — it's why the show was fascinating viewing for so many people.
Rated: B

Film Threat
All in all, it’s an effective meditation on the show and the aftermath of it.
Rated: 7.5/10

Spectrum Culture
Predators poses some big questions about morality and what, if anything, we owe to those looking to harm or take advantage of others.

Predators is thought-provoking and upsetting in all the ways you don’t expect it to be.
