Even with classic rivalries and storybook romance attempts, â€˜The Wrong Parisâ€™ just doesnâ€™t scratch a genuine itch.
Rated: 1/4

The Wrong Paris, written by Nicole Henrich and directed by Janeen Damian, somehow serves the synthetic sugar of both The Bachelor and the Hallmark movie without any sweetness. The formula is there, but not the flavor.
Rated: 2/5

While the movieâ€™s production design has considerable mojo, the anodyne writing reins in whatever satire one might have expected.

While the movie is absolutely outlandish, it is a beautiful addition to the rom-com genre because it is new and different.

Not everything in the script is linear, and the chemistry that's required between the protagonists...can be found in your living room. [Full review in Spanish]

Frothy and easy on the eyes, this romcom is chock full of stereotypes, but it does exactly what it sets out to do.

Appears like a typical Hallmark movie. It's also an insult to the ranching lifestyle plagued with inaccuracies.

The Wrong Paris is funny, sharp, and full of heart. Extremely well written,
the dialogue flows, the humor earned, It's layered and engaging with authentic performances. The twist lands, and using the dating-show craze as a backdrop rather than a gimmick makes it feel timely and original. I'm not usually a romcom fan, which made this even more satisfying. Smart writing, real chemistry, clean direction, and laughs that feel earned. It's a MUST watch. Five stars and recommending it to my friends.

Not a horrible movie, however I think If you are going to make a movie in Texas with Texas characters, you might either consult Texans on wardrobe and how they act or just cast real Texans. It is interesting to note Dawn has absolutely no twang at all for a character thatâ€™s lived in Texas her entire life, while the male lead who only spent summers in Texas has some southern accent. The movie would probably be more enjoyable for people that arenâ€™t from Texas.
