Even with classic rivalries and storybook romance attempts, ‘The Wrong Paris’ just doesn’t scratch a genuine itch.
Rated: 1/4

Guardian
The Wrong Paris, written by Nicole Henrich and directed by Janeen Damian, somehow serves the synthetic sugar of both The Bachelor and the Hallmark movie without any sweetness. The formula is there, but not the flavor.
Rated: 2/5

New York Times
While the movie’s production design has considerable mojo, the anodyne writing reins in whatever satire one might have expected.

Frothy and easy on the eyes, this romcom is chock full of stereotypes, but it does exactly what it sets out to do.
Rated: 3/5

Yet, even with the chemistry of a couple, the twists and turns in a story, and a great happily ever after, the details can sometimes ruin the fantasy.

It’s cheeky and silly, but with strong bones, such as likeable characters, a strong narrative structure, and an original script.

Entertaining watch for the whole family, with an surprising twist at the end although being predictable.

So I started watching this solely because it is popular. I was about halfway through and was honestly enjoying it when I decided to wait for my fiancé to get home so we could watch it together because I thought she would enjoy it. Needless to say, we both had a lot of fun watching this cute romcom with a reality TV spoof spin to it. Worth a watch as a guilty pleasure, but not a flawless film.

I thought this was such a good romcom! A handful of actual laugh out loud moments. Cast was fantastic, Miranda Cosgrove is so good at playing normal, relatable characters! I thought it was really original while also obviously poking fun at the inspiration from reality dating shows. Which was in good timing given recent developments with those shows. Definitely would watch again.
