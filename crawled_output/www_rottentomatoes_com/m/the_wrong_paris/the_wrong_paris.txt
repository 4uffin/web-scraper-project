Even with classic rivalries and storybook romance attempts, ‘The Wrong Paris’ just doesn’t scratch a genuine itch.
Rated: 1/4

Guardian
The Wrong Paris, written by Nicole Henrich and directed by Janeen Damian, somehow serves the synthetic sugar of both The Bachelor and the Hallmark movie without any sweetness. The formula is there, but not the flavor.
Rated: 2/5

While the movie’s production design has considerable mojo, the anodyne writing reins in whatever satire one might have expected.

Frothy and easy on the eyes, this romcom is chock full of stereotypes, but it does exactly what it sets out to do.
Rated: 3/5

Yet, even with the chemistry of a couple, the twists and turns in a story, and a great happily ever after, the details can sometimes ruin the fantasy.

It’s cheeky and silly, but with strong bones, such as likeable characters, a strong narrative structure, and an original script.
Rated: 4/5

Feminists would definitely hate the idea of making fun of girls. Nonetheless, it has an interesting take about reality shows.

Entertaining watch for the whole family, with an surprising twist at the end although being predictable.
