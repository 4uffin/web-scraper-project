Even with classic rivalries and storybook romance attempts, â€˜The Wrong Parisâ€™ just doesnâ€™t scratch a genuine itch.
Rated: 1/4

Guardian
The Wrong Paris, written by Nicole Henrich and directed by Janeen Damian, somehow serves the synthetic sugar of both The Bachelor and the Hallmark movie without any sweetness. The formula is there, but not the flavor.
Rated: 2/5

New York Times
While the movieâ€™s production design has considerable mojo, the anodyne writing reins in whatever satire one might have expected.

Not everything in the script is linear, and the chemistry that's required between the protagonists...can be found in your living room. [Full review in Spanish]

Frothy and easy on the eyes, this romcom is chock full of stereotypes, but it does exactly what it sets out to do.

Yet, even with the chemistry of a couple, the twists and turns in a story, and a great happily ever after, the details can sometimes ruin the fantasy.

I really liked this movie. Kids were on a sleepover, hubby working overseas so I was scrolling through Netflix when I stumbled on this movie, gave it a shot and loved it. I think it was mostly the handsome cowboy that got me hooked but still ðŸ˜„

Feminists would definitely hate the idea of making fun of girls. Nonetheless, it has an interesting take about reality shows.
