What to Know
Critics Consensus
Tangerine shatters casting conventions and its filmmaking techniques are up-to-the-minute, but it's an old-fashioned comedy at heart -- and a pretty wonderful one at that.

Their bond is largely what transforms another depressing Christmas in LA into a riotous adventure, even as it includes brothels, infidelity, meth, and kidnapping.

I enjoyed it... But the way it's set up, how it's shot, the progression of the plot - it's clear that it is offering up the story to a mostly white, bougie audience. It was voyeuristic in the worst possible way.

Most of the movie's slow-burning heat comes from Mya Taylor's amazingly deep and deliberate - and often uproariously comedic - performance as Alexandra

Baker’s film is a heartfelt rush to the head that extends across racial, sexual, gender and social boundaries.

Tangerine unostentatiously celebrates fluidity, community, support and is generally quite hearteningly right-on...

From a technical standard point, Tangerine is a marvel. Baker’s filmmaking style pioneered modern indie film-making.

If your a former meth

Better than Anora imo. Gritty and honest yet never exploits its subjects. All the more incredible that Baker shot this completely on his phone.

Tangerine is a series of unpredictable events, each one even more unhinged and hilarious than the last, culminating in a surprisingly warm and humanistic portrait of friendship, survival, and dignity in the margins of society. The unexpected highlight from this, however, is the impressive and commendable indie filmmaking approach from one talented Sean Baker.

So funny and real. I just don’t understand the ‘white gangster’ trope, very unnecessary character to the plot.

Given that few movies touch on these types of characters, I thought it was interesting and well done.
It was not heavy handed or "in your face" with a political message.
It was just a story about people living their lives, which ended up being campy, funny, and quirky.
