For all of its bucolic pleasures, Evelyn is like looking through the eye of a merciless storm, with Orlando's focus pointed outwards toward the untold millions of people who are struggling to endure this same predicament.

Guardian
[A] raw, unfiltered view of the fragility of family dynamics is exposed movingly, and sometimes comically, throughout.
Rated: 4/5

I was deeply moved by the simplicity of this gentle film and the courage it took to make it. It drew out my compassion for those who consider suicide as their only option, as well as the loved ones left behind.

[Orlando von Einsiedel] has made a career out of exploring the raw, unfiltered brutality of war... But it is this new film, Evelyn, in which he finally addresses the most important, most difficult and definitive event in his life.
Rated: 8/10

A tough film to watch at times, but if it helps you think about someone in your life who either isn't here anymore because of suicide or might harm his or herself, it becomes a completely worthwhile watch.

Having experienced it myself, I was empathising the whole time while watching—completely in tears. Highly recommend.

I just stumbled upon this documentary; a brilliant, loving, and raw remembrance of a beloved son, brother, and friend lost far too soon. Thank you for sharing your story, I hope it has helped you move a little closer to the other side of your deep pain…love and joy.
