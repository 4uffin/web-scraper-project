A tuneful, heartwarming story, it is based on the real life story of the Von Trapp Family singers, one of the world's best-known concert groups in the era immediately preceding World War II. Julie Andrews plays the role of Maria, the tomboyish postulant at an Austrian abbey who becomes a governess in the home of a widowed naval captain with seven children, and brings a new love of life and music into the home.

What to Know
Critics Consensus
Unapologetically sweet and maybe even a little corny, The Sound of Music will win over all but the most cynical filmgoers with its classic songs and irresistible warmth.

Whether you enjoy it as a fun family singalong or a moving true story, this classic still bounces along in a tremendously likeable fashion.

It is not a bold, adventuresome motion picture, nor does it advance the art of the film even a trifle. What it is, and this is what the producers must have intended, is tuneful, uncomplicated entertainment, expensively set before the viewer.

The last of the Rodgers-Hammer-stein collaborations, The Sound of Music is the best screen version of their works.

The movie hurts. It stings. Too many simply remember it as some happy-go-lucky singalong, but absolutely not. The Sound of Music breaks your heart.

The Sound of Music may be schmaltz, but it’s irresistible schmaltz.

Of course, it's well done for what it is: that is to say, those who made it are experts at manipulating responses. They're the Pavlovs of moviemaking: they turn us into dogs that salivate on signal.

The Sound of Music is one of the greatest movies ever made! Emotionally compelling! Perfectly cast! The music underscoring throughout is incredibly well-crafted and stimulating. Removing all the songs which Max and the Baroness sing in the Broadway play was a stroke of genius! It lifted the story to a whole new level! The cinematography, especially for the evening scenes outdoors, are nothing less than beautiful and dreamlike! The director and choreographer knew exactly how to create a visual masterpiece! Of the younger six children, the director chose Angela Cartwright wisely for many of the most responsible parts and lines and she handled that role flawlessly! I am always brought to tears when I watch this movie and am tearful now as I write this review. I saw this movie in the theater when it was first released. I was only 10 years old. I left the theater delightfully singing so many of those perfectly written songs. It was one of the most indelible experiences of my life!!!
