A gallery of dynamic characters clash over the possession of a rare Native American artifact in this wildly entertaining modern-day western. After the artifact falls onto the black market, a shy waitress with big dreams (Sydney Sweeney) teams up with a lovelorn military veteran (Paul Walter Hauser) to gain possession of it, putting them in the crosshairs of a ruthless criminal (Eric Dane) working on behalf of a Western antiquities dealer (Simon Rex). Bloodshed ensues when others join the battle, including the leader of an indigenous group (Zahn McClarnon) and a desperate woman fleeing her mysterious past (Halsey).

Kyle Logan
Chicago Reader
Americana delivers as an enjoyable neo-western with some things to say and requisite genre thrills, but it’s unlikely to be remembered.

Brianna Zigler
AV Club
The clichéd, forgettable work neither succeeds as a spoof nor as an earnest genre exercise by a wannabe indie-phenom wannabe.

Though Hauser and Sweeney can’t exactly save the movie, they keep it from derailing.

Radio Times
And so a sprawling chase movie ensues, with its eclectic cast and their interconnected storylines balancing impeccably.

Casey's Movie Mania
Halsey steals the show in Tony Tost's decent Coen Brothers and Tarantino-style neo-western.
Rated: 3/5

That Shelf
There are glimpses of a stronger film within Americana, but its inability to commit to a specific story and or central character results in a muddled experience that struggles to resonate with audiences.

I really liked this movie. I was interested from start to finish and Sydney Sweeney was amazing. She really shined in this. Definitely worth a watch if you like dark comedy and movies that are off the wall.
