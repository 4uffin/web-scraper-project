The History of Sound
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Its drawn-out pacing and overly familiar trajectory undermine its potential to truly surprise, but The History of Sound nonetheless offers a visually stunning and well-acted journey through its melancholic exploration of human connection.

Adam Graham
Detroit News
Director Oliver Hermanus keeps everything on a very low heat — too low, in fact, to ever rise to a simmer.
Rated: C

Globe and Mail
The History of Sound might not set the internet on fire, but it will leave a few embers burning in the hearts of any audience who takes the time to listen to its particular song.

Carla Meyer
San Francisco Chronicle
In the film’s second half, as Lionel and David return to their regular lives, it becomes clear that O’Connor’s and Mescal’s acting had been doing too much, and the script too little, of the heavy lifting.
Rated: 2/4

Marlon Wallace
The M Report (WBOC.com)
...the film isn't necessarily concerned with the musicology. The folk songs and their presence here are instead just a crutch that the film barely utilizes. It's more concerned with Lionel's loneliness and his dissatisfaction with his life.

Jared Rasic
Metro Times (Detroit, MI)
Director Oliver Hermanus crafts the film with a gentle and unassuming eye. The film is handsome to look at, but it is still mostly understated in its framing and compositions.
Rated: A-

Brian Bromberger
Bay Area Reporter
Yet with all its weaknesses, that magic undeniable undefinable aura between Mescal and O’Connor makes the film almost irresistible. But the key word here is almost.
