The History of Sound
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Its drawn-out pacing and overly familiar trajectory undermine its potential to truly surprise, but The History of Sound nonetheless offers a visually stunning and well-acted journey through its melancholic exploration of human connection.

Randy Myers
San Jose Mercury News
Mescal and O’Connor each have a natural ease and awkwardness that fits with the plight of their characters... Sound reminds us of the toll that’s taken when you can’t fully embrace your desires and loves.
Rated: 3.5/4

Alison Willmore
New York Magazine/Vulture
Like Lionel, The History of Sound becomes stuck on its youthful interlude, a period that’s more alive than everything that comes next, and that’s also, less successfully, presented as a mystery to be solved.

Everything about ‘The History of Sound' is restrained to a fault.

What elevates it beyond that bittersweet validation of queer love, in all its devastating cultural inconvenience, is its profoundly felt embrace of music as an ongoing record of human existence.

A period romance starring two of today’s the most intriguing actors, Paul Mescal and Josh O’Connor, A History of Sound is a kind of stealth musical, in which a pair of young musicologists use traditional ballads and music to express beauty and pain.

It’s a quiet movie.
The film is beautifully shot and gives you insight into a time which is slower and serene. Well acted and moving performance by the two main leads.

Engaging in its simplicity. Gorgeous cinematography without overstatement or reliance on gimmicks. Beautiful lighting, incredibly subdued and human story.
