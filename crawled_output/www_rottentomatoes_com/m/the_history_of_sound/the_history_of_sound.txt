The History of Sound
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Its drawn-out pacing and overly familiar trajectory undermine its potential to truly surprise, but The History of Sound nonetheless offers a visually stunning and well-acted journey through its melancholic exploration of human connection.

The History of Sound might not set the internet on fire, but it will leave a few embers burning in the hearts of any audience who takes the time to listen to its particular song.

Carla Meyer
San Francisco Chronicle
In the film’s second half, as Lionel and David return to their regular lives, it becomes clear that O’Connor’s and Mescal’s acting had been doing too much, and the script too little, of the heavy lifting.
Rated: 2/4

Randy Myers
San Jose Mercury News
Mescal and O’Connor each have a natural ease and awkwardness that fits with the plight of their characters... Sound reminds us of the toll that’s taken when you can’t fully embrace your desires and loves.
Rated: 3.5/4

The History of Sound is very much a story about the ephemeral, allowing two doomed lovers to live in a moment for eternity.
Rated: 7/10

In its most moving moments, The History of Sound proves that love, like a song, can echo across decades, even after its final note has faded. It’s a film that explores the song of one individual's life and the impact of who he decided to compose it with.

Unfortunately, this is a terrific cast making the best of a bad script creeping through the scenes at a horribly slow pace.
I had such hopes going in, but the teaser storyline is misleading, and a few scenes were reminiscent of Brokeback Mountain.
The goal is unclear, character development is stunted, characters and situations appear out of nowhere, and ultimately, you just don’t care about the characters you just want it to end.
Save your money and wait for streaming/VOD.
Don’t judge the lead actors harshly, they made the most of what was handed to them.
