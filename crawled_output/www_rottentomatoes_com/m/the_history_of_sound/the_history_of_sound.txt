The History of Sound
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Its drawn-out pacing and overly familiar trajectory undermine its potential to truly surprise, but The History of Sound nonetheless offers a visually stunning and well-acted journey through its melancholic exploration of human connection.

The History of Sound might not set the internet on fire, but it will leave a few embers burning in the hearts of any audience who takes the time to listen to its particular song.

Carla Meyer
San Francisco Chronicle
In the film’s second half, as Lionel and David return to their regular lives, it becomes clear that O’Connor’s and Mescal’s acting had been doing too much, and the script too little, of the heavy lifting.
Rated: 2/4

Randy Myers
San Jose Mercury News
Mescal and O’Connor each have a natural ease and awkwardness that fits with the plight of their characters... Sound reminds us of the toll that’s taken when you can’t fully embrace your desires and loves.
Rated: 3.5/4

Third Coast Review
The History of Sound is a beautiful, quiet, intimate and impactful film that leans into its story of love in the time of soulful songs...
Rated: 3.5/4

Fort Worth Report
Josh O’Connor does a terrific job of exposing his character’s vulnerabilities, which are often shielded by a calm exterior & self-assurance. Paul Mescal delivers one of his strongest performances yet—emotionally complex, understated, & deeply moving.
Rated: 3.5/4

The History of Sound is very much a story about the ephemeral, allowing two doomed lovers to live in a moment for eternity.
Rated: 7/10
