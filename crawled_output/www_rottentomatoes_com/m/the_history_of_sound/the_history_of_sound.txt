The History of Sound
What to Know
Critics Consensus
Its drawn-out pacing and overly familiar trajectory undermine its potential to truly surprise, but The History of Sound nonetheless offers a visually stunning and well-acted journey through its melancholic exploration of human connection.

The History of Sound might not set the internet on fire, but it will leave a few embers burning in the hearts of any audience who takes the time to listen to its particular song.

Carla Meyer
San Francisco Chronicle
In the film’s second half, as Lionel and David return to their regular lives, it becomes clear that O’Connor’s and Mescal’s acting had been doing too much, and the script too little, of the heavy lifting.
Rated: 2/4

Randy Myers
San Jose Mercury News
Mescal and O’Connor each have a natural ease and awkwardness that fits with the plight of their characters... Sound reminds us of the toll that’s taken when you can’t fully embrace your desires and loves.
Rated: 3.5/4

André Hereford
Metro Weekly (Washington, DC)
'The History of Sound' casts an enchanting spell in its languid story of a love that dare not speak its name between Lionel and David, two scholars who meet at the New England Conservatory of Music in 1917.
Rated: 4/5

Thoughtful and ambitious, but awkwardly structured.

Film Speak
[Paul] Mescal is terribly miscast as the younger version of Lionel. It’s only when Chris Cooper appears in the movie’s coda that the character becomes someone whom we can latch onto.
Rated: D+

It was a beautiful cross between Brokeback Mountain and A River Runs Through It. Loved it. Left with the type of tears you get from a great love story.

Heartbreaking and beautiful. Spare and deliberate. It’s a minimalist masterpiece. Great performances by Paul Mescal and Josh O’Connor. This stuck in my mind for days.
