At his mother's New Year’s Eve party Lucas, a young police officer, loses a letter no one was ever meant to read. Amid the backdrop of the suffocating family party, the search for the letter unlocks memories of a past he's tried to forget: months earlier, while working undercover in a mall bathroom, Lucas arrested men by seducing them. But when he encounters Andrew, everything changes. What begins as another setup becomes something far more electric and intimate. As their secret connection deepens and police pressure to deliver arrests intensifies, Lucas finds himself torn between duty and desire. With time running out and his past closing in, PLAINCLOTHES builds toward a New Year's Eve reckoning where everything he's buried threatens to erupt.

This tension-filled coming out story marks a welcome debut for director Carmen Emmi, whose Plainclothes showcases the perils of love and the effects of isolation.

Chris Azzopardi
New York Times
Writer-director Carmen Emmi’s evocative debut relies on a nostalgically textured aesthetic that sometimes seems to mask its thin narrative, the heat builds in unexpected ways, ultimately igniting through the quiet agony of living as someone you’re not.

‘Plainclothes’ feels seductively alive when Lucas and Andrew are alone together—either under the warm lights of the movie theater, where their shadows betray them, or as their hands touch the other’s body inside a lonely greenhouse. I

Blythe’s performance is an interior one, where what Lucas does is not as important as how he feels inside. Capturing that is a special gift and Blyth delivers.

Assignment X
Not a definitive look at a young man at a work/life crossroads. However, as a study of the nature of romance and attraction, it is highly impactful.
Rated: B

Spectrum Culture
By the end, the outcomes of both halves of the story make a sort of emotional and logical sense, but Plainclothes is more about the crushing weight of inevitability than about trying to surprise us with empty twists and turns.

Cinemalogue
Powerfully understated performances elevate this impactful drama about sexual repression, which works better as an intimate character study than a broader tale of morality.
