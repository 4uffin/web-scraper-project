At his mother's New Year’s Eve party Lucas, a young police officer, loses a letter no one was ever meant to read. Amid the backdrop of the suffocating family party, the search for the letter unlocks memories of a past he's tried to forget: months earlier, while working undercover in a mall bathroom, Lucas arrested men by seducing them. But when he encounters Andrew, everything changes. What begins as another setup becomes something far more electric and intimate. As their secret connection deepens and police pressure to deliver arrests intensifies, Lucas finds himself torn between duty and desire. With time running out and his past closing in, PLAINCLOTHES builds toward a New Year's Eve reckoning where everything he's buried threatens to erupt.

Bob Mondello

Lucas' self-loathing and panic are persuasively of their time, and the story, which could as easily have been set in the 1950s, can't help but seem a cautionary tale for the world we find ourselves in today.

Chris Azzopardi
New York Times
Writer-director Carmen Emmi’s evocative debut relies on a nostalgically textured aesthetic that sometimes seems to mask its thin narrative, the heat builds in unexpected ways, ultimately igniting through the quiet agony of living as someone you’re not.

‘Plainclothes’ feels seductively alive when Lucas and Andrew are alone together—either under the warm lights of the movie theater, where their shadows betray them, or as their hands touch the other’s body inside a lonely greenhouse. I

Washington Blade
It’s a small film, and one that feels even more intimate than its smallness might suggest, but that’s part of its winning strength.

Andrew Parker
The Gate
Emmi gets under the viewer’s skin, burrows straight through the body, and leaves a mark with his exceptional examination of a closeted man coming apart at the seams.
Rated: 7/10

Assignment X
Not a definitive look at a young man at a work/life crossroads. However, as a study of the nature of romance and attraction, it is highly impactful.
Rated: B
