Life seems easy for picture-perfect couple Ivy (Olivia Colman) and Theo (Benedict Cumberbatch): successful careers, a loving marriage, great kids. But beneath the façade of their supposed ideal life, a storm is brewing -- as Theo's career nosedives while Ivy's own ambitions take off, a tinderbox of fierce competition and hidden resentment ignites. The Roses is a reimagining of the 1989 classic film The War of the Roses, based on the novel by Warren Adler.

The Roses
What to Know
Critics Consensus
The Roses' blend of broad comedy and dark satire makes for an uneasy marriage, although watching Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch trade barbs is a treat onto itself.

Stephen Romei
The Australian
The dazzling script is thespian heaven for the stars, Olivia Colman and Benedict Cumberbatch, who put a wicked British spin on this remake of Danny DeVito’s 1989 movie The War of the Roses...
Rated: 3.5/5

Chicago Reader
The pacing switches too suddenly between vigor and slackness, leaving the film without the propulsion its absurd premise demands, causing the conflict to drag on.

Glen Weldon
NPR
It's a throwback film, the kind they don't make anymore -- and given the sheer amount of Screenwriting 101 cliches that pile up -- you can't help thinking that might be a good thing.

Sarah Cartland
Caution Spoilers
Colman and Cumberbatch look to be having a ball though they don't convince as a married couple. Still because of the subject matter we'll never know if they lack chemistry or they’re simply really good at pretending to have been married for 15 years.
Rated: 3/5

Terry Staunton
Radio Times
This is not a bad film, by any means, it’s just frustratingly toothless when it should be leaving visible bite marks; a black comedy that’s nowhere near black enough.
Rated: 3/5

The movie was terrible, we left after thirty minutes.
The pre-movie entertainment was even worse, running the same awful commercials over and over, again.
