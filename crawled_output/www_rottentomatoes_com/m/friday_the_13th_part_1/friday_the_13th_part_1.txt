Crystal Lake's history of murder doesn't deter counselors from setting up a summer camp in the woodsy area. Superstitious locals warn against it, but the fresh-faced young people -- Jack (Kevin Bacon), Alice (Adrienne King), Bill (Harry Crosby), Marcie (Jeannine Taylor) and Ned (Mark Nelson) -- pay little heed to the old-timers. Then they find themselves stalked by a brutal killer. As they're slashed, shot and stabbed, the counselors struggle to stay alive against a merciless opponent.

What to Know
Critics Consensus
Rather quaint by today's standards, Friday the 13th still has its share of bloody surprises and a '70s-holdover aesthetic to slightly compel.

Kevin Maher
The Times (UK)
The best bits of Halloween, Carrie, and Hitchcock’s Psycho were cheekily repurposed here by the director Sean S Cunningham for a slasher movie — the first of a whopping 12 installments — that remains the genre standard-bearer.
Rated: 4/5

Peter Bradshaw
Guardian
There’s some bizarre fun in this (almost innocent) film, but maybe the fanbase are the ones to get most out of a revisit.
Rated: 4/5

The Hollywood Reporter
It's blatant exploitation of the lowest order.

David Day
Horror Movie Talk
While it’s no crowning achievement in filmmaking, Friday the 13th does set the stage for 80’s horror very nicely with a parade of sexy but disposable characters, great practical effects by Tom Savini, and tense music by Harry Manfredini.
Rated: 7/10

Patrick Cavanaugh
The Wolfman Cometh
The young cast, simple premise, and unexpected ending more than solidify the film's status as an iconic slasher.
Rated: 4/5

Alan French
Sunshine State Cineplex
Cunningham frames some wide-angled shots perfectly and builds tension through his silence. It’s an unnerving experience and further accentuates Harry Manfredi’s brilliant score.
Rated: 7/10

I never got to see this in the theatres back in the day. I was too young. So it was a trip of nostalgia for sure. So it hit all of the marks for me.
