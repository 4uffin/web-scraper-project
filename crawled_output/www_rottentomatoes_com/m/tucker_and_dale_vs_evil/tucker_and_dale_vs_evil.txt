Critics Consensus
Like the best horror/comedies, Tucker & Dale vs. Evil mines its central crazy joke for some incredible scares, laughs, and -- believe it or not -- heart.

This movie is certifiably insane, that's a given, but it's also extremely witty, has far more intelligence than you might originally expect and has a grand time exploding clichés and playing with an audience's expectations.
Rated: 3.5/4

Here's something you don't see every day: a genial, politically correct splatter comedy.

Clever horror/comedy hybrid of the kind that Sam Raimi used to make and that so many have tried to produce in recent years but have fallen remarkably flat. There's nothing flat about this clever genre flick. For the right audience, it's pretty great.
Rated: 4.0/5.0

Patrick Cavanaugh
The Wolfman Cometh
A simple, clever premise that fully pays off exactly how you'd hope it could, thanks to the charm and chemistry between the two leads.
Rated: 5/5

Deep Focus Review
What lasts throughout is the comic chemistry between Labine and Tudyk, who make these not-so-stupid characters into a lovable duo that should have their own series of films.
Rated: 3.5/4

Film Frenzy
Even folks who generally shy away from gorefests should appreciate the dark humor, surprising plot pirouettes, and, most shockingly, developed characterizations in Tucker & Dale vs. Evil.
Rated: 3/4

Definitely rewatch worthy horror/comedy that brings both the laughs and lots of heart for something completely different. Another classic in my book.

Very much a hidden gem of a movie, it's not amount the greatest of all time but for such an unknown movie it's a lot of fun with an entertaining premise, showed it to my gf and she loved it too.

Tucker & Dale vs Evil is, and will always be, a good watch. Clever, comedic violence is where this movie clearly thrives. Led by two strong comedic actors bumbling their way through an onslaught of college kids, blood, and guts, this movie never fails to bring a smile to my face.
