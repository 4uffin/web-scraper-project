In this Shakespearean farce, Hero (Kate Beckinsale) and her groom-to-be, Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard), team up with Claudio's commanding officer, Don Pedro (Denzel Washington), the week before their wedding to hatch a matchmaking scheme. Their targets are sharp-witted duo Benedick (Kenneth Branagh) and Beatrice (Emma Thompson) -- a tough task indeed, considering their corresponding distaste for love and each other. Meanwhile, meddling Don John (Keanu Reeves) plots to ruin the wedding.

Much Ado About Nothing is one of the few movies of recent years that could leave its audiences weeping with joy.

The New Republic
Doyle's enrapturing music and Branagh's cinematic grip of the play--inventive, lithe, somehow Shakespearean--are splendid. This Much Ado is a flawed gem. Certainly, regrettably, flawed; still, a gem.

Emma Thompson is normally a very reliable performer on screen, but Beatrice is not one of her successes.

A Good Movie To Watch
It might not be set to the music of ABBA, but with Patrick Doyle’s radiant score, an intoxicatingly beautiful Tuscan setting, and an infectious, non-stop party vibe, the joyous Much Ado About Nothing feels [...] akin to Mamma Mia
Rated: 75/100

Just joyful. As Branaugh has a massive ego and almost always deserved, it is some like the movie.
Villains underdeveloped and we must trust that common humanity gets us through weak plot places.
Joyful, humorous and uplifting, and location so perfect the actual space in Tuscany.

I really wanted to love this but I didn’t. I like the enemies to lovers and playful vibe, but overall there’s too much silliness and crazy frolicking that it’s over the top and Kenneth Branagh is toooo much. There were some great convincing performances (Emma Thompson and Denzel Washington): Emma Thompson being witty while eating grapes in a tree is iconic, and I need to see more Denzel x Shakespeare or period pieces.

This version of my favorite comedy by The Bard is a dull and bland as its monochrome costumes. Although, Michael Keaton is a delight the rest feel uninspired
