"This Is Spinal Tap" shines a light on the self-contained universe of a metal band struggling to get back on the charts, including everything from its complicated history of ups and downs, gold albums, name changes and undersold concert dates, along with the full host of requisite groupies, promoters, hangers-on and historians, sessions, release events and those special behind-the-scenes moments that keep it all real.

Jake Cole
Slant Magazine
An instant cult classic, Rob Reiner’s 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap laid the groundwork for the modern improv comedy with its laser-precise skewering of the heyday of ’80s heavy metal and the vagaries of making it as a touring act.

Sydney Morning Herald
The funniest film about rock ever made.

Joe Williams
St. Louis Post-Dispatch
Reiner's directorial debut remains his best and most inventive film, a note-perfect parody of show-biz self-importance and pre-MTV production values.

Ottawa Citizen
In their shag haircuts and tight spandex pants, the actors are sublimely funny. The details are exactly right.
Rated: 4/5

From the cameos to Spinal Tap itself, the casting is brilliant.

What we have here is that rarest of birds, the sustained and nearly pitch-perfect parody.

Sporadically hilarious but not as funny as reputably preceded due to the targeted audience who immerse themselves with edgy music in volumed resonance. The non-converts of the very genre nonetheless checks this out per its cult status as an all-time classic, and recognize the influential creativity in the original, convincing craft that’s skillfully directed with layered approach attempting to dissect, or comprehend, a musician’s connective ambitions which were just as performatively devoted.

"This is Spinal Tap" is an enjoyable mockumentary comedy classic from the 80s. The film's style really makes it feel like a documentary about a real band, and the songs are genuinely catchy to listen to. The comedy is pretty good and there were a few laughs, but I wouldn't say it is one of my all-time favorites in the genre. I think it is light, short, and entertaining, and I can see why it has such a following because it does feel so unique. Overall, it is an enjoyable comedy that really feels immersive and wacky in equal measure, and is a one-of-a-kind experience.

I used to be in a touring band, and this is a film my entire band loved. The hair metal band spoof of Spinal Tap is so legendary that there were and are many people who believe them to be a real band, and one of the dumbest bands of all time. There are so many quotable moments in the film and ton of laughs to be had. I am so excited they are coming out with a sequel this month and I can't wait to go see it!

I've loved this movie since I was a tween and Mom rented the VHS for us.
Just recently learned that the guys spent time learning to play their instruments.
Well done, gents!

A modest grin but more cringe throughout. I’m afraid it doesn’t hold up very well so I can’t imagine #2 would be worth it. The references and music recalling Rock icons is kind of clever.
