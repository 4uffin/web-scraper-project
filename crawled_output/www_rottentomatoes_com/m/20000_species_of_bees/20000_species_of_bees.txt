In a small, sleepy village in the Basque Country, a sculptor named Ane and her three children arrive at her mother Lita's home for summer vacation where they are surrounded by extended family and nosy neighbors. Ane and her mother's relationship is strained -- Lita disapproves of her daughter's frayed marriage, career as an artist, and the way she parents her obstinate and mischievous children. Chief among them is eight-year-old Aitor, nicknamed Coco after it becomes clear that being referred to by the Aitor elicits feelings of distress in the child. Born biologically male, neither birth name nor the genderless nickname feel quite right, and Ane's concern for her child grows as Coco becomes more withdrawn. The child's only respite lies in the Basque hills, where Ane's aunt Lourdes tends to the family's beekeeping farm. Among the peaceful humming of bees and Lourdes' open-minded guardianship, Coco slowly begins to confide in family and friends her discomfort in her body, eventually voicing a desire to be treated as a girl. As Coco explores her own developing identity over the summer, Ane and the rest of her family in turn must learn to accept the child as she is.

Warmly humanist and deeply empathetic first feature… announcing the arrival of a bold new filmmaking voice.

Slant Magazine
The film blooms in moments where, instead of literally addressing Coco's gender trouble, we’re simply allowed to inhabit it.
Rated: 2.5/4

AV Club
Despite its limitations, 20,000 Species of Bees is crafted from a place of empathy so often lacking in conversations about trans childhood.
Rated: B

Video Librarian Magazine
All told, 20,000 Species of Bees has been the recipient of over three dozen awards, including three Goyas, the Spanish equivalent of the Oscars, a testament to the sensitivity and skill Estibaliz Urresola Solaguren brought to this touching narrative.
Rated: 4/5

20000 Species of Bees [...] was a delicate reminder of those who do accept us and open the door. Even if just a crack. Those people are there and they change lives.

[A] willingness to look at delicate matters in totality, combined with a spectacular cast of performers all given highly detailed characters to work with, makes 20,000 Species of Bees an exceptional family drama.
Rated: 8/10

Una película hecha para un evento como son los Goya, una película muy bonita y con temática muy bien llevada, pero excesivamente larga, además no se soluciona nada de las tramas secundarias. Personalmente no me llega a transmitir lo suficiente.

What kinds of humans are there? Who is my beekeeper? There are movies which yell out the questions. 20,000 Species of Bees does it with beauty, gentleness additionally making you cry.
