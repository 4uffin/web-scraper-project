Tomatometer® Criteria
Thank you for your interest in applying for Tomatometer® approval. Applications will reopen March 1, 2026.
Who are the Tomatometer-approved critics?
The Tomatometer® includes reviews from two different groups:
Individual professional film and TV critics who are Tomatometer-approved
and whose reviews are included on Rotten Tomatoes, whether or not the outlet is Tomatometer-approved.
Tomatometer-approved publications, such as websites, online video outlets, newspapers,
consumer and trade magazines, alt-weeklies, podcasts, radio programs, and TV shows.
If a publication is approved, its review of a movie or show is included on the Tomatometer®
regardless of which individual critic produced it.
How do I become Tomatometer-approved?
Critics who wish to apply should first review our guidelines below. All candidates will go through a vetting process and be evaluated against our criteria. Applications are accepted yearly during the month of March.
Key Values
Insight: Criticism can be many things: a deep dive into the filmmaking craft, an analysis of subtext, a discussion on social commentary, an enthusiastic argument. We look for engaging content that has a distinct voice and offers perspective on a film or TV series, not just a plot summary.
Audience: Our intention is to reflect and represent the moviegoing and TV viewing audience with our Tomatometer-approved critics community. To cultivate a rich, varied, and inclusive space for engaging perspectives and debate, we seek critics who reach both niche interests in cinema and the entertainment viewing audience at-large.
Quality: Reviews should observe grammatical rules and demonstrate clarity and structure, whether approved by an editorial staff or self-published. In the same vein, video and podcast reviews should be well structured and have clear resolution and sound.
Dedication: Whether you’re a podcaster producing multiple shows per month or an alt-weekly contributor, we recognize that there are varying degrees of output among critics. Contribution minimums are outlined in the eligibility guidelines, but we also look for overall consistency and demonstrated commitment to the field. Additionally, memberships in critics organizations are recognized as a sign of merit, but are not essential for – nor do they guarantee – inclusion.
We expect both applicants and approved critics to honor journalistic integrity, demonstrate ethical behavior, and observe our
Critics Code of Conduct.
We do not tolerate plagiarism, trolling, discrimination, conflicts of interest, or other breaches of conduct across all platforms,
nor do we tolerate the submission of a review whose outcome has been influenced by a financial or other incentive.
All Tomatometer-approved critics and publications are subject to an ongoing re-evaluation process to ensure they continue to meet the current criteria.
Eligibility Guidelines
Individual Critics
Written
Consistent review output for a minimum of two years.
Demonstrated film/TV review coverage at a publication outside of a self-published website. However, we will consider critics who solely self-publish if their site and work reflect our key values.
Broadcast
A regular appearance providing reviews on a major and/or well-regarded local/national/international TV or radio outlet.
Video
Consistent review output for a minimum of two years.
A minimum of 200K subscribers on a video publishing platform qualifies for wide audience reach. We also look to include critics who broaden the discourse around film/TV, even if they may not meet this metric, and will consider these applicants on a case-by-case basis.
Publications
Written
Consistent review output for a minimum of two years.
A minimum of 2 million visits over 6 months as reported by SimilarWeb qualifies for wide audience reach. We also look to include critics who broaden the discourse around film/TV, even if they may not meet this metric, and will consider these applicants on a case-by-case basis.
At least three individually approved critics contributing to the publication on a regular basis.
Demonstrated consistent social media presence and engagement.
Broadcast
Eligible TV and radio outlets and programs should be broadcasting reviews on a major and/or well-regarded local/national/international network or station.
Demonstrated consistent social media presence and engagement.
Video
Consistent review output for a minimum of two years.
A minimum of 200K subscribers on a video publishing platform qualifies for wide audience reach. We also look to include critics who broaden the discourse around film/TV, even if they may not meet this metric, and will consider these applicants on a case-by-case basis.
The show should feature multiple critics.
Demonstrated consistent social media presence and engagement.
Podcasts
Consistent review output for a minimum of two years.
Publish at least four episodes per month.
A minimum of 200 ratings on Apple Podcasts with a minimum score of 4 stars qualifies for wide audience reach. We also look to include critics who broaden the discourse around film/TV, even if they may not meet this metric, and will consider these applicants on a case-by-case basis.
Demonstrated consistent social media presence and engagement with audience.
Critics exclusively reviewing at a podcast should apply on behalf of the entire podcast as a publication, not individually.
We take the integrity of our scores very seriously, and in an effort to continue delivering quality and authentic reviews, all Tomatometer-approved critics and outlets are subject to re-evaluation.
Approval status can be removed or suspended, including, but not limited to, when a critic or outlet no longer meets our criteria, or engages in activity that breaches our code of conduct and affects the integrity of the Tomatometer.
From time to time we change our guidelines, and there may be critics or publications who are still included in the Tomatometer® that may not meet the current set of guidelines.
Outlets that are self-published by Tomatometer-approved critics are subject to the guidelines above and will be added to Rotten Tomatoes on a case-by-case basis.
In all cases, Rotten Tomatoes maintains the right to approve, reject, include, exclude and remove critics, reviews and publications on a case-by-case basis at any time.
We cannot guarantee a response time on applications. If your application is declined, you may reapply after one year.
