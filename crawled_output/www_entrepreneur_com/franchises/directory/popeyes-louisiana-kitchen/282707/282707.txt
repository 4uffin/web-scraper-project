Start a Popeyes Franchise | Costs and Requirements
If you have dreams of owning your own business and “love that chicken” from Popeyes, opening your own Popeyes franchise could be the perfect combination. Here’s what you need to know about becoming a Popeyes franchise owner.
About Popeyes
Popeyes specializes in delicious and unforgettable fried chicken. They are committed to tasty, affordable, and fast meals. Known for its New Orleans-style fried chicken, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen delivers excellent flavors at an appealing price.
As one of the top fast-food franchises in the U.S., Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen makes it a point to offer delicious fast food to keep people coming back for more.
Popeyes History
Originally named Chicken on the Run, Al Copeland founded the establishment in 1972. When it first opened, Chicken on the Run served traditional Southern fried chicken.
However, after a lack of popularity and success, Copeland decided to rebrand the concept. When he reopened the restaurant, he changed the name to Popeyes and started selling spicy, New Orleans-style fried chicken.
The first Popeyes franchise location opened four years later, and the company never looked back. Popeyes has grown its brand, menu, and reach to international locations through the decades.
In 2008, Popeyes underwent another rebrand to change its name to Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen as a nod back to its southern roots. As Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, it remains one of the leading fried chicken and fast-food restaurant chains in the United States.
Today, Popeyes has over 3,000 restaurant franchises across the U.S. and 30 countries worldwide.

In fact, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen is one of the U.S.’s most popular fast-food chains from New York to Texas to Florida. It is also popular outside of the United States, with over 600 franchises internationally and more than 200 in Canada alone.
