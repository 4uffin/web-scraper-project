Start a Jersey Mike's Franchise | Costs and Requirements
Opening a franchise can be an excellent option for owning your own business and the franchise industry is booming, with production output in 2022 totaling $826.6 billion, according to the International Franchise Association.
If you’re ready to start your own franchise, keep reading to see if Jersey Mike’s Subs is the right place for you.
How Jersey Mike’s Got Its Start
Originally called Mike’s Subs, the submarine sandwich shop started in 1956 in Point Pleasant, New Jersey.
Sub sandwiches were a rising trend in the 1950s. Mike's Subs seized the opportunity, becoming a successful business by capitalizing on its Jersey Shore location and summer popularity. The mom-and-pop shop grew its clientele by treating its customers with care and cultivating a local feel.
In 1971, 17-year-old employee Pete Cancro heard talks of the owners selling Mike’s Subs and decided to obtain a loan and purchase it himself. Pancro took Mike’s Subs to the next level by opening more stores and training new employees to treat customers just like the original mom-and-pop shop always had.
In 1987, Cancro took the business to the next level and started franchising. To keep the authenticity of the shop’s birthplace, he changed the name to Jersey Mike’s Subs. Peter Cancro remains the corporation's CEO and oversees about 2,000 franchise locations.
