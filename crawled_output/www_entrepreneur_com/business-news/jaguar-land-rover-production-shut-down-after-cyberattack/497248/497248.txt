Key Takeaways
Jaguar Land Rover was hit with a massive cyberattack earlier this month and had to pause all production.
The hack has reportedly cost the automaker more than $1.36 billion in revenue.
According to a new statement, production will be shut down until at least October 1.
In January, the U.S. replaced China as the largest single market for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), which makes the popular Range Rover and Defender models. In fact, the company's North American sales were up 23% last year. (Range Rovers start around $42,000 and go up to about $180,000.)But it might be more difficult to buy a JLR vehicle soon.According to a statement on JLR's website, a cyberattack has forced the company to shut down production, and the stoppage will continue until at least October 1. The company originally said things would be up and running on September 24.

"We have made this decision to give clarity for the coming week as we build the timeline for the phased restart of our operations and continue our investigation."
So far, the breach has cost the automaker well over $1.36 billion in revenue, per Auto News.A Land Rover - Range Rover LWB Autobiography is displayed during the Salon PrivÃ© Concours at Blenheim Palace on August 27, 2025, in Woodstock, England. John Keeble/Getty ImagesJLR first announced the attack on September 2, posting on its website that it had been "impacted by a cyber incident" and was "proactively shutting down" its systems. The company had initially suggested that data was not stolen, but later issued an update to add that "some data may have been affected."Reuters reports that JLR has closed three plants in the U.K. that would normally be producing around 1,000 vehicles per day. Manufacturing magazine reports that factories have also closed in China, Slovakia and India. JLR's retail locations remain open.
It's unclear how the breach will affect car shipments to the U.S., but reports note that disruptions will likely last through the fall.A new Land Rover Defender is displayed during the Salon PrivÃ© Concours at Blenheim Palace on August 27, 2025, in Woodstock, England. John Keeble/Getty Images
