The company was founded in October 1997 in Saint Louis, Missouri, and the experience in stores has remained consistent since its founding.
The company's CEO, Sharon Price John, who took over in 2013, told CNBC that the process of making a bear is "a really emotional, memorable experience that creates a tremendous amount of equity." The store's in-person experience contributes to its resilience, even as other mall stores like Claire's close hundreds of locations.Build-A-Bear Workshop in Denver, Colorado.

Build-A-Bear creates a deeper connection with its customers, building a sense of loyalty, Reed explained.

Two-fifths (40%) of Build-A-Bear's customers are adults, not kids, according to The Washington Post.

The company told The Washington Post that it plans to open 60 more locations this year, and that almost all of its stores in North America were profitable.Related: This Mom's Side Hustle Selling a $600 Children's Toy Became a Business Making Over $1 Million a Year: 'There Is a Lot to Love'
