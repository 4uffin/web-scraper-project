A bloody revenge epic and breathtaking visual marvel, The Northman finds filmmaker Robert Eggers expanding his scope without sacrificing any of his signature style.

Not since Christopher Nolan’s Inception has a studio executive shown such balls of steel, or perhaps I should say boller av stal.

Film of the Week
Blood runs, mud flies and bones crack — in crisp, percussive ways you’ve hopefully never heard in real life — throughout The Northman, a grand, gut-spilling Norse epic that feels at once earthily ancient and thrillingly modern.

Nick Schager
The Daily Beast
A death-metal ode to honor, retribution and sacrifice that casts payback in a surprisingly, and thrillingly, positive light.

Exhaustion will also set in, relentlessly. But not before its hallucinogenic images leave a breathtaking sense of primal awe.
Rated: 4/5

Rough Draft Atlanta
Eggers’ third film is characterized by a systematic style of filmmaking, almost rigid in its execution, that creates a distance between the story and the audience that allows them to see Amleth’s quest for what it is.

Julian Singleton
Cinapse
A globe-trotting epic rich with the exacting period authenticity his films are known for, the scale of Eggers’s film also extends to the inner depths of his characters.

Liked this much more the second time around, when you first watch it and expect a Viking bloodbath like the TV show you will be let down, when you know the main point of the film is revenge and watch it without the expectation of a ton of bloody battles you see it for what it is. Wonderfully shot Viking Epic. Loved it, it felt realistic and primal.

One of the better movies of the year that most people didn't see. It's dark, gritty, and visually beautiful! The Lead was well cast and is a great actor in his own right.
