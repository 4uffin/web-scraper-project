While Golden Dawn officially denied being a neo-Nazi movement, it adopted Nazi-influenced iconography.He and its former MPs were found guilty of running or belonging to the criminal group.Greece's New Left party said in a statement to state media that Michaloliakos's release was "a serious blow to the collective memory and the struggle for democracy and justice", adding that the justice system "cannot send a message of impunity to those who embodied hatred and fascism".The nation's communist party KKE said the decision should be overturned, adding Golden Dawn's "crimes are not time-limited in the consciousness of the people and the youth".Neo-Nazi politicians guilty of running crime gangGreek neo-Nazi goes on the run as jail terms startGreeceNeo-NazismGolden Dawn (political party)RelatedOne of the world's most sacred places is being turned into a luxury mega-resortFamily of dead PC 'deeply distressed' two years onSpain and Portugal fires kill two more as Spanish troops battle blazesMore from the BBC8 Apr 2025Firearms manuals on terror suspect's phone - courtOndrej Sidelka, 21, "created an online library" of far-right material in a Dropbox folder, a jury hears.8 Apr 202530 Jan 2025'I'm flabbergasted my stalker got a new identity'Callum Parslow, who was already convicted for stalking, has now been jailed for attempted murder.30 Jan 202530 Jan 2025Red flags missed in neo-Nazi stalker, say victimsStalking victims were told a far-right attacker "wasn't physical threat" when they contacted police.30 Jan 20252 Oct 2024Dozens charged in case against California neo-Nazi gangProsecutors say the Peckerwoods gang works with the Aryan Brotherhood and the Mexican Mafia.2 Oct 20242 Oct 2024BBC confronts neo-Nazi who gave UK rioters arson tips"Mr AG" shared an arson guide in a Telegram group chat used by UK rioters after the Southport attacks.2 Oct 2024British Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
