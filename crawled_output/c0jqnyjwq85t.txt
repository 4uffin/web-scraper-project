Some sound general advice there to round off from Holly. Well, so there you have it. Ready to make those all-important decisions?Here's the injuries and fixtures while you ponder.

Peter: My team is in an awful state. And I've used my Wildcard already! Do you have any advice?Itâs time to be patient now. Fix the biggest issues first, in the players who are going to be out the longest, and utilise your bench. Transfer in consistent players who have good form and fixtures. If itâs a short-term disaster and you need to Free Hit your way out of trouble for Gameweek 4 then that could work too, but remember you may be facing the same problems again come Gameweek 5.

Frankie: Is it worth making Viktor Gyokeres captain instead of Haaland or Joao Pedro this week? Forest are going to be all over the place with the change of manager and his style of play. But then again, Arsenal have so many different goal scorers and Gyokeres hasn't had much impact yet.I think thereâs enough going in Gyokeresâ favour to back him with the armband if your gut instinct is there. We think he will be on penalties and Nottingham Forestâs defence has looked frail and I donât expect that to improve under Ange Postecoglou. Haaland is the safer pick though!

Ian: Bruno Fernandes has a few tough fixtures in the next six to seven games. But with Matheus Cunha currently injured, is Bruno one to keep? He may play a more advanced role?Thereâs definitely an opportunity for Bruno Fernandes to play more advanced in the coming gameweeks, although he has plenty of opportunity for attacking returns through his set piece responsibility anyway and defensive contributions too. Iâm keeping him in my side for the time being, mainly because I have bigger problems to solve! We know he can be consistent, and with no other competitions to concentrate on, expect Unitedâs Premier League performances to improve.Image source, Getty Images

Image source, Getty ImagesIlyas: Do you think I should give Wirtz a chance? Giving he has a favorable fixture or should I cash in on Grealish?Iâm a Wirtz owner and I think weâve been very unfortunate not to get an attacking return from him so far. Heâs on some corners, plus heâs had four shots and made four key passes. Iâm going to give him the next two gameweeks against Burnley and Everton before considering a sale. Liverpool are the best attack in the league so far this season, he has to come good!

Image source, Getty ImagesNick: Is it time for a Haaland and Salah set-up given the number of high-price players blanking in the first three weeks?Iâve been contemplating this and itâs a question Iâll need to have the answer to come Gameweek 6, when Manchester Cityâs fixtures turn for the better, with Burnley at home that week. Right now I have Salah, but would prefer to own Haaland given his incredible record in the Manchester derby. His underlying numbers are excellent, whereas it feels Salah has been fortunate to get his two goal involvements and Iâm still unsure of his potential in Slotâs new-look attack compared with last campaign.

Image source, Getty ImagesStu: Who would you have longer term - Chris Wood or Jean-Philippe Mateta? Forest seem to be so unknown now given the manager change.Iâm a Chris Wood owner, but right now Iâd lean towards Mateta. I believe he has a higher ceiling for output this campaign if he can stay fit, especially with the addition of penalties, plus heâs more exciting to watch! I donât think Wood is a natural fit in Postecoglouâs system. Both sides are in Europe which will be a big adjustment to their regular schedules.

Andrew: Who is a good midfield differential for around Â£7m?Thereâs a few options here. Brentford newcomer Ouattara Dango has impressed since arriving from Bournemouth in the summer transfer window. Heâs Â£6.0m and 1% owned. Arsenalâs Noni Madueke is a good short-term punt with Saka still out injured, with Nottingham Forest and Manchester City the next visitors to the Emirates. Heâs in 1.3% of sides.

Image source, Getty ImagesMohammed: I have held Palmer ever since his injury in GW2. Should I still hold him or sell him and if so, who should I replace him with?Enzo Marescaâs comments in his pre-match press conference today were far from positive and so I highly doubt he starts in Gameweek 4 and his minutes will be carefully managed going forward too. I am planning to transfer him out this week, with Semenyo the replacement in my side. I also like Grealish too and freeing up those funds should give greater flexibility in the rest of your squad.

Image source, Getty ImagesMichael: Who would you captain this week? I don't have Haaland or Salah so who would you go with?Haaland and Salah are the standout options for this week so you may be at a disadvantage without them. With the news that Isak will be eased in at Liverpool, Ekitike remains a sound captain contender for this week given his early-season form and Mateta is another enticing option with a favourable home game against promoted Sunderland.

Image source, Getty ImagesJimmy: After a few average weeks, I have chosen to Wildcard. Who is the one player that is an absolute must-have going forward?Antoine Semenyo. Heâs been in red-hot form in the opening four gameweeks, with three goal involvements. Heâs had the most shots (9) and big chances (5) of any midfielder. He has three home games in his next four, against Brighton, Newcastle United and Fulham, plus a trip to promoted Leeds United. Iâm bringing him in this week for Cole Palmer!

Anyone who does not play FPL may well raise their eyebrows if you try to describe the "fear" of making a misstep, but I know exactly what Holly is talking about. I had a wild idea last gameweek to bring in Chris Wood as a differential when I could have afforded to shell out much more. The pain I felt when that plan backfired was all too real.
102Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingToo early to wildcard?published at 16:08 BST16:08 BSTFPL Q&A with Holly ShandHolly ShandFPL expert and two-time top 10k finisher
Floyd: I'm seeing plenty of people using a Free Hit or a Wildcard this game week. Is it really worth it?In my opinion itâs a little too early to wildcard: it always feels like the season gets properly underway after the first international break, but we need a couple of more gameweeks of information and allow time for players to bed in. Free Hit is a fun chip for this week if youâre facing a number of short-term issues, but only play it if your team needs it. Donât be dragged into it through fear!
77Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingHow likely will teams to rotate squads this early?published at 16:03 BST16:03 BSTFPL Q&A with Holly ShandHolly ShandFPL expert and two-time top 10k finisher
Image source, Getty ImagesChris: How likely are the teams involved in Europe to start rotating their squads given that the season is still at such an early stage?The Champions League gets underway this midweek, with six Premier League clubs involved, but then those teams have a natural opportunity to rest their players the following midweek and use squad depth for the League Cup fourth round. We do need to factor in fatigue for players who have had a busy international break and long travel times. Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca alluded to this in his news conference today, referencing the energy-sapping trip his Brazil internationals made to play at high altitude in Bolivia.

Image source, Getty ImagesSebastian: If you had to fit in some budget midfielders around Salah and Haaland, who would be in your line up?I think Jack Grealish is excellent value, particularly with the significance of playing his boyhood club Aston Villa this week. Plus, with Cole Palmer seemingly a doubt once again, Enzo Fernandez should be across set pieces and penalties for Chelsea, enhancing his routes to fantasy points. Antoine Semenyo may have risen in price by Â£0.4m already this season, but he still represents great value with form and fixtures.
164Shareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingIsak or Gakpo? Or neither?published at 15:54 BST15:54 BSTFPL Q&A with Holly ShandHolly ShandFPL expert and two-time top 10k finisher
Image source, Getty ImagesIsaac: I'm on wildcard, and after Slot's comments I'm not sure if I should invest in Isak or Gapko? Do we think Isak will start and be subbed off early, or will we have to wait longer for minutes?I would avoid buying a Liverpool attacker this week, stick with the ones you own now. Thereâs a good chance that Isak makes his full debut at home to Everton in the Merseyside derby in Gameweek 5, but we need to keep track of his minutes against Burnley and in the Champions League next midweek before making those predictions.
