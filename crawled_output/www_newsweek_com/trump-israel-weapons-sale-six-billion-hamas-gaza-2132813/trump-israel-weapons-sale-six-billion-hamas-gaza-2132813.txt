Greene also tried to add an amendment to a bill over the summer that would end all arms sales to Israel, but the amendment was flatly rejected by lawmakers, with only six voting in support of the measure.What To KnowPresident Donald Trump told Congress of his plans Friday, announcing a package of weapons for Israel that would total around $6 billion to bolster the Mideast nation's efforts. This adds to the already considerable weapons sales made earlier this year following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the U.S.The package includes a $3.8 billion deal for 30 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, nearly doubling Israel's fleet, and a $1.9 billion sale of 3,200 infantry assault vehicles for the army, a U.S. official and another person familiar with the proposal told the Associated Press. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans have not been made public.Deliveries would take at least two to three years, officials said. The proposed sales come as U.S.-backed efforts to broker an end to Israel's nearly two-year conflict with Hamas have faltered, and days after Israel's strike on Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, drew sharp criticism from American allies in the region.The U.S. is committing to the sale even as administration officials continue to seek a peace deal to end Israel's operation in Gaza.Meanwhile, some European allies have moved to start recognizing a Palestinian state, including the United Kingdom and France. The United Kingdom also last year suspended exports of some weapons to Israel out of concerns that the country could be violating international humanitarian laws and recently barred Israeli officials from attending the country's biggest arms fair.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also condemned Israel's attack on Gaza as disproportionate.Turkey also said it was closing its airspace to Israeli government planes and any cargo of arms for the Israeli military.What People Are SayingGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz, in a statement in August: "From the German government's point of view, the even tougher military action of the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, which was decided by the Israeli security cabinet last night, makes it increasingly difficult to see how these goals are to be achieved. Under these circumstances, the German government is not approving any exports of armaments that can be used in the Gaza Strip until further notice."British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said at a UN meeting in July: "Our support for Israel, its right to exist, and the security of its people, is steadfast. However, the Balfour Declaration came with the solemn promise that nothing shall be done, nothing which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of the Palestinian people as well. And colleagues, this has not been upheld, and it is a historical injustice which continues to unfold."Update 9/19/25, 6:42 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press....Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
