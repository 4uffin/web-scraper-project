Allegations that the website Jezebel orchestrated a so-called "curse" against Kirk have resurfaced in conservative circles, particularly as described on journalist Megyn Kelly's popular podcast. The claim that such actions deeply affected Kirk and his family, prompting prayer with a priest the day before his death, has underscored increasing tensions over the influence and boundaries of digital activism and satire—especially as it relates to high-profile political figures. The controversy also raises questions about the perceived and real impacts of online commentary and its effect on those targeted.What To KnowDuring a recent episode of The Megyn Kelly Show, host Megyn Kelly discussed a Jezebel article that allegedly called for a "hex" on conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. The article, published in late August 2025, reportedly detailed a satirical effort to bring bad luck to Kirk, involving commissioned Etsy witches and descriptions of imagined misfortunes, such as minor irritations and technical difficulties.Kelly explained on the podcast that, after learning of the Jezebel piece and alleged curse, Erika Kirk and Charlie Kirk became "rattled." Kelly recounted: "She and Charlie contacted a friend...and asked him to come over and pray with them over Charlie. the night before he was murdered," Kelly said. Kelly framed their response as rooted in deep Christian belief and concern about the spiritual implications of the article, regardless of its intention.According to a reading of the Jezebel piece on Kelly's podcast, the unnamed writer openly questioned whether it was ethical to curse Kirk, before humorously recounting their involvement in commissioning witches to cast spells to "ruin his day." The article expressed a desire for Kirk to face trivial setbacks, emphasizing satirical intent while including later disclaimers about not wishing physical harm.Kelly told listeners that the Jezebel article instructed readers on hiring witches via Etsy and detailed back-and-forth correspondence about the curse's timing. She noted the author’s hope that the spell would coincide with the new moon in Virgo, corresponding to August 23, 2025. The article alleged a third practitioner, "Priestess Lillian," contributed by burning an image of Kirk and promising results within three weeks—a time frame that overlapped with his death.Following Kirk's killing, Jezebel removed the original article, issuing a statement characterizing it as humor and reiterating that the publication condoned neither physical harm nor political violence. Jezebel claimed the removal came "out of an abundance of caution" for staff safety in a "tense and volatile environment," while affirming overall support for the article’s words and intent, Kelly said on her podcast.What People Are SayingMegyn Kelly, host of The Megyn Kelly Show, said on her podcast Monday: "Erika and Charlie Kirk heard about these curses, and that news genuinely rattled Erika, in particular. She...asked [a] Catholic priest...to come over and pray with them over Charlie. The night before he was murdered."Erika Kirk, widow of Charlie Kirk, told mourners at his memorial service Sunday: “I forgive him because it was what Christ did and it is what Charlie would do. The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the Gospel is love.”What Happens NextErika Kirk has announced her intention to lead Turning Point USA and further her late husband’s mission, focusing on outreach and support for young men and families. There has been no confirmation from Jezebel regarding a timeline for potential republication or further comment on the controversy. Ongoing discussions about the responsibilities and boundaries of digital activism, satire, and faith-based reactions are likely to continue. Law enforcement and officials have not credited or cited any connection between the Jezebel article and the events leading to Charlie Kirk's death.Update 9/23/2025, 9:48 p.m. ET: The headline of this article has been updated.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
