Here’s HowPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 10:47 AM EDTBy Hugh CameronU.S. News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberPresident Donald Trump’s decision to attach a fee to applications for H-1B visas, and proposed changes to the current visa lottery system, could raise the financial barrier to entry
and in doing so threaten to displace more senior American workers.On Friday, the White House announced that applications for H-1B visas—which allow U.S. employers to temporarily hire foreign-born workers in specialized fields—would now need to be accompanied by a $100,000 payment to "curb abuses that displace U.S. workers and undermine national security." Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has proposed a new "weighted selection process" that would prioritize more highly paid employees.Venture capitalist Deedy Das pointed out in an X thread that these changes effectively raise the salary baseline for those coming to work in the U.S. on H-1Bs. He said the combination of the fee and new weighting system—preferential toward higher earners—could greatly increase the job competition for senior, mid-career American employees.Newsweek has contacted the DHS via email for comment.Why It MattersSupporters of the H-1B visa—and critics of the recent changes—have pointed out that the program allows American companies to capitalize on talent from overseas. Some warn that the new fee is prohibitive, potentially limiting the flow of foreign-born expertise, disproportionately impacting smaller firms and undercutting America’s competitive edge when it comes to technological development and AI advancements.Critics, however, argue that large firms have exploited the visa program, using it as a way of sourcing lower-cost labor while driving down wages for American workers....What To KnowIn a report covering the 2023 fiscal year, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) noted that the median salary for new H-1B beneficiaries—those set to be impacted—was $94,000. Experts believe that requiring a $100,000 payment for such employees would effectively prevent them from being able to work in the U.S. under the program."I think it's fairly obvious that this would make H-1B visas prohibitively expensive for all except the most highly paid workers," Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King's College, London, told Newsweek this week.Beyond the general salary implications, proposed changes to the selection process could also place pressure on senior-level employees.At present, most new H-1B visas are awarded via a lottery system in which employers submit applications to USCIS, which then distributes the visas. However, the DHS has issued a new proposal that aims to do away with the randomized selection process and impose a “weighted” system—when annual demand exceeds the congressionally imposed 85,000 limit—which would “generally favor the allocation of H-1B visas to higher skilled and higher paid aliens.”Under the proposal, prospective employees would be divided into four wage tiers, with those in the top tier (IV) entered into the selection pool four times, while those in the lowest tier would be entered only once.As Das pointed out on Tuesday, this could limit the visa opportunities for entry-level and lower-wage workers, raise the salary band for foreign-born employees and, for American employees, mean that “the most lucrative jobs are disproportionately affected.”“A lot of jobs require you to go through entry-level salaries, like investment bankers, consultants, engineers, and especially doctors,” he wrote. “The ladder will be pulled up for them.”In addition to reducing the chances of securing visas for lower-level roles and posing challenges for smaller firms that cannot raise wages to attract talent, Das said the change would “put competitive pressure on mid-career Americans,” as “all the H-1Bs are going to be the ones who are paid more.”However, economist Madeline Zavodny believes that because H-1B visas require some form of specialized skillset, the policy change is unlikely to lead to substantial shifts among top-tier positions.“An alternative view is that more highly compensated employees tend to bring more unique, specialized skills, so there may be less substitution between foreign workers and American workers at very high levels,” she told Newsweek. “That said, I am concerned that employers will offshore more IT jobs, and that may make it less desirable for them to employ here workers who are complements to those offshore workers.”What People Are SayingThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in the Federal Register notice published Tuesday: “Through the proposed regulatory revisions, DHS aims to implement the numerical cap in a way that incentivizes employers to offer higher wages, or to petition for positions requiring higher skills and higher skilled aliens, that are commensurate with higher wage levels. The proposed process would favor the allocation of H-1B visas to higher skilled and higher paid aliens, while maintaining the opportunity for employers to secure H-1B workers at all wage levels.”Todd Schulte, president of bipartisan political group FWD.us, told Newsweek this week: "We should be thinking about reforming, improving, expanding this, and other immigration avenues that allow top talent from around the world to come to the US. We should be making it easier for companies in a predictable fashion to hire people. We should be making it easier for all those people to have mobility between employers, to go to startups and ultimately to get permanent residency and naturalize."Alan Manning, professor of economics at the London School of Economics, told Newsweek: “Whether $100K would be paid by many firms depends not so much on the salaries paid to the workers but on how much money these companies are currently making. They make their money by arbitraging the gap between the salaries of IT workers in India and the U.S.”“The H1-B has a quota system to limit numbers. [It] might be better to use fees as they raise money—Singapore has taken this approach a lot. So charging fees rather than quotas might be a good idea. But $100K might be a lot.”Jennifer Hunt, professor of economics at Rutgers University, told Newsweek: “We have very good evidence H-1B workers complement American workers rather than substituting for them, and many make crucial contributions to American innovation and therefore economic growth. The misguided introduction of a $100,000 application fee could shut down the H-1B program entirely, since almost no firm would be willing to pay $100,000 to hire a worker who could quit at any time. If so, the fee will have very detrimental effect on the economy as a whole and will not deliver the benefits to American workers the administration expects.”What Happens NextThe new $100,000 application fee went into effect after midnight on Sunday, according to the Trump administration.According to the DHS Federal Register notice, the new rules regarding salary-weighted applications could be in place in time for the 2026 lottery. The DHS is soliciting written comment on the proposal from other federal agencies and the general public for a period of 30 days beginning Wednesday.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
