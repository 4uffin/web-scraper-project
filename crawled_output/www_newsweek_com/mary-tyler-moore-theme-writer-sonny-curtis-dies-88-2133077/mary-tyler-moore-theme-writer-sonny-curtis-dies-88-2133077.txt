What To KnowBorn during the Great Depression to cotton farmers in Texas, Curtis was a childhood friend of Buddy Holly and played a crucial role in rock music's early development.He wrote or co-wrote hundreds of songs recorded by artists ranging from Bing Crosby to Bruce Springsteen. His most famous compositions include "I Fought the Law," which he reportedly wrote in a single afternoon, and "Love is All Around," the theme for The Mary Tyler Moore Show.The Bobby Fuller Four took "I Fought the Law" to the Top 10 in 1966, and it was later covered by The Clash, Johnny Cash, and Tom Petty, among others. Curtis called it his "most important copyright" in a 2014 interview.For The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Curtis created two versions of the theme song.The original Season 1 version asked, "How will you make it on your own?" while the more famous version from seasons 2-7 declared "You're going to make it after all." The producers initially wanted Andy Williams to perform the theme, but when he declined, Curtis' own vocals were used instead.Curtis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Crickets in 2012.

What People Are SayingCurtis previously described the creative process for the Mary Tyler Moore theme: "James L. Brooks came into this huge empty room, no furniture apart from a phone lying on the floor... So I played the song, just me and my guitar, and next thing, he started phoning people, and the room filled up."Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum on X: "Sonny Curtis (1937‚Äì2025) was a gentle, humble man who wrote extraordinary songs. Growing up picking cotton in West Texas, he latched onto music as a way out. He found his calling, writing indelible hits like 'Walk Right Back' for the Everly Brothers, 'I'm No Stranger to the Rain' for Keith Whitley, and a little TV song called 'Love Is All Around' that started 'How will you make it on your own.' A page ripped from Sonny's own wonderful, self-made life."Artist Fausto Fern√°ndez on X: "Farewell to the fabulous Sonny Curtis, one of The Crickets, strumming with Buddy Holly and gifting 'More Than I Can Say' to the Everly Brothers. Musician, singer, and composer ('I Fought The Law'), his are the theme songs for LA CHICA DE LA TELE and LA FAMILIA NEWTON.
Rest in peace."Writer and musician Jeff Kallman on X: "RIP Sonny Curtis . . . once one of Buddy Holly's crickets, songwriting success ("I Fought the Law" and others), and the man who wrote one of television's greatest theme songs . . ."What Happens Next?Curtis is survived by his wife Louise, whom he married more than 50 years ago, and his daughter Sarah.
