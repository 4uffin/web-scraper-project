Family & ParentingWeddingFamilyTikTokViralNews ArticleFather of the Bride Reveals Wedding Suit—Tears at Where It Came FromPublishedSep 21, 2025 at 10:30 AM EDTBy Maria MoravaRelationships ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA bride-to-be online captured a moment with her dad she never expected.In an emotional TikTok video, Lucy Barnes shared the heartwarming moment her dad tried on a potential wedding suit, which brought her to tears when she realized its significance. Barnes, 23, spoke to Newsweek about how her dad's decision to wear his own wedding suit to her upcoming nuptials marked a milestone in their relationship."My dad coming down in his wedding suit to ask if I thought it was still nice to wear at my wedding," Barnes captioned the video. "I'm sobbing...He just frowns like that cause he thinks I'm taking pictures."...A Sentimental, Stoic DadBarnes described the moment as "very emotional." She said the suit was the very same one her dad wore when he married her mother 26 years ago. What's more was that the gesture was particularly moving because of her dad's stoic personality."It really showed how he not only approves of but is also already excited about my wedding," she said.The moment felt like a powerful display of affection from a man of few words."It was a real 'actions over words' moment as my dad is not a man of big passionate speeches," she said. "It was a touching moment of vulnerability from a dad who has always been very stoic, even in the most turbulent of times."The experience transported her back to a simpler time, when Barnes said she would ask her dad if he liked her "pink sparkly dresses" for school dances. The emotional exchange captured in the video "made a very surreal day feel very much more real," she said.A Man of Many DimensionsBarnes described her dad's personality as a mix of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. House."He is the most intelligent person I know and not just because he's my dad," she said. "His knowledge seems to cover ever topic from quantum physics to WWE wrestling."Despite his intimidating and aloof exterior, Barnes noted he is "kind, patient and grounded underneath." She said he is a man of many contradictions—he loves cycling but hates football, he's a "tech whiz" who hates socializing. Overall, she said, "My dad is unlike anyone I've ever met, it's honestly hard to describe."His role in the wedding will be a traditional one. He will walk her down the aisle and deliver a speech that she joked would likely include embarrassing tales of her teen-hood. She also holds out hope that he can be convinced into a father-daughter dance."My mom actually got him to go to a jazz dance class once," she said. "Never again—he said it was his personal hellscape."The heartwarming moment served as a perfect prelude to Barnes' wedding to her fiancé, Cory."I am so excited to marry Cory," she said. "He is the most wonderful man I've ever met and is the only man to win over my dad, too."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsErika Kirk on Husband Charlie’s Killer: ‘I Forgive Him’3 min. readNewsMusk and Trump Chat Warmly in First Meeting Since Summer Fallout3 min. readNewsTwo Killed, Five Injured in Indiana Shooting—Police3 min. readNewsUK, Canada, Australia Recognize Palestinian State7 min. readU.S.Exclusive: James Talarico on Texas, ‘Nonbinary’ God and Joe Rogan’s Support27 min. readU.S.Students Return to Books as Schools Ban Phones9 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
