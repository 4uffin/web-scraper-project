WorldChinaDronesChinese MilitarySouth China SeaNews ArticleWorld’s Largest Submarine Drone Moves Into South China Sea: ReportPublishedSep 25, 2025 at 10:22 AM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 10:24 AM EDTBy Micah McCartneyChina News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe world’s largest underwater drones are undergoing testing in the South China Sea, according to a new report.Why It MattersTwo types of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) were among the new weapons platforms on display during China’s “Victory Day” military parade in Beijing earlier this month.Advances in artificial intelligence and remote technologies have led to a surge in interest in military drone capabilities worldwide, as governments pursue platforms that can complement or even replace legacy systems at a lower cost and with reduced human risk.What To KnowChina, which already boasts the world’s largest navy by hull count, has been investing heavily in drones and other unmanned platforms as part of President Xi Jinping’s vision of developing a “world-class” military by 2049—widely viewed as an ambition to meet or surpass that of the U.S. as the countries vie for supremacy in the Asia-Pacific.China is believed to have built two submersible, mega-sized “XLUUVs” (Extra-large Uncrewed Underwater Vehicles), which satellite imagery shows measure approximately 130 feet in length. The massive drones eclipse the submersible drones seen during the V-Day parade and are more than twice the length of the U.S. Navy’s Orca XLUUV, which has also yet to complete testing....Both the leviathans are undergoing testing in the waters around China’s southernmost province of Hainan, open-source maritime analyst H.I. Sutton wrote in a report for Naval News.They are currently being housed at Gangmen Harbor, a facility located west of the Sanya naval base, where the PLAN has also parked other UUVs, as well as aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines.Each of the XLUUVs has been provided with its own floating dry dock, which can be deployed into deeper waters, allowing its contents to be released without interfering with nearby ship traffic. The docks also offer cover from foreign surveillance.In addition to extended range, Sutton pointed out that the vessels' immense size means the drones likely boast larger, more powerful sonar systems and can carry significantly larger payloads than other XLUUVs—possibly even more than the eight heavyweight torpedoes a crewed submarine of similar size can carry, thanks to space saved by not needing crew quarters.Notably, the absence of personnel means the vessels will rely on cutting-edge artificial intelligence to process their data and operate effectively, Sutton said.What People Are SayingMaritime analyst H.I. Sutton wrote: "It has long been a working assumption that Chinese naval technology is decades behind the West. And that Chinese engineers are not inclined to innovate. These attitudes have been shown to be outdated, yet they persist. These new XXLUUVs are thus yet another wake up call for Western planners."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
