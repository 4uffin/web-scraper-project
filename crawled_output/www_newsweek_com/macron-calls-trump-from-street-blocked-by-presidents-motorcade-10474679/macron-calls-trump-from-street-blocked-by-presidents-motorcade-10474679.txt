Trump and Macron have had a mixed relationship over the years, with the pair often appearing cordial at major events but disagreeing on policies around climate change and NATO. ...What To KnowPresident Trump is in the city ahead of his own speech to the UN, scheduled for later today.The clip, which has been shared by multiple social media users thousands of times since last night, begins with a police officer apologizing to Macron, that the roads have been closed to prepare for Trump's motorcade. The motorcade typically consists of a dozen or so vehicles including police on bikes and the president's own armored car, The Beast.“If you don’t see [the motorcade], let me pass,” Macron, who appeared to be in good spirits, argued.With little choice but to wait with the rest of traffic, Macron decided to put a call in to Trump directly.“Hey, how are you? Guess what, I am waiting in the street because everything is frozen for you, ha!” the French leader is heard telling Trump on his cellphone.Other footage captured Macron walking down the street towards the French embassy, while still speaking to Trump on the phone. The call appeared to be jovial in nature, despite the pair's differences on one of the key discussion points at this week's General Assembly - Israel and Palestine. Macron has been one of the leading voices in calling for recognition of the Palestinian state, alongside the U.K., Canada, and other western nations. Trump has said that doing so would reward Hamas.
