NewsJimmy KimmelSinclairABCFCCCharlie kirkMagaNews ArticleABC Affiliate Owner Demands Jimmy Kimmel Make Charlie Kirk DonationPublishedSep 18, 2025 at 02:29 AM EDTupdatedSep 19, 2025 at 03:32 AM EDTBy Martha McHardy and Shane CroucherShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberMedia giant Sinclair called on Jimmy Kimmel to apologize directly to Charlie Kirk's family over remarks he made about the conservative activist's killing, and to give both them and Turning Point USA a "meaningful personal donation."Sinclair, which owns a number of ABC affiliates, had told ABC that it would indefinitely preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! prior to the show's suspension by the network.The controversy centers on remarks Kimmel made in a monologue after Kirk's death about MAGA and 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, the suspect in the killing...."We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA Gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it," Kimmel said.MAGA activists interpreted the comment as an accusation that Robinson was from their pro-Trump movement.Why It MattersThe backlash over Kimmel's comments comes at a moment when America is deeply polarized over political violence, free speech and how public figures are remembered. Kirk's assassination on September 10 has become a flashpoint: supporters hailed him as a leading MAGA voice for young conservatives, while reactions to his death split sharply between outrage and even celebration. In such a volatile climate, remarks that appear dismissive or insensitive can end careers, as networks and broadcasters face mounting pressure to act.The controversy also underscores how fraught the political environment has become, following a string of high-profile attacks, including the attempt on Donald Trump's life in 2024 and the killing of a Democratic lawmaker in Minnesota this year.What To KnowThe Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates the networks, has also sharply criticized Kimmel's comments, putting greater political and business pressure on the companies to take action."This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney," FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said on Benny Johnson's podcast. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel or there will be additional work for the FCC ahead."Sinclair's Vice Chairman Jason Smith said in a statement: "Mr. Kimmel's remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country."We believe broadcasters have a responsibility to educate and elevate respectful, constructive dialogue in our communities."Smith continued that "this incident highlights the critical need for the FCC to take immediate regulatory action to address control held over local broadcasters by the big national networks."Sinclair did not specify its plans for the 11:35 p.m. time slot that usually airs Kimmel's show, except for Friday, when it will broadcast a one-hour tribute to Kirk on its ABC affiliates. Other Sinclair-owned stations will carry the special over the weekend, and the company has offered it to other ABC-affiliated stations nationwide.According to the release, Sinclair's station will not lift the suspension of Kimmel's show until "formal discussions are held with ABC regarding the network's commitment to professionalism and accountability."It added: "Regardless of ABC's plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform."Another major owner of ABC affiliate stations, Nexstar Communications Group, announced it would also pull the show beginning Wednesday."Kimmel's comments about Kirk's death are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse," said Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division. Nexstar operates 23 ABC affiliates.In an interview with Fox News late Wednesday, Carr praised the moves by Nexstar and Sinclair, noting that pulling Kimmel's show aligned with the conditional broadcast licenses each company holds, which require programming to serve the public interest."I'm very glad to see that America's broadcasters are standing up to serve the interests of their community," Carr told Sean Hannity's Fox News program. "We don't just have this progressive foie gras coming out from New York and Hollywood."What People Are SayingMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on X: "First Colbert, now Kimmel. Last-minute settlements, secret side deals, multi-billion dollar mergers pending Donald Trump's approval."Trump silencing free speech stifles our democracy. It sure looks like giant media companies are enabling his authoritarianism."California Governor Gavin Newsom said on X: "Buying and controlling media platforms. Firing commentators. Canceling shows. These aren't coincidences. It's coordinated. And it's dangerous. The @GOP does not believe in free speech. They are censoring you in real time."The Democrats said on X: "LEGALIZE COMEDY, FREE JIMMY KIMMEL."Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: "Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT."White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich said on X on Wednesday: "Welcome to Consequence Culture. Normal, common sense Americans are no longer taking the bull**** and companies like ABC are finally willing to do the right and reasonable thing. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"Republicans Against Trump said on X: "Turns out MAGA doesn't hate cancel culture. They just want to own it."What Happens NextWith both Sinclair and Nexstar pulling Jimmy Kimmel Live! from their ABC affiliates, pressure is mounting on the network to decide whether to discipline or distance itself from its late-night host.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
