President Donald Trump on Monday suggested that taking Tylenol during pregnancy may be linked to higher autism rates in the United States, a connection experts have studied but say remains unproven.Speaking at the White House, Trump advised women to avoid acetaminophen "during the entire pregnancy."Trump said during his remarks, "If you can't tough it out, if you can't do it, that's what you're gonna have to do. You'll take a Tylenol, but it'll be very sparingly. It can be something that's very dangerous to the woman's health.""I think you shouldn't take it," Trump continued.Trump: "If you can't tough it out, if you can't do it, that's what you're gonna have to do. You'll take a Tylenol, but it'll be very sparingly ... I think you shouldn't take it." pic.twitter.com/gzmYrtBlLm‚Äî Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 22, 2025
Why It MattersThe announcement comes amid a significant increase in autism cases in the U.S. in recent years.Experts say the rise in cases is mainly due to a new definition for the disorder that includes mild cases on a "spectrum" and better diagnoses. They say there is no single cause to the disorder."[Health and Human Services Secretary] RFK Jr. has a long history of promoting false or unsubstantiated health claims and harmful theories about autism that have been debunked by doctors, scientists, and advocates who have experienced or studied it for years. Today's announcement attributes autism to the use of Tylenol during pregnancy based on distorted 'science' and false claims," Mia Ives-Rublee, senior director for the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement obtained by Newsweek.

What To KnowTrump said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would begin notifying doctors that the use of acetaminophen "can be associated" with an increased risk of autism, but the president did not provide any medical evidence for the new recommendation.He referenced the announcement in comments to reporters on Sunday, saying, "I think we found an answer to autism.""We have not identified the holy grail at this point. We need more research," Ann Bauer, epidemiologist and co-author of research linking the active ingredient in Tylenol to increased incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders, told Newsweek ahead of Trump's remarks.Autism affects 1 in 31 U.S. children today, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Who Owns Tylenol?Kenvue, which manufactures Tylenol, said "independent, sound science clearly shows" that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism."We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers," the company told Newsweek in a statement. "Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives."What People Are SayingTrump, at a news conference: "Don't take Tylenol. There's no downside. Don't take it. You'll be uncomfortable. It won't be as easy, maybe, but don't take it. If you're pregnant, don't take Tylenol. And don't give it to the baby after the baby is born."Ives-Rublee, in a statement obtained by Newsweek: "This will likely lead to blaming parents if their children are diagnosed with autism and discouraging the safe use of medication to appropriately manage pain and fever during pregnancy. In addition, RFK Jr. and Trump's focus on "curing" autism‚Äîa natural part of human diversity‚Äîis offensive, inaccurate, and stigmatizing. This administration's approach derails efforts to provide autistic people the services and support they may need."What Happens NextRobert F. Kennedy Jr. said that he is launching an effort to identify all causes of autism, involving the National Institutes of Health, FDA, CDC and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.
