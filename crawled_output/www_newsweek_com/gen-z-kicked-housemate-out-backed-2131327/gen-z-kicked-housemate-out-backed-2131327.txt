On the InternetViralFriendshipInternetGen ZTrendingRedditMoreNews ArticleGen Zer Who Kicked Housemate Out for ‘Only Child Syndrome’ Sparks DebatePublishedSep 17, 2025 at 11:20 AM EDTBy Melissa Fleur AfsharLife and Trends ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA Gen Z woman has sparked debate online after sharing that she and her roommates told one housemate to leave, citing months of disruptive behavior and what she described as "only child syndrome."The post, shared by the woman under u/Interesting-Month927, has been upvoted more than 1,700 times, drawing widespread support from commenters who said the eviction was justified.The 21-year-old said that she lives with three others—"Kelly," 20, "Allie," 22, and "Steve," 23—in a rental home owned by Steve's parents. But, after nearly a year together, she and the other roommates said they reached their breaking point."Kelly has lived with us now for 10 months," the woman said. "This was her first time living away from her parents, and we have tried to discuss our problems with her multiple times with zero results."The poster detailed grievances ranging from spoiled food left in shared containers to neglect of basic household responsibilities."Basically, from the time she moved, she has been terrible about taking care of her food that's gone bad, which is particularly frustrating when she is using Tupperware that she does not own along with ruining several pans," the woman said.She added that Kelly has had a consistent problem with contributing to household shared products such as soap and paper towels, despite the fact that she has more money in her bank account than the others.Sharing a bathroom added further strain. According to the post, Kelly left "hair and toothpaste everywhere" and refused to flush toilet paper, instead discarding it in the trash."When we asked her not to, she just said 'that's how my parents do it,'" the woman said.Newsweek spoke with Dr. Becky Whetstone, a therapist and life coach based in Arkansas, who reviewed the post."What a mess," Whetstone said. "My guess is that the roommate is immature, has been coddled, thinks her parents' way is the only way."She may even have a mental-health disorder like ADD, anxiety and/or some form of financial dysmorphia."On a recent road trip, Kelly allegedly ignored group plans, nitpicked over costs, and spent freely on her own purchases, aggravating existing tensions between the group.After returning home, tensions escalated."She has been avoiding us and won't talk to us, and all of her bad habits at home have gotten worse," the woman said, before posing the central question to viewers: "Are we the a******* for giving her 30 days to leave?"For Whetstone, the best solution involves clear expectations and guidance."The group should have a house meeting and tell Kelly the arrangement isn't working; they're not sure why, but things must change," she said."They need a list of specific things that need correction, with a proposed solution included. I suggest this because she seems a bit clueless about the real world, then give her 30 to 60 days to improve."Newsweek reached out to u/interesting-month927 for more information via Reddit....Are you and your friend stuck in an argument?
