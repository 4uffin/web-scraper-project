NewsJimmy KimmelCharlie kirkDonald TrumpDisneyABCNews ArticleJimmy Kimmel and Free Speech: The Week in Your WordsPublishedSep 19, 2025 at 05:59 AM EDTBy  Joshua Sammonscommunity managerShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberHello, and welcome back as we take another look at your highlighted comments. This week, ABC announced that it has suspended Jimmy Kimmel Live! following backlash over comments its host made about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk."Jimmy Kimmel Live! will be preempted indefinitely," said a spokesperson for ABC.President Donald Trump quickly praised the decision and said during a press conference: "Jimmy Kimmel was fired because he had bad ratings more than anything else." Meanwhile, online activists have launched a boycott campaign targeting ABC and its parent company, Disney, over the decision....The fallout has sparked debate about the decision to suspend the show and raised questions around free speech. You have pushed the conversation further with your comments and opinions, some of which we have highlighted below:On Reactions to Jimmy Kimmel Live! Being Suspended Original Article: Jimmy Kimmel 'Canceled' Over Charlie Kirk Comments: Trump Celebrates, Hollywood Fury—Live UpdatesBackground: Jimmy Kimmel Live! has been suspended indefinitely by ABC over its titular host's comments about Charlie Kirk.Original Comment: "Sorry but if you've been glad to see conservatives canceled and lose their jobs over these last few years, you can't complain when the cancel culture you promoted comes for one of your own. We warned you that it set a very bad precedent and that it would all be fun and games until it happened to you. Here we are. Perhaps now you can see the problem." – bhn72Editor's Note: This comment highlights concerns about cancel culture and its potential hypocrisy. It reflects the ongoing debate about balancing free speech with accountability in today's polarized environment.From the Same Article:"Kimmel and his Hollywood pals are directly responsible for killing the viewership of awards programs like the Oscars by their mean spirited political narratives. SNL Trump skits were funny. Kimmel's obscenity laced criticisms were not. When someone signs your massive paycheck, they have the right to direct the narrative. When Fox fired Tucker Carlson the libs applauded. When ABC fired Kimmel, they cried 1st amendment. No surprise here." – z3_patriotEditor's Note: Reacting to the story, this commenter draws a parallel between reactions to media personalities on both ends of the political spectrum. It reflects a view that questions the consistency of public responses and highlights how corporate and political interests intersect with freedom of expression.From the Same Article: Original Comment: "Government threatening and corporate capitulation and a direct violation of the 1st Amendment. This is what Americans voted for by electing the people they did. The President, Congress, Senate and the court this delivered. This is what American chose. Now the economy has direct government intervention as well. Americans have to put stop to this in midterms --if not, they will choose to allow government more control and intervention in their lives as well as denial of their freedom as citizens." – ciaconnaEditor's Note: This comment reflects concern about government influence over corporate decisions and its perceived impact on constitutional rights. It contributes to ongoing discussions around the role of elected officials and regulation.On Calls For Jimmy Kimmel to Make a Charlie Kirk DonationOriginal Article: ABC Affiliate Owner Demands Jimmy Kimmel Make Charlie Kirk DonationBackground: Media giant Sinclair called on Jimmy Kimmel to apologize directly to Charlie Kirk's family, and to give both them and Turning Point USA a "meaningful personal donation."Original Comment: "Kimmel should not apologize for something he did not do. I do not watch the show but read all the comments and saw the clip of the show and I think he did nothing wrong." – JFB1013Editor's Note: This commenter argues that Jimmy Kimmel shouldn't have to apologize for his speech. It highlights ongoing discussions about intent, interpretation, and the appropriate response to controversial public remarks.On Reactions to President Trump Praising George OrwellOriginal Article: Donald Trump Praises George Orwell Amid Free Speech Crackdown ConcernsBackground: Trump praised British novelist George Orwell at the state banquet at Windsor Castle on Wednesday, amid growing concerns over a crackdown on free speech.Original Comment: "Whether he praised Orwell or not there a lot of people who seem OK with the direction the Trump administration is taking the country. They support, empower and encourage this movement and the actions this government is taking. But there is an old saying that should be known by those supporters: 'Those with oars, that move the ship, are the last to see the storm that sinks it.'" – truroadEditor's Note: This comment offers a perspective on the current political climate and the views of some supporters. It contributes to the broader discussion about leadership, public opinion, and concerns surrounding free speech.Thank you for keeping the conversation going.
