The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said it will defy California's new "No Secret Police Act," which restricts law enforcement officers from masking their identities during operations.California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill on Saturday that prohibits local and federal law enforcement officers from wearing ski masks, neck gaiters, or other face coverings while performing official duties. He made the post hours after his press office wrote in an X post that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem "is going to have a bad day today.""Governor Gavin Newsom is fanning the flames of division, hatred and dehumanization of our law enforcement. At a time that ICE law enforcement faces a 1,000% increase in assaults and their family members are being doxxed and targeted, the sitting Governor of California signs unconstitutional legislation that strips law enforcement of protections in a disgusting, diabolical fundraising and PR stunt," DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a press release.She added: "He signed this piece of legislation the same day his team made a menacing threat against Secretary Kristi Noem online. The violent rhetoric and demonization must stop. To be crystal clear: we will not abide by Newsom's unconstitutional ban."Why It MattersICE has come under increased scrutiny for deploying agents in plain clothes and wearing face coverings during operations, a measure officials say is essential to protect both agents and their families from threats. Under the new legislation, California becomes the first state to prohibit enforcement agents from covering their faces, with limited exceptions for undercover operations and medical masks.

What To KnowNewsom signed a series of legislative bills aimed at curbing ICE's ability to conduct raids in sensitive locations such as schools and churches.Under state law, schools must notify families when immigration officers are present on campus. Student records and classrooms are protected from access by ICE without a judicial warrant or court order, per the new legislation. Similarly, emergency rooms and other nonpublic areas of hospitals are off-limits to immigration enforcement without court authorization, and information collected by health care providers is treated as protected medical data.The laws also require that law enforcement and immigration officers be clearly identifiable by name or badge number, with exceptions limited to situations where identification is not possible. The use of masks by officers is restricted to cases where it is absolutely necessary.Additionally, impersonating a federal agent is explicitly defined as a criminal offense, under the bill.Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli told CBS News in an interview on September 22 that California has no jurisdiction to regulate the federal government. His remarks came in response to the recently signed law, which is set to take effect next year. Essayli's statement reflects the federal government's position that state law cannot override federal operations, and he indicated that federal agents in California would not be bound by the state mask restrictions.DHS has repeatedly claimed that ICE officers have faced a surge in assaults, including attacks using vehicles, as well as online doxing campaigns targeting officers and their families. However, the agency has refused to release a detailed breakdown of the alleged assaults.Despite the new restrictions, DHS has said that ICE will continue its immigration enforcement operations in California.The confrontation highlights growing tensions between federal law enforcement agencies and California's state leadership over President Donald Trump's hardline immigration agenda.Newsom has repeatedly squared off and gone toe to toe with the Trump administration, particularly over immigration raids and the federal deployment of thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of U.S. Marines to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles in June, despite objections from state leaders.What People Are SayingNewsom said on Saturday: "It's like a dystopian sci-fi movie‚Äîunmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing. This is a disgrace. This is an outrage, what we've allowed to happen in this country."Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin: "He signed this piece of legislation the same day his team made a menacing threat against Secretary Kristi Noem online. The violent rhetoric and demonization must stop. To be crystal clear: we will not abide by Newsom's unconstitutional ban."Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Eassayli told CBS News: "The law has no force or effect on federal agencies. The State of California has no jurisdiction to regulate anything that we do in the federal government and I've instructed our agents to disregard it."Jason P. Houser, former chief of staff, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and former CBP counterterrorism official, said in a press release: "Ensuring that officers are clearly identified, while providing sensible exceptions, helps protect both the public and law enforcement personnel. These are common-sense necessities that safeguard all law enforcement agencies as they keep us safe and protect our communities.What Happens NextThe mask ban legislation comes into effect on January 1, 2026.
