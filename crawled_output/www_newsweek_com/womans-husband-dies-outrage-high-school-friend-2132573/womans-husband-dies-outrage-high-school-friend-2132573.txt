RelationshipsGriefDeathFriendshipCheatingMarriageRedditMoreNews ArticleWoman’s Boyfriend Dies, Outrage Over What High School ‘Friend’ Says NextPublishedSep 19, 2025 at 11:10 AM EDTBy Maria MoravaRelationships ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe tragic loss of a woman's boyfriend led to an advance she never saw coming.Her tragic loss was compounded by a high school "friend's" disturbing behavior, sparking a firestorm of outrage from an online community that immediately recognized the red flags. The woman, u/lifelong-angstt, shared her heartbreaking story in a post on Reddit, saying her boyfriend of 13 years passed away in a fire in April. Since the post was published, it has received 42,000 upvotes."An old friend from high school reached out to me and now I'm getting a little uncomfortable," she wrote in the post. "Am I reading into this too much? Because to me, his intentions don't feel right. I'm literally mourning the love of my life and this just does not seem appropriate at all."Loading reddit content...Inappropriate 'Condolences'In accompanying screenshots, the woman showed that the man referenced his marriage and said his wife might get jealous of them talking. He then told the grieving woman that everyone in high school thought they were "end game," a comment that left her feeling deeply disturbed.The Reddit community immediately shared her outrage and validated her feelings. One person said the man was a "creep" and wrote: "This creep is just trying to get in your pants. He figures, 'Oh, so she's single now, huh?'" The commenter, who had also been recently widowed, added: "I'm recently widowed myself, and the dudes who just want to 'talk' are in for more than that. I've been through a few of these gross encounters myself."Another person's reaction was visceral: "This actually made me say 'yuck' aloud. 100 percent fishing to see if you want to make bad choices with him."...The Red Flags of Unwanted AttentionAccording to Miranda Malone, a licensed grief therapist and founder of The Mother Loss Collective, this kind of unwanted attention is a common problem because grieving individuals are particularly vulnerable.The brain is in "survival mode," she told Newsweek, making it harder to read nuance and set clear boundaries."After a major loss, our nervous system searches for safety," she said. "Attention, even inappropriate attention, can temporarily feel regulating, which complicates red flags."Malone provided clear ways to distinguish supportive intentions from inappropriate ones. The red flags include pressure to meet, secrecy—such as "don't tell my spouse"—romantic or sexual undertones, and centering themselves in your loss. She said that a message is a red flag "if it makes you manage their feelings while you're acutely bereaved."Setting Boundaries to Protect YourselfMalone's advice to the woman is to set clear boundaries to protect herself. She suggested naming her needs and emotional state directly."'I'm focusing on grieving and logistics right now. I'm not available for personal outings or late-night chats,'" she suggested the poster say. If that doesn't work, a harder boundary might be necessary.Malone emphasized that it's important for the woman to protect her own nervous system and not feel obligated to respond. She said that a person's behavior is simply "information, not a verdict on you."For those who want to support a grieving friend or acquaintance, Malone said the key is to lead with consent and specificity."Good support is quiet, consistent and asks first," she concluded.Newsweek reached out to u/lifelong-angstt for comment via Reddit.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting3 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
