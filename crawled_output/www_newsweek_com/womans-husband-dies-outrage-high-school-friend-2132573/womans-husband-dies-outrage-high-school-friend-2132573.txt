RelationshipsGriefDeathFriendshipCheatingMarriageRedditMoreNews ArticleWoman’s Boyfriend Dies, Outrage Over What High School ‘Friend’ Says NextPublishedSep 19, 2025 at 11:10 AM EDTBy Maria MoravaRelationships ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe tragic loss of a woman's boyfriend led to an advance she never saw coming.Her tragic loss was compounded by a high school "friend's" disturbing behavior, sparking a firestorm of outrage from an online community that immediately recognized the red flags. The woman, u/lifelong-angstt, shared her heartbreaking story in a post on Reddit, saying her boyfriend of 13 years passed away in a fire in April. Since the post was published, it has received 42,000 upvotes."An old friend from high school reached out to me and now I'm getting a little uncomfortable," she wrote in the post. "Am I reading into this too much? Because to me, his intentions don't feel right. I'm literally mourning the love of my life and this just does not seem appropriate at all."Loading reddit content...Inappropriate 'Condolences'In accompanying screenshots, the woman showed that the man referenced his marriage and said his wife might get jealous of them talking. He then told the grieving woman that everyone in high school thought they were "end game," a comment that left her feeling deeply disturbed.The Reddit community immediately shared her outrage and validated her feelings. One person said the man was a "creep" and wrote: "This creep is just trying to get in your pants. He figures, 'Oh, so she's single now, huh?'" The commenter, who had also been recently widowed, added: "I'm recently widowed myself, and the dudes who just want to 'talk' are in for more than that. I've been through a few of these gross encounters myself."Another person's reaction was visceral: "This actually made me say 'yuck' aloud. 100 percent fishing to see if you want to make bad choices with him."...The Red Flags of Unwanted AttentionAccording to Miranda Malone, a licensed grief therapist and founder of The Mother Loss Collective, this kind of unwanted attention is a common problem because grieving individuals are particularly vulnerable.The brain is in "survival mode," she told Newsweek, making it harder to read nuance and set clear boundaries."After a major loss, our nervous system searches for safety," she said. "Attention, even inappropriate attention, can temporarily feel regulating, which complicates red flags."Malone provided clear ways to distinguish supportive intentions from inappropriate ones. The red flags include pressure to meet, secrecy—such as "don't tell my spouse"—romantic or sexual undertones, and centering themselves in your loss. She said that a message is a red flag "if it makes you manage their feelings while you're acutely bereaved."Setting Boundaries to Protect YourselfMalone's advice to the woman is to set clear boundaries to protect herself. She suggested naming her needs and emotional state directly."'I'm focusing on grieving and logistics right now. I'm not available for personal outings or late-night chats,'" she suggested the poster say. If that doesn't work, a harder boundary might be necessary.Malone emphasized that it's important for the woman to protect her own nervous system and not feel obligated to respond. She said that a person's behavior is simply "information, not a verdict on you."For those who want to support a grieving friend or acquaintance, Malone said the key is to lead with consent and specificity."Good support is quiet, consistent and asks first," she concluded.Newsweek reached out to u/lifelong-angstt for comment via Reddit.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
