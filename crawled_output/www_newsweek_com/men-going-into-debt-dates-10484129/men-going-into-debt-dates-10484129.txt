LifeDebtCredit CardsDatingGenderPersonal financeNews ArticleMen Are Going Into Debt to Pay For DatesPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 06:16 PM EDTBy Suzanne BlakeReporter, Consumer & Social TrendsShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA large number of men say they’d go into debt to pay for dates, according to new research from Credit One Bank.While 46 percent of men said they’d overdraft for love, only 28 percent of women said the same in the survey of 1,000 Gen Z and millennial adults.Why It MattersWhile many Gen Z and millennials have expressed frustration with today’s dating apps and dating culture at large, personal finances can also play a major role in how young Americans date—or if they date at all.With prices of restaurant meals and bar cocktails increasing, cash-strapped singles may choose to date less or be forced to take on credit card debt for the expenses. This could be especially true for men, who often feel the societal pressure to cover the full cost of a date.What To KnowThe report found an overwhelming number of Gen Z and millennials are invested in looking financially successful, even if their actual financial situations don’t reflect it.Over half, or 51 percent, admitted to exaggerating their financial success, with Gen Z (54 percent) leading the way compared to millennials (48 percent).“Men overdraft for love because we've been socialized to think financial generosity equals romantic value. It's the modern version of peacock feathers,” Michael Ryan, a finance expert and the founder of MichaelRyanMoney.com, told Newsweek.“The data shows this isn't about stupidity. It's about deeply ingrained expectations. Men still face cultural pressure to be providers despite earning power becoming more and more equal. When you add social media's highlight reel and dating app competition, guys feel they need to spend their way into consideration.”Altogether, 37 percent said they’d go into debt just to impress a date, granted the percentage was significantly higher for men than women (46 percent compared to 28 percent).“This gender gap reflects entrenched social expectations where men still feel pressure to be financial providers and demonstrate their romantic commitment through spending. Despite evolving gender roles, traditional courtship norms persist: men are expected to pay for dates, buy gifts, and showcase their ability to provide,” AASECT certified sexologist for DatingNews Natassia Miller, who previously worked as a wealth manager, told Newsweek. “Going into debt becomes a form of ‘performance spending’ to project success and desirability, even when it's financially unsustainable.”What People Are SayingAlex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: “It's a sign of the times. For many men, their personal image is deeply tied to their financial success, and if that success is falling short, using debt to meet the monetary gap is seen as the only measure they can do. This is so unfortunate, because digging a bigger financial hole is not just bad for their own future, but also for the relationship they're building more on money than genuine feelings. Miller told Newsweek: “Men often view financial risk-taking as acceptable, while women — who historically faced greater economic vulnerability — tend to prioritize financial security. When people feel economically insecure, paradoxically, some compensate by overspending to maintain social status, creating a dangerous cycle of debt-fueled impression management.”Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek: “Whether it be love or job title, people in general have this fake it til you make it ideology that can lead to substantial long-term debts if things don't turn around quickly.  As for men, women prefer a financially stronger individual which connotes safety and security.  So, going into shorter term debts for a connection may be in the interest for certain men.”What Happens NextAs prices for food and other date-related activities continue to stay high, the trend of men paying for dates with debt is likely to continue, experts say.“With inflationary pressures continuing to weigh on so many, the desire for money over love is going to be attractive for some men and women who are craving financial security above all else,” Beene said.Miller said the willingness to damage credit scores for romance is “financially catastrophic.”“The broader message is clear: we need better financial education that specifically addresses how social pressures drive destructive spending behaviors, particularly among men who may not recognize how traditional masculine expectations are undermining their economic futures,” Miller said....Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
