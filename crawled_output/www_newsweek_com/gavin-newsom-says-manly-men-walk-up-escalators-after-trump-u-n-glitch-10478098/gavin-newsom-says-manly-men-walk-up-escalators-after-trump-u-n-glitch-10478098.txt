GlitchPublishedSep 23, 2025 at 10:24 PM EDTupdatedSep 23, 2025 at 11:27 PM EDTBy Anna CommanderDeputy News EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberDemocratic California Governor Gavin Newsom took a swipe at President Donald Trump after an escalator the president stepped on suddenly shut down on Tuesday at the United Nations General Assembly.Newsweek reached out to the White House via email for additional comment. Why It Matters The exchange follows the widely publicized mishap during Trump's visit to the United Nations, when the escalator halted as soon as he and first lady Melania Trump started ascending it.The snag, coupled with reported teleprompter issues during Trump's speech, sparked debate over security at major international events and gave political opponents, like Newsom, fodder for viral mockery.As both parties gear up for the 2028 elections and midterms, the episode underscores how viral moments and digital tactics could potentially shape perceptions of political leadership in the United States.Both Newsom and Trump have publicly engaged in online quarrels with one another recently, notably after the deadly wildfires in Los Angeles County and Republican House redistricting efforts.What To Know In a post to X on Tuesday, Newsom said, "I only walk up escalators because that’s what REAL MANLY MEN do."The remark was in response to a clip of Fox News' Jesse Watters saying that the escalator and teleprompter glitches were possibly indicative of "an insurrection" and the United States should either leave the United Nations or "bomb it."Watters then seemingly joked that there could be "some fallout" if that did occur. Loading twitter content...According to Reuters, the United Nations said that a member of Trump's video crew—specifically, his videographer—may have triggered a built-in safety mechanism by moving backwards up the escalator to film the president and first lady, inadvertently causing it to halt. The device is designed to prevent people or objects from getting caught in the machinery.During his speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Trump discussed the mishaps: “These are the two things I got from the United Nations—a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,” drawing some laughter from the audience, Reuters notes.U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock then said after Trump's remarks, according to Reuters, that "The U.N. teleprompters are working perfectly."What People Are Saying White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted to X on Tuesday: "If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately. The Times reported this on Sunday."Loading twitter content...Trump, on Truth Social Tuesday: "It was a great honor to speak before the United Nations. I believe the speech was very well received. It focused very much on energy and migration/immigration. I have been talking about this for a long period of time and this Forum, was the absolute best from the standpoint of making these two important statements. I hope everybody gets to watch it! The teleprompter was broken and the escalator came to a sudden hault [sic] as we were ridding [sic] up to the podium, but both of those events probably made the speech more interesting than it would have been otherwise. It is always an honor to speak at the United Nations, even if, their equipment is somewhat faulty. Make America Great Again!"Governor Newsom's Press Office, on X Tuesday: "DOZY DON WAS DEFEATED BY THE ESCALATOR, POOR GUY! THE ENTIRE WORLD IS LAUGHING AT THE LOW IQ 'PRESIDENT.' NEXT STOP: THE BEST ROOM AT MEMORY MEADOWS RETIREMENT RESORT. TYLENOL INCLUDED. ENJOY YOUR STAY, DON! — GCN"What Happens NextOnline exchanges demonstrate how American political discourse is increasingly shaped by digital platforms and viral content. Newsom, viewed by strategists as a top contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, has used such moments to rally support and energize Democrats.It is immediately unknown if there will be a further probe into the incidents at the U.N....Update 9/23/25 11:17 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
