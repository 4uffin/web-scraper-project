WorldChinaPacific IslandsNews ArticleChina Reaches Deeper Into South PacificPublishedSep 25, 2025 at 04:00 AM EDTShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberChina is set to formalize a policing agreement with the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, paving the way for Chinese police officers to operate there for the first time.The move marks the latest step in Beijing’s efforts to expand its security footprint across the region, drawing close scrutiny from Western governments.Why It MattersChinese police are already present in several other countries, including across Europe, ostensibly to boost bilateral security cooperation and support Chinese residents and tourists, with uniformed officers active in the Solomon Islands and Kiribati.Rights groups have warned that Beijing can use these police deployments to monitor and intimidate dissidents overseas and to export its surveillance-driven policing model. The United States and its Australian ally have expressed concern that China’s expanding presence in the Asia-Pacific could shift the balance of power in the region.Newsweek has reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Vanuatu, a Vanuatu government representative, and the U.S. State Department via emailed request for comment.What To KnowChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun told reporters Tuesday, “China’s cooperation with Vanuatu is based on mutual respect, equal-footed consultation, mutual benefit, openness and inclusiveness. China will continue to support Vanuatu to the best of our capabilities in light of their will and need, and strengthen friendly exchanges and cooperation in various fields for the benefit of the two countries and two peoples....Vanuatu Police Minister Andrew Napuat, who met with Chinese Public Security Minister Wang Xiaohong in Beijing last Friday, was quoted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: “Overseas media has exaggerated these discussions with misrepresentations, giving wrong impressions of our relationship with our partners on topics of security and policing, which have very specific meanings in Vanuatu’s context.”Napuat added that China has agreed to donate equipment to Vanuatu’s police, including drones and motorcycles. “Vanuatu has already established Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] and Cooperation Agreements on policing with Australia, New Zealand, France, the United Kingdom [U.K.], and PNG [Papua New Guinea], while China is the only country with which we still need to formalize,” he told local media.“Our two governments wish to formalize a Police MOU similar to existing MOUs…to better coordinate and manage different areas of partnership in the policing sector with all of our partners.”The pending deal comes just over a week after Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese left Vanuatu without securing a proposed 10-year aid and security package.What People Are SayingThe Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in a commentary on China’s overall regional policing activity, said, “Australia and its partners must recognize that the contest in [the Solomons' capital] Honiara isn’t simply about who can deliver more aid vehicles, training programs or infrastructure projects; it is about what kind of policing model will define the Pacific’s future. Will it be one rooted in transparency, rights and service to communities? Or one that normalizes surveillance, submission and political control?”What's NextIt remains unclear when Beijing and Vanuatu will finalize their policing agreement, or how extensive a Chinese police presence will be.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
