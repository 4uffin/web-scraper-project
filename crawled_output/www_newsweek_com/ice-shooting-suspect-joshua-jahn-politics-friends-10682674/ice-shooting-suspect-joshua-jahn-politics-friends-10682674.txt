NewsImmigration and Customs EnforcementICEDallasNews ArticleICE Shooting Suspect Joshua Jahn ‘Wasn’t Really Into Politics’: Ex-FriendsPublishedSep 25, 2025 at 06:51 AM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 10:21 AM EDTBy Alia ShoaibNews ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberFormer friends of the gunman who fatally shot an ICE detainee and wounded two others at a Dallas facility on Wednesday say he was not interested in politics, according to a report.Authorities said that Joshua Jahn, 29, who shot people at the facility before turning the gun on himself, had engraved an anti-ICE message on a bullet casing.Why It MattersFollowing the shooting, speculation has grown about whether it was politically motivated. At this time little is known about Jahn’s beliefs or potential motivations, beyond the bullet engraving.The FBI and Vice President JD Vance have said that the attack was politically motivated. But former friends have reportedly said Jahn was not overtly political, describing him instead as an online provocateur who said things for shock value.What To KnowJournalist Ken Klippenstein has quoted unnamed former friends of Jahn as saying that he cultivated an ironic persona online on forums such as the anonymous message board 4chan, and had contempt for mainstream politics.One friend who reportedly knew the shooter since he was eight years old said: "He was never really into politics, especially not politicians.""He was into politics only in the 4chan sense—contrarian, provocative, boundary-pushing for laughs, not conviction," the former friend said....Klippenstein noted that all of the people he interviewed were former friends of Jahn, and that he had not been able to speak with anyone who could provide insight on his recent views.The friends suggested that Jahn had become increasingly socially isolated after he dropped out of college and lost many of his friends due to his overly provocative behavior.One friend told Klippenstein that he had stopped talking to Jahn because he had become "unbearable," due to "taking his 4chan/irony stuff into daily interactions." "If you’re having trouble finding people besides immediate family who knew him, that’s part of the story," another friend told the reporter. "Every mutual friend drifted away over that kind of edgelord behavior."FBI Director Kash Patel said that the "anti-ICE" engraving on a bullet casing suggested it was a politically motivated attack....One of his former friends reportedly told Klippenstein that they did not believe the engraving was sincere, speculating: "I think he tried his best to write something goofy … to rile people up."The FBI told Newsweek it did not have any updates on the shooting at this time.What People Are SayingVice President JD Vance said at an event in North Carolina: "What we know is that in Dallas, Texas, an ICE facility was opened fire upon by a violent left-wing extremist, a person who wrote anti-ICE messaging on their bullets. And there's some evidence we have that's not yet public, but we know this person was politically motivated."FBI Director Kash Patel said in a post on X: "While the investigation is ongoing, an initial review of the evidence shows an ideological motive behind this attack. One of the unspent shell casings recovered was engraved with the phrase "ANTI ICE."The Department of Homeland Security sent Newsweek an emailed statement from Noem, reading: "For months, we’ve been warning politicians and the media to tone down their rhetoric about ICE law enforcement before someone was killed. This shooting must serve as a wake-up call to the far-left that their rhetoric about ICE has consequences."What Happens NextAs the investigation continues, more information about Jahn’s personality and political views are likely to come to light.Update 9/25/2025 10:13 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with more information and comment.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
