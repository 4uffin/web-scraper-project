However, once infected, the virus can cause neurological symptoms due to inflammation or damage to the brain or lining of the brain and spinal cord, known as meningitis....How to Prevent Potential Exposure from Eastern Equine EncephalitisIn order to limit or prevent potential exposure, people are advised to follow the seven Ts:Tip over anything that can old waterToss any unwanted yard items that may collect waterTurn over items that hold water like children's poolsTighten tarps over items like boats and pools where water can gatherTake care to clear out debris from ditches and drains and guttersTreat items that be drained with mosquito control productsTalk with neighbors about reducing mosquito presence in the home and neighborhood.What Happens Next?Beaufort County has advised residents to remain alert to potential issues with mosquitos, which proliferate in areas with water standing for five days or more.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesPoliticsDemocrats React to Jimmy Kimmel’s Return from Suspension3 min. readPoliticsDonald Trump Tells Pregnant Women to ‘Tough it Out,’ Avoid Tylenol4 min. readPoliticsWhat We Know and Don’t Know About Trump’s H-1B Crackdown7 min. readPoliticsMap Shows Health Care H-1B Visas by State as Trump Floats Fee Exemption6 min. readPoliticsWhite House Shares Update on Antifa Crackdown as Trump Order Nears4 min. readPoliticsTrump Admin Vows to ‘Defend Every Inch of NATO’ After Russian Violations3 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
