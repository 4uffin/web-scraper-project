However, once infected, the virus can cause neurological symptoms due to inflammation or damage to the brain or lining of the brain and spinal cord, known as meningitis....How to Prevent Potential Exposure from Eastern Equine EncephalitisIn order to limit or prevent potential exposure, people are advised to follow the seven Ts:Tip over anything that can old waterToss any unwanted yard items that may collect waterTurn over items that hold water like children's poolsTighten tarps over items like boats and pools where water can gatherTake care to clear out debris from ditches and drains and guttersTreat items that be drained with mosquito control productsTalk with neighbors about reducing mosquito presence in the home and neighborhood.What Happens Next?Beaufort County has advised residents to remain alert to potential issues with mosquitos, which proliferate in areas with water standing for five days or more.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting3 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
