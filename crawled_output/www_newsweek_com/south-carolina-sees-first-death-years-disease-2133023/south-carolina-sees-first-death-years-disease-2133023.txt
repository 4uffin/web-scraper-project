However, once infected, the virus can cause neurological symptoms due to inflammation or damage to the brain or lining of the brain and spinal cord, known as meningitis....How to Prevent Potential Exposure from Eastern Equine EncephalitisIn order to limit or prevent potential exposure, people are advised to follow the seven Ts:Tip over anything that can old waterToss any unwanted yard items that may collect waterTurn over items that hold water like children's poolsTighten tarps over items like boats and pools where water can gatherTake care to clear out debris from ditches and drains and guttersTreat items that be drained with mosquito control productsTalk with neighbors about reducing mosquito presence in the home and neighborhood.What Happens Next?Beaufort County has advised residents to remain alert to potential issues with mosquitos, which proliferate in areas with water standing for five days or more.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
