The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Oct. 10 in Oslo, Norway.But it’s highly unusual for a head of state to make a public plug for themselves to win the prize at the UN’s annual general debate in New York, a venue designed to bring leaders together to discuss international issues like climate change and nuclear proliferation.Trump touched on those issues as well in a rambling UN address that more closely resembled his campaign speech, filled with attacks and lists of achievements.The president said that in eight months in office he had restored the peace and prosperity that marked his first term, reversing four years of “weakness, lawlessness and radicalism under the last administration.” Trump touted his economic, trade and immigration agenda, as well as his poll numbers and gains in the stock market.After promoting his administration’s work, Trump delivered a blistering critique of the United Nations and of other countries as allies and adversaries sat mostly in silence through a speech that ran well past the 15 minutes allotted to each world leader.Trump said the UN did nothing to help him address international conflicts — the work he said should be rewarded with the Nobel Peace Prize. He also ripped into the UN’s renovation of its Manhattan headquarters, and its failure to provide a working teleprompter for the first part of his remarks.Trump reprised past comments he’s made by referring to global warming as the “global warming hoax” and calling climate change “a con job.”Most of his UN address was dedicated to an attack on immigration and clean energy. Trump called the issues a “doubletailed monster” that was ruining Western Europe. He argued that they could only be resolved if countries followed America’s lead by closing their borders and turning away from renewable energy sources. “Immigration and suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe,” Trump said. “Your countries are going to hell.”The performance reflected Trump’s willingness to anger allies and upend norms at the UN and other international institutions, even as he seeks recognition with international awards like the Nobel. “It’s too bad I had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them,” Trump said of his efforts to end conflicts since taking office. He added that the UN did nothing but write “really strongly worded” letters. “Empty words don’t solve war,” he said.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
