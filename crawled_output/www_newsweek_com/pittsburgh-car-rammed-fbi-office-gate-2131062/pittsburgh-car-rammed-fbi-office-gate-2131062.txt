NewsFBIPittsburghCar crashBreaking NewsNews ArticleFBI Field Office Rammed With Car in ‘Targeted Attack’PublishedSep 17, 2025 at 05:58 AM EDTupdatedSep 17, 2025 at 10:52 AM EDTBy Robert Birsel and Shane CroucherShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA man rammed his car into the gate of an FBI field office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, early on Wednesday and then fled the scene in what investigators said was a "targeted attack".There were no reports of any injuries. The FBI named the suspect as Donald Henson of Penn Hills, who has a history of mental health issues and is thought to be a former member of the military. He was later found and taken into custody.FBI Pittsburgh Assistant Special Agent In Charge Christopher Giordano said Henson had grabbed an American flag from inside the car and thrown it over the gate he had just crashed into.Giordano initially said the FBI viewed it as an "act of terror," but the bureau later backed down from that characterization, CBS News Pittsburgh reported."This was a targeted attack on this building," Giordano said. "Thankfully, no one was hurt, but we are going to exhaust every ability we have under the federal law to find, apprehend, and prosecute this subject to the fullest extent."He said Henson had come into the FBI field office a few weeks ago to make a complaint that "didn't make a whole lot of sense" and, after looking into it, investigators "contacted him and let him know that there was no federal crime that we were able to charge."Newsweek reached out to the FBI in Pittsburgh via a messaging app for comment....Pictures broadcast by CBS showed a light-colored sedan, the driver's side door open, in front of a damaged black metal gate, raised at one end but still blocking the entrance. An American flag appeared to have been placed on the gate.There appeared to be a message written on one of the car's windows, Giordano said, and the bomb squad has been called in to check the vehicle.Witness Nakeisha Brown told ABC affiliate WTAE she first heard the screeching of tires and then saw the aftermath of the crash as well as a man who got out of the vehicle."He got out and went around the passenger side and pulled something out the passenger side. I thought it was a gun but it happened to be a flag and he just set it on that fence and started yelling out some words and just took off," Brown said.Another witness, Cierra Posey, who also works nearby, described the driver as being incoherent as he walked away from the scene."I'm blown away right now," Posey said."He just walked away like nothing happened," added another nearby worker, Idez Columbie.Updated, 9/17/25, 10:51 a.m. ET: The article was updated to say the suspect had been detained.Updated, 9/17/25, 10:10 a.m. ET: The article and headline were updated with new information.Updated, 9/17/25, 6:20 a.m. ET: This article was updated with more information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
