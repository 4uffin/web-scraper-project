WorldRussia-Ukraine WarDmitry MedvedevDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyKremlinRussiaMoreNews ArticlePutin Ally Fires Nuclear Warning at Trump’s USPublishedSep 25, 2025 at 06:58 AM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 09:02 AM EDTBy Shane CroucherBreaking News EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberTop Kremlin official Dmitry Medvedev issued a fiery nuclear warning to the U.S. after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said officials in Moscow should learn where their nearest bomb shelter is if they don't end Russia's war.Zelensky, in an interview with Axios, said U.S. President Donald Trump had given his explicit backing to Ukrainian strikes on Russian targets such as energy infrastructure and arms factories, and that if Kyiv receives more long-range American weaponry, then "we will use it"."The Kiev drug addict said the Kremlin should know where a bomb shelter is so its occupants can hide when he uses long-range American weapons," Medvedev, who is deputy chairman to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the Kremlin's Security Council, and is himself a former president and prime minister of Russia, in a post on X."What the freak needs to know is that Russia can use weapons a bomb shelter won't protect against. Americans should also keep this in mind."...NATO-Russia ConflictTensions between Russia and U.S.-led NATO—both sides armed with devastating arsenals of nuclear weapons—have escalated sharply in recent weeks as Moscow's invasion of Ukraine thunders on, despite Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal. The potential for a direct NATO-Russia clash is increasing. NATO allies have accused Russia of a series of serious violations of their airspace, allegations Moscow says lack evidence. In one such incident, Poland says it had to shoot down a dozen Russian drones that violated its airspace and threatened its security during an attack on neighboring western Ukraine. Trump, speaking at a press conference alongside Zelensky during the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York, said he thought NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft entering their airspace.
Trump: Ukraine Could Recapture All LandHe also posted to his Truth Social platform that, with NATO's support, Ukraine could win back all of the territory seized by Russia over the course of its full-scale invasion, launched in February 2022. "Why not?" Trump wrote. "Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like 'a paper tiger.'"Trump continued: "When the people living in Moscow, and all of the Great Cities, Towns, and Districts all throughout Russia, find out what is really going on with this War, the fact that it’s almost impossible for them to get Gasoline through the long lines that are being formed, and all of the other things that are taking place in their War Economy, where most of their money is being spent on fighting Ukraine, which has Great Spirit, and only getting better, Ukraine would be able to take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that!"Updated, 9/25/25, 8:30 a.m. ET: This article was updated with more information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
