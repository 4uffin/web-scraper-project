WorldEarthquakeEarthquakesRussiaTsunamiGeologyNews ArticleMultiple Earthquakes Slam Russian CoastlinePublishedSep 19, 2025 at 09:13 PM EDTBy Amanda Castro and Peter AitkenShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberMinor earthquakes have continued rattling the Kamchatka region of Russia in the aftermath of a massive 7.8 magnitude temblor that struck the area on Thursday, with aftershocks from 4.5 to 5.5 magnitude throughout Friday.Why It MattersThree moderate earthquakes struck off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula early Monday, shaking one of the world's most geologically volatile regions. Kamchatka borders the Pacific Ring of Fire, and the region has endured a number of recent quakes just two months after getting slammed by one packing an 8.8 magnitude.The activity culminated in Thursday's quake, which briefly triggered warnings of a tsunami, although no such event occurred. However, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that Hawaii had no expected threat of a tsunami despite a Pacific-wide warning.Thursday's quake struck around 80 miles off the Russian coast, at a depth of 6 miles. Other officials reported tsunami waves of around 1 to 2 feet high at various points along the peninsula's edge....What To KnowAftershocks further disrupted the Kamchatka region, with a fresh one occurring virtually every hour throughout Friday.The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) recorded 14 seismic activities during the last 12 hours. The agency reviewed and confirmed all of them, with no reports of immediate damage or injury.As of Friday evening ET, several hours had passed with no further quakes and tsunami warnings were not issued.The clustered timing and proximity of the quakes suggested a possible sequence of related seismic disturbances. Experts have yet to confirm whether they represent a pattern or independent ruptures along the same fault zone.Where Is Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in Russia?Kamchatka, along the volatile Pacific Ring of Fire, is among Russia's most seismically active regions.Perched on the edge of Avacha Bay in the Russian Far East, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky is the capital of Kamchatka Krai and one of the world's most isolated major cities, accessible only by air or sea.The port city is surrounded by snow-capped volcanoes and rugged terrain, adding to its seismic vulnerability inside a tectonically active zone. But despite its isolation, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky remains a hub for scientists and tourists.What Happens NextSeismologists will continue monitoring the region for aftershocks and analyze the sequence for patterns that could indicate increased risk. Any further quakes could present a threat to the U.S. with tsunamis that could strike Alaska or Hawaii.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting3 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
