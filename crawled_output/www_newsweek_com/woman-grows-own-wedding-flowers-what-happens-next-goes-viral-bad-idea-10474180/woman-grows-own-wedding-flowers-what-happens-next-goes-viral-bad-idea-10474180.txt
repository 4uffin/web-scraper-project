The woman, whose wedding is just under a month away, shared a TikTok video with the caption: “Maybe it was a bad idea to try growing all my own wedding flowers...just kidding. Actually, the best choice I made so far.” Since her video was posted, it has received over 844,000 views.The video shows the woman carrying an abundance of fresh flowers in a wide variety of colors and species, including zinnias, statice and strawflower, as she noted in the comments.

In addition to the flowers she shared in the video, she recommended other varieties like feverfew and double white yarrow for other brides to consider.In another video, the woman told viewers she "truly believe[s] you can grow all your own flowers for your wedding." She showed off her eucalyptus, saying she grew the plants from a “five-dollar seed packet." She showed off other flowers she grew from seed packets that cost just a few dollars, saying, “This Gomphrena, so pretty for centerpieces, dries beautifully...it would look really pretty for like a green-and-white very simple centerpiece situation.”While growing flowers requires other costs like soil, she believes it’s worth it. She said the decision to grow her own flowers was made because she thought about the "environmental and the ethical dilemmas of plastic flowers." She encouraged other brides not to buy flowers online, either....Inspiration and a New BusinessThe video sparked a wave of praise from people who recognized the effort involved. “People don’t understand how much effort this takes," one person wrote. "SOOO impressive!"For many, the video was the inspiration they needed to start their own wedding flower journey.“I’m doing this too!” one person wrote. “Those are beautiful! I need this confirmation as a 2026 bride.” Another person was so impressed they said, “You just created me a new necessity for my wedding, thank you very much. P.S. it looks amazing.”One person who had already grown their own wedding flowers was so impacted by the experience that they started a new career path. “This is what I did in 2024," they shared. "I now own a floral business because I loved it so much."Newsweek reached out to @emvida97 for comment via TikTok.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
