Thousands of families – from Pacific Palisades to Altadena to Malibu – are still displaced and we owe it to them to help," Newsom said in a statement.The funding is intended for the "development of affordable multifamily rental housing so that those rebuilding their lives after this tragedy have access to a safe, affordable place to come home to," the governor said.It allows affordable housing developers to apply to multiple funding programs through a single application, providing an additional $101 million in funding to support recovery and rebuilding efforts following the wildfires, according to his office....Trump responded to the announcement in a post to Truth Social on Tuesday."Shockingly, I have just learned, that Gavin Newscum, the Governor of California, is in final stages of approval to build Low Income Housing in Pacific Palisades. How unfair is that to the people that have suffered so much!" the president wrote."Gavin Newscum's plan to build Low Income Housing (at the Super Luxury Pacific Palisades Fire Site) is what caused the destruction of the Late, Great New York City Mayor John Lindsay's Political Career — and John Lindsay was a Republican," Trump wrote.He added, "Unfortunately, the Governor of California and Mayor Karen Bass failed you!"Newsom's office responded on X, writing that there is "no state effort targeting low income housing in the Pacific Palisades" and that "there is no such thing as a federal housing permit."In July, Newsom also signed an executive order aimed at preventing overcrowding while rebuilding the Pacific Palisades, amid concerns about the density of new buildings in the area, according to news station KABC.What People Are SayingSecretary of the California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency Tomiquia Moss, in a statement in July: "The State's special Multifamily Finance Super NOFA will galvanize the collective public-private response to the wildfires in Los Angeles County, expediting and expanding opportunities to build affordable housing for low-income residents. By prioritizing affordable housing projects that are ready to go, these funds will accelerate household stability, climate and health outcomes in communities."California Department of Housing and Community Development Director Gustavo Velasquez, in a statement in July: "HCD has taken a program built on efficiency and further refined it specifically to help the Los Angeles region rebuild from unimaginable tragedy. Our team has gone above and beyond to ensure this program is designed to provide housing stability for fire-displaced families as quickly as possible."What Happens NextEfforts to rebuild areas of California devastated by the January wildfires continue.According to the state's government, 1,858 permitting applications have been received and 361 permits issued since the fires in Los Angeles County.Update 9/16/25, 4:52 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
