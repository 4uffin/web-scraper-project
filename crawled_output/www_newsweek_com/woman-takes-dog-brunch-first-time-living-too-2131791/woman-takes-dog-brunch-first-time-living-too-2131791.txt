Even 65 percent of dog owners asked said no, and only 22 percent replied yes.Laws and regulations on this matter vary depending on which state you are in. In Maryland, pet owners can bring their pups to outdoor dining areas, if the restaurant permits. In New York, leashed dogs can sit with their owners indoors.In Texas, businesses are allowed to advertise as pet-friendly, offering their outdoor patios for use to leashed pets....The video quickly went viral on social media and has so far received over 729,000 views and more than 188,000 likes on the platform.One user, WNR Pet Services, commented: "All dogs should be allowed on the chairs."Katie said: "Bless her animals are better behaved than humans and children yet still so many places refuse them."Sparkwdfl74 added: "Nothing makes me happier than seeing one more animal on earth being loved."Beautiful3nigma wrote: "Yeeesss. Mine sits in his carrier just to give him a little more height. He loves it and he's always so much more well behaved when he sits where he can see!"Newsweek reached out to @florencealexandras for comment via Instagram chat.
