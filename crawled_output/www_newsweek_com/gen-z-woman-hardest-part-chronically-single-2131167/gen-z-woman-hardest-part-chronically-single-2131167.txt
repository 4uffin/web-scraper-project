RelationshipsSingleRelationshipTikTokTrendingViralDatingNews ArticleGen Z Woman Reveals the Hardest Part About Being ‘Chronically Single’PublishedSep 21, 2025 at 12:30 PM EDTBy Alyce CollinsLife and Trends ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA "chronically single" Generation Z woman has gone viral on TikTok after revealing the hardest part about not being in a relationship.It's often said that every friendship group has one person who is perpetually single. For Emma Hughes, 25, she is that person. She's had a few so-called situationships in the past, but she's never been in a long-term relationship, and it's been more than six years since she went on a date.For the most part, Hughes, who resides in Maine, loves her life and is so proud of what she's been able to achieve by herself. But that doesn't mean being single is easy, as she tells Newsweek that she's "tired of always doing everything alone."In fact, Hughes explained that one of the hardest parts of being single is the idea of not being "anyone's person," and not having that person in return. Of course, she has friends and family to lean on, but Hughes is referring to that one person she can automatically talk to whenever something happens (good or bad), knowing they will be there for her no matter what...."There's a certain weight of not having a default person, like coupled friends do (and often take for granted)," Hughes said. "There's no one to lean on to pick up the slack at home when you're having a busy week, no one whose assumed job it is to help you take your car to the mechanic or pick up medicine when you're sick."She continued: "Sure, you can have friends and family help, but you have to put in the mental labor of selecting someone available and willing. You don't have that person to rely on and come home to at the end of the day."This is a concept that Hughes became more aware of in her early twenties when many of her friends started to meet their long-term partners.Realizing she doesn't have that one specific person can leave Hughes feeling lonely at times, and it's isolating to know that she has to do everything herself. Whether it's a daunting task or something frivolous, Hughes doesn't have the option to pass it onto someone else.It isn't just the fact that she doesn't have that default person, but also, it's the desire for Hughes to be that person for someone else."I'm a caregiver by nature and career, so I would love to give that kind of love and care to a partner. Sometimes singleness can feel like having this well of love building up inside, just waiting to be poured out," Hughes said.Trying to explain this concept to people in relationships isn't always easy, as Hughes notes that they are often quick to pity her or think she's just being self-pitying instead. She's not highlighting this to throw a pity party or to complain, but merely to share the reality of being a single woman.Indeed, she encourages people to be more empathetic towards their single friends. Rather than asking if they're using dating apps or when they last met someone, invite them over for dinner, ask about their job and be a pillar of support.By all means, avoid throwing around phrases such as "it will happen when you least expect it" and the dreaded "you need to put yourself out there more." Those sentiments aren't constructive and can be rather patronizing.Hughes has been documenting her experiences of singledom on social media (@mainelyemma on TikTok and Instagram) as a way to share her vulnerability and to connect with others. She felt alone for such a long time, but she's found such a supportive and generous community on social media, and she's come to realize that she certainly isn't alone.A video explaining how not having a specific person to lean on is one of the hardest parts of singledom has gone viral with over 1.6 million views and 223,900 likes on TikTok at the time of writing.Given that social media is usually about perfection and success, it felt important for Hughes to share the unvarnished truth.Hughes told Newsweek: "Social media is a highlight reel, but people want to see messy and imperfect people. They want creators they can see themselves in, people they can connect with. I can love my life, be happy and grateful for what I've built, and I can want love too. I can long for a husband, a home, children and family. Both can be true, and that messy middle ground is life."Being in a relationship is one of the few things in life that you can't work or will into existence. No amount of wanting or working can make it happen. It's not a dream you can achieve by merit or strength, and that's hard. It can often feel like your dreams are being held hostage."Hughes doesn't rule out dating and eventually finding her default person. The 25-year-old jokes that she's "accepting referrals for her husband-to-be," who can't be allergic to cats, is kind, patient, humble, has a sense of humor, is adventurous, and can make her laugh."If you, or someone you know, meets the following criteria, please get in touch," Hughes jests.
