HealthDaily DoseAgingCardiovascular diseaseStudyHealth and MedicineNews ArticleSupplements: Cocoa Extract May Reduce Risk of Cardiovascular DiseasePublishedSep 17, 2025 at 11:00 AM EDTBy Hannah MillingtonHealth ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberCocoa extract supplements rich in cocoa "flavanols" could reduce inflammation and help prevent age-related chronic diseases—including cardiovascular disease.This is the finding of Mass General Brigham researchers, who looked at five age-related markers of inflammation among participants who received daily cocoa supplements over several years.They discovered that "hsCRP"—an inflammatory marker that can signal increased risk of cardiovascular disease—decreased in participants taking the supplement.Indeed, their investigation suggests its anti-inflammatory potential may help explain its heart-protective effects, the team report.The finding adds to evidence that nutritional interventions may be an attractive solution for slowing inflammatory aging, known as "inflammaging."...Thanks to flavanols—small, bioactive compounds found not only in the cocoa bean but also berries, grapes, tea and other plant-based foods—cocoa extract has been found in previous smaller studies to reduce inflammatory biomarkers.To bridge the gap between these studies and humans, researchers launched the large-scale trial to examine the effects of cocoa extract on cardiovascular disease and help determine whether inflammaging may explain those effects."Our interest in cocoa extract and inflammaging started on the basis of cocoa-related reductions in cardiovascular disease," said study author Howard Sesso of the Division of Preventive Medicine and associate epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, in a statement."We also appreciate the important overlap between healthy aging and cardiovascular health, where aging-related inflammation can harden arteries and lead to cardiovascular disease."Because of that, we wanted to see whether multiyear cocoa extract supplementation versus a placebo could modulate inflammaging—and the data suggests it does."Between 2014 and 2020, Brigham and Women's Hospital led the COSMOS trial, a large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 21,442 participants over 60 years old. They found that cocoa extract supplementation decreased cardiovascular disease mortality by 27 percent.In this new study, researchers collected and analyzed blood samples of 598 COSMOS participants to measure several inflammaging biomarkers: three pro-inflammatory proteins called hsCRP, IL-6 and TNF-α; one anti-inflammatory protein called IL-10; and one immune-mediating protein called IFN-γ."This research on improvements in inflammaging through C-reactive protein represents an important pathway through which cocoa flavanols improve cardiovascular health," Sesso told Newsweek."We saw reductions in other forms of cardiovascular disease, but the most pronounced benefits for cocoa extract were for cardiovascular disease death, heart attack and stroke."Cocoa flavanols reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease through, at least in part, improvements in hsCRP."...Comparing changes in the three biomarkers measured at baseline, 1 and 2 years follow-up, hsCRP levels decreased by 8.4 percent each year compared with placebo, according to the team. Meanwhile, the other biomarkers remained relatively consistent or increased modestly.The decrease in hsCRP may help explain the cardio-protective effects seen with cocoa extract supplement in the larger COSMOS trial, where participants experienced a reduction in cardiovascular disease death.Clarifying that participants were all initially free of major cardiovascular disease at the start of COSMOS, Sesso added: "Keep in mind that the main COSMOS trial in more than 21,000 older adults found reductions in cardiovascular disease death and other cardiovascular outcomes, so understanding whether this is through improvements in hsCRP—or reductions in incident hypertension, which was also recently published—is important for us to disentangle!"Changes in the other inflammaging markers, including a small reduction in IL-6 observed in female but not male participants, warrant additional study, the researchers said.The team will continue to evaluate the COSMOS trial to determine whether the cocoa—and multivitamin—regimens can curb more severe inflammaging, as well as other important aging-related health outcomes."We believe our findings highlight the importance of food-based approaches to cardiovascular disease focused on the benefits of cocoa flavanols. Supplementation is not the required approach, as flavanols are found not only in the cocoa bean but other plant-based foods such as berries, tea, and grapes," explained Sesso.He emphasized that COSMOS focused on a supplement containing the bioactive component of the cocoa bean."This trial tells us nothing about chocolate—which has excess calories and fat, and always without the key bioactives of the cocoa bean such as cocoa flavanols due to the processing of the food. So, eating chocolate is not the proper response to this study—it remains important to have a well-balanced diet with a variety of plant-based foods that contain flavanols!"Do you have a tip on a health story that Newsweek should be covering?
