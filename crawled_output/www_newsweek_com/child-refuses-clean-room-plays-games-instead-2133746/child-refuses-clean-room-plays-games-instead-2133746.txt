Family & ParentingViralChildrenInternetFamilyRedditParentingMoreNews Article8-Year-Old Refuses To Clean His Room—Hysterics at What He Does InsteadPublishedSep 22, 2025 at 11:27 AM EDTBy Melissa Fleur AfsharLife and Trends ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberAn 8-year-old boy who flatly refuses to tidy his real-life bedroom has gone viral for doing the exact opposite—virtually.In a Reddit post shared on September 21 by the child's parent under u/IxDrZOIDBERGxI, viewers were shown an image of the boy, standing with his back to the camera, focused intently on a large TV screen.The screen showed a video game simulating the process of unpacking and organizing a child's bedroom. The irony was not lost on more than 96,000 Reddit users who upvoted the post, many of whom said they were left in stitches over the relatable situation.The image, which obscured the child's face to maintain anonymity, showed cardboard boxes neatly arranged in the center of a spotless virtual bedroom. In real life, however, the boy had no interest in replicating the order he maintained in-game.As the caption read: "8-year-old hates to clean his room but has been playing this unpacking/organizing game for 2 hours...He also likes to play a pressure washing game."The post was shared to the subreddit r/mildlyinfuriating and has since drawn more than 1,900 comments. The majority have responded with humor.At its core, the lighthearted post taps into a familiar paradox for many parents—how children may resist everyday responsibilities but spend hours immersed in games that mimic those same tasks.The post's irony struck a chord with viewers who shared similar stories from their own households."I am in this picture, and I do not like it," one viewer said."It's like me and those cooking games," another added."My dying plants when they see me playing Stardew Valley," a third viewer shared."When you have to put her DEGREE under the BED," another joked."This had me doubled over with laughter," a different viewer commented."Unpacking is honestly such a great game," another said, referring to the name of the game being played. "If you follow the story of the person changing from their childhood bedroom to their apartments throughout their adult lives. It's surprisingly deep. Seeing how her clothes change to the styles of her shoes, clothes to even underwear. It's pretty crazy how much story there is to unpack, pun not implied."Newsweek reached out to for u/IxDrZOIDBERGxI more information via Reddit....Do you have any funny or adorable videos or pictures that you want to share?
