The Trump administration suffered two legal defeats within hours on Friday, with a federal judge in Rhode Island ruling the president's executive order on "gender ideology" can't be applied to National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) grantees.Separately in California, a panel of Ninth Circuit judges affirmed the administration must hand over documents related to the firing of federal workers.Newsweek contacted the White House and Department of Justice for comment via email and press inquiry form on Saturday, outside of regular office hours.Why It MattersWith Republicans controlling both the Senate and House of Representatives the courts have emerged as one of the main impediments to Trump administration policy in recent months.The administration has suffered legal defeats on subjects including the imposition of punitive measures against law firms involved in proceedings against Trump, a bid to strip Haitan migrants of legal protection and sanctions on International Criminal Court employees.
What To KnowIn Rhode Island on Friday Senior District Judge William Smith, a federal judge, ruled that President Trump's January 20 executive order titled "Defending woman from gender ideology extremism" couldn't be applied to those given grants by the NEA.The executive order said the U.S. government only recognizes two genders, male and female, and stated federal funds "shall not be used to promote gender ideology."

In his conclusion, Judge Smith agreed that the NEA disfavoring grant applicants that "promote gender ideology," based on the executive order, would violate the First Amendment and thus can't go ahead.Friday also saw a panel of Ninth Circuit judges in California rule 2-1 to affirm a lower court decision demanding the Trump administration hand over documents related to the firing of thousands of federal workers.In April, a coalition of labor groups, non-profits, cities and a Texas county sued the federal government arguing job cuts imposed by Trump were outside his authority according to the Constitution, and also needed Congressional approval.Sweeping layoffs took place across the federal government following Trump's second presidential inauguration in January, spearheaded by the newly created and Elon Musk led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).What People Are SayingIn his ruling Judge Smith said: "Defendants are therefore enjoined from applying a viewpoint-based standard of review to Plaintiffs that disfavor applications deemed 'to promote gender ideology,' and the Court vacates and sets aside Defendants' current plans to implement the Executive Order."Writing for the majority in the Ninth Circuit ruling Judge William Fletcher, a President Clinton appointee, said: "We nowhere find clear error by the district court nor a clear entitlement to relief on the part of the government."Our denial of mandamus accords with the longstanding presumption that district courts have broad latitude to control discovery matters. Far from abusing its discretion, the district court has exercised care and restraint in managing discovery, affording 'careful consideration' to the government's assertion of privilege."Plaintiff attorney Elena Goldstein said: "The Trump-Vance administration tried to hide its sweeping plans to dismiss civil servants and dismantle the programs Americans depend on. The court made it clear that these documents‚Äîand the truth about what the administration is doing‚Äîare essential to this case."What Happens Next?The Trump administration could seek to appeal either or both of Friday's rulings to a higher court. Legal challenges are likely to remain a major obstacle to Trump's policy agenda.
