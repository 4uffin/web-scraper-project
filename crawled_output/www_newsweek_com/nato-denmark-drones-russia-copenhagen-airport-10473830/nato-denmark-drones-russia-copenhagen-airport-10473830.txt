WorldDenmarkNATORussiaDronesBreaking NewsWorld NewsNews ArticleRussia Link Possible in ‘Serious Attack’ on NATO’s DenmarkPublishedSep 23, 2025 at 05:26 AM EDTupdatedSep 23, 2025 at 07:11 AM EDTBy Shane CroucherBreaking News EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she cannot rule out the possibility that Russia is behind the major disruption to Copenhagen airport caused by drones flying in the area, calling it a "serious attack" on the NATO ally's critical infrastructure.Frederiksen pointed to a similar drone incident also affecting Oslo airport in Norway on Monday, September 22, and the recent alleged Russian violations of Polish, Estonian, and Romanian airspace."It must necessarily be seen in the context of everything else that is happening in Europe—without us being able to conclude anything yet," Frederiksen said, originally in Danish, Denmark's DR reported.Russia’s Ambassador to Denmark Vladimir Barbin told Newsweek in a statement that the suspicions of Russian involvement are "ungrounded," adding that "Russia is not interested in further escalating tension in Europe, which could have unpredictable consequences.""The incident in the sky above Copenhagen Airport reveals a clear desire to provoke NATO countries into a direct military confrontation with Russia. It is unacceptable to pander to this," Barbin said....Russia-NATO ClashRussia has said NATO allies have not provided enough evidence that Moscow's aircraft committed airspace violations.But NATO says Russia is testing its ability to respond and the resolve of its allies in a series of deliberate provocations related to the alliance's ongoing support for Ukraine.The risk of a direct clash between Russia and U.S.-led NATO—both sides armed with potentially devastating arsenals of nuclear weapons—is rising by the week.Under Article 5 of NATO's founding treaty, allies are obliged to mutual defense of each other if one comes under armed attack. Article 5 has not yet been invoked in this conflict, and Russia has not declared war on NATO.But the Kremlin has characterized NATO as at war with Russia because of its aid for Ukraine, fighting off Moscow's full-scale invasion since February 2022.Denmark Chose Not to Shoot Down DronesJes Jespersen, senior police inspector of the Copenhagen Police, called the drone pilot "a capable actor" during a news conference on Tuesday morning.Jespersen said the pilot seemed intent on showing off their skills and practicing their techniques.The two or three large drones disappeared after several hours and were not shot down because Danish officials thought the risk to the airport—particularly the passengers, planes on the runways, and fuel depots—was too high.Copenhagen Airport is the largest in Scandinavia.Poland, Estonia Accuse RussiaEarlier in September, Poland shot down what it said were Russian drones that violated its airspace and posed a security threat during Moscow's aerial attack on neighboring western Ukraine. In a separate incident, Estonia accused Russian fighter jets of violating its airspace for 12 minutes after ignoring warnings to leave the area.Both Poland and Estonia triggered NATO's Article 4 over the Russian threat, kick-starting formal consultations among allies on how to respond.Western allies say Russia is engaged in hybrid warfare against them, such as acts of sabotage against key infrastructure and cyberattacks.Russia denies the accusations.Updated, 9/23/25, 6:45 a.m. ET: This article was updated with more information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
