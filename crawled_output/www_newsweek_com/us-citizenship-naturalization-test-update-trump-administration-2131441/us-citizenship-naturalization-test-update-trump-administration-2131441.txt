Could You Pass It?PublishedSep 17, 2025 at 03:49 PM EDTBy Dan GoodingPolitics ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Trump administration has revealed the new test immigrants looking to become citizens must take, with new questions and an updated threshold for passing.Under the new civics test, those seeking naturalization must correctly answer 12 questions out of a possible pool of 128, to determine their "knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of American history, and of the principles and form of government of the United States."The changes were announced on Sept. 17, federally observed as Citizenship Day, with the White House releasing a copy of the letter President Donald Trump is now sending to prospective new U.S. citizens."This rich heritage is now yours to protect, promote and pass down to the next generation, Trump writes. "Our history is now your history... And our Constitution is now yours to safeguard, honor and respect."Loading twitter content...Doris Meissner, senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute and former director of the U.S. Immigration Service, told Newsweek that changing test requirements was not necessarily notable, but the overall tone from the administration was."The way in which they're explaining why they're doing this, really casts doubt on people's eligibility," Meissner said. "It suggests that people applying for naturalization are somehow either not eligible or have questionable intent for naturalizing or it needs to be clearly established, that they will be good Americans."It uses language like 'restoring the integrity of the naturalization process'. There is just not evidence, for decades really, that people who seek naturalization and are able to pass the requirements are in any way misusing the system."During his first term in the White House, President Trump first introduced a version of this new test, but under President Joe Biden, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) reverted to the test used since 2008, arguing then that the older test had been developed over a long period of time with the backing of multiple organizations.On Wednesday, USCIS filed notice that it would be switching the test out shortly, for a 2025 version which built on the changes made in 2020.What Questions Are Asked in the Citizenship Test?USCIS issues a study guide and a list of questions for applicants to prepare for the oral exam. The questions cover a range of topics, from the U.S. Constitution, through how the government is formed, to the symbolism seen in the American flag, and important holidays.Some examples of questions asked are:Name one American Indian tribe in the United States.Where is the Statue of Liberty?What did the civil rights movement do?Who was the United States' main rival during the Cold War?George Washington is famous for many things. Name one.There were 13 original states. Name five.What is one way Americans can serve their country?Name one power that is only for the federal government.The questions are broken down into subcategories, including System of Government, Rights and Responsibilities, and the Colonial Period and Independence.The full list of questions is below.478398-idris-elba.jpg.JPGDownloadHow Do Immigrants Pass the Test?While there are 128 potential questions, immigration agents only ask a random selection of 20. Under the new rules, all 20 may not need to be asked, which was required as part of the 2020 version.The questions will now stop when an immigrant has either correctly answered 12 – the passing threshold – or if they incorrectly answer 9, which would mean failure. This is an increase from the 2008 test which required 10 questions be answered and had a pass rate of 6.Applicants will have the chance to take the test twice if they need to, but if they fail twice then their application for citizenship will be denied.Meissner told Newsweek that the test frequently has a pass rate in the low 90 percentiles."Whether the test is a 100 questions, which it had been before, or 128 questions, the fascinating thing about it is that when the test is given to people who are native born, they do not succeed with good grades in answering the questions on that test," she said.So, it is fair to say that people who are applying for naturalization, and who study — and they study hard — they ultimately pass the test at a very high rate."Wider Changes to Citizenship Applications...Although immigrants applying for citizenship have often been through rigorous vetting before, for visas and green cards, the new test forms part of a wider set of adjustments being made by USCIS to the naturalization process.Last month, the agency announced it was resuming neighborhood checks, meaning agents may interview neighbors, colleagues and other associates before making a decision. Immigrants also have to prove they have shown "good moral character" in order to become a U.S. citizen.USCIS and the wider Trump administration insist this is necessary to ensure high standards are met."American citizenship is the most sacred citizenship in the world and should only be reserved for aliens who will fully embrace our values and principles as a nation," USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a press release Wednesday."By ensuring only those aliens who meet all eligibility requirements, including the ability to read, write, and speak English and understand U.S. government and civics, are able to naturalize, the American people can be assured that those joining us as fellow citizens are fully assimilated and will contribute to America's greatness. These critical changes are the first of many."When The New Citizenship Test Begin? USCIS said that those who have already applied for citizenship, or file within the next 30 days, will take the 2008 test. Those who file after 30 days will take the new 2025 test, with USCIS saying this likely means the test won't begin in full until three months from now.Special consideration has long been given to applicants age 65 and over who have been legal permanent residents for at least 20 years, and that will continue. Under the new rules, those applicants will still only be asked 10 questions and need to get 6 correct.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
