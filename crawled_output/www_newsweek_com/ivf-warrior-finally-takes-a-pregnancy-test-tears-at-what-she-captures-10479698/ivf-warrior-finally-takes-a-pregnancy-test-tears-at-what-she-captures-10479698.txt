Family & ParentingIVFMaternityTikTokViralNews Article‘IVF Warrior’ Finally Takes a Pregnancy Test, Tears at What She CapturesPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 11:02 AM EDTBy Maria MoravaRelationships ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA woman who documented her grueling IVF journey on TikTok captured the moment she finally took a pregnancy test, and her raw, emotional reaction has since gone viral. Lucy, 37, from South London, shared the tense, unforgettable moment after years of trying to conceive with her social media audience—who saw the results of the test even before she did. Since her good news was posted, the video has received 1.6 million views. Lucy spoke to Newsweek about the incredible moment and the palpable emotion behind it. The video opened with Lucy clearly anxious and nervous. “I feel sick," she said. "I can't even look. I talk so much when I'm nervous."...The Weight of the JourneyLucy reflected on the intense focus that defined her IVF process. "Going through IVF, all you can think about is getting pregnant," she said in the video. "Like, all I've thought about for the last year and a half is getting pregnant, not getting pregnant. When am I going to get pregnant? What's my future going to look like?"The anxiety reached a peak as she considers what the result might be. "If IVF hasn't worked, it's okay," she said. "We're just gonna go again next year. It's fine."Then, the best-case scenario came true. The test read "Pregnant"—and Lucy cried with overwhelming joy.Finding Hope and RepresentationThe journey to that moment was long and difficult. Lucy was diagnosed with blocked fallopian tubes and had growths removed after four years of trying. She was told IVF was her only option.She told Newsweek she was inspired to document her journey because she noticed a lack of representation online. "I noticed there weren't a lot of people documenting that looked like me or were from my ethnic background," she said. She hoped to help someone else "looking for a likeminded individual on their own IVF journey they could relate to."In the exact moment she found out, Lucy says she felt "utter surprise, shock, relief and joy." "As much as I had a slither of hope, I was still preparing for the worst," Lucy said, as her clinic had been honest about the statistical chances.A Phenomenal ResponseThe video's impact has been something she never predicted. The response to her good news has been "phenomenal," she said, with messages pouring in from fellow "IVF warriors," people who have experienced loss and even those who chose not to have children but felt her joy.Lucy received deeply personal messages from Black and brown women who felt seen by her documentation. She explained that "culturally IVF is still a bit of a taboo we don't talk about openly—especially not online in our communities."Her video brought hope to others. A woman who was waiting for cancer results messaged Lucy, sharing that she saw the video after being told she might not conceive naturally and that the video "filled her with happy tears and hope for the future."The moment remains incredibly special to Lucy. She said the journey has been one of the happiest times of their lives. "I can't explain how much lighter life feels knowing our little family is growing like we have dreamt about for so long," she said, adding that "joy is a feeling you cannot control and I'm so glad people felt mine with me. It was a moment I never want to forget. I still cry happy tears if I think too hard about it."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
