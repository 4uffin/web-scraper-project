I've never felt so vulnerable and unable to do anything about it."The actor said that he had managed to wake up before things could have got worse without specifying how he managed to escape.Trump and the TruthA passage in McConaughey's new book Poems & Prayers laments "an epidemic of half-cocked logic and illusions being sold as sound conclusions."When asked if this referred to President Donald Trump, he told The Guardian he had "been around politics and politicians enough to see and hear that the score is not always what they say it is; that they don't keep the score accurately."When the newspaper asked if he was concerned about the president's "disregard for the truth," McConaughey said he was concerned about that, but that there are many things to question over decades and centuries about what the truth was.He said that Trump was going about things in a different way than other politicians. "You can go back and there are many things to question over decades and centuries about what the truth was," he said."Trump's going about things in a different way than other politicians have. It's direct," said McConaughey, "he's cutting out the middleman."He also told The Guardian he had considered joining the world of politics. "It's something I started thinking about six years ago. The reason I'm not diving into it presently is I want to do my best to get three kids out of the house. But I'm fascinated with politics."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsErika Kirk on Husband Charlie’s Killer: ‘I Forgive Him’3 min. readNewsMusk and Trump Chat Warmly in First Meeting Since Summer Fallout3 min. readNewsTwo Killed, Five Injured in Indiana Shooting—Police3 min. readNewsUK, Canada, Australia Recognize Palestinian State7 min. readU.S.Exclusive: James Talarico on Texas, ‘Nonbinary’ God and Joe Rogan’s Support27 min. readU.S.Students Return to Books as Schools Ban Phones9 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
