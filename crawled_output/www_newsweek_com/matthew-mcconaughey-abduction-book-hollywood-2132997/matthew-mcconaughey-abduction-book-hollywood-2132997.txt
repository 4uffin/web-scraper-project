I've never felt so vulnerable and unable to do anything about it."The actor said that he had managed to wake up before things could have got worse without specifying how he managed to escape.Trump and the TruthA passage in McConaughey's new book Poems & Prayers laments "an epidemic of half-cocked logic and illusions being sold as sound conclusions."When asked if this referred to President Donald Trump, he told The Guardian he had "been around politics and politicians enough to see and hear that the score is not always what they say it is; that they don't keep the score accurately."When the newspaper asked if he was concerned about the president's "disregard for the truth," McConaughey said he was concerned about that, but that there are many things to question over decades and centuries about what the truth was.He said that Trump was going about things in a different way than other politicians. "You can go back and there are many things to question over decades and centuries about what the truth was," he said."Trump's going about things in a different way than other politicians have. It's direct," said McConaughey, "he's cutting out the middleman."He also told The Guardian he had considered joining the world of politics. "It's something I started thinking about six years ago. The reason I'm not diving into it presently is I want to do my best to get three kids out of the house. But I'm fascinated with politics."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting3 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
