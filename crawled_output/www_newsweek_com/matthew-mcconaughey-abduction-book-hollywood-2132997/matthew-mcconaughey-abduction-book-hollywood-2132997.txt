I've never felt so vulnerable and unable to do anything about it."The actor said that he had managed to wake up before things could have got worse without specifying how he managed to escape.Trump and the TruthA passage in McConaughey's new book Poems & Prayers laments "an epidemic of half-cocked logic and illusions being sold as sound conclusions."When asked if this referred to President Donald Trump, he told The Guardian he had "been around politics and politicians enough to see and hear that the score is not always what they say it is; that they don't keep the score accurately."When the newspaper asked if he was concerned about the president's "disregard for the truth," McConaughey said he was concerned about that, but that there are many things to question over decades and centuries about what the truth was.He said that Trump was going about things in a different way than other politicians. "You can go back and there are many things to question over decades and centuries about what the truth was," he said."Trump's going about things in a different way than other politicians have. It's direct," said McConaughey, "he's cutting out the middleman."He also told The Guardian he had considered joining the world of politics. "It's something I started thinking about six years ago. The reason I'm not diving into it presently is I want to do my best to get three kids out of the house. But I'm fascinated with politics."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
