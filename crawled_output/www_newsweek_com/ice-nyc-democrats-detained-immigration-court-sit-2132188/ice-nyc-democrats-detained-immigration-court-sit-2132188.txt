City Comptroller Brad Lander and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams were among several Democratic New York elected officials detained by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents on Thursday during a protest at federal immigration courts in Lower Manhattan.New York State Assemblywoman Jessica Gonz√°lez-Rojas said she was among those officials held after they unfurled a banner and staged a sit-in outside holding cells for immigrants inside 26 Federal Plaza.Thursday was Lander's second time being detained at the facility, following an arrest in June.DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Newsweek in a statement, in part, "Brad Lander's obsession with attacking the brave men and women of law enforcement, physically and rhetorically, must stop NOW. The men and women of ICE put their lives on the line every day to arrest violent criminal illegal aliens to protect and defend the lives of American citizens. This type of rhetoric is contributing to the 1000% surge in assaults of ICE officers through this repeated vilification and demonization of ICE."Comptroller Brad Lander has been released after he and 10 other electeds were detained while observing immigration proceedings at 26 Fed.

Newsweek reached out to DHS for comment via email Thursday evening.Why It Matters26 Federal Plaza has seen large numbers of immigrants detained in recent months, as they appeared for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) check-ins and immigration court hearings.

List of NYC Officials ArrestedLander was arrested alongside several others after demanding access to the lockup and being denied entry.Lander's office said federal agents also arrested state Senators Julia Salazar and Jabari Brisport, both Brooklyn Democrats, along with Assembly members Marcela Mitaynes, Tony Simone, Gonz√°lez-Rojas, Clare Valdez, Robert Carroll, Emily Gallagher and Steven Raga.

Why Brad Lander, Jumaane Williams and Other Officials Were ArrestedGonz√°lez-Rojas said the group's actions were necessary because New York communities were being "terrorized by federal agents." Protesters had gathered outside the federal building, calling for the release of all detained at the facility.Salazar shared updates on her X account, saying that ICE vans had been blocked by those angry at the Trump administration over its immigration enforcement tactics.Happening NOW: New Yorkers Against ICE.¬†We‚Äôre at 26 Federal Plaza, where ICE has been ruthlessly kidnapping immigrant NYers, to demand access to the 10th floor‚Äîwhere people are being inhumanely detained‚Äîand block ICE vans from leaving.¬†#NYvsICE #ICEoutofNY pic.twitter.com/ARqqycN0aM‚Äî NYS Senator Julia Salazar (@SalazarSenate) September 18, 2025
As tensions escalated, officials who had made their way to the 10th floor of the building were detained by DHS officers, but were soon released.Elected officials, mostly Democrats, have clashed with DHS over gaining access to ICE facilities across the country. Officials are supposed to be able to enter buildings to inspect them without notice, but federal officials and ICE detention center staff have denied them on multiple occasions.What Is at 26 Federal Plaza?The building in New York City's Lower Manhattan neighborhood is home to federal government immigration courts and ICE holding facilities, where immigrants are held temporarily before being transferred to a full detention center.Other federal agencies share the building, including the FBI, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service and Social Security Administration.What People Are SayingGonz√°lez-Rojas, in a news release: "Today, I stood in solidarity with elected colleagues, advocates, and faith leaders in the halls of 26 Federal Plaza. The U.S. District Court granted a preliminary injunction that requires improved conditions for detained people at 26 Federal Plaza, ensuring that people are not kept in spaces smaller than 50 square feet per person."We attempted to conduct oversight of the 10th floor to ensure compliance with this preliminary injunction ruling. We put our bodies on the line for the lives and freedom of thousands of New Yorkers who have been illegally kidnapped and detained by ICE. Many of us, myself included, were arrested."New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, on X: "Overcrowded cells. Unsanitary conditions. Limited access to food and water. These are the inhumane conditions that ICE has created at 26 Federal Plaza, which eleven of my elected colleagues sought to inspect today. Instead, they were arrested. They must be released right now."McLaughlin added in her statement to Newsweek, "Another day, another activist politician pulling a stunt in an attempt to get their 15 minutes of fame while endangering DHS personnel and detainees. Here are the facts: Brad Lander showed up to 26 Federal Plaza unannounced with agitators and media and proceeded to obstruct law enforcement and cause a scene. He yelled inside the building that he was 'not leaving' until detainees were 'released.'"What's NextFurther immigration enforcement protests are planned in Manhattan, including on September 25.Clarification 09/18/25, 6:43 p.m.: This article's headline was updated to remove the number of officials detained, pending further details.Clarification 09/18/25, 7:32 p.m.: This article was updated with new information and remarks.
