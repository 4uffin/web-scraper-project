U.S.Supreme CourtTrump administrationBreaking NewsVenezuelaMigrantsDeportationMoreNews ArticleTrump Administration Asks Supreme Court for New Emergency OrderPublishedSep 19, 2025 at 04:24 PM EDTupdatedSep 19, 2025 at 05:06 PM EDTBy Dan Gooding and Gabe WhisnantShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to let it move forward with ending protections for more than 300,000 Venezuelan migrants. The Justice Department is seeking to block a San Francisco judge's ruling that found the administration acted unlawfully when it terminated Temporary Protected Status for the group.A federal appeals court declined to halt U.S. District Judge Edward Chen's decision while the case proceeds.In May, the Supreme Court had already overturned another Chen order affecting about 350,000 Venezuelans, without explanation, as is typical for emergency appeals. Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the justices the earlier ruling should guide them again.Why It MattersThe Trump administration has taken a hardline stance on Temporary Protected Status, arguing that the protections are meant to be temporary but have been abused by consecutive administrations. Immigration advocates have countered, saying that conditions in Venezuela and other countries have not improved enough to send people home.What To KnowFriday's plea by the Trump administration continues a cycle of court orders and challenges around the attempts by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to end TPS for two groups of Venezuelans."This case is familiar to the Court and involves the increasingly familiar anduntenable phenomenon of lower courts disregarding this Court's orders on the emergency docket," the administration wrote in its submission to the Supreme Court.The argument is that Chen's final order in the case rested on the same legal basis that had been stayed by the Supreme Court just months earlier.This back-and-forth has left around 300,000 Venezuelans in limbo, alongside thousands more in a second group also facing the potential loss of their legal status....Under TPS, immigrants from designated countries are allowed to remain in the United States without fear of deportation. They are granted permission to work while in the U.S., and can sometimes travel out of the country.Noem and her predecessors hold the power to grant and revoke TPS per country. Status is renewed every 18 months, and the first Trump administration made similar attempts to revoke it but also faced legal challenges, which continued until President Joe Biden took office in 2021.Part of Noem's reasoning is that conditions in Venezuela have improved significantly, meaning it is safe for immigrants to return home. This has not necessarily aligned with the broader Trump administration's views on the South American nation and its leader, Nicolas Maduro.Trump Admin Moves to Revoke TPS for SyriaAlso on Friday, the DHS moved to revoke TPS for another country: Syria.In a Federal Register notice, the DHS reiterated that conditions had improved in the country, indicating that TPS was no longer necessary. Protections are set to lapse on September 30, 2025.Protections were first introduced in 2012, at the height of the unrest in the Middle East at the time.What People Are SayingThe Trump administration, in its filing to the Supreme Court Friday: "Since the statute was enacted, every administration has designated countries for TPS or extended those designations in extraordinary circumstances. But Secretaries across administrations have also terminated designations when the conditionswere no longer met."Adelys Ferro, co-founder and executive director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, told Newsweek on August 29: "We, more than 8 million Venezuelans, just didn't leave the country just because it's fun, it's because we had no choice...Venezuelans with TPS are not a threat to the United States."What Happens NextThe Supreme Court must now decide whether to take up the appeal.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.Update 9/19/25, 5:06 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
