LifeCharlie kirkParentingSchoolsHigh SchoolTurning Point USAOklahomaNews ArticleState Superintendent Told Schools To Mark Charlie Kirk’s Death—We Said NoPublishedSep 17, 2025 at 07:17 AM EDTBy Alice GibbsSenior Life and Trends ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberAn Oklahoma father has shared why he refused to let his teenage son take part in a statewide moment of silence to honor conservative activist Charlie Kirk this week, describing the directive from State Superintendent Ryan Walters as a "violation" of his family's rights.Kirk, who founded the conservative student group Turning Point USA, was recently killed in an attack that Walters called an act of political violence. In a letter to parents, Walters urged schools to pause at noon on September 16 to reflect on Kirk's legacy, praising him as someone who "empowered the next generation with courage and conviction."Marshall Wayne Thomas, whose 16-year-old son attends Ardmore High School, told Newsweek he was stunned after receiving Walters' email on Monday afternoon."I was really shocked and I was hurt, because I think that Charlie was a rather controversial figure and a lot of people have a lot of mixed reactions," Thomas said. "Being forced to participate in a vigil or something to honor him, I feel really was a violation of our constitutional rights. It wasn't something I wanted my child to be a part of."...Kirk's killing on September 10 during a campus event at Utah Valley has intensified debate over political violence, campus speech and how schools respond to polarizing public figures.Supporters say tributes are an act of respect; critics say state-led commemorations compel students to honor a figure whose politics they may reject.Family pushbackThomas said that he sat down with his son to review Kirk's public statements before making a decision."We looked at some videos and reels on social media, some of the things that he had to say. I listened to my son to hear his opinion, and after we listened to it, he agreed that wasn't something that he really wanted to do, something that he wasn't ready to support," Thomas said. "We agreed it would be beneficial to keep him out of school today."Later that night, Ardmore Public Schools told parents it would not observe Walters' requested remembrance. But Thomas said by then he had already decided to keep his son home. Ardmore Public Schools declined to comment when contacted by Newsweek.Schools decline extra silenceSeveral other districts, including Edmond, Norman, Tulsa, Yukon and Jenks, also declined to add an additional silence, releasing statements saying they already comply with state law requiring a daily one-minute observance at the start of the school day.Edmond Superintendent Josh Delich told families the district "will not be adding an additional moment of silence," citing disruption to the school schedule. Tulsa Public Schools said in a statement it would maintain its regular practice "to minimize disruption to the learning environment."...What Oklahoma law requiresOklahoma law has required all public schools to hold a daily moment of silence since 2002. The statute allows students to reflect, meditate, pray, or sit quietly by individual choice, but prohibits schools from coercing students into any particular activity.The law was designed to create space for voluntary religious expression in schools while staying within constitutional limits....Walters reactsWalters defended his call for an extra remembrance and told Newsweek: "It speaks volumes that the same schools rushing to host pride parades, promote BLM rallies, and strip American flags from students can't spare even a moment of silence for a man who dedicated his life to America, truth, and faith."Charlie Kirk inspired a generation to think for themselves, embrace free speech, and engage in meaningful debate—values that some school districts clearly don't want their students to hear. His brutal murder was an act of political violence, and refusing to honor him reveals just how out of step these districts are with Oklahoma families."Supporters of Kirk praised him for encouraging free speech and conservative activism on campuses. Critics accused him of spreading divisive rhetoric and misinformation.Thomas said he could grieve Kirk's death while rejecting his ideas."I think two things can be true," Thomas said. "You can be grievously sad about what happened to Charlie Kirk and grieve for his wife and for his children, which I do, because I don't advocate violence and I don't advocate for what happened to him, but at the same time, I can't condone the things that he said during his lifetime, and stand behind the rhetoric that he chose to use."Utah prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson, 22, with aggravated murder, felony firearm discharge, obstruction of justice and witness tampering in relation to Kirk's death.They are seeking the death penalty. Robinson appeared via video link for his initial court hearing on Tuesday. His next hearing is scheduled for Sept. 29.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
