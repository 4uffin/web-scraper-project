The video captures the emotional moment the cat is safely brought inside, as the owner says: "You're safe my baby girl!"The owner shared that the cat, named Mochi, was left behind by her previous owners."She's the best cat anyone could ever ask for … I never thought I'd adopt an adult cat, but it's truly been the best part of my year," she wrote. "Mochi, my heart is so full knowing you're part of my life."The emotional journey of this cat rescue resonated with people online, who flooded the comments with a mix of outrage at animal abandonment and praise for the woman's selflessness."People who abandon their animals are vile," one person wrote.

"He now eats twice a day and somewhere warm but not letting me get close." To this, the creator reminded them that the feline will approach when he feels he can trust the person.Another person shared their successful journey: "Well done, girl. When I moved into my house, the last tenants had left their cat outside and never came for it, she was so scared of me to begin with. I persevered and now she's lived with us for three years and is the best thing ever."The video is a reminder of the resilience of animals and the immense capacity for love in a dedicated human.
