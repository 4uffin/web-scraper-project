To this, the creator reminded them that the feline will approach when he feels he can trust the person.Another person shared their successful journey: "Well done, girl. When I moved into my house, the last tenants had left their cat outside and never came for it, she was so scared of me to begin with. I persevered and now she's lived with us for three years and is the best thing ever."The video is a reminder of the resilience of animals and the immense capacity for love in a dedicated human.
