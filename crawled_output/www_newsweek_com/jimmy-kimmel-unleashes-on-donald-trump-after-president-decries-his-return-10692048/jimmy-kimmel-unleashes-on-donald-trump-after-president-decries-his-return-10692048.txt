NewsDonald TrumpJimmy KimmelJimmy Kimmel Live!ABCNews ArticleJimmy Kimmel Unleashes on Donald Trump After President Decries His ReturnPublishedSep 25, 2025 at 06:07 AM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 08:38 AM EDTBy Alia ShoaibNews ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberJimmy Kimmel fired back at Donald Trump last night after the President complained about the late-night host’s return to air following a brief suspension over his comments about Charlie Kirk’s killing.Trump had taken to Truth Social to criticize ABC’s decision hours after Kimmel returned on Tuesday's comeback show, writing: "I can’t believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was canceled!"On Wednesday night’s episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the host hit back: "You can’t believe they gave me my job back? I can’t believe we gave you your job back." ...Why It MattersKimmel’s show was pulled off air after controversy over his comments in the wake of Kirk’s killing.The nearly weeklong suspension prompted widespread criticism and sparked national debates over free speech and political pressure on the media.ABC reinstated the show on Tuesday, but Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar, which own several ABC affiliates, opted not to air it on their channels.What To KnowTrump posted a lengthy message on Truth Social in which he decried Kimmel’s return to television and made jabs about his talent and ratings.The president wrote: "Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who’s not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99 percent positive Democrat GARBAGE."Kimmel responded by poking fun at the president’s own low approval ratings, flashing on the screen four different pollsters showing his ratings to be 55 or 56 percent unfavorable.The late-night host also noted the former president’s apparent veiled threat to sue ABC, pointing to Trump's reference to his previous $16 million defamation settlement against the network.Trump wrote in his post that Kimmel "is yet another arm of the DNC and, to the best of my knowledge, that would be a major Illegal Campaign Contribution. I think we’re going to test ABC out on this. Let’s see how we do. Last time I went after them, they gave me $16 Million Dollars. This one sounds even more lucrative."The president was referencing a lawsuit he’d filed in 2024 against ABC host George Stephanopoulos, which the network agreed to settle."Only Donald Trump would try to prove that he wasn’t threatening ABC by threatening ABC," Kimmel retorted.What People Are SayingJimmy Kimmel said on his show on Wednesday night: "There are still a lot of people who think I should be pulled off the air for making fun of Donald Trump. So I want to explain—I talk about Trump more than anything because he’s a bully. I don’t like bullies."What Happens NextIt remains to be seen whether the president will pursue any action against ABC over Kimmel’s return, or if Sinclair and Nexstar will choose to resume airing the show.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
