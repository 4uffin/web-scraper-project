U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, appointed in 2023 by former Democratic President Joe Biden, ruled that although the watchdogs’ firings may have violated the Inspector General Act, they failed to demonstrate “irreparable harm” sufficient to warrant reinstatement while litigation proceeds.Reyes noted that even if she granted their reinstatement, Trump could legally remove them again after 30 days, as long as he submits notice and a rationale to Congress as required by statute. Still, the judge strongly admonished the administration, writing, “President Trump violated the IGA. That much is obvious.”...Why It MattersInspectors general serve as independent overseers inside federal agencies, auditing programs and investigating misconduct, fraud or abuse. Their ability to operate without political interference is considered a bedrock of government accountability. The mass firings — 17 IGs were terminated Jan. 24, with the eight plaintiffs among them — sparked immediate concern from congressional Democrats and watchdog groups that the move amounted to a purge of oversight. The firings also tested the strength of new protections passed by Congress in 2022, which require presidents to provide a “substantive rationale” and 30-day advance notice before removing IGs — rules critics say the Trump administration ignored.The case also implicates broader battles over independence within the federal bureaucracy. In related disputes, the Supreme Court recently allowed Trump to remove an FTC commissioner pending review, a test of limits on executive removal powers. What to KnowThe eight former watchdogs sought a court order reinstating them immediately, along with back pay, arguing the abrupt dismissals violated their statutory and constitutional rights. The Justice Department contended that presidents have broad authority to remove inspectors general without cause and need not wait 30 days after providing notice to Congress. During earlier hearings, Judge Reyes had pressed DOJ counsel over whether the administration complied with statutory notice requirements; DOJ agreed it did not, but argued those provisions were not binding. Reyes’s order calls on the Department of Justice to explain how the apparent violations occurred and to detail steps to avoid future violations. She warned that further noncompliance could lead to sanctions: “personal financial penalties, contempt of court findings, or relief specific to the prosecution of this matter.” Reinstatement was denied in part because Reyes found no immediate threat to agency functions or to plaintiffs that would demand extraordinary judicial relief. What People Are SayingReyes said in her ruling, "The Court recognizes Plaintiffs' exceptional service as IGs, marked by decades of distinguished leadership across multiple administrations. They sacrificed much to take on the role of an IG and its many demands — no doubt including substantial time away from family and far larger paychecks available in the private sector. They deserved better from their government. They still do. Unfortunately, this Court cannot provide Plaintiffs more."Sidney Powell, Trump's former lawyer, wrote in a January 25 on X: "Existing IGs are virtually worthless. They may bring a few minor things to light but accomplish next to nothing. The whole system needs to be revamped. They are toothless and protect the institution instead of the citizens."What Happens NextThe lawsuit will proceed on its merits, with the court eventually addressing whether the IG removals violated statute or constitutional protections. Passage of the 2022 Securing Inspector General Independence Act gives new legal footing to the plaintiffs’ arguments and sets up a potentially consequential review of executive power over watchdog offices. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is advancing nominations for replacement IGs in several agencies. Updates: 9/24/25, 6:55 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.
