NewsBreaking NewsEarthquakeJapanNews ArticleTwo Earthquakes Rattle Southern Japan Today: What To KnowPublishedSep 17, 2025 at 10:32 AM EDTupdatedSep 17, 2025 at 04:45 PM EDTBy Hollie Silverman and John FengShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe United States Geological Survey (USGS) has published a map showing where two strong earthquakes shook southern Japan Wednesday.Newsweek reached out to the USGS by email Wednesday for more information.Why It MattersThe area where the quakes struck is a very active seismic region, with thousands of earthquakes being recorded in just a month's time this summer.In July, a 8.8 earthquake struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, prompting tsunami warnings up and down the West Coast of the U.S.Emergency evacuations took place in Hawaii, but the waves did not produce significant damage.Earthquakes Strike Japan: USGSWednesday's quakes were both measured at 4.9 magnitude. They struck around 105 kilometers, about 65 miles, from land in the East China Sea around the Tokara Islands at a depth of 10 kilometers, according to the USGS report.They struck about five minutes apart, according to the data from USGS. No damage or injuries have been reported, and no tsunami warnings have been issued.Related StoriesTeen Found Dead in a Creek 14 Years Ago, Police Say Man Just Confessed3 min. readGreen Card Update: State Department Proposes Major Change to Applications3 min. readSupplements: Cocoa Extract May Reduce Risk of Cardiovascular Disease4 min. readBoth quakes struck in the East China Sea off the coast of the Tokara Islands at a magnitude , according to USGS.Shallow earthquakes can be more dangerous because when energy is released close to the surface, more intense shaking can occur, leading to a higher potential for damage and destruction than earthquakes at greater depths.The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quakes measured lower 5 on the Japanese seismic scale of 7 in Toshima, Kagoshima Prefecture, Nippon.com reported."A lower 5 is defined by the agency as a situation in which many people would be frightened and feel the need to hold onto something stable, while dishes and books on the shelves may fall," the report explained.Where Was the Epicenter of Both Japan Earthquakes?The location of the quakes is off of the Tokara Islands, a remote archipelago in southern Japan which is known for its seismic activity.It sits above the Philippine Sea Plate Subduction under the Eurasian Plate, leading to frequent earthquakes.From June to July, the region recorded over 2,000 earthquakes, according to a report from Nippon.com."From June 21 through the afternoon of July 18, there were 2,171 earthquakes with a seismic intensity of 1 or more, the report said, adding, "July 3 saw the largest tremors, including one of level 6 lower on the seismic intensity scale recorded among a series of quakes from 4:13 in the afternoon on the island of Akusekijima."What People Are SayingAlan Yong, USGS US-Japan Coordinator for Earthquake Studies told Newsweek in an email Wednesday: "The archipelago of Japan is a very seismically active region. Earthquakes of magnitude 4 are common there. The M4.9 earthquakes on September 17th were located near the Ryukyu and Nankai Trenches, an area where much larger quakes can occur, such as rarer magnitude 8 quakes in 1910, 1920, 1944, and 1946."The International Federation of Red Cross said in a post on its website: "The seismic activity has been very active around the area since the end of June and a magnitude 5.5 (in the Japanese intensity scare level 6 lower) earthquake struck near the Tokara Islands in Kagoshima Prefecture at 4:13 p.m. on 3 July 2025."So far there has been no report of casualties. About 700 people live on the 12 Tokara islands, and some of the residents have been evacuating voluntarily to the mainland."What Happens NextScientists will continue to monitor for earthquakes in the region while emergency agencies will respond as needed.This is a breaking news story.
