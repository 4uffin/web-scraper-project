The first slide is a video, where O'Keefe films law enforcement officers. In the video, he says, "You're gonna arrest the one Black dude on the train, because this white woman said she didn't like the way I was sitting on the train."In the video, he films a woman whom he points at. The woman is elderly and wearing a face mask."You call the police to arrest the one Black dude on the train," he says in the video, adding, "I haven't done anything illegal."In the caption of the Instagram post, he wrote, "An old white woman got on the train and immediately pointed at me and told me to correct how I was sitting. I refused, so she went to the conductor and complained. The conductor called the police and stopped the train," he said.O'Keefe also says in the caption that the friend of the woman who called the police had said to him, "You're not the minority anymore."A separate video about the incident has been uploaded by the user, Nalae, on TikTok, where it has quickly gone viral, having been viewed over 160,000 times as of reporting.What People Are SayingAlex O'Keefe, the writer, in his Instagram caption: "The police told me to leave the train, I refused and asked what was I doing illegally. They said I was disturbing the peace by not leaving the train. They pulled me off the train and arrested me without even talking to the Karen who reported the one black person on the train. On the platform, the police detained me and interrogated me. Only black folks stayed nearby and recorded the arrest. When I demanded a lawyer and reminded them they didn't even take a statement from the woman who complained they eventually released me. This country is growing more psycho by the day. What will you do about it?"Eliana Chinea, a journalist, commented on O'Keefe's Instagram post: "That's horrible. I'm so sorry you went through this. I hope you have a good lawyer who will sue because this can't go unchecked!"Kari Ferrell, an Instagram user with over 100,000 followers, commented on O'Keefe's Instagram post: "Alex, we stand with you! @govkathyhochul @nycmayor @mta CONTROL YOUR GOONS!Anna Morgan, a DJ, commented on O'Keefe's Instagram post: "Really hope you sue that lady, the conductor, each one of those officers and the precinct. Make them pay this is insane."What's NextMTA have not publicly responded to the incident as of the time of this reporting.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
