Kim, in a major address before the country's rubber-stamp parliament on Saturday, reiterated his pledge never to give up these United Nations-sanctioned programs, citing "severe" threats to security posed by the U.S.-led alliance.Newsweek reached out to the North Korean embassy in Beijing, China, by email with a request for comment....What To KnowA satellite photo captured September 21 by one of the European Space Agency''s Sentinel-2 satellite shows increased activity at the staging grounds for the celebration near Mirim Airport, a few miles east of the North Korean capital Pyongyang.Korean People's Army personnel are visible in columns during a rehearsal, as well as military vehicles and equipment, according to a South Korean official speaking to Yonhap News Agency on condition of anonymity. Among the assets identified were transporter erector launchers, used to fire intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) such as the Hwasong-19, believed to be capable of reaching the continental U.S.It will be the first gala marking the party's founding since the 75th anniversary in 2020.
