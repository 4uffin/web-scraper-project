It is more an ideology than a formal organization, though some adherents have adopted militant tactics.Responding to a question regarding holding antifa "accountable," Leavitt said, in part, "This is something the president campaigned on because we have seen a rise in violence perpetuated by antifa radical people across this country who subscribe to this group."Loading twitter content...The press secretary listed several violent incidents involving alleged antifa members, calling the group and left-wing groups a "serious threat to American safety."She added, "We will be most importantly looking at who is funding antifa and who is funding these other violent left-wing groups."Later Monday, Trump signed an executive order declaring antifa as a domestic terror organization."The president intends to sign that executive order as soon as it's drafted, as soon as later this afternoon.Why It MattersTrump's announcement of a terrorist designation for the antifa movement comes amid heated debate over the motive in the September 10 killing of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, which the president blamed on "fanatical leftists."Utah investigators said they discovered a bullet casing from the fatal shooting inscribed, "hey fascist, catch!"What to KnowKirk's murder and subsequent reaction from individuals across the political spectrum and media sphere have sparked a conversation about political rhetoric and free speech. On Tuesday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that threats of violence are federal crimes under the U.S. Constitution, as part of a governmental crackdown on so-called hate speech.Meanwhile, the Department of Justice appears to have deleted a study which documented the frequency of far-right violence in the U.S. from its website.The document said that "far-right extremists have committed far more ideologically motivated homicides than far-left or radical Islamist extremists," since 1990. It said that this includes 227 events that took more than 520 lives and said that far-left extremists committed 42 ideologically motivated attacks, which took 78 lives.Trump, on a state visit to the United Kingdom last week, announced the antifa move in a social media post, He called antifa a "SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER" and said he would "strongly recommend" investigations into its funders.Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that he would pursue a domestic terrorism designation for antifa if Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Cabinet officials supported the move....Because antifa is a domestic movement, it does not qualify for the State Department's list of foreign terrorist organizations, which includes groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaida. That designation allows the Justice Department to prosecute those who provide material support to foreign groups, even when the aid does not directly result in violence.No comparable list exists for U.S.-based groups, in part because of broad First Amendment protections. Despite repeated calls, especially after mass shootings by white supremacists, Congress has never enacted a domestic terrorism law.In July 2019, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, introduced a Senate resolution condemning antifa's violent acts and urging its designation as a domestic terrorist organization.The following year, amid nationwide protests over George Floyd's killing, Trump again floated the idea of labeling antifa a terror group. But then-FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that antifa is an ideology rather than an organization, lacking the structure typically required for such a designation.What Happens NextIt remains unclear how the administration could designate what is essentially a decentralized movement as a terrorist organization.Updates: 9/22/25, 2:24 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Updates: 9/22/25, 2:48 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information.Updates: 9/22/25, 7:35 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
