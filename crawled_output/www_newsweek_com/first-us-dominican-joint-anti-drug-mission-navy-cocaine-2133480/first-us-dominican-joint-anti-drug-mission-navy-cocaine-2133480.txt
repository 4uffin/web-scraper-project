According to White House officials, this flotilla has destroyed three speedboats carrying drugs in separate operations, resulting in more than a dozen deaths aboard the intercepted vessels.The administration has linked at least two of the destroyed boats to Venezuela, whose President Nicolás Maduro is frequently characterized by U.S. officials as leading what they call the "Cartel of the Suns." The current operation represents the first confirmed recovery of drug cargo following a vessel destruction, providing tangible evidence of the mission's stated objectives.Human rights organizations have raised concerns about the strikes, characterizing them as extrajudicial killings. On Friday, two Democratic senators introduced a congressional resolution seeking to halt further military strikes against drug trafficking vessels.What People Are SayingDominican Republic's National Directorate for Drug Control: "This is the first time in history that the United States and the Dominican Republic carry out a joint operation against narco terrorism in the Caribbean."President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social on Friday: "On my Orders, the Secretary of War ordered a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization conducting narcotrafficking in the USSOUTHCOM area of responsibility."He added: "Intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics, and was transiting along a known narcotrafficking passage enroute to poison Americans. The strike killed 3 male narcoterrorists aboard the vessel, which was in international waters. No U.S. Forces were harmed in this strike. STOP SELLING FENTANYL, NARCOTICS, AND ILLEGAL DRUGS IN AMERICA, AND COMMITTING VIOLENCE AND TERRORISM AGAINST AMERICANS!!!"...What Happens Next?The congressional resolution introduced by Democratic senators will require legislative review and potential voting to determine whether military strikes against drug trafficking boats should continue.Meanwhile, the Trump administration appears committed to expanding the Caribbean anti-narcotics mission.Reporting from the Associated Press contributed to this article.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
