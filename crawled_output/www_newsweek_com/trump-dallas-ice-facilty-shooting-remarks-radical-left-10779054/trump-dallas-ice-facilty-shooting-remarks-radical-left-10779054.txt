PoliticsBreaking NewsDallasICEDonald TrumpFBIDepartment of Homeland SecurityNews ArticleTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting PublishedSep 25, 2025 at 12:28 PM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 07:40 PM EDTBy Gabe WhisnantBreaking News EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberPresident Donald Trump again blamed the "radical left" and warned that "it's going to get worse" after Wednesday's fatal shooting at a Dallas ICE facility.Joshua Jahn, 29, the gunman who opened fire at a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, killed one detainee and critically injured two others. He left a note saying he hoped the attack would “give ICE agents real terror,” FBI Director Kash Patel said Thursday.Patel shared the detail in a post on X, offering the first indication of a motive for Wednesday’s shooting, which struck an ICE van carrying detainees at the building’s gated entryway. No ICE personnel were hurt.The Dallas shooting was the latest in a string of high-profile attacks, coming two weeks after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot by a rooftop gunman at Utah Valley University. It also unfolded amid heightened immigration enforcement that has fueled backlash against ICE agents and fear within immigrant communities.Trump Reacts to Dallas ICE Shooting: What We Know In response to a question about the incident, Trump told reporters Thursday during a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, "The radical left is causing the problem ... It's going to get worse and ultimately, it's going to go back on them. Bad things happen when they play these games. I'll give you a little clue, the right is a lot tougher than the left and the right is not doing this. And they better not get them energized because it won’t be good for the left."Loading twitter content...When reached for comment by Newsweek via email, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, “As President Trump correctly pointed out, the right is not committing the heinous acts of targeted violence that the left is. President Trump has already taken bold action to address the scourge of left-wing violence in America by designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, and he will continue with his efforts to stop radical leftists from terrorizing American communities.” On Wednesday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he had been briefed on the Dallas ICE facility shooting and condemned it as “despicable,” pointing out that the suspected shooter had marked shell casings with “ANTI-ICE.” He blamed the attack on “Radical Left Democrats,” charging that their rhetoric demonizing law enforcement—and ICE in particular—was fueling violence. He also warned that “continuing violence from Radical Left Terrorists” must stop, while pledging to use executive powers to dismantle domestic terror networks.Who was shooting suspect Joshua Jahn?The assailant, who authorities said fired indiscriminately from a rooftop, carried out a “high degree of pre-attack planning,” Patel said. Agents searching a Dallas-area home seized electronic devices, handwritten notes and other evidence, he added.“One of the handwritten notes recovered read, ‘Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?’” Patel wrote, quoting an apparent abbreviation for armor-piercing bullets.The gunman, who took his own life during the shooting, had downloaded a document titled “Dallas County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management” that listed Homeland Security facilities, Patel said. In the hours before the shooting, he searched online for ballistics information and video of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination at a Utah university earlier this month. Patel said the man had also searched last month for apps that track the presence of ICE agents.On Wednesday, FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo on social media of a bullet recovered at the scene with “ANTI-ICE” scrawled on it. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has since ordered increased security at ICE facilities nationwide, the department said on X....Hours after the shooting, FBI agents converged on a house in suburban Fairview, Texas, that public records link to Joshua Jahn. The home, located on a quiet cul-de-sac of brick houses, was cordoned off by a police vehicle as agents in FBI jackets searched the front yard.Former friends of the alleged gunman say he was not interested in politics, according to a report.A spokesperson for Collin College in nearby McKinney said Jahn attended classes there “at various times” between 2013 and 2018. In late 2017, he traveled cross-country to Washington state, where he worked several months at a legal cannabis farm, owner Ryan Sanderson said.“He’s a young kid, a thousand miles from home, didn’t really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age,” Sanderson told the AP.Updates: 9/25/25, 1:18 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.
