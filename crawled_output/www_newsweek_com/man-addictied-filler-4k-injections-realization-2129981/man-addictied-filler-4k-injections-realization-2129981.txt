Beauty and FashionViralTrendsTikTokTrendingBeautyCosmeticsNews ArticleI Was Addicted to Filler and Spent $4K on Injections—Then I Had RealizationPublishedSep 20, 2025 at 06:30 AM EDTBy Alice GibbsSenior Life and Trends ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA British man who once spent thousands on extreme lip and facial fillers has shared why he decided to have it removed, and the dangers of the pull of cosmetic treatments.In shocking before-and-after photos, 25-year-old Christopher Sharratt from Staffordshire showed how years of injections left him with enlarged lips and facial swelling before he underwent four rounds of dissolver to return to a natural look.Sharratt had his first filler injections at age 17 after lying about his age, and after the first treatments, it quickly escalated and he estimates spending around £3,500 ($4,400) on fillers."The amount of money I spent on that is like half a house deposit, for God's sake," Sharratt told Newsweek....The results were addictive, he explained, because of the swelling that follows injections. "You have a mil [millimeter] and your lips swell up or wherever you have it on your face. And you're like, oh my God, this swelling looks so good. And a week later, the swelling goes down and you're like, oh c***, I need to go and get another mil," he said.Dr. Cali Estes, psychologist and celebrity addiction specialist, told Newsweek: "Fillers aren't chemically addictive, but psychologically they can be. Each injection gives an instant confidence boost, and the brain starts chasing that dopamine hit again—just like checking likes on social media."Often after starting to use filler, people lose sight of the changes and look for more results. Estes explained this is what she calls "aesthetic blindness."Related StoriesMRI of 33-Year-Old Woman’s Face Shows Exactly Where Her Filler Ended Up3 min. read"The brain recalibrates so quickly that what once looked dramatic now feels normal. They stop seeing the enhancements and keep chasing more," she said.For Sharratt, his turning point came during the COVID-19 lockdown, when he could not access treatments. "I looked at my photos of myself for the first time... and I was like, oh I actually didn't look that bad. I should have been a bit nicer to myself," Sharratt said, reflecting on his realization.Dissolving the fillers was both painful and time-consuming. "I had four rounds of dissolver because I had so much filler in my lip. Cheeks and jaw were easy to get rid of, but I actually had to start pulling my lips out and putting it in the back because there was nowhere else to fill out," he said. "It did take four whole rounds of dissolving to get rid of it."Push for stricter regulationSharratt said his experience highlighted how little oversight exists in Britain. Fillers are often administered in salons without medical supervision. "There needs to be so much more regulation in place," he said. "No 17-year-old should be going to get fillers. Nobody."In the United States, dermal fillers are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which approves them only for adults and in specific cosmetic uses.There are no federal laws on minimum age for fillers, but many providers set a minimum age of 18, and some filler products are only FDA-cleared for patients 21 and older.Rules on who can administer injections vary by state, but in general only licensed medical professionals—including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and, in some cases, dentists—are permitted to perform the procedures, often with requirements for additional training or physician supervision....Sharratt said patients are rarely informed about long-term risks. "Nobody tells you the fact that it doesn't dissolve... It doesn't, it moves around your face," he said. "You don't get told that if you overstretch your lips... parts of your face can actually remain stretched.""Fillers are often treated like beauty services, but they carry medical risks—including blindness. For those with body dysmorphia or addictive patterns, the lack of safeguards is dangerous," Estes said. "We need stronger psychological screening and ethical limits to protect people—not just from physical harm, but from themselves."Now filler-free, Sharratt feels more approachable and more confident in everyday life. "More people come up to me now than ever. People wouldn't come up and say hello," he said.He hopes his story will raise awareness about the risks of cosmetic procedures and push for tighter rules. "Hopefully I can be one of the few people to put their hand up, say I've made a mistake, we need to do something about this," he said....Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
