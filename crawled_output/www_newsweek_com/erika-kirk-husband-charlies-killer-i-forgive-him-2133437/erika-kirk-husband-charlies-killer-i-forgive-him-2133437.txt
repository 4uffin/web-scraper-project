Erika Kirk, the widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk who was assassinated earlier this month, told a crowd of thousands during a packed memorial in Glendale, Arizona, for her late husband that she has forgiven his shooter."I forgive him," Kirk said through tears, adding after cheers rang out from the crowd, "I forgive him because it was what Christ did, and it is what Charlie would do."While talking about her late husband, she said part of his mission was to "save young men just like the one who took his life."Kirk said she will be taking over as the CEO of Turning Point USA and plans to continue campus events including debates and dialogue.Why It MattersCharlie Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University (UVU) on September 10. His death has rattled the American political landscape and intensified national conversations around political violence and the safety of prominent public figures.Officials, including President Donald Trump, have called for swift and severe penalties for those responsible.Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in Kirk's assassination, remains in custody, and has been charged with multiple felonies, including aggravated murder. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray announced last week that the state will seek the death penalty.

What To KnowErika addressed thousands of mourners gathered at State Farm Stadium on Sunday to honor her late husband.During her speech, she reflected on Charlie's mission to guide young people, including those struggling or at risk, saying, "He wanted them to have a better life and a better path."She drew parallels between her act of forgiveness and the teachings of Jesus Christ, citing His words from the cross, "My husband, Charlie. He wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life. That young man. That young man on the cross. Our Savior said, 'Father, forgive them, for they not know what they do.' That man. That young man. I forgive him."She continued: "I forgive him because it was what Christ did and it is what Charlie would do. The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the gospel is love and always love. Love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us."In addition to her message of forgiveness, Erika announced her intention to lead Turning Point USA as its new CEO."His passion was my passion, and now his mission is my mission. Everything that Turning Point USA built for Charlie's mission and hard work, we will make ten times greater through the power of his memory."What Happens Next?During her speech on Sunday, Erika pledged to expand Turning Point USA's national outreach, grow its campus presence, and continue its advocacy for freedom of speech.The organization has announced plans to create thousands of new chapters and cultivating new partnerships with pastors and congregations.Meanwhile, law enforcement officials have said the investigation into Kirk's assassination is ongoing.Update 9/21/25, 7 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with more information.
