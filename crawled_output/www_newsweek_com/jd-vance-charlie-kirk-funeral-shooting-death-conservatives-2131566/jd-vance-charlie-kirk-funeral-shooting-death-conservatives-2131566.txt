Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said his office will seek the death penalty in response....Vance said in a post on X, "To my friends on the political Right: I understand the feeling that people are putting words into Charlie Kirk's mouth. At some level, I agree and share your frustration.Try to remember: a lot of people loved Charlie. It is natural for them to debate his views and his legacy. In fact, I think Charlie would welcome that.But for now, let's celebrate our friend, remember his impact, and save the debate for after his funeral."Newsweek has reached out to Vance's office and the White House via email on Wednesday afternoon for additional comment.Carlson, Greene dispute Netanyahu's portrayal of Kirk's legacyOn Wednesday, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, posted a screenshot of recent text messages she received from Kirk several weeks before he was assassinated.Greene revealed the text amid an ongoing debate over Kirk's relationship and stance toward Israel's leaders, many of whom sent messages in support of him."Charlie Kirk invited me to speak at Amfest a few weeks ago before he was martyred," Greene wrote in her post that attached a screenshot of the reported texts.She added that this invitation came after she called for American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act and publicly stated that "the nuclear armed secular government of Israel was committing genocide in Gaza and killing innocent children, Christians, and people."Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of exploiting Kirk's death, saying Tuesday that Netanyahu attempted to "hijack Charlie's memory" for political purposes."A lion-hearted friend of Israel, he fought the lies and stood tall for Judeo-Christian civilization," Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu wrote on X. "I spoke to him only two weeks ago and invited him to Israel. Sadly, that visit will not take place," he added.Speaking on his podcast, Carlson said Kirk "did not like Bibi Netanyahu" and was "appalled by what was happening in Gaza," despite his support for Israel. Carlson called Netanyahu's response to Kirk's killing "ghoulish" and "repulsive," and alleged that the late Turning Point USA founder viewed the Israeli leader as a destructive force who misused U.S. support for his own wars.Carlson said, "Charlie didn't hate Jews. He loved Jews ... He loved the state of Israel ... He did not like Bibi Netanyahu. He said that to me many times. He said to people around him many times, he felt that Bibi Netanyahu was a very destructive force."Loading twitter content...Carlson also claimed Kirk faced heavy donor pressure after inviting him to a Turning Point conference, saying Kirk lost a $2 million donation just two days before his assassination because of that decision."Two days before he died, he lost a $2 million donation because he had publicly pledged to bring me to the next Turning Point conference in December," adding that Netanyahu's allies sought to punish him for giving Carlson a platform.Carlson concluded by labeling Netanyahu "number one" among "liars" seeking to distort Kirk's legacy, while former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida backed his account, saying he had "personal knowledge" that Carlson's claims were accurate.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas posted on X on Wednesday, "I'm getting really tired of Tucker & his cronies falsely claiming, "Charlie agreed with me that Israel is terrible & the problem in America is all the damn Jews....""I knew Charlie well & indeed the very last conversation we had was how deeply concerned he was about the rising, toxic wave of antisemitism on the right."Update: 9/17/25, 5:23 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
