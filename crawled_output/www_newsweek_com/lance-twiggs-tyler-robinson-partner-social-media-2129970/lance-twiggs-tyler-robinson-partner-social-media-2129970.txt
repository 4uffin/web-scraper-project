When Robinson surrendered to authorities, liberals focused on his family's conservative background as evidence that Trump may have been wrong.Kirk was an opponent of transgender rights advocates and was discussing transgender mass shootings when he was fatally shot.What To KnowThe last post on the Facebook account for Lance Twiggs is dated 27.12.23.

One shows a person holding a toad, with filter effects including lightning and fire. Another video shows filming a bathroom, with the text overlay "It's still worter theory."Another video shows Twiggs wearing a hat and headphones, eating something, and the clip then cuts to a person looking down at an animal before cutting to a clip of another animal, and then a person skateboarding, then a person holding up their hands, then two dogs.In another video, Twiggs appears to be seen wearing a yellow hat with ears opening a cookie tin. In another video, Twiggs puts spaghetti on a sandwich.The content indicates little about their lives, and Robinson does not appear.In the reposts section of the account, it is shown that Twiggs reposted a video about Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shortly after the election. "Rfk Jr's brain worm telling him to outlaw soda and replace it with battery acid to combat adhd and autism." The post references Kennedy's previous disclosure of a brain worm.What People Are SayingFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, asked on The Megyn Kelly Show if Lance Twiggs is the name of Robinson's boyfriend: "That is the boyfriend's name."Fom the information we've accumulated, both forensically and digitally, in the comms between the two and some of the statements from family and friends that there was a relationship here that may have been beyond platonic. I think we have a good body of information at this point indicating that."Utah Governor Spencer Cox, on Meet the Press: "According to family and people that we're interviewing, he does come from a conservative family. But his ideology was very different than his family, and so that's part of it. We do know that the roommate that we had originally talked about, we can confirm that that roommate is a boyfriend who is transitioning from male to female. So we know that piece. I will say that that person has been very cooperative with authorities."President Donald Trump, in a video posted on Truth Social on Wednesday: "For years those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals. This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop."What Happens NextProsecutors in Utah County are expected to file formal charges on Tuesday. Robinson is expected to attend an initial court appearance.Investigators have said they will disclose more forensic findings and interview results as the case proceeds.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
