Rescue and AdoptionViralTrendsAnimalsCatsRescueAnimal RescueMoreNews ArticleFace of Tiny Kitten Thrown Out of Moving Car Sparks Fury: ‘I Hate People’PublishedSep 21, 2025 at 05:30 AM EDTBy Alice GibbsSenior Life and Trends ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA late-night jog turned into an animal rescue mission when a Kentucky man witnessed a kitten being thrown from a moving vehicle at around 11:30 p.m.Christopher, who asked not to share his surname, said he was running along a familiar route about 2.5 miles from his home when a car sped past him before briefly stopping. "I saw a large arm flick something out the window like you'd do emptying a cup," he told Newsweek. "The arm went back inside like they had more, but then they tore out faster than before. My guess is they saw me. I'm not sure."Moments later, he heard the faint cries of a kitten."I scooped it up and used my watch to call my wife first to let her know I was bringing it home," Christopher said. "Then I called the Richmond Police non-emergency number to report what I saw and gave them the partial plate."...Police took the report, but Christopher said officers told him there was little they could do without more information. "It's probably the sad truth that I doomed the rest of the litter being there and scared them off," he said. "There's zero reason to think they didn't dump the rest elsewhere."At home, Christopher and his wife Kathleen cared for the kitten, giving her wet cat food and lactose-free milk. "It wasn't interested, which gave me a hint at its age," he explained. Early the next morning, Kathleen purchased kitten formula and a bottle from a local Walmart. "She devoured it," Christopher said.The couple have been lifelong cat owners. They lost their 22-year-old cat in January and were already caring for another pet facing health challenges. "We couldn't keep her, but we wanted to make sure she had a chance," Christopher said.A veterinary check revealed minor matting and a sore on the kitten's leg, but otherwise she was in good health. With local shelters unable to take in strays due to restrictions, the couple connected with One Stray At A Time, a rescue group about 50 miles away, agreed to take the kitten."They told me she's eating like a monster—and that's half the battle," Christopher said. "It was a relief to know she's in good hands."Shelter System Under PressureChristopher's struggle to secure immediate shelter care reflects broader trends in community cat programs and stray cat rescue efforts in Kentucky.In Campbell County, data from the county's own animal services shows that by 2022, 440 cats were returned to the field (after being spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and ear-tipped), which represented about 78 percent of all cat intakes that year.The Kentucky Humane Society, one of the state's largest animal welfare organizations, reported a 96 percent live-save rate in 2023 for animals entering its care. This follows a wider national trend as U.S. animal shelters are closer than ever to achieving "no-kill" status. Advocates say that success reflects the value of large-scale community programs, but caution that it doesn't solve every problem.Despite this, many county shelters prioritize high-volume intake and owner surrenders, and some, like Madison County, do not accept individual stray cats unless surrendered by an owner. That leaves rescues and smaller nonprofits to fill the gap for cases like Christopher's, where a vulnerable kitten requires immediate, hands-on care.Community ResponseChristopher shared his story on Reddit, hoping to find someone willing to adopt the kitten. In the post he shared his frustration that someone would do this with a kitten, writing: "I hate people."While most offers of help came from too far away to be practical, he said the overwhelming response was heartwarming."I'm glad at the reaction because it shows people still have common issues they can rally around," he said. "We can all get behind not abusing a helpless animal."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesPoliticsDemocrats React to Jimmy Kimmel’s Return from Suspension3 min. readPoliticsDonald Trump Tells Pregnant Women to ‘Tough it Out,’ Avoid Tylenol4 min. readPoliticsWhat We Know and Don’t Know About Trump’s H-1B Crackdown7 min. readPoliticsMap Shows Health Care H-1B Visas by State as Trump Floats Fee Exemption6 min. readPoliticsWhite House Shares Update on Antifa Crackdown as Trump Order Nears4 min. readPoliticsTrump Admin Vows to ‘Defend Every Inch of NATO’ After Russian Violations3 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
