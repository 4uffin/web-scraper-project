This study adds to mounting research on the benefits of 3D-printed materials. The main ingredient found in glass—silica, which comes from sand—means it can exist in liquid form and be 3D printed into a variety of shapes, including the exact structure of a missing section of bone. However, the study authors wrote in the paper: “3D printing of ceramics or glass typically requires sacrificial organic plasticizers and high-temperature sintering, which is time- and cost-consuming, potentially cytotoxic [damaging to living cells] and may compromise the bioactivity and functionality of the inorganic components [ceramic/glass].”...With this in mind, the researchers set out to combat the need for toxic chemicals or glass to be fused at temperatures (typically) higher than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. To do this, they combined oppositely charged silica particles and calcium and phosphate ions to form a printable, bio-active glass gel.After being shaped with a 3D printer, the glass was hardened into its final shape in a furnace at a “relatively cool” 1,300 F—and all through an additive-free process.The team then tested the new bio-glass against a 3D-printed plain silica glass gel and an available dental bone substitute by repairing skull damage in living rabbits. Insights gained from cross-scale analysis of structural and mechanical features allowed them to develop robust “colloidal gels without compromising the self-healing ability.” Colloidal gels are soft materials typically found in cosmetics and building materials. “We further demonstrated the excellent printability, shape-fidelity and reprocessability of the inorganic gels,” the authors added.Although the existing commercial product was found to grow bone faster, the bio-glass sustained growth longer, according to the team. After eight weeks, most bone cells present had grown on the bio-glass structure.The plain glass, however, had barely any bone cell growth. “This ‘green’ inorganic 3D-printing strategy enabled cost-efficient and bioactivity-preserved fabrication of bioglass-based bone substitutes, which led to improved in vivo osteogenesis [bone formation] and osteointegrity [the implant being fused with bone],” the authors wrote.They said the work provides an avenue for customized fabrication of functional inorganic 3D structures to be used in biomedical, machinery, energy and chemical industries. It should be noted more research will be needed to see how these results translate into humans.Newsweek has reached out to the study authors for additional comment. Do you have a tip on a health story that Newsweek should be covering?
