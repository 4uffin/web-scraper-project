Cook, a Biden appointee, has vowed not to step down, saying she won't be "bullied" from her post....What To KnowThe Republican administration turned to the high court after an appeals court refused to go along with ousting Cook, part of President Donald Trump's effort to reshape the Fed's seven-member governing board. It would also strike a blow at its independence.Cook, who was appointed to the Fed's board by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, has said she won't leave her post and won't be "bullied" by Trump. One of her lawyers, Abbe Lowell, has said she "will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor."Separately, Senate Republicans on Monday confirmed Stephen Miran, Trump's nominee to an open spot on the Fed's board.Trump sought to fire Cook on Aug. 25, but a federal judge ruled last week that the removal probably was illegal and reinstated her to the Fed's board. Trump has accused Cook of mortgage fraud because she appeared to claim two properties, in Michigan and Georgia, as "primary residences" in July 2021, before she joined the board. Such claims can lead to a lower mortgage rate and smaller down payment than if one of them was declared as a rental property or second home.Cook has denied any wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. According to documents obtained by The Associated Press, Cook did specify that her Atlanta condo would be a "vacation home," according to a loan estimate she obtained in May 2021. And in a form seeking a security clearance, she described it as a "2nd home." Both documents appear to undercut the Trump administration's claims of fraud.U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration had not satisfied a legal requirement that Fed governors can only be fired "for cause," which she said was limited to misconduct while in office. Cook did not join the Fed's board until 2022.Cobb also held that Trump's firing would have deprived Cook of her due process, or legal right, to contest the firing.By a 2-1 vote, a panel of the federal appeals court in Washington rejected the administration's request to let Cook's firing proceed.Trump's lawyers have argued that even if the conduct occurred before her time as governor, her alleged action "indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy."Trump has previously won orders from the court's conservative majority to fire the presidentially appointed leaders of other independent federal agencies, including the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Trade Commission, even as legal fights continue.Those firings have been at will, with no cause given. The Supreme Court has distinguished the Federal Reserve from those other agencies, strongly suggesting that Trump can't act against Fed governors without cause.What People Are SayingThe Trump administration, in its appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court: "This application involves yet another case of improper judicial interference with the President's removal authority—here, interference with the President's authority to remove members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for cause."U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb for the District of Columbia, in a ruling September 9: "At this preliminary stage, the court finds that Cook has made a strong showing that her purported removal was done in violation of the Federal Reserve Act's 'for cause' provision. Therefore, the court will enter an injunction directing Powell and the Board of Governors to allow Cook to continue to operate as a member of the board."What's NextThe Supreme Court will now have to decide if it will take up the case. If it does, then it can look at whether it will go against previous precedent and issue a stay.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
