NewsLuigi MangioneTrue CrimeTerrorismCourtNew YorkNews ArticleLuigi Mangione’s Lawyer Reacts After ‘Great Day’ in New York TrialPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 06:32 PM EDTBy Jenna SundelReporter (Live News)ShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberMarc Agnifilo, an attorney representing Luigi Mangione, told TMZ "it's a great day" after a judge dropped two terrorism charges against his client on Tuesday."It's a great day. It's a big win and it's the first of many," Agnifilo said.Newsweek reached out to Mangione's legal team for additional comment.Why It MattersNew York State Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro issued a written decision dismissing the terrorism charges against Mangione, saying that New York law does not consider a crime allegedly motivated by ideology to be terrorism. Mangione still faces other New York state charges, including second-degree murder, as well as federal counts and Pennsylvania state charges.Mangione, 27, is eligible for the death penalty if convicted at the federal level. The defendant is accused of fatally shooting Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare (UHC), outside a hotel in midtown Manhattan in December.Mangione has pleaded not guilty to all charges.What To KnowMangione's attorneys walked over to a group of people cheering, "Free Luigi!" in the footage shared by TMZ.Marc Agnifilo and Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who are married and both representing Mangione, thanked the group....When asked if Mangione told his lawyers to go see his fans, Marc Agnifilo said, "First Amendment."Mangione wore a tan prison jumpsuit over a black shirt with handcuffs and ankle shackles as he appeared in court on Tuesday. The hearing lasted a few minutes, with Carro setting a hearing schedule for court proceedings.The judge did not dismiss the second-degree murder charge against Mangione, ruling there was sufficient evidence that Mangione "murdered Brian Thompson in a premeditated and calculated execution." Mangione faces a sentence of 15 years to life in prison with the possibility of parole if convicted of the second-degree murder charge.What People Are SayingManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, in a statement obtained by the Associated Press: "We respect the Court's decision and will proceed on the remaining nine counts."Carro, in his written decision: "While the defendant was clearly expressing an animus toward UHC, and the health care industry generally, it does not follow that his goal was to 'intimidate and coerce a civilian population,' and indeed, there was no evidence presented of such a goal."What Happens NextCarro scheduled the next court appearance in Mangione's New York state case for December 1. The defendant's next court appearance in his federal case is scheduled for December 5.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.Do you have a story that Newsweek should be covering?
