President Donald Trump has said that he will designate Antifa a terrorist organization, and Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to crack down on "hate speech."However, civil liberties groups are sounding the alarm about the First Amendment, saying there is now an aggressive overpolicing of speech, as evidenced by the backlash against comedian Jimmy Kimmel for his recent remarks, which triggered the suspension of his ABC talk show.A majority of Republicans—51 percent, up from 29 percent in June—now say the country is on the wrong track, according to a poll conducted between September 11 and 15, 2025, immediately following Kirk's assassination.Related StoriesWho Is Ermiya Fanaeian?

Republican women (60 percent) express more pessimism than men (43 percent). Overall, 75 percent of American adults—the highest level in recent years—believe the nation is moving off course.The poll of 1,183 adults, conducted online and by telephone, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.The polling trend follows not only Kirk's killing but a series of high-profile, violent political incidents, including attacks on officials and an assassination attempt on President Donald Trump. Many Republicans cited these events as central to their political frustrations, alongside ongoing worries about crime, jobs, and the cost of living.The AP-NORC survey also highlighted ongoing dissatisfaction with national leaders across the political spectrum, with relatively low approval ratings for Trump's performance, except in areas such as border security and crime management.What People Are SayingThe AP-NORC poll on the pessimism about the direction of the country growing among Republicans: "Since June, the share of adults who say the country is on the wrong track increased 13 percentage points from 62% to 75%. The shift occurred primarily among Republicans. In June, 29% of Republicans said the country was heading in the wrong direction. That number is now 51%. The vast majority of Democrats have felt the country is headed in the wrong direction since Donald Trump won the election in 2024."Chris Bahr, a 42-year-old Houston Republican, told the Associated Press: "I've spent a lot of time worrying about the worsening political discourse and, now, the disturbing assassinations."Mustafa Robinson, a Philadelphia truck driver, told the Associated Press: "It's like, you think you're heading in the right direction with your career and your job, but everything around you is going up in price. It seems like you can't catch a break. But we are also supposed to be united as a country and coming together. And we are not. I'm so perplexed how we're not on the same page about anything, so bad that these people are being shot."What Happens NextThe rapid decline in Republican confidence in the nation's trajectory is anticipated to shape forthcoming political debates and strategies on the right. Divisions within the Republican Party between those favoring hard-line policies and leaders seeking a return to civility and unity are likely to become more pronounced.At the same time, concerns around protecting First Amendment rights will continue to be a heated part of the national dialogue, as civil liberties organizations respond to the administration's policy shifts.Update 9/19/25, 9:25 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
