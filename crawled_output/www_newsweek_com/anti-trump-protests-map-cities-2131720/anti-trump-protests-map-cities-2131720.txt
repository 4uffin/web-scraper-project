However, Trump still commands strong support from his conservative base.What To KnowThe protest centres on a march through New York City at 12pm but will also take place in other cities.The demands listed on the protest website include making billionaires pay more tax, stopping deportations, stopping U.S. involvement in Israel, and phasing out fossil fuels.On the Make Billionaires Pay website, it says: "Trump and billionaires are setting the world on fire. They're dismantling our democracy, attacking immigrants, feeding the war profiteers, and fueling the climate crisis. Our communities face attack after attack—floods and fires fueled by Big Oil, ICE agenda kidnapping our neighbors, congress revoking our healthcare."Below is a map showing the cities that are involved in the protest....The full list of 207 planned protests nationwide can be found here.What People Are SayingRenata Pumarol, deputy director of Climate Defenders, told Inside Climate News: "I hope we can scare Trump and his billionaire allies. We need to show them that we are organized, and that there are more of us than them.""The reason why we are targeting billionaires for this march is because we see the growing concentration of economic and political power," said Pumarol. "They are the class driving fascism and climate chaos, and they have the resources to fund a sustainable future."What Happens NextThe protests take place on September 20.
