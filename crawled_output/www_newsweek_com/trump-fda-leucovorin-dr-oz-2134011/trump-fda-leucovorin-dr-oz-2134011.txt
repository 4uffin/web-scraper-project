U.S.FDAAutismTrump administrationNews ArticleWill Dr Oz Benefit From Trump’s FDA Approving Leucovorin? What To KnowPublishedSep 23, 2025 at 08:57 AM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 05:06 AM EDTBy Kate PlummerSenior US News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberConcerns that Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), may profit from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approving leucovorin to treat autism are unfounded, the Health and Human Services Department (HHS) has said.Newsweek has contacted CMS via website form for comment.Why It MattersOn Monday, the FDA approved a version of leucovorin, a type of vitamin B also known as folinic acid, to treat children with autism.The administration cited small studies suggesting that a number of people with autism might have antibodies that interfere with how folate is transported in the body. Folate is needed for healthy blood cells. The announcement also came as President Donald Trump claimed, without evidence, that there are links between Tylenol, vaccines and autism....What To KnowOz, a heart surgeon and celebrity doctor, invested in iHerb, a California supplement retailer that sells folinic acid, the supplement found in leucovorin. This link led people on social media to claim Oz will profit from it being approved more widely and from its increased profile in the news.However, Oz pledged to divest his shares of the company and HHS said that the approved drug was only for prescription leucovorin, not versions sold over the counter, and therefore he would not profit.iHerb told Newsweek the company is no longer affiliated with Dr. Oz and is not working with him or the Trump administration.A number of viral posts on X claimed that Oz would profit from the drug being approved.But it is unclear how much of the iHerb shares Oz still has. In February, he said he would divest his iHerb holdings within 90 days of being confirmed to his government role. However, in another disclosure he indicated that he might keep some of the stock until the company goes public or is bought.Regardless, HHS said people should not conflate over-the-counter drugs with prescription drugs that have been approved.What People Are SayingOrganic chemist Simon Maechling said on X: "This isn't public health. It's corruption dressed up as wellness."Adam Cochran, a policy consultant, wrote: "Dr. Oz is going to make a killing from this new recommendation."On X, HHS said: "At today's press conference, POTUS and HHS officials discussed *prescription* leucovorin, which can only be taken in consultation with a doctor. It is not to be conflated with ANY over-the-counter drugs or supplements."What Happens NextThe Autism Science Foundation said research on leucovorin and autism "is still in very early stages" and that more studies are needed before any firm conclusions can be drawn.This story has been updated for clarity and with a comment from iHerb.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
