EntertainmentJimmy KimmelCharlie kirkGun ViolenceShootingNews ArticleJimmy Kimmel Under Fire Over Charlie Kirk RemarksPublishedSep 17, 2025 at 06:58 AM EDTBy Megan CartwrightDeputy Entertainment EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberLate-night host Jimmy Kimmel drew widespread attention and criticism over his comments on Charlie Kirk and President Donald Trump during a monologue on Jimmy Kimmel Live!Kirk, a conservative political activist and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot and killed on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University.Newsweek reached out to Kimmel and Trump's representatives for comment on Wednesday via email outside regular working hours.Why It MattersKirk's killing and the national reaction to it have intensified scrutiny of political speech and how public figures respond to politically charged violence. Critics say public commentary from influential media figures and elected officials can shape the tone of public discourse; supporters say satire and critique are central to political commentary. The episode involving Kimmel and Kirk feeds into those larger conversations while unfolding alongside an active criminal investigation.What To KnowOn Monday, Kimmel took aim at Trump's supporters."We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA [Make America Great Again] gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it," the comedian said on the ABC program.Following Kimmel's MAGA comments, he mocked Trump's public response to the fatal shooting. When asked by a reporter how he was "holding up," Trump had said, "I think very good," before speaking about the White House's ballroom construction."He's at the fourth stage of grief, construction," Kimmel said through audience laughs. "This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he called a friend. This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish."...Shooting suspect Tyler Robinson appeared in court via video link on Tuesday following his arrest. The 22-year-old was charged with aggravated murder, felony firearm discharge, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. He showed no emotion as the charges were read out.According to The New York Times, "The charges filed against Tyler Robinson on Tuesday in the killing of Charlie Kirk depicted him as a lone assassin with hardening left-wing, pro-L.G.B.T.Q. views that led him to violence... Mr. Robinson is evidently not a disgruntled member of the hard-right, white nationalist 'groyper' movement, as some on the left had insisted in recent days."While Robinson is a registered voter in Utah, he is not affiliated with any political party and has never voted, The New York Times also reported, citing the Washington County Clerk.What People Are SayingOn X, many called out Kimmel over his remarks and appeared to think Kimmel had identified Robinson as MAGA.Former West Virginia state delegate Derrick Evans said in a post with 904,100 views and 49,000 likes: "Jimmy Kimmel LIED to his audience by claiming Charlie Kirk's assassin is MAGA. I'm tagging @jimmykimmel @JimmyKimmelLive so we can all demand he apologize & tell his audience the truth."@yalligatorgar wrote in a comment with 536,300 views and 29,000 likes: "Hey @ABCNetwork we are demanding an on air apology from @jimmykimmel for spreading dangerous misinformation and hate speech on your network. Failure to comply will result in endless lawsuits. He can apologize, or you can cancel his show. Nothing else will do. The shooter was not MAGA, and harmful insensitive rhetoric like Kimmel's is what led to the murder of Charlie Kirk. This type of hate speech is putting millions of Americans in harm's way. I look forward to your cooperation."@LiberalHivemind shared in a message with 642,000 views and 27,000 likes: "I hope this ends his career."@DogRightGirl added in a note with 92,900 views and 4,900 likes: "I didn't think I could hate @jimmykimmel more but he is subhuman."@Anc_Aesthetics posted in a remark with 210,600 views and 14,000 likes: "There is no peace with people like this. People like Jimmy Kimmel must have their careers completely destroyed. Lying about the now 100% confirmed far left terrorist ideology of Tyler Robinson should be grounds for removal from polite society."@RitaPanahi voiced in a line with 24,700 views and 2,200 likes: ".@jimmykimmel is a contemptible liar He knows Charlie's killer is a Leftist loon, he's choosing to lie. Gross."Others, meanwhile, defended Kimmel.@mauneel questioned why his remarks should affect his career: "Why? He is absolutely right."@Tangerine2003 chimed in: "Hopefully he gets an Emmy next year for 'Best TV Talk Show.'"What Happens NextA memorial service for Kirk will take place in Arizona on Sunday. Trump is expected to be in attendance.Kirk is survived by his wife, Erika Kirk, and their two children.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
