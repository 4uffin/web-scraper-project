U.S.Robert RedfordDonald Trumpcelebrity deathsNews ArticleEverything Robert Redford Has Said About Donald TrumpPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 09:51 AM EDTupdatedSep 22, 2025 at 11:40 AM EDTBy Martha McHardyUS News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberRobert Redford, the beloved Oscar-winning actor and director has died at the age of 89.His death was announced in a statement to The New York Times by Cindi Berger, the chief executive of the publicity firm Rogers & Cowan PMK. She said he died in his sleep at his home in Utah, without detailing the cause of death.Redford was an acting and directing giant, whose roles in films such as The Sting, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Out of Africa are loved the world over. He won the Oscar for Best Director for Ordinary People in 1981.Beyond his Hollywood legacy, Redford was known for his outspoken views on American politics — and Donald Trump was no exception. Throughout Trump's rise and presidency, Redford, a longtime Democrat, often weighed in with sharp criticism and warnings about the president's impact on democracy....'I Think He Shakes Things Up'In 2015, Redford told Larry King Now, when asked about Trump, "Look he's got such a big foot in his mouth, I'm not sure you're going to get it out. But on the other hand, I'm glad he's in there."He added: "I'm glad he's in there because him being the way he is, and saying what he says the way he says it, I think shakes things up and I think that's very needed. Because on the other side, it's so bland, it's so boring, it's so empty."Responding in a Twitter post focusing on the latter remarks, Trump tweeted: "Wow! Such nice words from Robert Redford on my running for President. Thank you, Robert,"A spokesperson for Redford told The Hollywood Reporter at the time that the quote reflected the actor's enjoyment of Trump as a character, but didn't indicate his support for Trump as president.'Degrades Everything He Touches'In a January 2019 op-ed in The Washington Post, months before Trump's first impeachment proceedings began, Redford argued against using impeachment as a political remedy. Instead, he urged Americans to use the ballot box to remove Trump from office.Redford expressed deep frustration with the state of U.S. politics under Trump, describing a sense of "outrage and despair over what is happening right under our noses." Still, he noted that America had faced crises before and managed to "pull back from the brink," asking whether the country could do so again.Redford was unsparing in his assessment of Trump: "It is painfully clear we have a president who degrades everything he touches, a person who does not understand (or care?) that his duty is to defend our democracy."Trump went on to face two impeachments while in office. The first came in December 2019, when the House of Representatives charged him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over his dealings with Ukraine. He was acquitted by the Senate in February 2020.A little over a year later, Trump was impeached again, this time for "incitement of insurrection" following the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The House passed the article of impeachment on January 13, 2021, making him the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice. In February 2021, the Senate acquitted him.'Dictator Like Attack'In another 2019 NBC News op-ed, Redford delivered one of his strongest denunciations of Trump, framing the then-president as a direct threat to America's democratic foundations ahead of his impeachment. Redford warned: "We're up against a crisis I never thought I'd see in my lifetime: a dictator-like attack by President Donald Trump on everything this country stands for." He argued that Trump's actions had undermined truth, the rule of law, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech.Redford acknowledged that when Trump was first elected, he believed it was fair to "give the guy a chance." But, he wrote, Trump "almost instantly began to disappoint and then alarm me." Drawing on his memories of World War II, Watergate, and 9/11, Redford contrasted past moments when Americans united in the face of crisis with Trump's presidency, which he said had left the country fractured. "Instead of the United States of America, we are now defined as the Divided States of America," he wrote.Trump Reacts To Redford's DeathBefore boarding Marine One for his state visit to the U.K. on Tuesday, Trump reacted to Redford's death."Robert Redford had a series of years where there was nobody better," the president told reporters. "There was a period of time when he was the hottest. I thought he was great."Trump did not address Redford's previous criticism of him.Who Did Robert Redford Endorse For President?He endorsed Barack Obama for president in 2012, writing that only Obama shares "the belief that our kids and grandkids should grow up with living, natural places to explore."Redford did not make a formal presidential endorsement in the 2016 election. While he occasionally commented on the race, he said he didn't know where Democratic contender Hillary Clinton stood on the issues.In an interview with CNN, he added: "I think she is demanding that she has a chance. I think she's fortifying herself to win by touching what is important to win, which is money and things like that. That seems to me [a] very conventional way to proceed, but they're all going that direction, because I think they feel they need it," he said.By 2020, however, Redford broke his silence and endorsed Joe Biden. In a July 2020 CNN op-ed, he praised Biden's "fierce compassion" and contrasted it with what he described as the "moral vacuum" of the Trump presidency. Redford wrote that Biden led with empathy, was committed to fighting racial and economic injustice, and represented the kind of steady leadership the country needed at a time of crisis.In 2024, he endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris, citing her record on climate action. Writing in a USA Today column, Redford said Harris was the leader best equipped to "confront the existential challenge of our time and keep us free from climate hazards and harm."He cited her record as California Attorney General. As California's attorney general, she "won a $24.5 million settlement with Chevron and a $14 million settlement with BP" over hazardous waste leaks, and she investigated the oil industry's lies about climate change, he wrote. As vice president, he noted, she played a decisive role in advancing the Inflation Reduction Act and helped set new standards to cut greenhouse gas emissions. For Redford, this history showed she was "ready to build on those gains and press for even more climate progress from day one as president."By contrast, Redford cast Trump as an existential danger to the environment and public health. He said that Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, rolled back emissions curbs, and backed "the MAGA manifesto Project 2025," which Redford warned would gut the civil service, politicize science, and undo clean energy incentives. He dismissed Trump's approach bluntly: "No thanks."Correction, 09/22/2025, 11:40 a.m. ET: A previous version of this article got the date of President Donald Trump's second impeachment wrong.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
