Newsatlantic hurricane seasonHurricaneNews ArticleTropical Storm Humberto: What to Know as Atlantic Disturbance StrengthensPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 05:56 PM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 06:39 PM EDTBy Hollie SilvermanDeputy Weekend EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberTropical Storm Humberto formed in the Atlantic on Wednesday night, according to an advisory from the National Hurricane Center (NHC).The storm was about 550 miles east-northeast of the Northern Leeward Islands, moving 40 mph, the advisory said.There are no coastal watches or warnings currently in effect, but as Humberto moves west, that could change.Humberto is forecast to continue strengthening steadily over the next several days, according to the NHC.Newsweek reached out to the NHC for more information by email on Wednesday night.Why It MattersTropical Storm Humberto's emergence in the central Atlantic marked an intensification of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, prompting heightened vigilance across the region. As the season entered its historically most active phase, Humberto’s development and a second disturbance—potentially Imelda—have drawn attention from emergency managers and coastal residents, especially given uncertainties about potential impacts for Bermuda and the southeastern United States.The rapid succession of named storms suggested increased activity compared to recent years, emphasizing the need for preparedness as the Atlantic hurricane season progressed through its peak months. What to KnowTropical Storm Humberto organized over the central Atlantic following days of monitoring by meteorologists tracking Invest 93L. At formation, Humberto was centered about 550 miles east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands, producing sustained winds of 40 mph. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) indicated Humberto was expected to move west-northwest, remaining well north of the Leeward Islands, and was forecast to possibly intensify into a hurricane by the weekend.While Humberto is not predicted to impact the United States directly, meteorologists caution that Bermuda could be threatened if the storm strengthens as forecast. The system is being monitored for a potential west-northwest track that might bring rough surf and winds to the region. At the same time, a separate tropical disturbance, Invest 94L, located in the northeastern Caribbean Sea, shows an elevated chance of development and could become the next named storm, Imelda. Forecast models suggested that this system could approach the coasts of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, or even stall offshore early the following week, though its path remained highly uncertain. Weather Channel meteorologists said that before any potential approach toward the U.S., the disturbance associated with Invest 94L would bring showers and locally heavy rain to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Hispaniola, eastern Cuba, and the Bahamas over the coming days. The system's future intensity and track were described as uncertain, with possible outcomes ranging from stalling offshore to making landfall as either a tropical storm or a hurricane.The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season has already produced multiple named storms by late September, including Hurricane Gabrielle, currently weakening as it moves towards the Azores and Europe, but none have made landfall this season on the east coast of the US.What People Are SayingNational Hurricane Center forecasters, in a public advisory dated September 24, 2025: “Humberto is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by this weekend as it moves northwest, well north of the Leeward Islands.”The Weather Channel, in an outlook published September 24, 2025: “There is a lot of uncertainty in the forecast for this system … it may either stall offshore for a few days or make landfall sometime Monday to Tuesday. It may either be a tropical storm or hurricane at that time.”Andrew Hazelton, scientist at the University of Miami, speaking with The News-Press for a report published September 24, 2025: “Invest 94L might take a westerly track and could pose a threat to the East Coast.”What Happens NextThe NHC will issue regular daily advisories on Humberto and Invest 94L, with updates expected as models provide greater clarity on their tracks and intensity.Humberto is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by the weekend, while Invest 94L could gain tropical storm status and be named Imelda in the coming days.As both systems evolve, residents along the U.S. Southeast, Bermuda, and Caribbean are advised to monitor official forecasts and prepare for possible storm impacts as the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season continues.With Humberto's naming, the next scheduled Atlantic storm names were Imelda, Jerry, and Karen.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
