WorldNATOPolandUnited StatesNews ArticleNATO Soldiers Killed During Military Training in USPublishedSep 20, 2025 at 06:58 AM EDTBy Brendan ColeSenior News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberTwo Polish servicemen have been killed during parachute training in the U.S., the General Staff of the Polish Armed Forces reported.Poland's military said in a statement that on Friday an accident occurred during night parachute training in the U.S. and that the cause of the deaths was being investigated, without revealing any further details about the operation.Newsweek has contacted the Polish armed forces for further comment.Why It MattersThe Polish military statement gave few details, but the incident follows the U.S. Army Special Operations Command announcing that four of its soldiers were killed in a crash involving a U.S. Army MH-60 Black Hawk helicopter in Washington state on Wednesday.The deaths of Polish personnel in the U.S could raise questions about the safety of drills by NATO as it faces an increasing threat from Russia, which has been accused of repeatedly breaching the alliance's airspace....What To KnowThe General Command of Poland's Armed Forces said in an X post that "on September 19, 2025, during night parachute training conducted in the United States, a tragic accident occurred."The post said that two Polish special forces soldiers had been killed in what Poland's Deputy Prime Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz described in a statement as "extremely sad news from the United States."Kosiniak-Kamysz said they were killed during night parachute exercises and that the families of the fallen have been provided with full support and an investigation had been launched.It is unclear whether there is any connection with the crash of the Black Hawk helicopter during a routine training exercise in a remote area of Washington state near Joint Base Lewis-McChord.The U.S. Army said the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk went down near the base, about 15 miles southeast of Tacoma at about 9 p.m. PDT on Wednesday, two days before Poland announced the incident in which its soldiers had been killed took place.The U.S. Army said that the soldiers in Wednesday's crash were members of the elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, 4th Battalion Dubbed "Night Stalkers," which is known for conducting operations at night.What People Are SayingPoland's President Karol Nawrocki wrote on X: "It is with deep sadness that I received the news of the death of two special forces soldiers who died during parachute training in the United States.He added: "To the families and loved ones, I express my sincere sympathy and solidarity in their pain. May the good God take care of their souls."What Happens NextKosiniak-Kamysz said that the causes of the incident were the subject of proceedings conducted by a special commission, but did not specify whether the findings would be made public.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
