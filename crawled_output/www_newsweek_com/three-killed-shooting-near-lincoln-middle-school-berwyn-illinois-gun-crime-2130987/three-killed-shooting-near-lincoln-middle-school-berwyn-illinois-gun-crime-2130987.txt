NewsShootingIllinoisSchoolDeathCrimeNews ArticleThree Killed In Shooting Near Illinois Middle School: What To KnowPublishedSep 17, 2025 at 03:19 AM EDTBy Jordan KingUS News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThree people were killed in a murder-suicide shooting near a middle school in Illinois on Tuesday.A male suspect fired a rifle into another vehicle near Lincoln Middle School in Berwyn at around 4.05 p.m. on Tuesday, said Berwyn Police Department division commander Michael Fellows.The suspect then turned the gun on himself, said Michelle Smith, the superintendent of the Berwyn North School District 98, in a separate statement.Why It MattersEven though Fellows said that the incident "appears to be domestic-related," the shooting unfolded in front of a school that serves hundreds of students, sparking fear among families as law enforcement swarmed the area.It comes amid heightened concerns about violence across the country, after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed last Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University.What To KnowAt one point, officers were shot at by the suspect, but they "took cover and did not return fire," Fellows said.Lincoln Middle School was placed under a hard lockdown.Both Fellows and Smith said there was no ongoing threat to the community, but Smith said the school would be "closed for instruction" on Wednesday."Students are encouraged to come to school if they need to process today's events," she added. "Social workers/counselors will be available."Police are treating the shooting as an isolated incident and said that investigation is ongoing.What People Are SayingAbraham Pulido, who lives nearby, told ABC7Chicago: "You don't expect that from a small town like this in Berwyn, and it's kind of scary to just think about it, because it happened right in front of school. It was just cops everywhere and helicopter noises and sirens."Berwyn Police Department's division commander Michael Fellows said: "At approximately 4:05 p.m. today, Berwyn Police officers heard gunfire near Lincoln Middle School and responded. Upon arrival, officers observed a male suspect firing a rifle into another vehicle. As officers approached the scene, they came under fire from the suspect. Officers took cover and did not return fire."In response to the ongoing threat, Lincoln Middle School was placed on an immediate hard lockdown to ensure the safety of students and staff. Tragically, the incident resulted in the deaths of three individuals at the scene, and at this time this incident appears to be domestic-related. All parties involved are accounted for, and authorities have confirmed that there is no ongoing danger to the community. The situation is being treated as an isolated incident."Michelle Smith, the superintendent of the Berwyn North School District 98 said: "Today, at approximately 4:05 p.m., a gunman approached a car in front of Lincoln Middle School and began firing shots into the car before turning the gun on himself. None of the individuals killed were students from Lincoln Middle School. This was a domestic incident and there is no ongoing threat to the school community."What Happens NextLocal and regional investigative units, including a forensic team, remained on scene into the evening to process evidence and reconstruct the sequence of events. Authorities asked anyone with information to contact the Berwyn Police Department as the probe continues....This is a developing story. More to follow.
