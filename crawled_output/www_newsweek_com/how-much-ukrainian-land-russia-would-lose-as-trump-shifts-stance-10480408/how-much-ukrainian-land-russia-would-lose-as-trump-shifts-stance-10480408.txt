NewsDonald TrumpMapsRussia-Ukraine WarNews ArticleHow Much Ukrainian Land Russia Would Lose As Trump Shifts Stance  PublishedSep 24, 2025 at 09:35 AM EDTBy Brendan Cole and John FengShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberNewsweek has produced a map that the shows the territory President Donald Trump said he believes Ukraine would be able to take back from Russia in comments made on Truth Social.Why It Matters The U.S. president’s comments on Tuesday signaled a shift from his prior insistence that Kyiv would have to make land swaps ahead of a peace deal. It appears Trump envisages a possible future in which Ukraine reclaims tens of thousands of square kilometers of lost territory—even more if it includes the illegally annexed region of Crimea. ...What To Know Trump’s Truth Social post could mean a major shift in the president’s policy toward Kyiv, which he has previously pressured for concessions and suggested territorial swaps for peace. This was something that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly ruled out as against his country’s constitution.  Trump’s post disparaging Russia’s economy appeared to back the ability of Europe and NATO to help Ukraine withstand and win back territory it has lost, delivering a much-needed boost to Kyiv. It is also a far-cry from the tone of his ill-humored meeting with Zelensky in the White House in February when he said that the Ukrainian leader had “no cards.” After a meeting with Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, Trump posted on social media how Ukraine, with the support of Europe and NATO, could “fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form."  Trump’s Truth Social post did not provide any more details, but it did signal a shift from his previous suggestions that Ukraine would never be able to reclaim all the territory that Russia has occupied since seizing Crimea in 2014.  Russia controls nearly 114,500 square kilometers (44,600 square miles), or 19 percent of Ukraine, Reuters reported in August, citing battlefield maps. This territory includes Crimea, (27,000 square kilometers) seized in 2014 and a chunk of land in the east and southeast of the country.
Trump’s comments were reported by some outlets as meaning that Kyiv could recapture Crimea, which is an often stated Ukrainian war aim. If Trump was referring to territory captured since February 2022, this would encompass land Russia seized during the initial months of the war. It was followed by incremental advances, in the oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, which Moscow claims to have annexed but does not fully control. In its initial surge at the start of the war, Russia captured over 45,000 square kilometers, including areas near Kyiv and large parts of the south and east. Then, Ukraine reclaimed significant ground in Kharkiv and Kherson oblasts during counteroffensives. But between November 2022 and August 2025, Russian forces only captured 5,842 square kilometers, or less than 1 percent of the country, according to open-source intelligence outfit, DeepState. The outlet also said that on November 12, 2022, 108,651 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory were under Russian occupation and as of August 17, 2025, 114,493 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory had been captured. Russia's advances have slowed, but not stopped and another 1,000 square kilometers were brought under Russian control in June and July 2025. Finnish-based military analyst Emil Kastehelmi told Newsweek that the Russians are constantly on the attack, and are still advancing in Ukraine, gaining roughly 300 to 400 square kilometers so far in September. Last week, Zelensky warned that Russia was planning two more major offensives, a statement that Kastehelmi said was vague, but he believes Moscow’s focus would remain on the Donbas region, consisting of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. What People Are Saying President Donald Trump on Truth Social: “I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and win all of Ukraine back in its original form.” Following Trump’s post, Brett Erickson, a sanctions expert, told Newsweek: “Russia is watching closely. If Trump’s commitment is real, it must be proven through immediate economic pressure. Sanctions, not rhetoric, are what alter the Kremlin’s calculus. Without them, today’s promises risk becoming just another headline.” Emil Kastehelmi, a military analyst with open-source intelligence service Black Bird Group: “Generally, the Russians are constantly on attack, and are still advancing in Ukraine, gaining roughly 300-400 square kilometers during September.” What Happens Next Analysts will pore over Trump’s words and speculate whether they mean a renewed U.S. commitment for Ukraine or a statement that he was leaving it to Europe to help.  Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded to Trump by saying Wednesday that Moscow would continuing with its “special military operation to ensure our interests and achieve the goals," suggesting that no let up from Russia is on the cards.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
