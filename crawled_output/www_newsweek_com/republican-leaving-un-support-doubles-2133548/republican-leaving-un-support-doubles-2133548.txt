NewsRepublicansUnited StatesNews ArticleRepublican Support for Leaving UN Nearly DoublesPublishedSep 22, 2025 at 06:55 AM EDTupdatedSep 22, 2025 at 06:56 AM EDTBy Theo BurmanLive News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberMore than one-third of Republicans say the U.S. should exit the United Nations, nearly double the number from two decades ago, a sharp rise amid growing party alignment with President Donald Trump's America First agenda.According to a new Gallup poll released in September, 36 percent of Republicans favor U.S. withdrawal from the U.N., nearly double the 19 percent who held that view in 2005.Still, 63 percent of Republicans still back continued membershipWhy It MattersThe rise in Republican support for leaving the U.N. comes as President Donald Trump continues to reshape U.S. foreign policy in his second term. In February, he signed an executive order formally withdrawing from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC)and cutting future U.S. funding to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides humanitarian aid to Palestinians.What To KnowGallup's September 2025 poll found that while 79 percent of Americans overall want the U.S. to remain in the U.N., that figure masks significant partisan divides.Among Republicans, 70 percent now want to decrease U.S. funding for the U.N, compared to 46 percent who said so in 2003. By contrast, a majority of Democrats (52 percent) favor increasing funding, up from 19 percent over two decades ago.Only 32 percent of Americans overall believe the U.N. is doing a good job addressing global challenges, compared to 63 percent who say it is performing poorly....That dissatisfaction is especially high among Republicans, 75 percent of whom rated the U.N.'s performance negatively, while 21 percent thought it was doing a good job.The partisan split is less stark among independents, who broadly support U.S. membership and funding but share Republicans' low ratings of the U.N.'s effectiveness.Trump withdrew the U.S. from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in July, following a review of American participation in the agency, citing concerns about "woke" activity.What People Are SayingWhite House deputy spokesperson Anna Kelly said in July: "President Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from UNESCO—which supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out-of-step with the common-sense policies that Americans voted for in November."This president will always put America First and ensure our country's membership in all international organizations aligns with our national interests."What Happens NextA full withdrawal from the United Nations remains unlikely in the near term, but the rising Republican appetite for such a move could shape the party's messaging ahead of the midterms in 2026.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
