More than one-third of Republicans say the U.S. should exit the United Nations, nearly double the number from two decades ago, a sharp rise amid growing party alignment with President Donald Trump's America First agenda.According to a new Gallup poll released in September, 36 percent of Republicans favor U.S. withdrawal from the U.N., nearly double the 19 percent who held that view in 2005.Still, 63 percent of Republicans still back continued membershipWhy It MattersThe rise in Republican support for leaving the U.N. comes as President Donald Trump continues to reshape U.S. foreign policy in his second term. In February, he signed an executive order formally withdrawing from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC)and cutting future U.S. funding to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides humanitarian aid to Palestinians.What To KnowGallup's September 2025 poll found that while 79 percent of Americans overall want the U.S. to remain in the U.N., that figure masks significant partisan divides.Among Republicans, 70 percent now want to decrease U.S. funding for the U.N, compared to 46 percent who said so in 2003. By contrast, a majority of Democrats (52 percent) favor increasing funding, up from 19 percent over two decades ago.Only 32 percent of Americans overall believe the U.N. is doing a good job addressing global challenges, compared to 63 percent who say it is performing poorly.

That dissatisfaction is especially high among Republicans, 75 percent of whom rated the U.N.'s performance negatively, while 21 percent thought it was doing a good job.The partisan split is less stark among independents, who broadly support U.S. membership and funding but share Republicans' low ratings of the U.N.'s effectiveness.Trump withdrew the U.S. from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in July, following a review of American participation in the agency, citing concerns about "woke" activity.What People Are SayingWhite House deputy spokesperson Anna Kelly said in July: "President Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from UNESCO‚Äîwhich supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out-of-step with the common-sense policies that Americans voted for in November."This president will always put America First and ensure our country's membership in all international organizations aligns with our national interests."What Happens NextA full withdrawal from the United Nations remains unlikely in the near term, but the rising Republican appetite for such a move could shape the party's messaging ahead of the midterms in 2026.
