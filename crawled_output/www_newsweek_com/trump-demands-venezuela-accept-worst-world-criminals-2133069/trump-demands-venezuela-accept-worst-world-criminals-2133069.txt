NewsDonald TrumpVenezuelaTPSDhsImmigrationSupreme CourtMoreNews ArticleTrump Demands Venezuela Accept ‘Worst in the World’ CriminalsPublishedSep 20, 2025 at 02:58 PM EDTBy Adeola AdeosunWeekend Night EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberPresident Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to Venezuela on Saturday via Truth Social, demanding the country "immediately accept" what he described as prisoners and individuals from mental institutions who were allegedly sent to the United States.Newsweek reached out to the White House via email on Saturday for comment.Why It MattersThis coordinated approach represents a significant escalation in the Trump administration's immigration enforcement strategy.Concurrently, the administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday for an emergency order to strip legal protections from more than 300,000 Venezuelan migrants currently under Temporary Protected Status (TPS).The Justice Department's filing seeks to overturn a federal judge's ruling that blocked the administration's termination of these protections.The outcome could determine the legal status of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans currently living in the U.S., while potentially establishing precedent for how the administration handles protected immigrant populations from other countries. The administration has already moved to end TPS protections for 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians who received protection during former President Joe Biden's administration.What To KnowThe Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court for an emergency order allowing it to strip legal protections from more than 300,000 Venezuelan migrants. The Justice Department asked the high court to put on hold a ruling from U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco that found the administration wrongly ended TPS for the Venezuelans.The federal appeals court in San Francisco refused to put on hold Chen's ruling while the case continues. In May, the Supreme Court reversed a preliminary order from Chen that affected another 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections expired in April. The high court provided no explanation at the time, which is common in emergency appeals.Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions. The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary in 18-month increments. Chen found that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) acted "with unprecedented haste and in an unprecedented manner … for the preordained purpose of expediting termination of Venezuela's TPS" status.Trump's latest Truth Social post claimed that "thousands of people have been badly hurt, and even killed" by individuals he characterized as coming from Venezuelan prisons and mental institutions.The president's post provided no specific evidence or data to support these claims about harm caused by Venezuelan migrants in the U.S.However, states like Texas and Georgia have recently begun sharing data on illegal immigrant crime in their regions, showing non-citizens are committing crimes at a lower rate than their American-born counterparts....What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump on Truth Social: "We want Venezuela to immediately accept all of the prisoners, and people from mental institutions, which includes the Worst in the World Insane Asylums, that Venezuelan 'Leadership' has forced into the United States of America. Thousands of people have been badly hurt, and even killed, by these 'Monsters.' GET THEM THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY, RIGHT NOW, OR THE PRICE YOU PAY WILL BE INCALCULABLE!"Adelys Ferro, co-founder and executive director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, told Newsweek on August 29: "We, more than 8 million Venezuelans, just didn't leave the country just because it's fun, it's because we had no choice...Venezuelans with TPS are not a threat to the United States."What Happens Next?The Supreme Court will decide whether to grant the administration's emergency request to strip protections from Venezuelan migrants.Venezuelan leadership has yet to respond to Trump's demands.Reporting from the Associated Press contributed to this article.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
