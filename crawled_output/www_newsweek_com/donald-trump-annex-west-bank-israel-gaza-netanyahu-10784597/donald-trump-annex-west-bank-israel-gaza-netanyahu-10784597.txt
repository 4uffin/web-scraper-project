Trump gave his own address earlier this week, followed by meetings with the leaders of Arab nations, with whom the president shared his plan for Gaza resettlement. However, those same leaders over the past two months have grown more vocal in their opposition to Israel as it launched a fresh assault on Gaza City and criticized Israel's plan to take control of the city and the wider Gaza Strip. Regional leaders have warned that the operation will deepen an already severe humanitarian crisis and mass displacement, and it will only undermine any chance at a lasting peace for the region.This year's High Level week has drawn increased attention as several major Western nations, including the United Kingdom and France, have decided to recognize a Palestinian state. What To KnowTrump, while fielding questions from reporters in the Oval Office, addressed any potential future expansion of Israeli ambitions for the Palestinian territories, which would include moving on the West Bank, which has thus far remained removed from the violence in the Gaza Strip.Trump said he would oppose any attempt to take the West Bank, saying, "It's not going to happen." "I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. I will not allow it. It's not going to happen," he said, adding, "It's been enough. It's time to stop now," and calling any attempt to take the West Bank a "red line" for relations with Israel. Unlike Gaza, where Israel is at war with Hamas, the West Bank is administered by the Palestinian Authority. Trump has often touted his close ties with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but he has come under pressure from Arab leaders who have voiced concerns about Israel moving to annex more land. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces immense internal pressure from key coalition allies to increase the nation's control over the Palestinian territories, with some hoping that broad U.S. support for Israeli policies would ultimately translate to support for expansion into the occupied territories.

Much of the international community largely views these settlements as illegal and an obstacle to peace. Should Israel annex the West Bank, it would lead to a rapid expansion of those settlements, pushing longtime residents. Israel in August approved a settlement program in the West Bank that Palestinians and rights groups warned would split the territory and deal a devastating blow to any prospect for a future Palestinian state. ...List of Countries That Do Not Recognize a Palestinian StateThe State of Palestine has received increased recognition in recent years, with major additions occurring in the past two months.
