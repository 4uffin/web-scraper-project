They'll be briefing me in a short while, so I'll let you know about it tonight or tomorrow.He continued, "I don't love it. I don't like when that happens. This could be big trouble, but I'll let you know later they're going to brief me in about an hour."The Estonia incident happened just over a week after NATO planes downed Russian drones over Poland and heightened fears that the war in Ukraine could spill over.Loading twitter content...Did NATO Intercept Russian Jets?On Friday, NATO scrambled Italian F-35 jets under its Baltic Air Policing Mission to intercept three Russian MiG-31 fighter aircraft that entered Estonia's airspace without permission. The jets reportedly flew without a flight plan, had their transponders turned off, and stayed inside Estonian airspace for about 12 minutes before being escorted out.Later in the day, Sweden's military posted photos of what it says were Russian fighter jets over the Baltic Sea.The post said, "Following a violation of Estonian air space, Swedish JAS 39 fighters intercepted and monitored three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets over the Baltic Sea today. Sweden is always ready to ensure the safety, security and integrity of our airspace together with our allies."Meanwhile, Poland accused Russia on Friday of violating the "safety zone" of a Baltic Sea oil platform after two fighter jets flew low over the Petrobaltic installation. The Polish Border Force said the military and other authorities were alerted following the incident, which it called a breach of security around the offshore site.What is NATO's Article 4?Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty allows any NATO member to request consultations among the alliance if it believes its territorial integrity, political independence, or security is threatened. It's a mechanism for political dialogue and coordination, not a guarantee of military action, but it often precedes heightened alert or joint responses....When was NATO's Article 4 last invoked?NATO's Article 4 was most recently invoked by Poland on Sept. 10, 2025, after multiple Russian drones violated Polish airspace. Earlier, several Eastern European states simultaneously invoked it on Feb. 24, 2022, in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.How Many Soldiers Has Russia Lost in Ukraine?Estimates of Russia's losses in the war with Ukraine vary, but most credible sources suggest they have suffered over 900,000 casualties (killed, wounded, missing, or captured), with fatalities likely in the hundreds of thousands. These numbers are based on Ukrainian official figures and Western intelligence.Loading twitter content...Update: 9/19/25, 5:48 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information.Update: 9/19/25, 6:04 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Update: 9/19/25, 7:37 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
