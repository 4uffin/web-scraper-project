PoliticsTed CruzFCCJimmy KimmelABCCharlie kirkBreaking NewsNews ArticleTed Cruz Compares FCC Chair to Mafia Boss Over His Kimmel WarningPublishedSep 19, 2025 at 01:51 PM EDTupdatedSep 20, 2025 at 08:24 AM EDTBy Dan Gooding and Hannah ParryShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberRepublican Senator Ted Cruz said that Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair Brendan Carr sounded like a mafia crime boss when he threatened ABC's licenses over Jimmy Kimmel's comments about Charlie Kirk."This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr, a Trump appointee, had warned on Wednesday, in reaction to Kimmel's remarks. "These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead."Speaking on his podcast Friday, Cruz said, "That's right out of Goodfellas. That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar going 'Nice bar you have here. It'd be a shame if something happened to it.'"The Texas senator added that he agrees with Carr that Kimmel was misleading the American public with his remarks and was also glad to have him off the air, but did not approve of the government's handling of the situation.He warned that government policing speech set a bad precedent, which would allow Democrats to do the same once they're back in office."They will silence us," Cruz said. "They will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly, and that is dangerous."Why It MattersCruz's comments come amid rising discomfort among Republicans over the perceived pressure from the FCC, which led to Jimmy Kimmel Live! being pulled from the air earlier this week. Voices across the political spectrum have warned that First Amendment rights are being put at risk by the Trump administration in its handling of views the president does not like.Related StoriesVideo of Barack Obama Responding to Heckler Takes Off Online4 min. readSteve Bannon Urges Investigation of Spencer Cox After Charlie Kirk Shooting4 min. readJoe Rogan Says He’s Not a Republican—’You’re Gonna Need Some Socialism’6 min. read...What To KnowCruz made it clear that he did not like what Kimmel had said about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, but he said that high-ranking officials threatening ABC in the way Carr did was "dangerous as hell."The Republican said the actions that led to the late-night host being taken off the air indefinitely could end with conservatives facing censorship later."If the government gets in the business of saying, 'We don't like what you, the media have said, we're going to ban you from the airwaves if you don't say what we like,' that will end up bad for conservatives," Cruz said.Carr had criticized Kimmel for the comedian's comments on Monday that Kirk's alleged killer was a "MAGA or Republican-motivated person," although suspect Tyler Robinson's motives remain unclear.Cruz said he believed Kimmel had lied to his viewers, but that the government should not be policing speech in the way that it had appeared to in recent days.Asked about the free speech issue during an appearance in the Oval Office later Friday, President Donald Trump said he believed in free speech but that 97 percent of news stories about him were bad, to which he said, "I think that's really illegal, personally".Trump was then asked about Cruz's comments, to which he said Carr was an "incredible American patriot". He said that when there was a network putting out stories with 90-plus percent bad publicity, it was dishonest.The president said he believed Carr did not like to see the airways used dishonestly.Texas Representative Jasmine Crockett, a Democrat, has announced that she has introduced legislation to prevent the FCC from taking actions that compel companies it regulates to adopt or suppress particular viewpoints.What People Are SayingFormer Republican Representative Adam Kinzinger said, during an appearance on CNN, regarding Cruz's comments: "He's actually thinking long term. I mean, the idea that Republicans are going to be in charge of government from here to eternity, it's not true. We've seen history. Democrats will take over at some point. And what I think Ted Cruz is rightly worried about is this idea. 'OK, well, if Democrats take over and then they do exactly what we've done, what does that mean for stations that we like?'"President Donald Trump, speaking in the Oval Office later Friday: "The people have given your networks no credibility. If they did, they wouldn't vote for me... The networks, they have a licensing procedure and they have to show honesty and integrity."So, I think Brendan Carr is a great patriot and I disagree with Ted Cruz on that."Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett, in a press release Thursday: "The Republican Party has demonstrated that free speech clearly isn't free for everyone. The Free Speech Act of 2025 will prevent the FCC from using its power to unlawfully censor voices or force media companies to align with a political agenda."That kind of overreach is a direct step toward authoritarianism. It is critical that we add these protections so Americans can freely express their opinions—without fear, without coercion, and regardless of politics."What Happens NextABC's owner, Disney, is facing backlash over the decision to pull Kimmel's show, while President Donald Trump has insisted that late-night shows are not allowed to mock him.Update 9/19/25, 3:20 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
