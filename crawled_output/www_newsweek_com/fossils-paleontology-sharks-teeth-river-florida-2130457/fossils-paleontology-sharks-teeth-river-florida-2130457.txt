ScienceFossilsViralTrendsRedditOnlineInternetMoreNews ArticleMan Wades Through Florida River, Discovers Pile of Fossilized Shark TeethPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 08:25 AM EDTBy Alice GibbsSenior Life and Trends ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA Southwest Florida man has shared his incredible haul of fossilized shark teeth, found while sifting through the Peace River.Michael VanEtten, 46, has been combing Florida rivers and streams for fossils most of his life. His latest find—a mound of teeth shared in the r/sharkteeth Reddit community—were deposited by a variety of prehistoric shark species."I have been collecting fossils all my life. I find them in the Peace River area of Hardee County," VanEtten told Newsweek."I wade the rivers and streams with my scoop and sifter. When I find some gravel, I sift it for the teeth. It's mostly shark teeth including bull, hastalis, lemon, megalodon, sand tiger and tiger sharks."Sometimes I get lucky and find Ice Age mammals including camels, early whales and horses."The Peace River is known among paleontologists and amateur fossil hunters alike as a hotspot for finding prehistoric remains.In 2021, a group of scuba divers discovered a rare Ice Age mammal bone at the bottom of the same river....Fossil hunting is a hugely popular pastime in Florida, largely thanks to the state's unique geology. According to the Florida Museum of Natural History, Florida's fossil record stretches back more than 50 million years, with shark teeth among the most common finds in beaches, creek beds and riverbeds.The state is also home to some of the world's best Ice Age mammal fossils, including giant ground sloths, mastodons and saber-toothed cats.In recent years, fossil discoveries have made headlines across the state, from a 12-million-year-old megalodon tooth washing up on a Florida beach to a 6-inch megalodon tooth found off the Florida coast.With more than 15 million acres of publicly accessible land, enthusiasts flock to Florida's waterways and exposed rock beds in search of ancient treasures—though permits are required for vertebrate fossils other than shark teeth.Even outside of riverbeds, fossil finds can be surprising. For example, utility workers once uncovered an ancient bone fragment from a mastodon....VanEtten said his haul occasionally includes crocodile and alligator teeth. He described the thrill of fossil hunting as "addictive.""I'm always excited to see what's in the next scoop. It's always a surprise and very exciting," he said.The collector, who recently joined Reddit to connect with other fossil enthusiasts, was inspired to share his discovery after seeing similar posts."It's been very interesting," he said. "I enjoy helping people learn about fossils and love to answer questions and offer advice."Reddit users were quick to marvel at the find. One commenter wrote: "Amazing. Was telling my wife about this type of find as we walked the beach looking for teeth."Another added: "Wow! I have access to beachcombing the Miocene deposits on the western shore of Chesapeake, but never get a haul like that!"Do you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?
