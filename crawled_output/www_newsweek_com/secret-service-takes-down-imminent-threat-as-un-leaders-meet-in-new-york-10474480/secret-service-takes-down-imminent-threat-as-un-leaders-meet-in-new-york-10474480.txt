NewsSecret serviceUnited NationsNew YorkBreaking NewsNews ArticleSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat As UN Leaders Meet in New YorkPublishedSep 23, 2025 at 07:26 AM EDTupdatedSep 23, 2025 at 06:44 PM EDTBy Shane CroucherBreaking News EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Secret Service said it dismantled a telecommunications network throughout the New York tristate area that was used to direct threats toward senior U.S. government officials and which posed an imminent threat to its ability to protect them.All the devices were found within 35 miles of the United Nations General Assembly meeting of world leaders in New York City that kicked off on Monday, September 22. The Secret Service release said its early analysis shows communications between "nation-state threat actors" and individuals "known to federal law enforcement."It did not specify who the states or individuals involved are. No arrests have been made so far. Officials said they haven’t uncovered a direct plot to disrupt the U.N. General Assembly and note there are no known credible threats to New York City.The 300 co-located SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards had the potential to shut down New York City's entire cellular network, among other telecoms attacks, such as crippling denial of services attacks, and it could enable encrypted communication between bad actors. The investigation is ongoing."The potential for disruption to our country’s telecommunications posed by this network of devices cannot be overstated," U.S. Secret Service Director Sean Curran said in a statement."The U.S. Secret Service’s protective mission is all about prevention, and this investigation makes it clear to potential bad actors that imminent threats to our protectees will be immediately investigated, tracked down and dismantled."Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s New York field office, said in a video shared by the agency that it "can’t be understated what this system is capable of doing.""It can take down cell towers, so then no longer can people communicate, right? … You can’t text message, you can’t use your cellphone. And if you coupled that with some sort of other event associated with UNGA, you know, use your imagination there, it could be catastrophic to the city," McCool said....When agents entered the sites, they found rows of servers and shelves stacked with SIM cards.More than 100,000 were already active, investigators said, but there were also large numbers waiting to be deployed, evidence that operators were preparing to double or even triple the network’s capacity, McCool said. He described it as a well-funded, highly organized enterprise, one that cost millions of dollars in hardware and SIM cards alone.The operation had the capability of sending up to 30 million text messages a minute, McCool said.Officials also warned of the havoc the network could have caused if left intact. McCool compared the potential impact to the cellular blackouts that followed the September 11 attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing, when networks collapsed under strain. In this case, he said, attackers would have been able to force that kind of shutdown at a time of their choosing."Could there be others?" said McCool. "It’d be unwise to think that there’s not other networks out there being made in other cities in the United States."Updated, 9/23/25, 8:12 a.m. ET: This article was updated with more information.This article includes reporting by The Associated Press.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
