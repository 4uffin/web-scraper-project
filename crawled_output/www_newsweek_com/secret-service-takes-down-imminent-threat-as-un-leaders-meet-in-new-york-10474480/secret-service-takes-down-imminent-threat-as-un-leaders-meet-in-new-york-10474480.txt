The Secret Service release said its early analysis shows communications between "nation-state threat actors" and individuals "known to federal law enforcement."It did not specify who the states or individuals involved are. No arrests have been made so far. Officials said they haven’t uncovered a direct plot to disrupt the U.N. General Assembly and note there are no known credible threats to New York City.The 300 co-located SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards had the potential to shut down New York City's entire cellular network, among other telecoms attacks, such as crippling denial of services attacks, and it could enable encrypted communication between bad actors. The investigation is ongoing."The potential for disruption to our country’s telecommunications posed by this network of devices cannot be overstated," U.S. Secret Service Director Sean Curran said in a statement."The U.S. Secret Service’s protective mission is all about prevention, and this investigation makes it clear to potential bad actors that imminent threats to our protectees will be immediately investigated, tracked down and dismantled."Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s New York field office, said in a video shared by the agency that it "can’t be understated what this system is capable of doing.""It can take down cell towers, so then no longer can people communicate, right? … You can’t text message, you can’t use your cellphone. And if you coupled that with some sort of other event associated with UNGA, you know, use your imagination there, it could be catastrophic to the city," McCool said....When agents entered the sites, they found rows of servers and shelves stacked with SIM cards.More than 100,000 were already active, investigators said, but there were also large numbers waiting to be deployed, evidence that operators were preparing to double or even triple the network’s capacity, McCool said. He described it as a well-funded, highly organized enterprise, one that cost millions of dollars in hardware and SIM cards alone.The operation had the capability of sending up to 30 million text messages a minute, McCool said.Officials also warned of the havoc the network could have caused if left intact. McCool compared the potential impact to the cellular blackouts that followed the September 11 attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing, when networks collapsed under strain. In this case, he said, attackers would have been able to force that kind of shutdown at a time of their choosing."Could there be others?" said McCool. "It’d be unwise to think that there’s not other networks out there being made in other cities in the United States."Updated, 9/23/25, 8:12 a.m. ET: This article was updated with more information.This article includes reporting by The Associated Press.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
