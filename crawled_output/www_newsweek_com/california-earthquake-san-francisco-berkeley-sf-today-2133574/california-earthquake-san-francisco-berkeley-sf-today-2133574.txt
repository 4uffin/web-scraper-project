A 4.3 magnitude earthquake struck Berkeley, California, on Monday morning, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. Neighboring San Francisco felt the tremor.The quake struck shortly before 3 a.m. PDT, around 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) east-southeast of Berkeley, the USGS recorded, and had a depth of 7.8 kilometers.It was initially recorded as a 4.6 magnitude tremor, but was later revised to a lower magnitude. There was a green alert for shaking-related fatalities and economic losses. "There is a low likelihood of casualties and damage," the USGS said.Social media users in the area reported that it was the strongest earthquake they had felt in a long time. More than 24,000 people registered with the USGS that they had felt the earthquake.
San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit system posted an alert on X that an "earthquake occurred within the area serviced by BART.""Trains are running at reduced speeds while we complete safety track inspections. Please expect residual delays of up to 20 minutes systemwide," the alert said.The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management (DEM) said that "911 received an increase in calls from people who felt shaking," but there were "no reports of injuries" in the city."While DEM has not received any damage reports, we are continuing to check with infrastructure partners to confirm and evaluate any potential impacts to morning commutes," it said in a post on X."While 911 received an increase in calls from people who felt shaking, there have been no reports of injuries in San Francisco at this time, the city's Department of Emergency Management posted on X.

San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said officials would provide an update later in the day after first responders assessed for any impact."Stay prepared, San Francisco. Remember to drop, cover, and hold on when shaking starts," Lurie said on X, directing locals to the city's earthquake advice portal.More than seven million people live in the Bay Area. It is located near the San Andreas Fault, a source of significant earthquakes.The San Andreas Fault runs about 750 miles from the Salton Sea in Southern California to Cape Mendocino in Northern California. It passes near major urban areas, including Los Angeles and San Francisco.In 1906, a huge earthquake destroyed swathes of San Francisco, sparking fires and killing hundreds, perhaps even thousands of people.Seismologists warn that another massive earthquake, dubbed the "Big One," should be expected along the San Andreas Fault in the future. But earthquakes are currently extremely hard to predict.Update 9/22/25, 10:10 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.
