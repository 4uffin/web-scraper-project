NewsPoliceMarijuanaTexasBreaking NewsNews ArticleTexas Police Officer Fired for Smoking Marijuana in Jail BathroomPublishedSep 19, 2025 at 02:48 PM EDTupdatedSep 19, 2025 at 03:42 PM EDTBy Amanda CastroLive Blog EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA Bexar County sheriff's deputy was arrested Thursday night after admitting to smoking marijuana inside a staff restroom at the county's detention center, according to a statement from the sheriff's office. Deputy Ivan Estrada, 23, who joined the department in April, now faces two criminal charges: possession of a controlled substance and introducing a prohibited item into a correctional facility.Why It MattersThe arrest raises concerns about internal accountability and drug use within law enforcement agencies, particularly in correctional settings where contraband poses serious risks. Estrada's case also underscores the importance of peer reporting and swift administrative action in maintaining public trust....What To KnowAround 9 p.m. Thursday, a deputy on break reported "a strong odor of marijuana coming from a staff restroom" at the detention center, the Bexar Sheriff's Office told Newsweek. Investigators determined Estrada had been the last person to use the restroom and questioned him about the smell.Initially denying any drug use, Estrada later admitted to smoking a vape pen and voluntarily handed it over to investigators. Subsequent testing confirmed the presence of THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana.Estrada was charged with possession of a controlled substance and introducing a prohibited item into a correctional facility. Both charges stem from his alleged use of the vape pen while on duty inside a secure area.Because Estrada was still within his probationary employment period, the sheriff's office issued an immediate dismissal. Under department rules, he cannot appeal the decision or return to the agency in the future.The Public Integrity Unit is handling the criminal case. At the same time, Internal Affairs has launched a parallel administrative investigation to review the incident and any potential policy violations, the office told Newsweek.The incident was confirmed by Sheriff Javier Salazar, who praised the deputies who reported the violation and assisted in the investigation. Estrada was booked into the South Tower facility and has been issued an order of dismissal. The sheriff's office said he is not eligible for rehire and cannot appeal the termination under civil service rules.What People Are SayingIn a statement to Fox San Antonio, Sheriff Javier Salazar said: "[H]alf a dozen dedicated deputies worked to bring someone to justice who violated his oath. That oathbreaker is now in jail and unemployed. I'm thankful to this dedicated group who went above and beyond to ensure swift justice."What Happens NextEstrada's case will proceed through the criminal justice system, with further disciplinary findings possible pending the outcome of the internal investigation. The sheriff's office has not announced whether additional policy reviews will follow.Update 09/19/25 3:41 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.
