NewsImmigrationICEMigrantsNew YorkGuatemalaLong islandNews ArticleTeen to Self-Deport After ICE Detained Him Weeks Before GraduationPublishedSep 17, 2025 at 05:23 PM EDTBy Andrew StantonWeekend Staff WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA teenager has decided to self-deport from the United States after being detained by federal immigration agents weeks before his high school graduation.Newsweek reached out to his attorney and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for comment via email.Why It MattersPresident Donald Trump campaigned on mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, specifically targeting those with violent criminal records, and his administration ramped up immigration enforcement since his return to office in January. However, many Americans have been critical of his immigration policy, as individuals with misdemeanors, decades-old infractions, or, in some cases, no criminal records at all have been swept up in the heightened enforcement.What to KnowAlvaro Velasquez, 18, traveled to the United States from Guatemala when he was 16 years old and settled on Long Island. His mother had died prior to his move to the U.S., and he does not have contact with his father, reported local news station WABC....He was set to graduate from Roosevelt High School in June, but was detained by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and transferred to Texas before the ceremony, the station reported.Valesquez, who does not have a criminal record, agreed to self-deport during a virtual hearing on Tuesday, according to WABC.His attorney, Pallvi Babbar, told the station that while he entered the country unlawfully, he went through the courts and was granted deferred action."He wasn't doing anything wrong. He was in the car with his guardian, going back from the grocery store," Babbar said.Babbar told Newsday that he was "frustrated" and "done with being isolated in the facility."She said she is concerned he does not recognize "what hardships he's about to face" back in Guatemala, where he does not have any relatives to return to.What People Are SayingTricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of Homeland Security, wrote in a statement to Newsweek: "Alvaro Castro-Velasquez is an illegal alien from Guatemala who illegally crossed the southern border and was apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol May 6, 2022. Castro was released into our country by the Biden administration.ICE arrested Castro June 1 pursuant to a warrant of arrest. He is in ICE custody and undergoing removal proceedings."Secretary Noem is reversing Biden's catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets. This Administration is once again implementing the rule of law."Jessica Harrison, who taught social studies at Roosevelt High School, told WABC: "He was so wonderful. He was the student that every teacher would dream to have."What Happens NextVelasquez will now return to Guatemala. Babbar told Newsday that she is hoping he can briefly return to New York to say goodbye to his friends, family and teachers.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
