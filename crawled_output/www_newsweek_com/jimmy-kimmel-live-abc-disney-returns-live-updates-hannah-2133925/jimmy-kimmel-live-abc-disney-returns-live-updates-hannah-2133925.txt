"He's back on air because those executives got a wakeup call from the American public."People all over the country showed up, canceling subscriptions, protesting outside ABC and Disney, Nexstar and more, and made it damn clear this political alliance with Trump was not in Disney's best interest. Trump's authoritarian playbook is unpopular, and when these CEOs comply, it's not only cowardly. It's unstrategic."While we're glad Kimmel is back on air, the fight doesn't end here. FCC Chairman Carr still must be hauled up to Congress to testify. Sinclair and Nexstar must commit to airing the program and drop their wild demands. And Bob Iger and Disney must make it clear they are fully opposed to being bullied by Trump and his cronies."Sep 22, 2025 at 06:59 PM EDTSean Spicer asks if censorship accusations were wrong as Kimmel set to return to airFormer White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer asked on X on Monday, if the accusations of Trump administration "censorship" had been incorrect, as Jimmy Kimmel prepares to return to air on Tuesday."So if Kimmel returns tomorrow than I guess all then censorship calls were wrong?" he wrote.There were strong calls of censorship and even accusations of fascism made against the Trump administration last week after Kimmel was suspended in the wake of comments by FCC Chair Brendan Carr.Loading twitter content...Sep 22, 2025 at 06:49 PM EDTDavid Hogg welcomes Kimmel’s returnDavid Hogg, a gun control activist who served as a co-vice chair of the Democrat National Committee, welcomed Jimmy Kimmel's return to air on Monday."He's back!"

They're not allowed to do that."Earlier during the plane-based press conference the president said "maybe their license should be taken away," in reference to those networks that aren't positive about him.The comments come amid fallout over the axing of late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! after comments the host made regarding the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk in Utah on September 10.Read in full from John Toher on Newsweek.

Trump said Kimmel had said "a horrible thing" about Kirk and praised ABC's decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! off the air.The dispute cuts to the heart of how far government officials can pressure media outlets without violating the First Amendment. If regulators can threaten broadcasters' licenses to influence programming decisions, critics warn it could chill not only comedians but also journalists, academics and other public voices from speaking freely.The outcome could set an important precedent for media independence and democratic norms in an era of escalating political polarization.Trump was asked by a reporter if he was going to have Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr weigh in on late-night show hosts the president has previously criticized."Ninety-seven percent [of TV networks] against, they give me only bad publicity or press," he replied. "I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away."Trump added that such decisions would be left up to Carr, who he called a "patriot."When asked by a reporter who he thinks should replace Jimmy Kimmel, Trump replied:"A lot of people, anybody could replace him. The guy had no talent. Kimmel had, look, he was fired. He had no talent. He's a whack job, but he had no talent, and more importantly the talent, he had, because a lot of people have no talent to get ratings, but he had no ratings. His ratings were worse than Colbert, I think," referring to the CBS late-night TV host whose own eponymous show was canceled in July and will end next May."They got rid of Colbert, which was a good thing to do and look, that's something that should be talked about for licensing too. When you have a network and you have evening shows and all they do is hit Trump," the president continued."All they do is hit Trump. They're licensed. They're not allowed to do that," he added.When asked to comment on the remarks, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Newsweek that the late-night talk show hosts are "nothing more than an arm of the Democrat party."The president's comments are likely to add to the fierce backlash over the administration's perceived crackdown on critical voices or perceived liberal bias in the media.Read in full from John Toher on Newsweek.Sep 22, 2025 at 04:26 PM EDTWhat did Jimmy Kimmel say about Charlie Kirk?On September 15, during his opening monologue, Kimmel addressed the fallout from Kirk's killing, saying, "Many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk."He added, "The MAGA gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it."On September 18, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr publicly warned that broadcasters airing content like Kimmel's could face regulatory review, a statement critics argued was intended to pressure networks into compliance.Hours later, ABC announced that it was indefinitely suspending Jimmy Kimmel Live!—which premiered on the network on January 26, 2003.In an interview with podcaster Benny Johnson, Carr said: "We can do this the easy way or the hard way.
