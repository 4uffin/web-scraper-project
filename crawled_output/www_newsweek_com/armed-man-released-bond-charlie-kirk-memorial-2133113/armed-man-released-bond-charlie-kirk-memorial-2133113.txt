Joshua Runkles, 42, has been charged with impersonating a law enforcement officer and carrying a weapon into a prohibited place after being arrested Friday at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, according to information provided to Newsweek by the Arizona Department of Public Safety.The arrest occurred at the venue where Charlie Kirk's memorial service is scheduled to take place on Sunday.Runkles was released on bond after being booked into the Maricopa County Jail.Why It MattersKirk, the 31-year-old co-founder of conservative campaign group Turning Point USA, was shot dead on September 10 while addressing students at the Utah Valley University campus in Orem.The killing sparked fresh fears about political violence in the U.S. after President Donald Trump, then the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, narrowly survived an assassination attempt in July 2024.According to prosecutors, Trump survived a second attempt two months later in September 2024 and 59-year-old Ryan Routh has been charged over the incident. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.What To KnowOn Friday afternoon Runkles was taken into custody at State Farm Stadium in Glendale after exhibiting suspicious behavior, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety. The U.S. Secret Service initially approached the individual, who falsely claimed to be a member of law enforcement and stated that he was armed.The Arizona Department of Public Safety confirmed to Newsweek that Runkles is not a law enforcement officer. He was booked into the Maricopa County Jail on two charges: impersonating a law enforcement officer (Class 6 felony) and carrying a weapon into a prohibited place (Class 1 misdemeanor).According to a federal source familiar with the investigation, Runkles is "a former deputy sheriff out of Idaho" who "came and identified himself with expired credentials". The man allegedly told Secret Service agents that he was at the site to provide private security, though no authorization for this has been found.Police are expecting approximately 100,000 people to attend Kirk's memorial service at State Farm Stadium and an overflow arena on Sunday. President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, along with several administration officials, are scheduled to speak at the memorial. Erika Kirk, who was named Turning Point USA's new CEO, is also scheduled to speak. Musical artists Lee Greenwood and Steve Amerson have been added to the performance lineup.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated the memorial service as a "Special Event Assessment Rating Level 1," which is "reserved for events of the highest national significance" and the same severity as the Super Bowl. State Farm Stadium has fixed seating for 63,400 and can expand to over 73,000 for larger events.What People Are SayingArizona Department of Public Safety told Newsweek: "An investigation is ongoing to determine his intent and purpose at the stadium. Runkles has since been released on bond."In a statement about Friday's incident, the Secret Service said: "The individual is not a member of authorized law enforcement working the event and is currently in custody."The U.S. Secret Service and local law enforcement are investigating the circumstances as to why he was at the location."
