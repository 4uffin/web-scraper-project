NewsIranNuclear dealTrumpNews ArticleIran Hits Back at TrumpPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 07:41 AM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 08:20 AM EDTBy Amir DaftariNews ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberIran has forcefully rejected President Donald Trump’s recounting of an earlier outreach to suspend its nuclear program, blasting it as an intolerable attempt to undermine its defenses. Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, said that Washington’s plan included a demand to cut missile ranges below 500 kilometers (over 300 miles)—a clause he said “no man of honor could accept.”Newsweek has reached out to the U.S. State Department and Iran's Foreign Ministry for comment. Why It MattersTrump’s proposal letter, sent earlier in 2025, included conditions such as suspending Iran’s nuclear program and limiting its missile capabilities. Iran’s rejection of these terms contributed to a diplomatic deadlock that preceded the 12-day war with Israel and strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Iran’s capabilities influence the security calculations of Israel, Gulf states, and neighboring countries, and any renewed conflict could disrupt energy markets and threaten global stability. With both sides publicly dug in, the potential for another confrontation remains high....What To KnowAt the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, Trump recalled a letter he said he sent “shortly after taking office." The correspondence, delivered through an Emirati intermediary, offered full cooperation if Iran agreed to suspend its nuclear program. It reportedly set a two-month deadline for talks and carried the warning that “all options remain on the table” if Iran refused. Trump also described Iran as the “world’s number one sponsor of terror,” emphasizing that the letter was intended to prevent the country from acquiring a nuclear weapon.Iran’s Missile Red LineLarijani disclosed that the American plan demanded Iran restrict its missile range to under 500 kilometers. He characterized the condition as fundamentally unacceptable, saying it crossed a sovereignty red line. Missiles remain a cornerstone of Iran’s deterrence strategy, and agreeing to such terms would be seen domestically as a major capitulation. However, Iran's top security official added that Tehran remains open to negotiations if they are genuinely fair and protects national interests.Larijani also highlighted earlier engagements with European and Russian initiatives, which Tehran accepted with reservations for a six-month negotiation window. Those tracks, he argued, collapsed when commitments were not honored and parties pushed for U.N. snapback sanctions....Rejection of Direct TalksIranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has ruled out direct negotiations with the U.S., describing such talks as “a sheer dead end.” In a recorded address broadcast on Tuesday, Khamenei criticized the U.S. approach under Trump, stating, “The U.S. has announced the result of the talks in advance… This is not a negotiation. It is a diktat, an imposition.” What People Are SayingSecretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Ali Larijani: “In the initial American plan, they set a condition that no man of honor could accept — to cut the missile range to less than 500 kilometers. Is such a thing imaginable for any Iranian?”President Donald Trump: “The world’s number one sponsor of terror can never be allowed to possess the most dangerous weapon. That’s why, shortly after taking office, I sent the so-called Supreme Leader a letter making a generous offer. I extended a pledge of full cooperation in exchange for a suspension of Iran’s nuclear program. The regime’s answer was to continue their constant threats to their neighbours and US interests throughout the region and some great countries that are right nearby.”What Happens NextWith Tehran publicly rejecting missile restrictions and refusing direct negotiations, diplomacy remains stalled. The potential for renewed mediation exists through Europe, Russia, or Gulf intermediaries, but the risk of sanctions escalation, regional clashes, or additional strikes remains high.
