Japan‚Äîa key United States ally near Russia, China and North Korea‚Äîmay consider developing nuclear-powered submarines amid threats posed by regional adversaries.Newsweek has contacted the Russian and Chinese foreign ministries and the North Korean Embassy in Beijing for comment.Why It MattersUnder the U.S. island chain strategy, Japan forms part of a north-south defensive line known as the first island chain, which helps Washington project military power to keep its adversaries‚ÄîRussia, China and North Korea‚Äîat bay and deter aggression.
Nuclear-powered submarines have operational advantages because they offer virtually unlimited endurance, speed and range. Both Russia and China operate this type of submarine, while North Korea has reportedly received Russian help to develop its own.Japan's potential development of nuclear-powered submarines comes as the Pentagon maintains a submarine presence in the western Pacific to bolster its defense posture.What To KnowAn expert panel formed by Japan's Defense Ministry to explore ways to strengthen the country's defense capabilities submitted a report to Defense Minister Gen Nakatani on Friday, calling for the development of advanced submarines, according to local media.The report also highlighted the need to consider "next-generation propulsion systems." While it did not explicitly mention nuclear propulsion, The Asahi Shimbun reported that previous panel discussions suggested the term refers to "compact nuclear reactors."Japan's defense white paper, released earlier this year, reported that the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) operated 22 nonnuclear submarines as of March 31. The fleet is divided into the Oyashio, Soryu and Taigei classes, according to the JMSDF.In addition to extended-range and long-duration capabilities, the advanced submarines proposed by the expert panel should be equipped with the vertical launching system (VLS) to fire long-range missiles for counterstrikes, directly striking enemy territory.According to the defense outlet Naval News, a VLS-equipped submarine can enhance interoperability with the U.S. Navy, which equips most of its submarines with VLS-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles‚Äîa weapon of which Japan has acquired 400.

However, the development of nuclear-powered submarines could raise questions about Japan's commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, The Asahi Shimbun noted. Japan is the only country to have been attacked with nuclear weapons‚Äîtwice in 1945.What People Are SayingAn expert panel formed by Japan's Defense Ministry reported on Friday: "Submarines are strategic assets that can be deployed covertly. ‚Ä¶ It is desirable to equip them with long-range missiles and enable long-distance, extended travel and submerged navigation. To achieve this, we must advance necessary research and technological development, including consideration of next-generation propulsion systems, without being bound by conventional approaches."Japan's 2025 defense white paper said: "The existing order of world peace is being seriously challenged, and Japan finds itself in the most severe and complex security environment of the post-war era. ‚Ä¶ The Ministry of Defense (MOD) and the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) are fundamentally reinforcing Japan's defense capabilities with independence and initiative, in an effort to protect the lives and peaceful livelihoods of Japanese people and resolutely defend Japan's territorial land, waters, and airspace."What Happens NextJapan's Defense Ministry plans to move forward with discussions on strengthening defense capabilities based on the expert panel's report, according to The Asahi Shimbun.
