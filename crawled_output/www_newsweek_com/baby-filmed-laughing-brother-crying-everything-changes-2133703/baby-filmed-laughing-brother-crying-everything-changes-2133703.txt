Family & ParentingFamilyParentingSiblingsViralNews ArticleBaby Filmed Laughing—When She Hears Brother Crying Everything ChangesPublishedSep 22, 2025 at 01:12 PM EDTBy Daniella GrayFamily and Parenting ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA Seattle mom attempting to film her baby's laughter on camera wasn't prepared for what she captured instead.Sara Angulo (@saralynnangulo) set up her camera hoping to document a memory of her youngest child, Eleanor, who had just turned 1; nothing "planned or posed," she said.Angulo, mom to 5-year-old Cooper, Charlotte, 4, Henry, 2, and baby Eleanor with husband Stephen, told Newsweek that the details of their early years seem to change daily—and she wanted to hold onto this season of baby giggles....But, just seconds into filming, the scene shifted. Henry, who was upset and crying downstairs, made his way up to her."He was coming to me for comfort, so I opened my arms and let him fall into me," Angulo said.What the video captured next melted hearts online: Eleanor, noticing her brother's distress and her mother's attention shifting, paused her laughter to comfort him.Angulo said she was struck by how her baby responded. Instead of demanding attention back, Eleanor gave her brother space, then returned with a gift—Mr. Potato Head legs, one of Henry's favorite toys.At first, Henry pushed her away, not ready for comfort, but she tried again. This time, her persistence worked. Henry took the toy, said "thank you," and started to laugh with his sister."Looking back, I love seeing my daughter notice her big brother notice my attention shift, and simply make space for him as he needed me," Angulo said. "She's the youngest of four; her patience and understanding of my need to shift and divide my attention is remarkable."For Angulo, the moment was also a quiet validation of her approach to parenting. She and Stephen focus on teaching their children to understand one another's needs.Sometimes, that means giving hugs; other times, sharing a silly distraction or a toy. "It's one of those parenting moments where you realize they really are absorbing what you're trying to teach," she said.With the four children close in age, Sara said that brings the usual sibling ups and downs, but at their core, they "love and care for each other fiercely."Sara posted the wholesome moment in a reel on Instagram, clocking up over 295,000 views within a week. In the comments, users couldn't get enough of the sibling interaction."This made my day. So wholesome," one user wrote."Look at the love, the patience, the empathy, the boundaries!" another added.A third commented, "My little toddlers are just like this. The love they have for each other is just so pure and beautiful to witness."Sara said the response was overwhelming online. "Motherhood is full of hard and messy moments, but then you get these glimpses of who your children really are becoming and it makes every bit worth it."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting3 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
