He said that "many in MAGA land" were trying to "characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them ... doing everything they can to score political points from it."Boycott calls have grown after ABC, which is owned by Disney, announced it would indefinitely suspend the show following complaints from the Federal Communications Commission (FFC) chair, Brendan Carr.Trump appointee Carr said Kimmel's comments were "appearing to directly mislead the American public."What To KnowVarious subscribers have taken to social media to express their anger at the move, with some saying they are cancelling their subscriptions altogether.X, formerly Twitter, user Reed Galen wrote: "Goodbye, @DisneyPlus. I won't miss you," accompanied by an image of his cancelled subscriptions. Actor Misha Collins said he would be "canceling my @DisneyPlus subscription "indefinitely."Related StoriesVideo of Barack Obama Responding to Heckler Takes Off Online4 min. readSteve Bannon Urges Investigation of Spencer Cox After Charlie Kirk Shooting4 min. readJoe Rogan Says He’s Not a Republican—’You’re Gonna Need Some Socialism’6 min. read"I believe in free markets and free speech, so I canceled @DisneyPlus ,@Hulu , and @ESPNPlus.

"Weird. @DisneyPlus keeps crashing when I try to cancel my subscription," she said. "Wonder if it's a bit busy?"The anger isn't just contained online.

Demonstrators told CNN that they had already canceled their Disney+ subscriptions in protest against the move.Actor Jake Ferree, who was holding a sign that read "Disney stop bowing to a dictator," told CNN, "This affects every aspect of free speech. We should be able to express ourselves. That's the point of art."Film production accountant Taylor Smith said she hopes that this "wakes people up" as she warned that the implications were bigger than just Kimmel.What People Are SayingThe suspension of the show has been met with condemnation and praise from both sides of the political spectrum.Brendan Carr said on Thursday: "We're going to continue to hold these broadcasters accountable to the public interest - and if broadcasters don't like that simple solution, they can turn their licence in to the FCC."President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: "Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT."Posting on X, former President Barack Obama wrote: "After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn't like."X account Republicans Against Trump posted: "Not a big fan of Jimmy Kimmel, but if you think his show should be canceled for this, you're a hack and a total fraud who should never pretend to care about free speech."Former Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg posted: "What's happening with Jimmy Kimmel is about politics and power. Any corporation that thinks they can win by playing Trump's game will wind up regretting it, sooner or later, because he will never have enough."What Happens NextThe future of Kimmel's show hangs in the balance. Disney executives met with Kimmel on Thursday to discuss the matter.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting3 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
