When Eminem made a cameo in Chrysler's 2011 Super Bowl ad, cruising through Detroit's streets in a stylish new sedan to the strains of gospel and hip-hop, the message to the recession-weary audience was pointed: In America, there's always a comeback story waiting just around the corner."What does a town that's been to hell and back know about the finer things in life?" the narrator intones.At two minutes, it was among the longest commercials ever shown during a Super Bowl, and has since been voted by the public and the media as one of the greatest commercials of all time. The ad worked because it wasn't really about selling cars. It was a reclamation ‚Äî of grit, of identity, of pride. A battered but unbroken city staring back at the country that had dismissed it.The tagline clinched it: "Imported From Detroit."Fourteen years later, long after Chrysler discontinued the model it paid Eminem to pitch, the Motor City is humming with life.
On a late summer afternoon, Detroit's outgoing mayor Mike Duggan sits in his office overlooking the Detroit River and the hulking General Motors headquarters, reflecting on what that hometown pride means today."The pride is back," he says. "People are proud of this city. When visitors come from out of town now, Detroiters take them down and show them the riverfront. They take them to the train station. We have a long way to go, but we now have a riverfront that's a unifying site for everybody in Detroit."It is a stark contrast to the Detroit the mayor inherited in 2013. The city had just filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history, staggering under $18 billion in debt. Nearly half the streetlights didn't work, more than 47,000 homes stood vacant or burned out and arson claimed as many as 12,000 buildings a year. Unemployment topped 20 percent in the wake of the Great Recession. As the rest of the country recovered, slowly but surely, from the depths of the global financial crisis, it seemed Motown would once again be left behind."For a lot of years, the only time the national media paid attention to Detroit was auto plant closings, financial crisis and poverty," Duggan told Newsweek in an exclusive sit-down interview as he prepares to leave office."I still have at home the cover of Newsweek that says 'bankruptcy' on it."
The bankruptcy marked the lowest point in a long story of urban decline and disrepair, during which the city lost more than 200,000 residents in a decade. Entire neighborhoods were left hollow, and downtown struggled to offer even the basics‚Äîa place to grab a coffee, go for a run, or meet friends for a drink. When the Super Bowl came to Detroit in 2006 organizers went so far as to paint over empty storefronts to make them appear occupied.Deals Over DramaDuggan wasn't even supposed to be on the ballot a decade ago. After being thrown out of the 2013 Democratic primary on a technicality, he mounted a write-in campaign and stunned the city's political establishment by winning the mayoral race‚Äîbecoming Detroit's first white mayor in nearly 40 years in a majority-Black city."I went to people's houses every night and sat in their living rooms," Duggan recalled in his interview with Newsweek while driving downtown in his personal Jeep. "We need a city where everybody's valued, everybody is welcome. We dropped the us-versus-them politics."That style of reconciliation carried into City Hall. "I have not vetoed an action of the Detroit City Council in 12 years," he said. "We worked out a middle ground so that publicly we weren't attacking each other. Businesses can go anywhere, and they do not want to go to a community with chaos and uncertainty."

He still drives his own car to meetings, often personally ferrying visitors through Detroit's neighborhoods to show off new projects. That everyday style‚Äîdirect, pragmatic‚Äîwon over investors as much as voters. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who committed $200 million to Detroit's comeback, said the city under Duggan's leadership created an environment "where it was easy to invest and easy to build."The results of Duggan's business-friendly approach continued. Ford committed nearly $1 billion to restore the derelict Michigan Central Station into a gleaming new tech hub. GM put $2.2 billion into converting its Hamtramck plant into Factory Zero, dedicated to electric vehicles. Stellantis, the parent of Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler, opened the first new assembly line in the city in three decades, a $1.6 billion Jeep plant employing about 5,000 workers."I sat down with Mary Barra at GM, Bill Ford and Sergio Marchionne at Chrysler and asked them: what would it take to site your next plant in Detroit?" Duggan said. "They needed land, fast permitting, no drama on approvals and a workforce.We delivered, and they came."

Private money soon followed. Detroit-born billionaire Dan Gilbert moved Rocket Companies downtown and poured hundreds of millions into towers, lofts and storefronts. The influential Ilitch family, of Little Caesars fame, anchored redevelopment with an arena and mixed-use real estate using generous public subsidies. By 2024, more than 160 projects worth roughly $9 billion were underway or recently completed.Block by BlockWhen Duggan took office in 2014, Detroit was drowning in blight. The city's land bank owned more than 47,000 abandoned houses, a number so large that entire blocks had become ghost towns. Some were collapsing or fire-damaged, others left vacant after the house next door burned.Duggan made it his mission to turn that around. Through an aggressive strategy, the city created an online auction site, where they began selling off salvageable homes three at a time, every day.

"We saved every house that could be saved," he said. "We knocked down the ones that couldn't."Those removals were not without controversy. A federal probe in 2015 exposed corruption among contractors tied to demolition work, and critics balked when Duggan asked voters to approve $250 million in city bonds to continue the effort. Yet nearly 70 percent backed the measure, and since 2014, more than 12,000 homes have been rehabbed and reoccupied by new families."Property values have doubled or tripled in every neighborhood of this city, and the people who stayed are finally seeing their patience pay off, he said, citing a University of Michigan study.Yet, critics note that much of the visible revival has been concentrated downtown and Midtown, with outer neighborhoods still struggling with poverty and boarded-up shops. Duggan's office counters that Detroit homeowners gained more than $4 billion in equity during his tenure, with most of those gains going to Black families who stayed through the decline.A Different PlaybookDuggan achieved his three-term run in a city that, like many others, had been battered by decades of decline and political division. White flight hollowed out the tax base, and what remained often hardened into a politics of grievance‚Äîracial, ethnic, suburban versus city‚Äîthat resisted reform. National debates only deepened the divides. In progressive enclaves, calls to "defund the police" became a rallying cry after 2020.In Detroit, Duggan went the other way."When I got elected, we had 750 carjackings a year‚Äîfifteen times a week somebody stuck a gun in one of our citizens' face and stole a car, usually senior citizens at gas stations," Duggan told Newsweek. "Now we're down to fewer than two a week‚Äîwe've cut it by 90 percent."Homicides, once topping 350 annually, fell to 203 in 2024‚Äîthe lowest since 1965. Non-fatal shootings dropped nearly 50 percent in two years. Project Green Light, the city's high-definition camera network at more than 1,000 businesses, has been credited with helping nearly eliminate robberies and carjackings on those premises.Privacy advocates also warned that widespread surveillance‚Äîespecially in a predominantly Black city‚Äîcould enable racial profiling. During the George Floyd protests, local groups like Detroit Will Breathe demanded an end to Project Green Light and facial recognition surveillance, labeling the program invasive and racist."People in Detroit don't think it was too tough," Duggan said, pushing back against those critics. "When you put violence prevention together with more cops and smarter enforcement, you can change the trajectory of your city. You've got to have everybody on board."

The Governor GambleAfter three terms ‚Äî Detroit doesn't have term limits for mayor ‚Äî Duggan said it had come time to step aside. The city had just posted back-to-back years of population growth for the first time since 1950, adding nearly 7,000 residents in 2024. The city has $500 million in reserves and, instead of nearly 50,000 abandoned houses, fewer than 1,000 are left for the next mayor to handle."Twelve years was long enough," Duggan told Newsweek. "The candidates running to succeed me are all talking about unity and building on the progress. I'm confident the city's in good hands."His decision not to seek a fourth term opened the door to another surprise: a run for governor of Michigan as an independent. In a moment when President Donald Trump routinely points to blue cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York as examples of failed Democratic governance, Duggan has carved out a different narrative, keeping Detroit out of Trump's megaphone‚Äîan achievement in itself."It would have been a lot easier to get elected governor as a Democrat," he said. "But then I'd have been part of the problem. Republicans and Democrats have been fighting in Lansing for two decades. We have to end politics as usual."That gamble has rattled the state's Democratic Party, which fears he could split the vote in 2026. In a crowded primary field, a May poll found Duggan to be the only candidate with favorable ratings from voters of all political stripes. Duggan, for his part, brushes off the criticism he's playing spoiler for Democrats."I'm running to get the two parties to work better together. Some Democrats are angry, but a lot of people come up to me and say, 'I've never been all one party or the other. I'm glad somebody speaks for me now.'"Duggan insists he is leaving Detroit in strong financial shape, but the recovery is far from guaranteed. Tariffs, in particular, loom as a threat. With three auto assembly plants in the city and a supply chain tied directly to neighboring Windsor, higher trade barriers with Canada‚Äîpushed by the Trump administration‚Äîcould cost Michigan's transportation sector more than 3,000 jobs."When you put a tariff on Canada, you put a tariff on cars assembled in Michigan," Duggan warned. "It's hurting us right now."For him, though, the ultimate test of his tenure is about identity. Detroit is no longer defined solely by its losses. "The pride is back," he repeated.It's the same pride Eminem captured in his 2011 Super Bowl ad, a two-minute manifesto daring the country to see Detroit differently. A decade-and-a-half later, Duggan argues, the city doesn't have to pretend anymore.
After three terms, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said it was about time to step aside.
