I'm a psychotherapist, not a prescriber. But nearly every week, patients ask me if they should go on antidepressants, often for struggles so minor it would be laughable if it didn't reveal something broken in our culture. One young woman panicked over a pimple and asked if she needed medication. Others show up after a few gray winter days or a stressful week, convinced a prescription is the only solution. Ordinary struggles are now treated as medical crises.That's why Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s recent comments about antidepressants struck such a nerve. Whatever one thinks of Kennedy, he surfaced a truth many Americans feel but rarely admit: millions rely on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and millions more wonder if they should. He was right to question the status quo. Where he went wrong was in making the drugs the villain. The deeper problem is a culture that reflexively medicates instead of teaching people how to cope.

Nearly a decade ago, I warned that America was becoming a nation too quick to pathologize ordinary struggle. That trend has only deepened. Prescriptions for SSRIs have soared. We now spend almost $300 billion a year on mental health care, yet rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide remain stubbornly high. In any other branch of medicine, this would be called failure.The overreliance on pills didn't happen by accident. In the 1990s, Prozac and its successors were marketed as lifestyle enhancers as much as medical treatments. Direct-to-consumer ads, legal only in the U.S. and New Zealand, trained people to view sadness as a chemical imbalance. That message, amplified by social media and reinforced by a hurried health care system, has left many Americans convinced that discomfort itself is pathological.Antidepressants, used properly, can be lifesaving. I have seen patients lifted from the darkest despair go on to live fulfilling lives. But today that truth is lost. Drugs meant for severe depression are now handed out for everyday distress. Pills are given for what amounts to a psychological sniffle. Just as no one should take morphine for a paper cut, antidepressants should not be the first response to ordinary stress or sadness. Yet patients ask for them, and doctors, sometimes after only minutes, comply.The damage is not only medical. It is cultural. Difficult emotions have been redefined as disorders to be erased rather than signals to be understood. Sadness, anger, fear, frustration: these are not pathologies. They are forces that push us to adapt, grow, and find purpose. Medication can dull pain, but it cannot provide insight, teach coping skills, or build resilience. That comes only from the work of therapy and the harder work of facing life directly.Most people have never been taught how to endure and process powerful emotions. Instead, they avoid them, often by numbing themselves with medication. The result is a nation quick to medicate but slow to mature, fluent in diagnoses yet struggling with resilience. And because this pattern is most visible among the young, who come of age in a culture that treats hardship as trauma, we risk raising a generation less equipped to handle the ordinary difficulties of adulthood.The system reinforces this weakness. Doctors are pressed to move quickly. Insurance often makes pills easier to obtain than therapy. Social media amplifies fragile emotions while pushing pharmaceutical relief. In this ecosystem, every human struggle is reframed as a disorder in need of a pill.I see the consequences every week. Some patients medicate every discomfort and remain fragile, always fearing the next setback. Others confront their struggles in therapy, in family, in work, and emerge steadier, stronger, more self-reliant. Struggle is not always a symptom. Often, it is simply part of the human experience.The solution is not to stigmatize antidepressants or glorify suffering. It is to restore balance. Reserve SSRIs for cases where they are clearly warranted. Make therapy a place of growth, not endless validation. And teach people that painful feelings are not dangerous but can be the raw material of resilience.Kennedy's comments touched off debate because they forced Americans to confront a larger truth: We are medicating away not only pain but also the capacity to endure it. That is the debate we should be having.If we want a healthier nation, we need to teach people how to face sadness, not erase it. Medication has its place, but resilience must be the goal.If you or someone you know is considering suicide, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988, text "988" to the Crisis Text Line at 741741 or go to 988lifeline.org.Jonathan Alpert is a psychotherapist practicing in New York City and Washington, D.C.
