WorldIsraelGazaDonald TrumpIsraeli-Palestinian ConflictNews ArticleIsraeli Official Says Gaza Could Be ‘Real Estate Bonanza’PublishedSep 18, 2025 at 06:33 AM EDTupdatedSep 18, 2025 at 08:42 AM EDTBy Ellie CookSenior Defense ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberIsrael's far-right finance minister has said that Gaza could become "a real estate bonanza" and that a "business plan" for the enclave had been sent to President Donald Trump.Why It MattersTrump previously said the U.S. could "take over" Gaza, displacing the enclave's residents and transforming the strip into the "Riviera of the Middle East." His comments were sharply criticized by Arab and European nations.In February, Trump also shared an AI-generated video of a glitzy, remodeled beach-resort Gaza Strip, with a fake version of himself sipping cocktails with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A plan for post-war Gaza circulating among Trump officials would see the U.S. oversee the transformation of the strip into a tourist hot spot and tech hub for at least a decade, the Washington Post reported in late August....What To Know"We have paid a lot of money for this war," Bezalel Smotrich said during an appearance at a conference in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, according to remarks widely published in Israeli media. "We have to see how we are dividing up the land in percentages.""There is a business plan, put together by the most professional people here, that is on President Trump's desk," Smotrich said, according to the Times of Israel.Newsweek has reached out to the White House for comment via email.The United Nations estimated in April that roughly 92 percent of all residential buildings in Gaza had been damaged or destroyed since October 2023. It added that it would take "decades" to remove rubble from the territory."We've done the demolition phase, which is always the first phase of urban renewal," Smotrich said. "Now we need to build. It's much cheaper."The minister has previously said he believes there is a "tremendous opportunity" for Israel in Gaza, adding: "We will occupy Gaza and make it an inseparable part of the State of Israel."Netanyahu said Israel would seize all of Gaza in May. Palestinian militant group Hamas had controlled Gaza since 2007.The Israeli military said in early September it was targeting high-rise buildings in Gaza City "in preparation for expanding the operation" in the northern area of the strip. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed this week that Israel had intensified its ground operations in Gaza City.CNN analysis published on September 12 showed Israel had destroyed or damaged more than 1,800 buildings in and around Gaza City in roughly a month, starting from shortly after Israel approved the new offensive in the city at the start of August.Much of the destruction in the city was down to Israeli bulldozers and excavating equipment, rather than the aftermath of attacks by the IDF, according to the report. Destroying civilian properly unless militarily necessary is illegal under international law.The U.K. government sanctioned Smotrich, along with security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, in June 2025 for "repeated incitements of violence against Palestinian communities." Several other countries, including Canada and Australia, have sanctioned Smotrich.What People Are SayingSmotrich said last month new plans to build thousands of homes in the occupied West Bank would "bury the idea of a Palestinian state."Adil Haque, a law professor at Rutgers University, told NBC News: "It's appalling that any state would seek to profit from the suffering and dispossession of a civilian population."Update 9/18/2025 at 08:41 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
