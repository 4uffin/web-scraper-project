This is how a 4-year-old mourns a goldfish,” Kimmel said. Why Did ABC Reinstate Jimmy Kimmel? On Monday, ABC's parent company, Disney, said it had come to the decision to reinstate the show following "thoughtful conversations" with Kimmel."Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country," Disney said in the statement. "It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.""We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday." ...Who Owns Sinclair Broadcast Group? Sinclair Broadcast Group, a publicly traded company controlled in part by the Smith family—with David D. Smith as executive chairman—has historically leaned conservative.While Disney has decided to put Kimmel back on air, the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which controls many ABC affiliates, has said it will preempt the show, meaning it will block it and air its own programming instead.The company called on Kimmel to apologize and make a donation to Kirk's conservative youth organization, Turning Point USA.What Time Is 'Jimmy Kimmel Live'? Jimmy Kimmel Live! airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET on ABC and returns on Tuesday.Where Can I Watch 'Jimmy Kimmel Live'? The show is set to air on ABC stations nationwide. However, Sinclair Broadcast Group has said it will preempt the program on its affiliates and instead air news programming in the slot.This means viewers in markets with Sinclair-owned ABC affiliates won't be able to watch the show on their local channels.Nexstar, another major owner of ABC affiliates that previously objected to Kimmel's comments about Kirk, has not confirmed whether it will air the returned show.Who Is Jimmy Kimmel's First Guest Back?It is not clear who Kimmel's first guest back will be. The show's website, which ordinarily lists the upcoming interviewees and musical guests for the week, has not been updated since the news that the show was returning.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
