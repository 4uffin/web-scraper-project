NewsDonald TrumpMedicineHHSPregnancyNews ArticleTylenol’s 2017 Tweet About Pregnancy Reemerges After Trump CommentsPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 03:05 PM EDTBy Mandy TaheriPolitics and Culture ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), along with several online personalities, has resurfaced a 2017 social media post by the popular over-the-counter pain reliever, Tylenol, stating that it does not recommend using “any of our products while pregnant.”Melissa Witt, a global media relations leader at Kenvue, the parent company of Tylenol, told Newsweek in an email statement: “This eight-year-old consumer response is incomplete and did not address our full guidance on the safe use of Tylenol which has not changed.”The statement continued, “Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy,” adding that “We recommend pregnant women do not take any over-the-counter medication, including acetaminophen, without talking to their doctor first.”Why It MattersOn Monday, Trump suggested that acetaminophen, which is sold under the brand name Tylenol, may be linked to higher autism rates in the U.S., although experts say that while some studies have sought to examine the link, as well as to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, it has not been established. HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. has prioritized causes of autism, having previously floated that some vaccines may be responsible.Following the president’s statement, some medical professionals have argued that his messaging was not only "harmful," but also not backed by "the full body of scientific evidence."The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) released a statement reaffirming that “acetaminophen remains the analgesic and antipyretic of choice during pregnancy.”As one of the most common over-the-counter pain and fever medications, studies find that more than half of pregnant women use acetaminophen to manage pain and discomfort, often for fevers and back pain....What To KnowSeveral X accounts, including HHS, reshared Tylenol’s post in the hours since Trump’s announcement. HHS shared the post on Wednesday morning, writing “no caption needed.” Other accounts have captioned the posts as "straight from the horses mouth," and others, such as former Nevada State Senator Elizabeth Helgelien, just reshared the content, noting it is from 2017. Some other accounts have claimed that it's being taken "out of context."The online trend comes as a number of pregnant women have been posting videos on social media of themselves taking Tylenol, saying that they would not take medical advice from the president or RFK Jr., neither of whom has a medical degree.Many women take Tylenol during pregnancy to reduce fevers, which poses increased risks of birth defects.Ann Bauer, an epidemiologist and co-author of research linking the active ingredient in Tylenol to increased incidence of neurodevelopmental disorder previously told Newsweek that the link is not the “holy grail” and requires more research. She cautioned that “correlation is not causation.”Bauer and her colleagues advised "judicious" acetaminophen use among pregnant women in their findings last month, suggesting the lowest possible dose be taken for the shortest period of time. That recommendation still stands today, she said.What People Are SayingDr. Mary Talley Bowden, founder of Americans for Health Freedom, said in a Wednesday X post: “After 4 pregnancies and practicing medicine for 20+ years, this is the first time I’ve heard this.”American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a September 23 press release: “The current weight of evidence does not support a causal link between prenatal acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders… ACOG reaffirms that acetaminophen remains the safest first-line analgesic and antipyretic in pregnancy. Clinicians should continue to recommend its judicious use, provide evidence-based counseling, and reassure patients that current data do not support a causal link to neurodevelopmental disorders.”X account MAGA Voice, which has over 1.3 million followers on X, said in a September 24 post: “You won’t believe what Tylenol said back in 2017: 'We actually don’t recommend using any of our products while Pregnant' Would be a shame if every Liberal saw this YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.”Dr. Zeyan Liew, a Yale School of Public Health associate professor, said on Tuesday: “We do not know yet for sure whether acetaminophen causes autism. Multiple observational studies conducted across different populations have shown associations between frequent and long-term use of acetaminophen in pregnancy and some negative effects on a child’s neurodevelopment. However, not all studies are specific about autism. Further, there might be other factors related to acetaminophen use, such as fevers (which are known to cause increased rates of neurodevelopmental delays). Genetics and other medical conditions also need to be considered.”What Happens NextThe public debate of Tylenol is expected to continue as there are no other recommended pain reducers for pregnant women to take throughout their term.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
