WorldRussiaVladimir PutinRussia-Ukraine WarNATOSecurity CouncilKremlinMoreNews ArticleKremlin Says Putin Will Make ‘Important Statements’ at Key Security MeetingPublishedSep 22, 2025 at 06:02 AM EDTupdatedSep 22, 2025 at 08:31 AM EDTBy Shane CroucherBreaking News EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberRussian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would continue to uphold restrictions on nuclear arms under the New START Treaty with the U.S. for a year after it expires in February 2026.Putin made the commitment at a meeting of Russia's Security Council on Monday, September 22. His spokesman Dmitry Peskov had earlier said Putin would make "a number of important statements" at the meeting.It comes amid heightened tensions between Moscow and NATO after Estonia and Poland both requested Article 4 consultations over what they said were major violations of their airspace by Russia.Russia has said NATO allies have not yet provided evidence for their accusations of airspace violations.Putin's imminent statements also coincide with the start of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Monday, at which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will hold meetings with President Donald Trump and the leaders of other allies of Kyiv."Action must be taken so that murder and war do not become routine," Zelensky said ahead of the U.N. meeting. "Real, powerful pressure on Russia is needed; new joint steps from everyone in the world who believes that international law must work again."...NATO-Russia War FearsNATO and Russia are edging closer to a direct conflict.The Kremlin has described NATO as at war with Russia, though there has been no formal declaration of war by either side. NATO allies have given substantial assistance to Ukraine in its defense against Russia's invasion.Poland shot down what it said were Russian drones that violated its airspace and threatened its security. And NATO allies sent jets to intercept two Russian fighter jets that Estonia said lingered in its airspace for around 12 minutes.It prompted calls from NATO allies to step up and face Russia with tougher consequences for such incursions."NATO's border in the North East is being tested for a reason," Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovilė Šakalienė posted to X. "We need to mean business."Šakalienė said that Turkey "set an example 10 years ago," an apparent reference to the shooting down of a Russian jet in 2015 when it violated Turkish airspace."Some food for thought," she added.Trump: 'Big Trouble'Trump warned of "big trouble" when asked about the reports of Russian fighter jets entering Estonia's airspace.He has tried for months to broker an elusive peace between Russia and Ukraine, only for Moscow to intensify its invasion and test NATO's resolve.Trump is urging European allies to impose even harsher sanctions on Russia and its major strategic partner, China, to crank the pressure on making peace, saying the U.S. will follow their lead in doing so.Two key issues remain blockers to a peace deal: The division of territory and the future architecture of Ukrainian security.Russia has seized around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, and it has ruled out a Western plan in the works to deploy peacekeeping troops from NATO allies to Ukraine as a security guarantee for Kyiv when the war ends.Update 9/22/25, 8:30 a.m. ET: Putin's comments were added to the story.Update 9/22/25, 7:40 a.m. ET: This article was updated with more information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
