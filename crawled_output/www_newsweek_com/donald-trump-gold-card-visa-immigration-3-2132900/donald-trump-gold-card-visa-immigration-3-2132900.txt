U.S.Donald TrumpImmigrationvisasH-1B VisasNews ArticleDonald Trump Unveils ‘Gold Card’ Visas For $1 MillionPublishedSep 20, 2025 at 05:26 AM EDTBy Martha McHardyUS News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberPresident Donald Trump has announced a new "Gold Card" visa program that would allow wealthy foreigners to secure U.S. residency in exchange for a $1-million investment."Today we are proud to announce THE TRUMP GOLD CARD," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. "The Card will be available for $1 Million Dollars for individuals, and $2 Million Dollars for Corporations."Why It MattersThe Gold Card plan highlights the Trump administration's dual approach to the issue of visas: tightening traditional immigration channels while creating new, high-cost pathways.Since taking office, the president has repeatedly sought to raise revenue in unorthodox ways—imposing billions in new tariffs, demanding a share of corporate revenues from firms like Nvidia, and even suggesting the U.S. deserves royalties from university patents.Now, by monetizing green cards at $1 million apiece, the administration is turning immigration policy into a revenue stream, even as it slashes humanitarian programs such as Temporary Protected Status and parole....What To KnowUnder the Gold Card program—first floated by Trump in February and detailed in an executive order Friday—foreign nationals who contribute at least $1 million to the Commerce Department will be eligible for an expedited path to an immigrant visa. Corporations can secure the same privilege for employees with a $2-million payment.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the administration expects to issue around 80,000 Gold Cards, though the program remains in the "implementation phase." Applicants approved after vetting by the State Department and Department of Homeland Security will be granted lawful permanent resident status, commonly known as a green card, upon paying a $15,000 processing fee.The Gold Card will replace the existing EB-1 and EB-2 visa categories, which currently provide green cards for individuals with "exceptional ability" in business and other fields."In less than a month, the other visa green card categories are likely to be suspended, and this will be the model that people can come into the country," Lutnick told reporters.He added: "You can prove exceptional value for the United States of America by contributing $1 million to the United States of America. That's a pretty good expectation that they're highly valuable."Lutnick emphasized that holders will be subject to the same global tax obligations as U.S. citizens and permanent residents.In addition, the administration is weighing a $5-million "Platinum Card" visa that would allow recipients to stay in the United States for up to 270 days annually without paying taxes on non-U.S. income. That proposal, which does not include a pathway to citizenship, would require congressional approval. A federal website has already opened a waiting list.Separately, Trump signed an order Friday imposing an additional $100,000 fee on applicants for H-1B visas, the non-immigrant permits that allow tens of thousands of skilled workers to live and work in the U.S. for up to six years.Asked Friday how he believes tech companies will react to the new H-1B fee, Trump told reporters: "I think they're going to be very happy.""And we're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases, these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it," the president said.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: "For far too long, we have had millions of Illegal Aliens pouring into our Country, and our Immigration System was broken. It is beyond time that the American People, and American Taxpayers, are benefiting from our LEGAL Immigration System. We anticipate THE TRUMP GOLD CARD will generate well over $100 Billion Dollars very quickly. This money will be used for reducing Taxes, Pro Growth Projects, and paying down our Debt."What Happens NextThe Gold Card could face legal challenges as experts warn that allowing people to skip the line could draw lawsuits.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
