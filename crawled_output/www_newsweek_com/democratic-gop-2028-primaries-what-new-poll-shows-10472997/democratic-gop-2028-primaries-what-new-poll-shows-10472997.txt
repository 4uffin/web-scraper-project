PoliticsDemocratPollKamala HarrisGavin NewsomJD VanceRepublicanMoreNews ArticleDemocratic, GOP 2028 Primaries: What New Poll ShowsPublishedSep 22, 2025 at 09:59 PM EDTBy Anna CommanderDeputy News EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA new poll by Echelon Insights released on Monday shows potential 2028 Democratic and Republican presidential contenders chosen by likely voters.Newsweek reached out to political analysts via email for comment. Why It MattersEarly polls have the potential to gain significance, as possible contenders for the 2028 presidential election begin to emerge. Even with the election years away, polling can offer insight into candidate viability, voter sentiment and evolving party dynamics, particularly after the pivotal 2024 election cycle and upcoming midterms.Potential 2028 contenders could start announcing their candidacy after midterms, as Democrats attempt to make up ground lost in the 2024 elections, and Republicans strive to maintain control of the White House, Senate and House.What To Know In the poll, the top potential Democratic contender for president is former Vice President Kamala Harris with 23 percent of the vote.California Governor Gavin Newsom is in second place with 17 percent, followed by U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from New York and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, with 7 percent apiece. The poll shows that 12 percent of likely voters were unsure.Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and New Jersey U.S. Senator Cory Booker both received 6 percent of the vote in the poll.The top contender for Republicans is Vice President JD Vance with 43 percent, followed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis with 8 percent. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is in third place with 6 percent, the poll shows. The survey also notes that 18 percent were unsure.The poll surveyed likely electorate voters from September 18 to September 22 and has a margin of error of 3.7 percent.When respondents were asked if they feel America is heading in the right direction or on the wrong track, 36 percent said right direction versus 56 who said on the wrong track, the poll shows....What People Are Saying Trump last month in a news conference when asked if Vance is the successor to MAGA: "Well, I think most likely in all fairness, he's the vice president. I think Marco [Rubio] is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form. I also think we have incredible people, some of the people on the stage right here, so it's too early obviously to talk about it but certainly he's doing a great job, and he would be probably favored at this point."CNN polling analyst Harry Enten, on X this month: "What Newsom's done in Cali vs. Trump isn't just staying out in CA, it's found real support nationally. Early 2028 primary polls show he's rose from 8% to 21% (top) since April. He has near equal support from White, Black & Latinos, which means he can win across the primary map."What Happens NextMajor candidates' 2028 campaigns are not expected to be announced until after the 2026 midterm election cycle.The field of likely contenders could possibly be taking shape as politicians such as Newsom and Vance make public appearances and pursue national media opportunities.In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing, Republicans and Democrats alike could also see party messaging shift and prioritization of fundamental pillars change.
