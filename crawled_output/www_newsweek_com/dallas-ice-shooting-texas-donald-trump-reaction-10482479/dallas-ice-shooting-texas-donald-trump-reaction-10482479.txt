U.S.Donald TrumpICEDallasTexasBreaking NewsShootingNews ArticleDonald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility ShootingPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 12:33 PM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 05:19 PM EDTBy Dan Gooding and Gabe WhisnantShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberPresident Donald Trump has posted his reaction after Wednesday's deadly Dallace ICE facility shooting. The gunman who fatally shot an ICE detainee and wounded two others at a Dallas facility early Wednesday has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, law enforcement sources told multiple outlets, including NBC News.The suspect turned the gun on himself, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said earlier Wednesday morning. No law enforcement officers were injured, authorities said. At a press conference, FBI officials revealed that ammunition recovered near the suspected shooter contained anti-ICE messages, intensifying concerns about escalating threats against immigration enforcement.The president posted on Truth Social, "I have been briefed on the deadly shooting at the ICE Field Office in Dallas, Texas. It has now been revealed the deranged shooter wrote “Anti-ICE” on his shell casings. This is despicable! The Brave Men and Women of ICE are just trying to do their jobs, and remove the “WORST of the WORST” Criminals out of our Country, but they are facing an unprecedented increase in threats, violence, and attacks by Deranged Radical Leftists. This violence is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to “Nazis.” The continuing violence from Radical Left Terrorists, in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, must be stopped. ICE Officers, and other Brave Members of Law Enforcement, are under grave threat. We have already declared ANTIFA a Terrorist Organization, and I will be signing an Executive Order this week to dismantle these Domestic Terrorism Networks. I AM CALLING ON ALL DEMOCRATS TO STOP THIS RHETORIC AGAINST ICE AND AMERICA’S LAW ENFORCEMENT, RIGHT NOW! The Trump Administration is fully committed to backing Law Enforcement, Strong Borders, securing our Homeland, deporting Violent Illegal Criminals, and fully rooting out the Left Wing Domestic Terrorism that is terrorizing our Country. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"This is a breaking news article.
