U.S.Donald TrumpICEDallasTexasBreaking NewsShootingNews ArticleDonald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility ShootingPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 06:06 PM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 02:36 AM EDTBy Dan Gooding and Gabe WhisnantShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberPresident Donald Trump has posted his reaction after Wednesday's deadly Dallace ICE facility shooting. The gunman who fatally shot an ICE detainee and wounded two others at a Dallas facility early Wednesday has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, law enforcement sources told multiple outlets, including NBC News.The suspect turned the gun on himself, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said earlier Wednesday morning. President Trump took to Truth Social later Wednesday, saying he had been briefed on the shooting. "It has now been revealed the deranged shooter wrote “Anti-ICE” on his shell casings. This is despicable!" Trump wrote. "The Brave Men and Women of ICE are just trying to do their jobs, and remove the “WORST of the WORST” Criminals out of our Country, but they are facing an unprecedented increase in threats, violence, and attacks by Deranged Radical Leftists."Why It MattersTrump's reaction included pointed remarks towards the left, following similar messages in recent weeks in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination in Utah from Republicans who have focused on political violence allegedly perpetrated by liberals. In a similar situation to that of Kirk's alleged killer, full details on a motive were yet to be revealed or proven as of Wednesday night. ...Shooting at ICE Facility in Dallas, Texas: What We KnowOne ICE detainee was killed, and two more were in a serious condition, after the shooting at the ICE field office early Wednesday morning. No law enforcement officers were injured, authorities said.Officers said the shooter, identified as Joshua Jahn, had fired indiscriminately from a nearby building, before taking his own life. Emergency services had rushed to the scene, with Trump administration officials, including Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, quickly responding on social media, saying this had been an attack on ICE agents. In a statement, the ministry said that the Mexican Consulate General in Dallas had "immediately contacted authorities who confirmed that one of the seriously injured individuals is a Mexican national and is hospitalized receiving medical care."Reacting to the news later, Trump repeated claims that the violence seen in Texas was the result of "Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement", including calling for ICE to be abolished. "The continuing violence from Radical Left Terrorists, in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, must be stopped," Trump said on Truth Social. "ICE Officers, and other Brave Members of Law Enforcement, are under grave threat. We have already declared ANTIFA a Terrorist Organization, and I will be signing an Executive Order this week to dismantle these Domestic Terrorism Networks. "I AM CALLING ON ALL DEMOCRATS TO STOP THIS RHETORIC AGAINST ICE AND AMERICA’S LAW ENFORCEMENT, RIGHT NOW! The Trump Administration is fully committed to backing Law Enforcement, Strong Borders, securing our Homeland, deporting Violent Illegal Criminals, and fully rooting out the Left Wing Domestic Terrorism that is terrorizing our Country. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"Kash Patel Reveals Anti-ICE Message at SceneAt a press conference, FBI officials revealed that ammunition recovered near the suspected shooter contained anti-ICE messages, intensifying concerns about escalating threats against immigration enforcement.FBI Director Kash Patel then shared a photo of the alleged casings on X, claiming there was a clear ideological motive behind the attack because "anti-ICE" had been written on them. Loading twitter content...Democrat Rep. Marc Veasey, from Dallas, said he doesn't have faith that the FBI under the current administration would lead a fair and nonpartisan investigation into the shooting.“I don’t trust anything that’s happening out of that agency at all,” Rep. Veasey said. “I don’t trust them at all. They’re overly political.”What People Are SayingFBI Director Kash Patel, on X: "These despicable, politically motivated attacks against law enforcement are not a one-off. We are only miles from Prarieland, Texas where just two months ago an individual ambushed a separate ICE facility targeting their officers. It has to end and the FBI and our partners will lead these investigative efforts to see to it that those who target our law enforcement are pursued and brought to the fullest extent of justice."Texas state Rep. Rafael Anchía, a Democrat, said that now was not the time for politics or "premature blame", in a statement to NBC News: “Our Dallas community stands united against targeted gun violence. We have endured too many shootings and tragic losses, and we will not allow this moment to be exploited for division or premature blame. This is not about politics — every person who values their neighbor must denounce violence in all forms and commit to meaningful action to address the gun violence epidemic."What's NextMexican authorities have requested access to the Mexican nationals injured in the incident, while the FBI has taken control of the investigation.
