The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) announced on Sunday that AquaStar (USA) Corp of Seattle has recalled approximately 85,000 bags of shrimp products sold at major grocery chains nationwide due to potential contamination with cesium-137, a radioactive isotope.The recall affects Kroger-brand raw and cooked shrimp products as well as AquaStar raw shrimp skewers distributed across 31 states between June 2025 and September 2025.The FDA announced no illnesses have been reported to date, but the contamination poses potential long-term cancer risks through repeated exposure.Newsweek reached out to AquaStar and Kroger via email on Sunday for commentWhy It MattersThis latest recall marks the second major radioactive shrimp contamination incident in just over a month, highlighting systemic issues with the same Indonesian supplier.In August, the FDA warned consumers about cesium-137 contamination in Great Value shrimp products sold at Walmart, also traced to PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati (BMS Foods) in Indonesia. The rapid succession of recalls from the same facility raises serious questions about international food safety oversight and the effectiveness of current screening protocols.Both incidents involve the same radioactive isotope, which the Center for Disease Control (CDC) warns can cause DNA damage and increase cancer risks through repeated exposure.

What Is Cesium-137?Cesium-137 is produced by nuclear fissions for use in medical devices in gauges, according to the CDC.It's used in small amounts for calibration of radiation-detection equipment. In larger amounts, it can be used in medical radiation therapy devices for treating cancer, medical sterilization, industrial gauges that detect the flow of liquid through pipes and other industrial devices, according to the CDC.External exposure, however, can lead to burns, acute radiation, sickness and death, the CDC said."Exposure to Cs-137 can increase the risk for cancer because of exposure to high-energy gamma radiation. Internal exposure to Cs-137, through ingestion or inhalation, allows the radioactive material to be distributed in the soft tissues, especially muscle tissue, exposing these tissues to the beta particles and gamma radiation and increasing cancer risk," the agency says.The possible Cesium-137 contamination was discovered in shipping containers at ports in Los Angeles, Houston, Miami, and Savannah, Georgia, during routine inspections.Affected Retailers and LocationsThe contaminated shrimp was sold between June 12, 2025, and September 17, 2025, at:Baker'sCity MarketDillonsFood 4 LessFoodscoFred MeyerFry'sGerbesJay CKing SoopersKrogerMariano'sMetro MarketPay Less SupermarketsPick 'n SaveRalphsSmith'sQFCThe shrimp was distributed across 31 states that include:AlaskaAlabamaArkansasArizonaCaliforniaColoradoGeorgiaIdahoIllinoisIndianaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMichiganMissouriMississippiMontanaNebraskaNew MexicoNevadaOhioOregonSouth CarolinaTennesseeTexasUtahVirginiaWashingtonWisconsinWest VirginiaWyomingRecalled Products and Identification CodesKroger Raw Colossal EZ Peel Shrimp (2 pounds): The packaging is a transparent bag with a blue band, yellow and red details.
