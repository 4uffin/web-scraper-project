Bahari Makmur Sejati (BMS Foods) in Indonesia. The rapid succession of recalls from the same facility raises serious questions about international food safety oversight and the effectiveness of current screening protocols.Both incidents involve the same radioactive isotope, which the Center for Disease Control (CDC) warns can cause DNA damage and increase cancer risks through repeated exposure....What Is Cesium-137?Cesium-137 is produced by nuclear fissions for use in medical devices in gauges, according to the CDC.It's used in small amounts for calibration of radiation-detection equipment. In larger amounts, it can be used in medical radiation therapy devices for treating cancer, medical sterilization, industrial gauges that detect the flow of liquid through pipes and other industrial devices, according to the CDC.External exposure, however, can lead to burns, acute radiation, sickness and death, the CDC said."Exposure to Cs-137 can increase the risk for cancer because of exposure to high-energy gamma radiation. Internal exposure to Cs-137, through ingestion or inhalation, allows the radioactive material to be distributed in the soft tissues, especially muscle tissue, exposing these tissues to the beta particles and gamma radiation and increasing cancer risk," the agency says.The possible Cesium-137 contamination was discovered in shipping containers at ports in Los Angeles, Houston, Miami, and Savannah, Georgia, during routine inspections.Affected Retailers and LocationsThe contaminated shrimp was sold between June 12, 2025, and September 17, 2025, at:Baker'sCity MarketDillonsFood 4 LessFoodscoFred MeyerFry'sGerbesJay CKing SoopersKrogerMariano'sMetro MarketPay Less SupermarketsPick 'n SaveRalphsSmith'sQFCThe shrimp was distributed across 31 states that include:AlaskaAlabamaArkansasArizonaCaliforniaColoradoGeorgiaIdahoIllinoisIndianaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMichiganMissouriMississippiMontanaNebraskaNew MexicoNevadaOhioOregonSouth CarolinaTennesseeTexasUtahVirginiaWashingtonWisconsinWest VirginiaWyomingRecalled Products and Identification CodesKroger Raw Colossal EZ Peel Shrimp (2 pounds): The packaging is a transparent bag with a blue band, yellow and red details.
