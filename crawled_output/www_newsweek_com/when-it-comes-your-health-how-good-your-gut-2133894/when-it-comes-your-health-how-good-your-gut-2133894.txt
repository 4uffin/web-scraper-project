For many, colonoscopies have always seemed like an unnecessary procedure, one that they can put off until their doctor tells them they have no other choice. They're time-consuming and can be unpleasant, but they can also play a part in saving your life.Colorectal cancer is becoming more common in younger groups and remains a leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Taking the time to educate yourself on colorectal health is vital. And getting screened‚Äîespecially if you have symptoms‚Äîcan be life-changing.Earlier this month, Newsweek and data partner Statista published the World's Best Smart Hospitals for 2026, which includes some of the top hospitals for gastroenterology around the world. Newsweek spoke with leading specialists Dr. Caroline Macaron of Cleveland Clinic and Dr. Vivek Kumbhari of Mayo Clinic to discuss shifting patterns in gastrointestinal health and how patients can act now to protect their colorectal systems.The Threat of Colorectal CancerThe number of cases of colorectal cancer have decreased since the 1980s, but this form of cancer is still the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Even more concerning, the occurrence of colorectal cancer in people under 50 is increasing. While it is typically most common in people 50 or older, the rate of occurrence in groups younger than 50 has risen by 2 percent annually."The exact reasons for this increase are still unclear. However, it is believed to be largely driven by modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors," Macaron told Newsweek.Kumbhari added that in the case of colorectal cancer, genetic factors are less influential than lifestyle choices. Outside factors, he said, offer a potential explanation for the uptick."The trend is very concerning. It's not attributed to genetic syndromes or hereditary cancers, because these things take generations to increase in your genes. So, there's something in the environment or in our behavior that's triggering this," Kumbhari told Newsweek.Many regular practices can affect a young person's risk of developing colorectal cancer."I think what we're learning is that simple behaviors‚Äîeating a healthy diet, sleep, stress [are factors]. We're also seeing that younger people are sort of feeling a large portion of the societal changes that are happening," Kumbhari said. "We are also seeing increases in the foods that we probably shouldn't be eating or drinking: artificially sweetened beverages‚Äîor even high-sugar beverages, lots of ultra-processed foods, red meats."Many young people believe that their age makes them less likely to develop colorectal cancer. While this is statistically true, today's shifting trends make it especially important for them to be aware of their bodies and to seek medical advice if they notice anything amiss."If you are younger than 45, it's still important to be aware of your body and speak to your doctor if you notice any concerning symptoms, such as blood in your stool, unexplained weight loss, persistent abdominal pain or changes in bowel habits, Macaron said. "Colorectal cancer cases are rising in this age group, and early diagnosis greatly improves outcomes."New and Improved Screening OptionsBecause colorectal cancer is appearing more frequently in younger people, early detection is more important than ever. In fact, in 2018 The American Cancer Society lowered the recommended age for getting a colonoscopy from 50 to 45."If I could tell young patients one thing about colorectal cancer and prevention, it would be this: If you are 45 years or older, please get screened for colorectal cancer and talk to your doctor about the available screening options," Macaron said. "Early detection saves lives, and screening can identify precancerous polyps before they turn into cancer."Luckily for people who may be wary of having a colonoscopy or cannot access one easily, at-home colon cancer screening tests may be an option. For a person 45 or older with average risk, Khumbari continued, "this is sort of widely available, generally reimbursed, and would be considered a very good option." Still, he cautions, at-home testing is currently recommended only for that age group, and "it still doesn't help the very young people."Offering patients a choice between home tests and colonoscopy leads to higher screening participation compared to recommending colonoscopy alone, according to large studies, Macaron added. "At-home tests provide a more convenient and less invasive option, which can help overcome barriers such as fear, time constraints or limited access to healthcare facilities."Patients can purchase at-home tests, which use stool samples, as a preliminary screening. However, medical advice should be sought if a test reveals a positive result.Kumbhari said that the big problem with screening is that "not everybody gets screened, even though it's available and covered by the commercial payers and Medicare. So that's the real issue."He continued, "We'd be happy for anyone to do just one of the screening tests, [though] we sort of consider colonoscopy as our reference point to the best test one could perform. If anyone has high risk of an inflammatory condition of the gut, strong history or family history of colorectal cancer disease, have already had polyps detected or have some underlying genetic syndrome, then these tests are not recommended," he cautioned. In those cases, he said, a colonoscopy is recommended.Fact or Fiction: Taking Care of Your GutTaking care of your gut's microbiome can have an important impact on inflammation and overall health. When properly taken care of, your gut plays an important role in reducing your risk of colorectal cancer.In recent years, prebiotic soda brands Poppi, Olipop and others have sparked online conversations about taking care of the microbiome and using diet to improve gut health. "Talks about probiotics, prebiotics and gut health can be helpful because they teach people how important a healthy gut is for overall health. They encourage good habits like eating more fiber and fermented foods," Macaron said.Those internet conversations, however, are not always led by experts. "Sometimes, online information can be confusing or wrong," Macaron cautioned. "Some sources make probiotics sound like magic cures without enough proof." In short, when it comes to your health, it's better to rely on information provided by physicians.Kumbhari added, "We've tried to mitigate all the fun and enjoyable and social things and the healthy things via these supplements with no evidence that any of these supplements, even alone or combined, decrease cancer or extend life or keep you any younger."These new products may have ingredients that are potentially helpful to your gut. But often, they also contain ingredients that make them less helpful. "Prebiotic sodas and drinks can help gut health because they contain fibers that feed good bacteria in your gut," Macaron said, "but many of these drinks also have added sugar or artificial ingredients, which might reduce their benefits."Ultimately, as appealing as these supplements may be, patients looking to protect their gut health should really focus more on their food choices. "Eating whole foods like fruits, vegetables and whole grains is still the best way to keep your gut healthy," he said.Easy Changes to Save Your LifeFacing the risk of colorectal cancer as a young person is scary, but the lifestyle changes that you can make to protect yourself are easy. Eating well, staying active and getting enough sleep are feasible daily habits that can save your life.
