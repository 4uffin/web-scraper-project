U.S.Donald TrumpU.S. State DepartmentAmerica firstNews ArticleHow Donald Trump Could Use $1.8 Billion Foreign Aid on America First Goals PublishedSep 25, 2025 at 06:50 AM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 11:27 AM EDTBy Brendan ColeSenior News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberInvesting in mineral-rich Greenland and countering "Marxist, anti-American regimes" in Latin America are among the areas that the Trump administration wants to prioritize using redirected foreign assistance funds, it has been reported. Reuters and The Washington Post reported a White House plan to shift $1.8 billion in foreign aid funding, according to a document sent to Congress. The U.S. State Department told Newsweek Thursday that the America First Foreign Assistance programs must align with administration policies and advance concrete U.S. national interests.Why It Matters The reported move is part of an overhaul of U.S. foreign assistance under Trump, prioritizing national security and economic leverage over the “soft power” components of U.S. global influence, including food, medical, and economic assistance. It follows the administration dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in a policy it says would mean U.S. taxpayer money goes only to programs aligned with Trump's "America First" agenda....What To Know The Trump administration's plan was outlined in a 10-page document sent by the State Department to Capitol Hill on September 12 and reviewed by The Washington Post. The document describes how the Trump administration will direct $1.8 billion toward initiatives such as countering “Marxist, anti-American regimes” in Latin America and pursuing investments in Greenland and Ukraine.It also outlines how $400 million would back efforts, including energy and critical minerals programming in Ukraine and economic development and conservation work in mineral-rich Greenland, which Trump has said he wants the U.S. to acquire. The document also states that $400 million would be allocated to support efforts to end illegal immigration to the U.S. and to counter China's dominance in critical minerals and artificial intelligence. Money would go towards confronting “the Marxist, anti-American regimes of Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua,” added the document, which also lists projects defunded by the administration, including $175 million for the West Bank and Gaza, and $150 million for Iraq. The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, said the plan outlined subverted Congress's power outlined in the Constitution, controlling how government money is spent, according to Reuters. But an unnamed Republican congressional aide told The Washington Post that the State Department was working with Congress on the transfer and that the notice was “standard procedure.” Newsweek could not verify this source.The Washington Post reported administrations had often previously asked lawmakers for permission to move money toward the end of the fiscal year on September 30, but two unnamed congressional aides told the paper the request was far larger than normal.  Additionally, submitting the list only weeks before the fiscal year ends, lawmakers must choose between accepting the plan and risking undermining Congress’s decisions on federal spending, or fighting and risking the money disappearing when the deadline passes, the paper added.A U.S. State Department spokesperson told Newsweek in a statement that its America First Foreign Assistance programs are inextricably intertwined with the broader foreign policy goals of the United States and must align with administration policies to advance concrete U.S. national interests.  The statement said that the U.S. will prioritize trade over aid, opportunity over dependency, and investment over assistance.  "On Congressional Notifications, we do not comment on deliberative process or Congressional correspondence," the statement said, adding, "we look forward to working with Congress on America First Foreign Assistance."What People Are Saying Senator Jeanne Shaheen, per Reuters: "Funding politically driven, unaccountable, pet projects in place like Greenland...is out of step with America's foreign policy interests and an abuse of Americans' tax dollars.” An unnamed congressional Republican aide told The Washington Post: “House Republicans are in full support of State’s commitment to spending these funds in a more responsible way, specifically for programs that support U.S. national security interests.” U.S. State Department spokesperson told Newsweek: "The United States will prioritize trade over aid, opportunity over dependency, and investment over assistance."What Happens Next Amid concerns from some lawmakers about the destination of the foreign aid, The Post reported that congressional aides have pressed the Trump administration for more details on the new projects, which the State Department would later clarify.  Update 9/25/25, 11:26 a.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from the U.S. State Department.Request Reprint &
