They were not named by police.The three were detained on Wednesday, September 17, by counter-terrorism officers under an investigation into suspected breaches of national security laws by assisting the Russian intelligence services.The men are aged 41 and 46, and the woman is 35 years old. All were released on conditional bail....Warning on Intelligence 'Proxies'Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said in a statement that "through our recent national security casework, we're seeing an increasing number of who we would describe as 'proxies' being recruited by foreign intelligence services.""Indeed, two young British men are awaiting sentencing after they were recruited by the Wagner Group—effectively the Russian state—to carry out an arson at a Ukrainian-linked warehouse," Murphy said."They are facing potentially lengthy custodial sentences, although, to be clear, today's arrests are in no way connected to that investigation."But anyone who might be contacted by and tempted into carrying out criminal activity on behalf of a foreign state here in the U.K. should think again."This kind of activity will be investigated and anyone found to be involved can expect to be prosecuted and there are potentially very serious consequences for those who are convicted."Lithuania, Latvia Expose Suspected Russian PlotsOn Wednesday, Lithuanian prosecutors said they uncovered and detained a Russia-linked network of suspects who are alleged to have planned and organized arson attacks in various European countries.Lithuania's prosecutor general's office said suspects in a separate case are accused of sending packages containing homemade explosive devices to other European Union countries and Britain via courier services, on behalf of Russia's military intelligence services.The highly flammable incendiary devices with timed detonators were hidden inside vibrating massage cushions and tubes of cosmetics.Lithuanian authorities said a total of 15 people—citizens of Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Ukraine—are suspected of organizing and carrying out the alleged arson attacks.Their statement said an international arrest warrant has been issued for three people, but did not make clear if and how many people had been arrested.The investigation found that the packages contained thermite—a highly explosive substance used for industrial and military purposes.Meanwhile, Latvia's security service said it had detained a man suspected of passing intelligence about the military to Russia.The Latvian State Security Service said it had detained a man on suspicion of collecting information about Latvian military sites and passing the information to Russia's intelligence services.In a statement, it said the man provided Russian intelligence with information about NATO troops based in the country, training exercises and the construction of "new military objects."This article includes reporting by The Associated Press.Updated, 9/18/25, 09:07 a.m. ET: This article was updated with more information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
