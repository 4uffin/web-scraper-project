PoliticsJames ComeyDOJTrump administrationFBIBreaking NewsNews ArticleFormer FBI Director James Comey Indicted by Justice DepartmentPublishedSep 25, 2025 at 06:55 PM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 08:34 PM EDTBy Gabe WhisnantBreaking News EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberFormer FBI Director James Comey was indicted Thursday on charges of making a false statement to Congress and obstruction, just days after President Donald Trump publicly pressed his attorney general to prosecute him and other perceived political foes.The indictment makes Comey the first former senior government official to face prosecution tied to one of Trump’s long-standing grievances: the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump and his allies have derided that probe as a “hoax” and a “witch hunt,” despite repeated government reviews showing that Moscow acted to aid his campaign.Comey said in an Instagram reel posted Thursday night, "My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump, but we couldn't imagine ourselves living any other way. We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn't either. Somebody that I love dearly said recently that, 'fear is the tool of a tyrant.' But I'm not afraid, and I hope you're not either. I hope instead you are engaged, you are paying attention, and you will vote like your beloved country depends upon it, which it does."He concluded, "My heart is broken for the Department of Justice, but I have great confidence in the judicial system, and I'm innocent. So, let's have a trial. And keep the faith."Trump posted on Truth Social Thursday night, "JUSTICE IN AMERICA! One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI. Today he was indicted by a Grand Jury on two felony counts for various illegal and unlawful acts. He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"...Why It MattersThe case is likely to intensify concerns that the Justice Department under Attorney General Pam Bondi is being used to pursue political enemies. It comes as the White House has taken unprecedented steps to exert influence over the department, blurring the line between law and politics at an agency where independence has long been considered foundational.Comey, who was fired by Trump in 2017, has remained a top target for the president and his supporters. He was singled out by name in a Truth Social post Saturday in which Trump complained to Bondi that she had not yet brought charges against him. The next evening, Trump again publicly urged prosecutions, writing, “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”What to KnowThe case was brought by the U.S. attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia, which has been in turmoil following the resignation of chief prosecutor Erik Siebert. Siebert had faced pressure to indict another Trump adversary, New York Attorney General Letitia James, in a separate probe. Lindsey Halligan, a Trump aide and personal lawyer with no prosecutorial background, was tapped to run the office and quickly brought the Comey matter to a grand jury.The indictment centers on testimony Comey gave to the Senate in September 2020, when he said he had never authorized anyone to act as an anonymous source to reporters about the Russia investigation. Prosecutors allege that statement was false and obstructed congressional oversight. They had until Tuesday to act before the five-year statute of limitations expired.Without mentioning Comey by name, Bondi posted on X, "No one is above the law. Today’s indictment reflects this Department of Justice’s commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case."Comey is expected to enter a not guilty plea, and his legal team has already signaled it will argue that the case is politically motivated. A conviction could carry up to five years in prison, though the outcome of any trial may hinge as much on perceptions of fairness as on the narrow legal issues at stake.Loading twitter content...Trump has long sought to cast the Russia probe as a partisan effort launched under Democratic President Barack Obama to undermine his 2016 victory. His administration has declassified documents and tried to discredit a 2017 intelligence assessment that concluded Moscow interfered at the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin.Comey has often been one of Trump’s sharpest critics. He clashed with the president during his tenure, including at a private dinner where Trump asked for his personal loyalty. Comey later documented that request in a memo and confirmed Trump had asked him to shut down an FBI investigation into national security adviser Michael Flynn. After his firing, Comey authorized a friend to share portions of his memos with a reporter, prompting Trump to brand him a leaker.The case against Comey ensures that the long shadow of the Russia investigation will again dominate headlines — and deepen divisions over the Justice Department’s independence as the presidential election cycle accelerates.Meanwhile, Comey’s daughter, Maurene Comey, has filed a lawsuit claiming she was fired earlier this year from her role as a federal prosecutor in New York for political reasons, underscoring the broader pattern of Trump-aligned officials targeting his critics....What People Are SayingDemocratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California posted on X, "Donald Trump forced out a respected U.S. Attorney because they wouldn't go along with Trump’s demands for political prosecutions. Less than a week later, his inexperienced handpicked successor brings charges against a member of Trump's enemies list. In my almost six years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, I never witnessed such a blatant abuse of the department. The DOJ is now little more than an arm of the president’s retribution campaign."Bondi posted on X, "No one is above the law. Today’s indictment reflects this Department of Justice’s commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case."Former FBI agent F.X. Regan posted on X, "Comey started flying close to the sun when he leaked his classified memos to the NYT through a friend. He dodged a bullet on that one."Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California told CNN earlier Thursday, "What I would just say to any prosecutor at the DOJ is that it's not going away. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I promise you when Democrats are in the majority we will look at all of this and there will be accountability and bar licenses will be at stake."What Happens NextThe indictment adds a dramatic twist to Trump’s long-running campaign to revisit grievances from his first term and pursue cases against figures tied to the Russia investigation. It also raises fresh questions about whether the Justice Department can operate independently under Trump’s leadership.Updates: 9/25/25, 7:13 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Updates: 9/25/25, 7:37 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Updates: 9/25/25, 7:55 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Updates: 9/25/25, 8:32 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
