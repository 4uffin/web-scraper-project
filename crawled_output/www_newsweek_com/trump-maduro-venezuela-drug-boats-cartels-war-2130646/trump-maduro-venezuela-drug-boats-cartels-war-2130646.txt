Two had only been confirmed publicly before.He has deployed more U.S. forces to the Caribbean to take on drug traffickers directly and aggressively, increasing tensions with socialist-controlled Venezuela and raising the risk of a direct clash between the two states."Stop sending Tren de Aragua into the United States," Trump told reporters as he left the White House on Tuesday, September 16, referring to the Venezuelan drug gang, designated a terror organization in the U.S. "Stop sending drugs into the United States.""I would say to him very strongly: Stop sending people from your prisons into our country," Trump said in a message to Maduro.Drug Boat StrikesTrump said Monday that the U.S. military conducted a "kinetic strike" against another suspected drug cartel boat from Venezuela. Three people aboard the vessel were killed.The strike, which took place in the U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) area of responsibility, was announced in a message on Truth Social, where Trump warned of further action against drug traffickers targeting Americans.In the same post, Trump emphasized the strategic and domestic rationale behind the attack, calling the Venezuelan cartels "a threat to U.S. National Security, Foreign Policy, and vital U.S. Interests."Earlier this month, the U.S. carried out a missile strike on a boat Trump said was carrying drugs and operated by the Venezuela-based Tren de Aragua cartel, which he designated a terrorist organization by executive order at the start of the year. That strike killed 11 people.Maduro responded Monday, calling the strike a "criminal attack" and accusing the U.S. of launching a wider campaign against his country.At a press conference in Caracas with top military officials, he said the attack was part of "judicial, political, diplomatic, and military aggression."The Venezuelan leader also said all communication with the Trump administration had "broken down" and called U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio the "lord of death and war" for his repeated threats....Trump Expands Caribbean ForcesU.S. forces have significantly increased their presence in the Caribbean.The arrival of F-35 fifth-generation jet fighters to Puerto Rico over the weekend added to the growing complement of U.S. forces in the eastern Caribbean.Also seen at the island's airports were MQ-9 Reaper drones—thought to have been used in the two attacks on the alleged drug boats—and a number of P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft.This month, thousands of U.S. Navy sailors and Marines of the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group have been on standby off the Puerto Rican coast.The amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima, leader of the pack, has been training alongside amphibious transport docks USS Fort Lauderdale and USS San Antonio, all carrying MV-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft.As of early this week, at least two guided-missile destroyers—the USS Gravely and USS Jason Dunham—were already operating in Caribbean waters. A third, the USS Sampson, made a port call in Panama on the Pacific side, according to the U.S. embassy.Also in the Caribbean were the missile cruiser USS Lake Erie and the littoral combat ship USS Minneapolis-Saint Paul, according to Newsweek's review of publicly available ship-tracking data and satellite imagery.In August, the fast-attack submarine USS Newport News was ordered to the region from its Atlantic home port in Connecticut, but its exact location was never made public.The nuclear-powered boat is armed with Mark 48 torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise missiles, which have an approximate range of 1,000 miles.Earlier, Venezuela's Maduro mobilized the nation's armed forces across 284 "battlefronts," engaging thousands of troops and militiamen in exercises dubbed "Plan Independencia 200."Maduro described the maneuvers as a defense of Venezuelan sovereignty against U.S. operations.Updated, 9/16/25, 10:50 a.m. ET: This article was updated with more information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
