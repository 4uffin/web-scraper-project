ScienceFossilsPaleontologyamberSouth AmericaNews ArticleSouth American Amber Discovery Opens Window to 112-Million-Year-Old ForestPublishedSep 18, 2025 at 11:00 AM EDTBy Rachael O'ConnorLife and Trends ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe discovery in Ecuador of multiple pieces of insect-bearing amber—112 millions of years old—has opened a window to the secrets of a prehistoric forest.At this time, during the Cretaceous era, South America was part of a supercontinent known as Gondwana. And, in what is now Ecuador, there was a forest with a heaving ancient ecosystem.Trees produce a sap or resin, which in the right conditions can harden into amber. When hapless insects or pieces of plant matter get trapped in the sap, they can become stunningly preserved as fossils, allowing us to study organisms now long extinct.The discovery of amber deposits in Ecuador is major, as until recently, almost all fossilized resin was known from the the Northern Hemisphere....Researchers discovered two different types of amber in the quarry: one that formed underground around the roots of the trees, and another which was formed when resin was exposed to air.In their study, the team report the findings of their analysis of 60 samples of amber, which contain 21 separate fossil inclusions representing members of five insect orders—including flies, beetles, ants and wasps—along with a a fragment of a spider's web.Plant fossils—such as spores, pollens and other remains—were also discovered in the amber samples.The researchers believed that the amber formed in the southern part of the supercontinent Gondwana in a humid, dense forest dominated by resin-producing trees.The fossils suggest that the forests were moderately diverse, and showcased the earliest known "angiosperm" leaf assemblage from north-western South America. (An angiosperm is a flowering plant, with the leaf being the primary site of photosynthesis.)...The discovery, they say, is critical when it comes to unearthing the environment and life forms of the Southern Hemisphere 112 million years ago.Gondwana was a supercontinent that included around two-thirds of today's continental area—including what is now Australia, Antarctica, India, South America, Africa, Madagascar, Arabia and New Zealand.At the time, Earth was hot and humid, with lush vegetation and forests.Do you have a tip on a science story that Newsweek should be covering?
