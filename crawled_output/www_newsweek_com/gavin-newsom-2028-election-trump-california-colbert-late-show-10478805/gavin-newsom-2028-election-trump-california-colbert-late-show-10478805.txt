The poll shows that 12 percent of likely voters were unsure.What People Are SayingCNN polling analyst Harry Enten said on X this month that Newsom was having an impact nationally: “Early 2028 primary polls show he's rose from 8 percent to 21 percent (top) since April. He has near equal support from White, Black & Latinos, which means he can win across the primary map."What Happens NextTypically, candidates don't make campaign announcements until after the midterms, and Newsom's second term as governor will end at the start of 2027. A multitude of prominent Democrats are expected to run. Until then, polls will continue to be monitored to gauge Americans' views on potential presidential candidates.Update 9/24/2025  3:55 a.m. ET: This story has been updated to include more information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
