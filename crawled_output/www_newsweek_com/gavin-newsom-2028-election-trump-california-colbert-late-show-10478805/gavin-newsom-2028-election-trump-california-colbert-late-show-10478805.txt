The poll shows that 12 percent of likely voters were unsure.What People Are SayingCNN polling analyst Harry Enten said on X this month that Newsom was having an impact nationally: “Early 2028 primary polls show he's rose from 8 percent to 21 percent (top) since April. He has near equal support from White, Black & Latinos, which means he can win across the primary map."What Happens NextTypically, candidates don't make campaign announcements until after the midterms, and Newsom's second term as governor will end at the start of 2027. A multitude of prominent Democrats are expected to run. Until then, polls will continue to be monitored to gauge Americans' views on potential presidential candidates.Update 9/24/2025  3:55 a.m. ET: This story has been updated to include more information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
