Newsweek Writers DebatePublishedSep 24, 2025 at 06:00 AM EDTBy Newsweek ContributorsShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel Live! from the air for several days following comments by FCC Chair Brendan Carr criticizing Kimmel.Was Kimmel's suspension a response to viewer pressure—or a sign that free speech is under threat? Newsweek writers Mark Davis and David Faris debate:Mark Davis:It is fitting that the aftermath of the death of Charlie Kirk is filled with a sudden focus on the value of free speech. This man who held fast to his views while always welcoming the views of others is an example of the preciousness of debate in a free society. The additional lesson, learned by Jimmy Kimmel, is that the abuse of such freedom can sometimes carry a business consequence. His is not a free speech issue; it is a marketplace repercussion with roots in proper public reaction.David Faris:Last week, FCC capo Brendan Carr urged TV stations to pull Jimmy Kimmel’s show for his comments about the grotesque killing of far-right influencer Charlie Kirk. Disney quickly complied in advance. Hundreds of Americans have been fired for their thoughts, many for little other than posting Kirk’s own words to social media. This is part of a growing trend—on campus, for example, you are much more likely to face discipline from the Right for wrongthink about Israel than to be pilloried for Left-coded offenses. Today, “cancel culture” is almost exclusively a right-wing phenomenon, with the full backing of the GOP....Davis:Set aside the admittedly clumsy posturing of Brendan Carr and Pam Bondi.  It was not the FCC or DOJ that brought ABC to heel, it was viewers sick of Kimmel’s political bigotry. Comedians and even hostile journalists remain free to target Trump, but audiences will sometimes have limits.Faris:The Kimmel brouhaha is another example of someone (in this case Disney) mistaking sentiment in extremely online spaces like X for what the public wants. It took Carr days to walk back his remarks because they weren’t clumsy—they promised a sharp crackdown on free speech straight out of Vladimir Putin’s playbook. Davis:ABC did not react to online trolls weighing in on Kimmel’s false attribution of the shooter’s motive; it was real people in the heartland of America, a constituency the late-night host has made clear he despises. Networks and stations should know that such venom could now carry sizable public pushback.Faris:Whatever Disney’s motivation, gangland threats from Carr and Bondi together with the McCarthyite online mobs seeking retribution against ordinary people have created a censorious, intimidating atmosphere backed by the state. Jimmy Kimmel will land on his feet, but free speech in America is facing its most serious crisis in decades.Davis:Well, that hellish censorious atmosphere didn’t last long. ABC caved, and Kimmel’s return is imminent with zero apology.  No licenses will be lost, no Trump critic silenced. And Democrats will remain the side fond of muting dissent. This was all noise. Faris:The noise was the sound of corporate honchos panicking as thousands rushed to cancel their Disney+ subscriptions. Many Americans are justifiably weary of Trump's targets folding like a beach chair when they should be pushing back. In this case, Americans did the fighting for them, and they won.Davis:As this Kimmel chapter passes, it is clear the public will no longer shrug off vicious attacks disguised as comedy. ABC delivered a meaningless wrist slap designed to reduce the heat on them, but stations hold the real power these days, with the option of pre-empting network shows. In our grievance-obsessed age, “cancel culture” will be invoked often, but there is no crisis of liberties across the vast landscapes of expression. Everyone is free to spout off as they wish, but not without consequence. Those consequences should come from the public marketplace and not from government, which should get out of the business of policing content.Faris:While conservatives seemed happy to see one of their least favorite comedians off the air, the pushback against Carr and Bondi’s amateurish threats against broadcasters was broad and bipartisan. That’s encouraging—and Republicans speaking out against it deserve credit. But it is far too soon to declare this crisis over. There is still an active national campaign to silence regime critics by policing dissent on social media and destroying the careers of people who refuse to allow one senseless murder to be used as a pretext for enforced ideological conformity and the canonization of once-fringe ideas that they find repugnant.Mark Davis is a syndicated talk show host for the Salem Media Group on 660AM The Answer in Dallas-Ft.
