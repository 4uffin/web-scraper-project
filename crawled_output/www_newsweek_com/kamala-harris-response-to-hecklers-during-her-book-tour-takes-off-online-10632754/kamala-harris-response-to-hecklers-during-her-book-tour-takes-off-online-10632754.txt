PoliticsKamala HarrisProtestersIsraelIsraeli-Palestinian ConflictGazaNews ArticleKamala Harris’ Response to Hecklers During Her Book Tour Takes Off OnlinePublishedSep 25, 2025 at 03:33 AM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 04:12 AM EDTBy Jordan KingUS News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberFormer Vice President Kamala Harris told pro-Palestine protesters, “I’m not president right now, there’s nothing I can do” after she was heckled on Wednesday evening during the first stop of her book tour.Why It MattersThe encounter comes as the Israel-Palestine conflict continues to be a flashpoint issue within the United States. Harris’ remarks and the reaction they sparked reflect not only the ongoing debate over American foreign policy in the Middle East, but also highlight broader tensions surrounding her role and influence within the party following the 2024 election cycle.Loading twitter content...What To KnowOn Wednesday, the former vice president was repeatedly interrupted by hecklers while promoting her memoir 107 Days at an event in New York, according to The Washington Post.Sabrina Rodríguez, national political reporter at The Washington Post, shared a video of one of Harris’ responses that has been viewed 1 million times.In the clip, the crowd can be heard shouting down a protester, with one person heard telling them: “Talk to your president.”The venue erupts into applause when Harris then says: “I’m not president right now, there’s nothing I can do.”Harris was responding to a protester shouting, “The blood of the Palestinians is on your hands,” according to The Washington Post.She went on to stand by the actions she did take over Gaza when she was in office, but also seemingly distanced herself from then-President Joe Biden’s response to the war."People in our administration can tell you what my voice was in those rooms, in those closed rooms in the Oval Office," she said. "I was not the president. I couldn’t make the decision. But I made my position clear."She added: “Donald Trump has given [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu a blank check to do whatever he wants."...Demonstrators also gathered outside the venue, holding up Palestinian flags and posters that read: “Harris: Genocide is your legacy” and “717 Days of Genocide.”Harris was promoting her new memoir in front of 1,500 people at the Town Hall, in Midtown Manhattan, when the event was disrupted by several hecklers.The protesters, identified as pro-Palestinian activists, forced Harris to pause multiple times as jeers broke out.What People Are SayingKamala Harris told protesters: “Let’s bring the temperature down. I understand what’s happening right now in Gaza, what is happening to the Palestinian people is outrageous and it breaks my heart. I get it."She also said: “There are a lot of people that did not like that I spoke out so forcefully and candidly about my concern about what was happening in Gaza.”What Happens NextHarris book and its tour could reignite intra-party debates regarding Democratic leadership, foreign policy, and the party’s path forward. Her future remarks and actions are likely to remain a focus of both political discussion and public scrutiny.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
