NewsArizonaDemocratsRepublicansspecial electionNews ArticleDemocrat Outperforms Kamala Harris in Swing State Special ElectionPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 11:53 AM EDTBy Andrew StantonWeekend Staff WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberDemocratic Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva is on track to outperform former Vice President Kamala Harris by double digits in the special election to replace her late father, former Representative Raul Grijalva.Newsweek reached out to the Grijalva campaign and the Arizona Republican Party for comment via email.Why It MattersDemocrats have been overperforming in special elections across the country during President Donald Trump’s second term. Although special elections are not always predictive, Democrats are hoping the overperformances will translate into victories during the 2026 midterms, when they are aiming to flip control of the House and Senate.Although Grijalva’s district is not seen as competitive, Arizona will have two of the most contested House races of the midterms as Republican Representatives David Schweikert and Juan Ciscomani defend districts closely divided between Democrats and Republicans....What To KnowGrijalva continued to hold a significant lead over Republican Daniel Butierez in the special election. She led by nearly 39 percentage points (69 percent to 30 percent) as of Wednesday morning, according to the Associated Press.Most votes—87 percent—had been counted by then, but an estimated 13 percent of ballots were still outstanding, according to the AP. It’s unclear how the remaining ballots will affect the final margin.That is a notable improvement from Harris’ performance in the district last November. She carried the district by 23 points (61 percent to 38 percent), which was a decline from former President Joe Biden’s 33-point victory in 2020 (66 percent to 33 percent).The district covers the southernmost region of Arizona along the U.S.-Mexico border. Arizona is a swing state that has voted for both Democrats and Republicans at the state level. In 2024, it backed Trump by about 5.5 points but voted for Biden by less than a half-percentage point in 2020. It was the swing state that shifted furthest right in 2024 at the presidential level, but it still sent Democrat Ruben Gallego, then a member of the House, to the Senate over Republican Kari Lake.Grijalva’s performance comes after Democrat James Walkinshaw similarly overperformed in the Virginia special election to replace the late Representative Gerry Connolly earlier in September.Adelita Grijalva will follow her father, who died this year at age 77 following a battle with cancer. Raul Grijalva was long viewed as one of the most progressive Democrats in Congress.What People Are SayingAdelita Grijalva, on X: “Thank you, #AZ07. We made history — juntos. Now, let’s get to work!”Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, on X: “Congratulations to @AdelitaForAZ on her victory in #AZ07! I look forward to working with Representative-Elect Grijalva as she fights and delivers for Southern Arizona families in Washington.”Adam Carlson, founding partner at Zenith Polls, on X: “As expected, Adelita Grijalva (D) won the special election in AZ-07, giving House Dems their 214th member. This margin will likely narrow a bit as more Election Day ballots are counted — but this is looking like another double-digit Dem overperformance (district was Harris +22).What Happens NextA Grijalva victory will further narrow House Republicans’ advantage in the House. Currently, 219 seats are held by Republicans and 213 by Democrats. The result will have implications for legislation and efforts to secure the release of the Epstein files.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
