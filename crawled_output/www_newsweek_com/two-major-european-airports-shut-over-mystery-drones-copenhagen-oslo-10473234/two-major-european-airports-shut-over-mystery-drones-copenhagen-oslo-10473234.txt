NewsDronesCopenhagenDenmarkNorwayOsloAirportMoreNews ArticleTwo Major European Airports Shut Over Mystery DronesPublishedSep 23, 2025 at 03:03 AM EDTupdatedSep 23, 2025 at 05:18 AM EDTBy Brendan ColeSenior News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe airports in Copenhagen and Oslo were shut for hours on Tuesday, stranding tens of thousands of passengers as flights were diverted. Copenhagen Airport was closed for four hours and Oslo Airport for three hours following sightings of the drones, according to police cited by Reuters. Authorities in both countries have not yet specified the origin of the drones, but Danish Police Chief Superintendent Jens Jespersen told reporters that there was “a capable operator” behind the incident over Copenhagen. ...Why It Matters As of Tuesday morning, there was no clear cause announced but the appearance of drones in the airspace of Norway and Denmark, which are NATO members, comes at a tense time for the alliance. Already this month, fellow members Poland and Romania said Russian drones had entered their territory, while Estonia accused Russia of sending MiG-31 fighter jets into its airspace. Russia has denied the latter accusations and said that it had not intended to launch drones into NATO territory. What To KnowDenmark and Norway temporarily closed their main airports on Monday night following drone sightings.   The airspace at Oslo airport in Norway was shut from midnight local time due to a drone observation, with all flights diverted to the nearest airport. At around 9 p.m. local time, drones were detected over the Akershus Fortress military facility in Oslo and police detained two people linked to the incident, according to Norwegian media.  Norwegian airport operator Avinor said in a statement that the airport was reopened by 3.22 a.m. Tuesday.  Meanwhile, Danish police had said two or three large drones had been seen flying near Copenhagen's airport, which halted operations at 8:26 p.m. Monday, forcing the diversion of 50 flights to other airports, according to flight tracking service FlightRadar. In a statement on X, Copenhagen Airport warned of delays and some canceled departures and urged passengers to check with their airlines. Copenhagen police said an investigation was underway amid questions why the drones had disappeared without a trace, according to the Swedish publication Aftonbladet.  There is no information linking the incidents in Norway and Denmark. Russia has been accused of breaching the airspace of alliance members Poland and Romania with drones, and sending MiG-31 fighter jets into Estonian airspace, a claim Moscow has denied. Poland and Estonia have invoked Article 4 of the alliance’s charter for discussions about the threat. When asked if the drones could have come from Russia, Danish police chief superintendent Jens Jespersen said there was no information to that effect but that it was a “capable operator.” There was no indication as yet that the drones were intended to harm, he added. Monday's incident has caused the latest disruption for European air passengers after a cyberattack last Friday knocked out check-in and boarding systems supplied by Collins Aerospace, causing chaos at London's Heathrow and the Berlin and Brussels airports. What People Are Saying Danish Police Chief Superintendent Jens Jespersen told reporters: “This was what we would call a capable operator,” adding, "there is nothing to indicate that these drones were intended to harm people.” What Happens Next An investigation is underway and Danish police said they will hold a press conference about the drone incident on Tuesday which could reveal more about their origins. Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting3 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
