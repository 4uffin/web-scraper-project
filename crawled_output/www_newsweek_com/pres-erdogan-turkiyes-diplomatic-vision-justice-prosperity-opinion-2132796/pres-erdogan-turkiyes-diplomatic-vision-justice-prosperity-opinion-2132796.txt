Erdogan: Türkiye’s Diplomatic Vision for Justice and Prosperity | OpinionPublishedSep 22, 2025 at 06:00 AM EDTBy Recep Tayyip ErdoganPresident, TürkiyeShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe world has been facing an unrelenting wave of growing uncertainties and challenges for an extended period of time. Conflicts, lawlessness, terrorist attacks, pandemics, climate disasters, and deepening injustice and inequality are placing immense pressure on the current international order. In response, Türkiye acts with a vision that, without compromising its foreign policy approach centered on the principles of justice, peace, and solidarity, navigates comprehensive, complex, and deeply painful crises while safeguarding both its own security and the shared future of humanity. Our long-standing call, grounded in the principle that "The world is bigger than five," goes beyond a mere critique of the existing global order; it represents a vision for the common future of humanity.The United Nations, established in the aftermath of the Second World War to maintain peace and security, is regrettably no longer able to fulfil its core function in the face of today's crises and conflicts. The Security Council, the principal body of the UN, which was founded on the claims of justice and equality, has been confined to the will and interests of merely five countries in its decision-making regarding the regional and global crises. This unjust structure, which is among the primary sources of the deadlocks of our time, urgently needs to be reformed, so that the UN can indeed be a functioning center of effective multilateralism in line with its founding principles and we can produce just solutions to global challenges.Despite the vacuum caused by the UN's diminished effectiveness and the multilayered geopolitical challenges, Türkiye places a diplomacy of dialogue and mediation at the core of its foreign policy. The Black Sea Grain Initiative, which we have recently implemented, stands as the most prominent example of this approach, making tangible contributions to both regional and global security and stability. In a vast region extending from the Caucasus to Africa and from the Middle East to the Balkans, Türkiye has not refrained from assuming the responsibility to bring conflicts to a just diplomatic resolution and to usher in a sustainable and equitable peace....Türkiye's vision of diplomacy is reflected not only in resolving crises but also in addressing humanitarian issues. Türkiye's position as one of the world's leading providers of humanitarian aid is a testament to the responsibility bestowed upon us by our deep-rooted history and values. In this context, Türkiye will adamantly maintain its role as a leading nation in strengthening global solidarity.The ongoing occupation and atrocities committed by Israel in Gaza are one of the gravest tests of humanity's conscience. This test ends in shame for all of humanity, beginning with the actors of the international system. Children and women perish as millions are left deprived of even the most basic necessities. Türkiye persists in its endeavors to secure a ceasefire, facilitate the uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid, and rekindle the two-state solution. The more than 100,000 tons of aid we have sent to Gaza is but one of the steps we have taken to heal the wounds of our brothers and sisters struggling with hunger under Israel's inhumane blockade. In the face of an atrocity in which dozens of innocent Palestinians lose their lives every day—whether from hunger, lack of medicine, or the bullets and bombs of Israel's occupying forces—we believe the international community must demonstrate a more determined and sincere stance.The truth, which we have persistently and courageously advocated, is once again evident: A just peace is achievable only through the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with territorial integrity and East Al-Quds as its capital. This is essential for lasting peace and stability in the Middle East. Our call to the states of the world is clear: "Recognize the State of Palestine." Indeed, recognition of Palestine is the most powerful response to occupation, blockade, and oppression. We congratulate the countries that recently announced their decision in support of this effort, and we expect them to remain firm in their stance and translate their commitments into concrete steps.Syria is another significant country for regional stability. Since 2011, the conflict in Syria has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands and the displacement of millions, as well as extensive destruction. Today, the reconstruction and recovery of Syria is essential for the stability of the entire Middle East. The interests of Syrians must be prioritized in every decision concerning Syria's future. It should also be noted that lasting stability and peace in Syria can only be achieved by taking into account the collective will of the whole Syrian people, without granting privileges to any particular sect or group. We will continue to advocate for the principle of respect for Syria's territorial integrity and political unity, as we have reaffirmed in all spheres. Türkiye opposes any initiative that disregards the Syrian people's will and provides a foothold for separatist ambitions and terrorist organizations. The only way to rectify the mistakes made in Syria over the past 14 years is to support the establishment of a stable state and societal order based on a cooperative security approach.Related StoriesTrump Just Thanked Qatar for His $400M Airplane | Opinion4 min. readEgypt vs. Saudi Arabia—The Subtle Dispute Reshaping the Middle East | Opinion4 min. readVeteran: We Lied to You About What Happened in Afghanistan | Opinion5 min. readIn light of our painful experiences, we are confident that a future steeped in truth, justice, and solidarity can only be built through our collective will.
