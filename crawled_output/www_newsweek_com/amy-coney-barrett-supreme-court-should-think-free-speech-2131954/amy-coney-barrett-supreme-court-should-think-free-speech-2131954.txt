"We had a case a couple terms ago that involved Snapchat, a cheerleader who posted some things on Snapchat.""What would James Madison think about Snapchat? Well, that's the kind of question that really can't be answered," she continued.Barrett said Madison's intention, however, "is not the law that governs us.""The Constitution is law," she added....Why It MattersFree speech, a right granted in the First Amendment, has been at the center of a national debate amid the Trump administration's crackdown on hate speech following the killing of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.Related StoriesShooting Victim Held in Custody and on ICE Detainer5 min. readWesley Hunt’s Chances of Winning Texas GOP Senate Primary—Poll4 min. readTucker Carlson Urges ‘Civil Disobedience’ if Trump DOJ Targets Hate Speech5 min. read"Free speech protects ideas, debate, even dissent but it does NOT and will NEVER protect violence," Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X. "It is clear this violent rhetoric is designed to silence others from voicing conservative ideals. We will never be silenced. Not for our families, not for our freedoms, and never for Charlie. His legacy will not be erased by fear or intimidation."What To KnowBarrett was discussing her new book, Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution, during her Constitution Day appearance hosted by the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.She said she clerked for then-Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who also followed an originalist approach."I think one thing that inspired me to write this book is that Justice Scalia, even off the bench, tried to bring the Constitution and the court and law to people, lawyers and nonlawyers alike," Barrett said. "He certainly mentored us in chambers, but then he also I think really taught a lot of people and engaged a lot of people in law and questions of constitutional interpretation."Barrett also spoke about the importance of maintaining collegiality with her fellow justices."I firmly believe with all of my colleagues that civility and warmth and friendship should always be front and center, and debates about ideas don't change that," she said.What People Are SayingSupreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett said during an appearance at the National Constitution Center on Wednesday: "Free speech is broad enough that it encompasses the communication of ideas. So at the time that that text was ratified, so in 1791, that might have applied primarily to pamphlets and newspapers, etc. But if we're looking at what it means to communicate ideas, that can just as easily happen on Snapchat, on cable news or anything else."Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X on Tuesday: "You cannot call for someone's murder. You cannot swat a Member of Congress. You cannot dox a conservative family and think it will be brushed off as 'free speech.' These acts are punishable crimes, and every single threat will be met with the full force of the law."What Happens NextThe new Supreme Court term begins on October 6.Do you have a story that Newsweek should be covering?
