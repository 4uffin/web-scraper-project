U.S.Kash PatelFBICharlie kirkPollNews ArticleKash Patel Gets Mixed Approval Rating on Investigation Into Kirk ShootingPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 05:34 PM EDTupdatedSep 17, 2025 at 02:57 AM EDTBy Anna CommanderDeputy News EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberForty percent of U.S. adults are "unsure" if they approve of the job that FBI Director Kash Patel is doing in the investigation into the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a new poll shows.Why It MattersPatel has come under scrutiny from legal analysts and lawmakers after publicly describing investigative findings in the fatal shooting of Kirk.The dispute centers on whether an FBI director's on-air and social media summaries of evidence, including references to a recovered note and DNA matches, risk violating Department of Justice norms regarding pretrial publicity and due process.The shooting at a college campus last week raises concerns of university safety protocols, political violence and security at public events.Kirk, 31, was a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and a notable younger voice and advocate of the MAGA movement, with a large social media following....What To KnowIn The Economist/YouGov poll released on Tuesday, 36 percent approve of the way Patel is handling the investigation into Kirk's killing.The poll shows that 24 percent disapprove, and 40 percent are unsure. The poll surveyed 1567 U.S. adult citizens and was taken from September 12 to September 15. The margin of error is 3.6 percent.The poll also surveyed Americans on their familiarity with Kirk. Twenty-four percent said they are very familiar with Kirk, 32 percent said they are somewhat familiar, and 15 percent said they had "heard of him, but didn't know anything." Twenty-eight percent said they had never heard of him."The recent poll on Patel's handling of the Kirk assassination investigation, with 40 percent of Americans unsure, 36 percent approving, and 24 percent disapproving, suggests a public grappling with mixed signals about his leadership as FBI director," political analyst Craig Agranoff told Newsweek."Patel's initial misstep in announcing a suspect's custody prematurely, later corrected, likely fuels that uncertainty, though his transparency in updating the investigation and the swift arrest of Tyler Robinson may account for some approval," Agranoff said."Whether this reflects genuine leadership or a perception of competence is unclear, his hands-on approach shows decisiveness, but the high uncertainty indicates many Americans are still assessing his effectiveness amid early miscommunications and the high-profile nature of the case.""Leadership often hinges on consistency, and Patel's performance here remains under scrutiny as the investigation unfolds."What People Are SayingNew Jersey Senator Cory Booker, Tuesday on X: "Kash Patel has made our country less safe. He has put fealty to Trump over his sworn oath to the constitution."FBI Director Kash Patel, on X over the weekend: "Against all law enforcement recommendations, we demanded the video footage and enhanced stills of the suspect be released to the public. Robinson's father, who ultimately turned him in to authorities, told law enforcement that he recognized his son in that released video."What Happens NextThe suspect in connection with Kirk's shooting, Tyler Robinson, is set to make his first appearance in court on Tuesday. He has been charged with murder.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
