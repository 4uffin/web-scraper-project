Multiple states are under a freeze warning and frost advisories overnight on Friday and into the weekend as temperatures could plunge into the 20s and low 30s, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).Why It Matters The NWS alerts aim to protect crops, outdoor vegetation, and plumbing as overnight temperatures drop well below seasonal norms.The early arrival of cold weather could pose risks for farmers, gardeners, and homeowners who may not yet have prepared for freezing conditions, with the potential for economic consequences from lost crops and possible damage to infrastructure.What To KnowThe freeze warning is in place for portions of New York, Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire.According to the NWS, "sub-freezing temperatures as low as 27 expected Friday night. Temperatures Saturday night are likely to be as cold or a bit colder than Friday night."Counties under warning include Central Somerset, Northern Franklin, Northern Oxford, Northwest Aroostook, Northern Somerset, and Northern Piscataquis in Maine.In New Hampshire, Northern Coos and Southern Coos counties are under the warning. Hamilton, Southern Franklin and western Clinton counties in New York and Essex County in Vermont are impacted as well.Frost advisories are in effect for adjacent regions, with the coldest temperatures forecast just before sunrise on Saturday.Below is a map of the impacted states:
What People Are SayingNWS meteorologist Brian Hurley to Newsweek via phone on Friday: "The forecasts we have are in the 20s and low 30s. It is interesting, it is a little early for these temperatures this time of year that is why we're seeing these warnings and also advisories."Hurley added: "If you see frost, the means that grass blade or that windshield has seen freezing temperatures. These temperatures are below normal, but interesting enough, were not really looking at records with this."NWS Burlington wrote X on Friday: "What's it take to make frosty weather? We've got it. Clearing skies and very dry conditions following a strong front in mid-September. Satellite shows clouds pulling a disappearing act as high pressure builds. Expect temperatures to plunge after sunset to create widespread frost."NWS Albany on X on Friday: "A Freeze Warning has been issued for Hamilton County and a Frost Advisory for Northern Herkimer and Northern Warren Counties from 2 AM to 8 AM Saturday. Protect any sensitive vegetation in these areas."What Happens Next?The active freeze warnings are expected to expire by early morning in most regions. Residents are urged to take immediate measures such as insulating pipes, covering plants, and checking on potentially vulnerable individuals and pets.
