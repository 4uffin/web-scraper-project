If legislators do not pass something by 11:59 p.m. on September 30, the government will shut down.There are many impacts of government shutdowns—hundreds of thousands of federal workers may be unpaid or furloughed during the shutdown, and there can be disruptions to passport processing applications, national parks and government benefits.What To KnowSchumer on Thursday responded to a memo issued by the Trump administration about the potential for some federal employees to be fired if the government indeed shuts down on October 1.Politico reported a memo from the OMB that directed agencies to consider RIF notices for employees in programs that will see a lapse of discretionary funding in a shutdown, where another source of funding is not available, and the program is “not consistent with the President’s priorities.”...“RIF notices will be in addition to any furlough notices provided due to the lapse in appropriation. RIF notices should be issued to all employees working on the relevant PPA, regardless of whether the employee is excepted or furloughed during the lapse in appropriations,” the memo reads.If implemented, this could mean some permanent firings of federal employees—a step further than the typical furloughs during a shutdown.Schumer released a statement on the memo on Thursday.“This is an attempt at intimidation,” Schumer wrote. “Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one—not to govern, but to scare. This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government.”He continued, “These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today.”The memo notes this would only occur if the government shuts down. It sought to cast blame on Democrats for the shutdown.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, criticized the memo in a press conference on Thursday.“Now, the Trump administration has made their intentions clear. They want to continue to fire civil servants who are hardworking, American taxpayers because throughout the year, they’ve been firing civil servants who are hardworking American taxpayers. We will not be intimidated by these threats coming from the most extreme parts of the Trump administration,” he said.A CR has passed the House of Representatives, but faces challenging headwinds in the Senate, where it needs bipartisan support to pass the 60-vote filibuster. Democrats accused Republicans, who control all three branches of government and both chambers of Congress, of not being willing to make key concessions on matters like health care. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused the White House of an “attempt at intimidation” following reports of an official memo telling federal agencies to start firing workers as a government shutdown approaches.Republicans, however, have said Senate Democrats are to blame for not agreeing to the bill passed by the House.What People Are SayingHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote on X: “Attention, Virginia Donald Trump and MAGA extremists are plotting mass firings of federal workers starting October 1. Their goal is to ruin your life and punish hardworking families already struggling with Trump Tariffs and inflation. Remember in November.”Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, on X: “These weird sickos enjoy cruelty.”House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, on X: “House Republicans have already done the job of passing a clean, bipartisan bill to keep the government open. Now it’s up to Senate Democrats, who have long said shutdowns are bad and hurt people, to vote to fund the American government, or shut it down because they want to restore taxpayer-funded benefits to illegal aliens.”What Happens NextCongress has only five days to reach a deal to avert a shutdown.Update 9/25/25, 2:48 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readPoliticsElon Musk’s Grok AI Inks Deal With Trump Admin to Integrate With Government3 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
