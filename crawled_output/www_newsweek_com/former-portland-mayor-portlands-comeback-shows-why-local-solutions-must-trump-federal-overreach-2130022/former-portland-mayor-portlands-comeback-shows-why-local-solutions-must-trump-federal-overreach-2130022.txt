As someone with a front-row seat to the recovery of one of America's most remarkable cities, I've watched Portland's resurgence with pride—and the Trump administration's recent attacks on our city with dismay. The president's son, at his most disingenuous, called Portland and Seattle "craphole cities" and hinted at a federal takeover of our police force, while the nation's labor secretary recently suggested the administration should send ICE agents to Portland to "crackdown." The cherry on top was when the president himself threatened to "wipe out" protestors in Portland because of something he saw on TV, ignorantly asserting protesting has been going on for years. He also said Portland is "like living in hell." This is pure political theater pushing lies that could have devastating consequences for Portland. Again.By sending the military into L.A. and D.C., Trump is doing to other cities what he did to Portland in 2020, facts be damned. We know this playbook firsthand—we're still cleaning up the character assassination from the last time anonymous federal agents in unmarked vans snatched people off our streets during protests over the murder of George Floyd. The results were ugly and caused lasting damage to our citizens' livelihoods and our city's reputation.

But we've done what Portland always does: work hard. As a result, we're overcoming the challenges that have plagued cities nationwide since 2020. Homicides dropped 51 percent in the first half of 2025—the largest decrease among major American cities. Gun violence is down roughly 30 percent from last year and nearly 60 percent from 2022. Downtown foot traffic consistently exceeds 2 million people monthly, with July of this year setting a post-pandemic record of 2.83 million visitors. Portland ranks among the top five job markets nationwide and was named the cleanest metro in the nation. Even our protests are delivering economic benefit to our small businesses these days.What distinguishes Portland's recovery from the pandemic, fentanyl crisis, and 2020 protests—significantly inflamed by Trump's decision to deploy federal agents—is our commitment to creating a better, stronger, more inclusive city.This is an economic strategy rooted in Portland's values that invites everyone to contribute to our success. And it's working. Women-led businesses in our downtown are increasing. LGBTQ-owned businesses and businesses owned by people of color both doubled their representation. Our world-renowned food scene—anchored by the upcoming James Beard Public Market—thrives because of diverse entrepreneurs like Gregory Gourdet and Carlo LaMagna, whose restaurants have earned national acclaim. Major sports franchises are seeking us out, with the WNBA bringing a new team to Portland in 2026. Companies like On footwear, which employs over 500 people in the city, last year chose Portland for its largest U.S. retail location at the time.What Trump and his allies miss is that inclusive economic growth actually strengthens public safety. When people have good jobs, when small businesses are thriving, when communities feel invested in their neighborhoods, crime naturally decreases. Our 51 percent drop in homicides didn't happen in a vacuum—it happened alongside economic opportunity expanding to more people. Diverse businesses drive innovation, attract top talent, and create the kind of dynamic economy that can compete globally while building stronger, safer communities. The stats listed above aren't indicators of a city in decline—they're hallmarks of an economy that works for everyone and creates opportunity across all communities. In short—they are true American ideals in action.But, as we've seen in Washington, D.C., neither progress nor facts matter in Trump's escalating campaign to send troops into American cities that disagree with his politics. Every day brings news that another liberal city is in the crosshairs—Chicago, Baltimore, New York, San Francisco—and now his campaign is reaching an alarming and dangerous new stage. His recent executive order creating special National Guard units in all 50 states to intervene in civilian law enforcement matters is an un-American assault on local governance.Beyond the constitutional threat, there are economic consequences that Trump doesn't seem to care about: For a "businessman" president, sending in federal troops is perhaps the most anti-business action imaginable. We've seen the devastating impact in Washington, D.C., where restaurant sales for one owner of a casual eatery have plummeted by 30 percent since the National Guard deployment. Another restaurant owner told The New York Times that sales dropped from $1,200 to just $112 on the first night troops appeared. When families see soldiers armed with assault weapons walking around, they don't think "safety," they stay home.Portland's police and leaders are making the city safer. Our business community is building an innovative economy that works for everyone. We don't need federal intervention; we need what has always made America great: the freedom to innovate and the ability to build our community's future ourselves.Ted Wheeler served as the 53rd mayor of Portland, Oregon, from 2017-2025.
