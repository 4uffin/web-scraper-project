Kennedy Jr. and his team of anti-vaccine advisers, former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez told senators Wednesday.Monarez and former CDC Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry described turmoil inside federal health agencies, saying Kennedy and his political advisers dismissed data showing vaccines are safe and effective.Monarez, who was fired after 29 days in the job following disputes with Kennedy, warned that once-contained diseases such as polio and whooping cough could return in the United States."I believe preventable diseases will return, and I believe we will have our children harmed by things they don't need to be harmed by," she said.Loading twitter content...When is the advisory committee meeting?The hearing came a day before a federal vaccine panel was set to begin a two-day meeting in Atlanta to weigh recommendations on shots for COVID-19, hepatitis B and chickenpox. Kennedy has included several vaccine skeptics in the panel.Before this week's panel meeting, Houry said she proposed presenting data on the hepatitis B vaccine given to newborns to prevent transmission of the disease from mother to child. She said a Kennedy adviser rejected the information as biased because it could support keeping the shots on the schedule."You're suggesting that they wanted to move away from the birth dose, but they were afraid that your data would say that they should retain it?" Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, who chairs the powerful health committee, asked.Meanwhile, four Democratic-led Western states on Wednesday issued their own guidelines for seasonal vaccines, a direct rebuke of federal health policies under Kennedy.Which mandated vaccines could be eliminated?Members have questioned whether newborn hepatitis B shots are necessary and suggested narrowing COVID-19 guidelines.The CDC director must endorse the panel's decisions before they become official. Acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill will make that call."I'm very nervous about it," Monarez said of the meeting.While senators heard testimony from former CDC Director Susan Monarez, O'Neill criticized CDC scientists on social media. In a post on X, O'Neill attacked the agency for "unpopular policies like mask mandates, social distancing" and vaccine requirements during the pandemic, writing, "The American people deserve better — and leaders committed to that cause."O'Neill, an investor with close ties to billionaire Peter Thiel, previously held health policy roles under President George W. Bush. Kennedy appointed him acting CDC director after Monarez's ouster last month, though he continues to serve as deputy health secretary.When was Dr. Susan Monarez fired from the CDC?Monarez testified she was ousted on August 27 after refusing to approve vaccine recommendations without scientific backing and for declining to dismiss senior CDC officials without cause.Kennedy has denied ordering "rubber-stamped" vaccine approvals but acknowledged demanding personnel changes. He claimed Monarez admitted she was "untrustworthy," an allegation she rejected through her attorney.Monarez said Kennedy told her, "he spoke to the president every day about changing the childhood vaccination schedule."Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, said Monarez "stood up for protecting the well-being of the American people, and for that reason she was fired."While most Senate Republicans have avoided direct criticism of Kennedy, some expressed concern over reduced access to COVID-19 vaccines and the scaling back of childhood immunizations. Others echoed Kennedy's skepticism of federal health agencies.Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas physician, pressed Monarez on her "philosophy" on vaccines, while Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville argued her job was to show loyalty to Kennedy, saying, "America needs better than this."Sen. Bill Cassidy of Iowa, also a physician, pressed the witnesses as they described their exchanges with Kennedy and his advisers."To be clear, he said there was not science or data, but he still expected you to change the schedule?" Cassidy asked....Why did Former CDC Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry Resign?Houry resigned on Aug. 27, 2025, hours after the White House dismissed Monarez.She cited growing political interference in the agency's scientific work—especially around vaccine policy—and concerns that decisions were being made before adequate data or evidence was available. In her resignation, Houry warned that without Monarez, the CDC lacked scientific leadership and transparency.Update: 9/17/25, 1:08 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Update: 9/17/25, 1:37 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Update: 9/17/25, 5:47 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
