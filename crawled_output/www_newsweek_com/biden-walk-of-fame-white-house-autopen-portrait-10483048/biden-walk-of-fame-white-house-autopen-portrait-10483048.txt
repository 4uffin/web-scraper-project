PoliticsJoe BidenWhite HouseDonald TrumpBreaking NewsNews ArticleWhite House Debuts West Wing Walk of Fame with Biden Autopen PortraitPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 02:05 PM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 04:02 PM EDTBy Jesus Mesa and Gabe WhisnantShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe White House colonnade now includes a striking addition: an image of an autopen representing President Joe Biden, installed by former President Donald Trump as part of a new “Presidential Walk of Fame.”A video posted to X by Margo Martin, special assistant to the president and communications adviser, shows the walkway lined with black-and-white presidential portraits. As the camera pans to where Biden's portrait should be, it's revealed to be a zoomed-in photo of an autopen signing his name.“The Presidential Walk of Fame has arrived on the West Wing Colonnade,” Martin wrote in the caption.Loading twitter content...Why It MattersTrump has repeatedly accused Biden of relying on an autopen to sign pardons, executive orders, and other major documents, claiming Biden wasn’t even aware they had been signed.Legal experts note that autopen use is acceptable so long as the president directs it, but Trump insists its deployment in Biden’s final days undermines the validity of those actions.What To KnowTrump publicized the walkway project weeks ago, warning that “not all presidents will be treated equally” in the Walk of Fame outside the West Wing. He told the Daily Caller that Biden’s place would be “a picture of the autopen,” not a formal portrait.Portraits of Barack Obama and George W. Bush had been moved, either replaced with Trump’s own or placed in less visible spots, but are back in the walkway. The latest changes coincide with a Rose Garden redesign featuring stone tiles and new lighting, which aides call the “Rose Garden Club,” modeled after Mar-a-Lago....In June, Trump ordered an investigation into Biden’s use of the autopen, citing what he called his predecessor’s “cognitive decline.” Investigators were tasked with reviewing specific policy documents signed using the autopen, including clemency grants, executive orders, memoranda, and other presidential directives.Biden rejected the claim, saying in a statement that he personally made the decisions on pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations, and called Trump’s suggestion “ridiculous and false.”What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump told the Daily Caller on September 1: "We put up a picture of the autopen. He didn’t win the race. He lost badly. He was a horrible president, but can you imagine, he says he has Stage Nine cancer."Former President Joe Biden told The New York Times of Republicans who say that his aides abused the autopen: "They're liars. They know it. They know, for certain. I mean, this is—look, what they, they've had a pretty good thing going here. They've done so badly. They've lied so consistently about almost everything they're doing."What Happens NextTrump’s June memo instructed the White House Counsel, in coordination with Attorney General Pam Bondi and other agency heads, to lead the inquiry. The matter is now a formal internal probe within the executive branch, although there’s no timeline or publicly stated process yet for releasing the findings.Update 9/24/25, 4:01 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.
