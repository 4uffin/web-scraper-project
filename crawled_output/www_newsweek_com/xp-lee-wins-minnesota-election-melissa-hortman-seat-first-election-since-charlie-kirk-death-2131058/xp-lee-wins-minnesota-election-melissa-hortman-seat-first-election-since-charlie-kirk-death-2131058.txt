PoliticsDemocrats2024 ElectionElectionCharlie kirkRepublicansGun CrimeMoreNews ArticleDemocrats Underperform in First Election Since Charlie Kirk’s DeathPublishedSep 17, 2025 at 05:44 AM EDTBy Kate Plummer and Matthew RobinsonShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberDemocrat Xp Lee won a special election on Tuesday to fill the Minnesota House seat of a Democratic leader assassinated earlier this year, but received a smaller proportion of the vote.Representative Melissa Hortman held the District 34B seat in northern Minneapolis until her death in June.Lee defeated his Republican opponent, Ruth Bittner, to win the election on Tuesday, securing 60.82 percent of the vote to Bittner's 39.11 percent.Lee's vote share was more than two percent less than the 63.08 percent Hortman received when she won the seat in November 2024....Why It MattersLee's win restores the Minnesota House to a 67-67 tie, and preserves a bipartisan power-sharing arrangement brokered after the 2024 elections.This was the first election to take place since the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk last Wednesday, and came amid heightened national attention to political violence.What To KnowCommenting on his victory, Lee promised to "work hard every day" to honor Hortman's legacy.Related StoriesDemocrat Says Liberals Can’t Hit 200-Yard Targets After Kirk Shooting6 min. readDonald Trump’s Reaction to Melissa Hortman Flag Question Sparks Anger4 min. readSpecial Election Opens for Seat Left Empty by Last Act of Political Violence4 min. read"We did our best to make her proud: knocking on doors daily, making phone calls, and texting every neighbor we could," he said.Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said that Lee's "commitment to expanding access to education, affordable health care, and good-paying jobs honors the legacy" of Hortman.There was a slightly lower turnout on Tuesday with 26,596 votes, compared to the 26,827 votes in November, 2024.The election came three months after Hortman and her husband, Mark, were gunned down in their home by a man impersonating a police officer. State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were also shot, but survived.Vance Boelter, 57, faces federal and state murder, attempted murder and other charges for the attacks on June 14.What People Are SayingMartin said in a statement: "Across Minnesota, our hearts are still broken by the horrific assassination that stole Melissa and her husband Mark."Political violence is a scourge that has taken far too many lives. Enough is enough. It must end now. And in every case, each of us has a responsibility to condemn and reject political violence wherever it rears its head."Representative Zack Stephenson, Hortman's successor as the top Democrat in the Minnesota House, said that Lee's victory restores their caucus to full strength ahead of a potential special session that Governor Tim Walz wants on school security and gun violence after a recent church shooting."That means we'll prioritize the safety of our kids instead of access to weapons of war, and we'll make our economy work better for all Minnesotans, not just the billionaires," he said.Bittner said political violence made her question whether to run for office, but concluded that "there's no way to solve this problem if we shrink back in fear."What Happens NextTwo further special elections will be held on November 4 to fill two Senate seats.One was vacated by Democratic senator Nicole Mitchell, who resigned after being convicted of burglarizing her estranged stepmother's home. The other is for the seat of Republican Senator Bruce Anderson, who died in July.Update 09/18/25 09.05 a.m. ET: The vote share figures in this article were updated.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
