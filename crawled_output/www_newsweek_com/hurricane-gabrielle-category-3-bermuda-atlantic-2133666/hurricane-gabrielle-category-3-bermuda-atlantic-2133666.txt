Though the storm is not expected to make landfall, its far-reaching effects, especially hazardous surf and rip currents, are already being felt along populated coastlines.The NHC said Gabrielle is expected to continue tracking north before veering northeast, staying east of Bermuda. AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said that while Gabrielle poses no direct threat to the U.S., its swells are impacting coastal areas from North Carolina to Canada.The storm also arrives amid heightened activity in the Atlantic basin, with the NHC monitoring multiple tropical waves that could develop into additional storms later this week.Hurricane Gabrielle 2025 Tracker and Path: What We KnowAs of Monday morning, Hurricane Gabrielle was located roughly 195 miles southeast of Bermuda and moving north-northwest at 10 mph. The NHC confirmed the storm had reached Category 3 status, making it the second major hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season after Hurricane Erin.In addition to Gabrielle, the NHC is tracking at least two other tropical waves. One system near the Cabo Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical depression later this week. Another, east of the Lesser Antilles, has a lower chance of development but could still bring gusty winds and rain to the Leeward Islands.September marks the climatological peak of hurricane season, and forecasters note that 60 percent of annual activity typically occurs after this date. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s updated forecast predicts 13 to 18 named storms this season, with five expected to intensify into hurricanes.While Gabrielle is not expected to make landfall, emergency officials in Bermuda and along the East Coast are urging continued vigilance. The NHC continues to issue advisories and updates as the storm progresses.Where Is Hurricane Gabrielle Going to Hit?Swells generated by Gabrielle began reaching Bermuda on Sunday and are now affecting the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina to New England, as well as parts of Canada. The NHC warned of "life-threatening surf and rip current conditions" and advised beachgoers to monitor local marine forecasts.Gabrielle is expected to maintain its strength through Monday before encountering drier air and wind shear that could weaken it. The storm's projected path keeps it well offshore, with a turn toward the northeast forecast by Tuesday....What Is the Difference Between a Hurricane and a Typhoon?Despite their different names, hurricanes and typhoons are the same type of storm: tropical cyclones. These robust systems form over warm ocean waters and feature organized thunderstorms with a closed, low-level circulation. The distinction lies solely in geography.According to the NOAA, the term "hurricane" is used to describe these storms when they occur in the North Atlantic, central North Pacific, or eastern North Pacific. In contrast, the same phenomenon is called a "typhoon" when it develops in the Northwest Pacific. Elsewhere, such as in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean, the generic term "tropical cyclone" applies regardless of wind strength.Tropical cyclones are classified by wind speed:Tropical Depression: Winds below 39 mphTropical Storm: Winds between 39–73 mphHurricane/Typhoon: Winds of 74 mph or higherThe Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to November 30, though storms can form outside this window. NOAA emphasizes that the ingredients for cyclone formation include warm ocean water, moisture, and light winds—conditions that, when sustained, can lead to destructive weather events like flooding, high surf, and violent winds.What People Are SayingNational Hurricane Center, in a forecast discussion: "Satellite images indicate that Gabrielle has rapidly intensified into a major hurricane with a well-defined eye. The current intensity is set to 105 kt, a blend of constrained Dvorak estimates of about 100 kt with higher Data-T values of 115 kt. Further intensification is expected today, and the intensity forecast is raised for the first 24 hours, then kept the same afterwards. Small changes were made to the wind radii to account for the stronger hurricane."AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva, in an AccuWeather report: "Tropical activity is expected to increase in the coming weeks as conditions gradually become more favorable for development. More tropical activity will increase the risk for direct impacts to the Caribbean and U.S. coastlines."What Happens NextGabrielle is expected to continue moving northeast into open waters, gradually weakening as it encounters less favorable conditions. Meanwhile, forecasters will closely monitor the developing tropical waves for signs of intensification, with the next named storm likely to be Humberto.Update 9/22/25, 9:50 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
