U.S.Drinking waterwater contaminationNews ArticleMap Shows States Where Drinking Water Has Multiple ContaminantsPublishedSep 22, 2025 at 09:54 AM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 03:17 AM EDTBy Alia ShoaibNews ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberHealth nonprofit the Environmental Working Group has released a map it says shows that nearly 100 million Americans are drinking water contaminated with three toxic chemicals.The map shows which areas have water supplies simultaneously contaminated with the three potentially cancer-causing chemicals—chromium-6, arsenic, and nitrate.Why It MattersLong-term exposure to these contaminants, even at low levels, can pose health risks, such as cancer, birth defects and liver damage, according to the EWG.The group is calling for action to update drinking water treatment systems to target multiple contaminants at one time, rather than just one at a time, which is currently the norm.The EWG used information from its Tap Water Database as a source for the map data, which is put together by collecting test results from state and federal water authorities....What To KnowThe map shows areas across the country where drinking water reportedly contains levels of these contaminants above public health goal limits.Blue dots indicate areas where just chromium-6 was detected, orange dots indicate chromium-6 detected along with one other co-contaminant, and purple dots represent chromium-6 along with both arsenic and nitrate.The map shows that California, Arizona, and Texas are the worst affected hotspots, where high levels of all three contaminants are found.Across the country, chromium-6 alone contaminates water serving more than 260 million people, the EWG claims, while arsenic affects the water supply of 134 million, and nitrate is found in supplies for 263 million.The EWG says that these chemicals can be removed from water through treatments such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis.The nonprofit notes that U.S. drinking water regulations focus on single contaminants, overlooking the fact that multiple harmful chemicals often co-occur. It has called for advanced filtration systems that can target multiple several contaminants simultaneously.The EWG said it found in a peer-reviewed study that treating multiple contaminants simultaneously could prevent an estimated 50,000 cancer cases over a lifetime.What People Are SayingThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency told Newsweek in an emailed statement: “EPA is aware of this campaign and will review the findings. The agency is committed to ensuring that Americans can rely on clean and safe drinking water as part of the agency’s Powering the Great American Comeback initiative.”“The agency uses multiple tools to achieve this goal, including establishing federal drinking water regulations, administering water infrastructure funding programs, and providing technical assistance to communities. The Safe Drinking Water Act requires EPA to review each national primary drinking water regulation at least once every six years and revise them, if appropriate.”Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist at the EWG, said: "This is a significant national problem and public health issue."People are exposed to multiple contaminants in their drinking water, and analysis shows that regulating and treating them simultaneously is a more effective and efficient approach than focusing on each chemical separately."Melanie Benesh, EWG's vice president of government affairs said: "It's time for Congress and federal regulators to adopt a 21st-century strategy for a 21st-century crisis. Investing in water treatment not only prevents cancer, it improves the health for millions."Bernadette Del Chiaro, EWG's senior vice president for California, said: "Millions of Californians are exposed to a toxic soup of cancer-causing chemicals in their tap water every day, yet state policy continues to move too slowly to address weak limits and maximize public health protections."What Happens NextThe EWG is urging federal and state regulators to update drinking water standards and adopt treatment strategies that address multiple contaminants at once.Update 9/25/2025 3:15 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with comment from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
