The agency was said to be understaffed and lacking in new technology to cope, which the report appeared to affirm, calling for new technology and training to help prevent national security issues....What To KnowInspectors reviewed a sample of 60 immigration files, finding that 28 (47 percent) were missing available information on the use of fraudulent documents. Another sample of 60 instances where immigrants were suspected of having fraudulent documents found that 47 were allowed to enter the U.S.The OIG said that its findings raised serious concerns about CBP's reporting and vetting, calling them "potential risks and vulnerabilities.""For example, CBP may not be communicating information necessary to adjudicate immigration cases and identify fraud trends," the report read. "More importantly, CBP may not be identifying and preventing all individuals who could pose a threat to national security from entering and remaining in the United States."While CBP agents have a variety of tools at their disposal, including facial comparison technology, fingerprint scanners, and black lights to determine whether IDs are fake or not, the OIG found that not all of this was available to all agents at all ports of entry, in particular, vehicle crossings.Inspectors also flagged concerns with agents allowing those with suspected fake or fraudulent documents into the U.S. during fiscal year 2024, when President Joe Biden was still in office. While a proportion of those flagged were then detained or sent for further processing, not all were.The OIG did note that the policy had since changed, with President Donald Trump implementing an executive order on his return to the White House, which effectively ended CBP releasing flagged immigrants into the U.S.Another issue was reporting, with agents not always reporting documentation issues to other authorities, such as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), or seizing the documents. The information would be useful in determining whether an immigrant can stay or face deportation.Inspectors said CBP needed to implement changes, including clear training practices for agents, accurate recording of fake documents, and better communication with other immigration agencies.What People Are SayingKenneth Gray, professor of practice at the University of New Haven and retired FBI Special Agent, told Newsweek: "Technology is always changing, it requires training to use that technology as it changes. CBP and Office of Field Operations were being pushed to the limit with the number of people coming in, and so training may not have always been up to date, people may not have always been going through the reviews they are supposed to go through, so as to be refreshed with the problems with certain types of documents. So this adds to the problem."Mark Songer, vice president of Robson Forensic and forensic document examiner, told Newsweek: "The challenges facing CBP in detecting counterfeit or fraudulent documents are critical, given the profound implications these issues have for our national security."Criminals are continually developing more advanced techniques and technologies to evade scrutiny, utilizing color-shifting inks, security paper, and even holographic features, making it increasingly difficult for CBP agents to detect counterfeit documents. Additionally, differences in document formats and security features across countries complicate identification and verification if that information isn't shared effectively."A CBP Spokesperson told Newsweek: "CBP officers and agents use a variety of tools and system capabilities, including facial comparison technology, document scanners, fingerprint readers, black lights, and magnifying loupes, to help identify fraudulent documents and imposters."CBP remains committed to strengthening processes to identify and remove fraudulent documents from circulation to further secure our nation's borders and help achieve the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's national security goals, and continuously seeks opportunities for training and technology improvements by working with stakeholders in the public and private sectors."Border czar Tom Homan, in a recent X post: "We have the most secure border in the history of this nation and the data proves it. President Trump has been a game changer and his leadership makes the country safer every day. With strong border security you have stronger national security."What Happens NextCBP has implemented some of the recommendations already, and the agency has received extra funding under the Trump administration, which will bolster agent numbers and technology being used along the border.Update 9/17/25, 4:18 p.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from Mark Songer.Update 9/18/25, 11:58 a.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
