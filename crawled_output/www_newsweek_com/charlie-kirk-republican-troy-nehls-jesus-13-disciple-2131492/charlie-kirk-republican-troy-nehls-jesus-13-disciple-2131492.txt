His Arizona-based group, Turning Point USA, drew evangelical Christian youth into politics through social media, a popular podcast and campus events.Troy Nehls: Charlie Kirk Would've Been Jesus Christ's '13th Disciple'Loading twitter content...During Patel's hearing, Nehls said, "Charlie Kirk was a man of faith ... first and foremost, he loved his Lord Jesus, he loved his family. Beautiful wife, beautiful children. Just a remarkable honorable man that was silenced by this assassin's bullet. I would say if Charlie Kirk lived in the biblical times, he would have been the 13th disciple."The Texas Republican's tribute was among several from lawmakers during official proceedings over the past week. Earlier Wednesday, a motion was introduced to designate October 14—Kirk's birthday—as a national Charlie Kirk Day.As part of tributes to him, Kirk's supporters have focused on his Christian faith as a big influence in his work. A few months before his death, he said this is what he would want to be remembered for.In the days following his fatal shooting at Utah Valley University, some fans posted AI-generated videos of Kirk heading to heaven directly from the table he had been sitting on while speaking to students. Other videos showed Jesus crying over him or welcoming him.While some have questioned the appropriateness of such posts, they have shown the clear links between Kirk, his faith and the beliefs of his staunch supporters.Several evangelical churches dedicated their Sunday services to him over the weekend, with some church leaders calling his death a spiritual attack. However, not all church leaders have looked to honor Kirk, saying he sowed division by the way he engaged with people....Who Is Charlie Kirk Shooting Suspect, Tyler Robinson?Kirk was shot dead a week ago as he spoke for the first time on his American Comeback Tour. The suspect in the killing is Tyler Robinson, 22, who turned himself in to authorities the following day.The Utah resident comes from a Republican background, but his family reportedly told investigators that he had become increasingly political and left-leaning in recent years. The context of his purported ideological shift, however, remains unclear.Robinson was charged with aggravated murder, felony firearm discharge, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.What People Are SayingCongressman Jimmy Patronis, in a news release announcing the resolution for a Charlie Kirk day: "Charlie willingly braved the public square of colleges and universities to remind us all what makes free speech so important and how best we can come together as a nation: through the peaceful and respectful sharing of ideas. By honoring [h]is life with a National Day of Remembrance, we ensure that Charlie's legacy lives on, inspiring future generations to stand boldly for freedom and the Constitution."The Rev. Howard-John Wesley, senior pastor of the Alfred Street Baptist Church in Virginia, in a sermon: "How you die does not redeem how you lived. You do not become a hero in your death when you are a weapon of the enemy in your life. I can abhor the violence that took your life, but I don't have to celebrate how you chose to live."Charlie Kirk Funeral: What We KnowA memorial service will be held for Kirk at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The event has been organized by Kirk's Turning Point USA organization.Speakers will include Kirk's widow, Erika, as well as Trump and Vice President JD Vance.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
