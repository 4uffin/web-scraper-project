NewsAfghanistanTalibanDonald TrumpWashingtonKabulAfghanistan WarMoreNews ArticleTaliban Reacts to Trump’s Afghan Base Threat: ‘Not Even One Inch’PublishedSep 22, 2025 at 08:33 AM EDTupdatedSep 22, 2025 at 12:57 PM EDTBy Amir DaftariNews ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Taliban has rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's demand to hand over Bagram air base, emphasizing Afghanistan's sovereignty.Newsweek has reached out the U.S. State Department and Afghanistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment.Why It MattersBagram, located 50 kilometers, around 30 miles, north of Kabul, was the largest U.S. military installation in Afghanistan and served as the main hub for operations against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Control over the base carries both strategic and symbolic significance.Trump's push to regain the site highlights ongoing geopolitical tensions and the continuing influence of U.S. policy decisions on Afghanistan. The base's location in northern Afghanistan gives it strategic significance, particularly in the context of regional security and proximity to China....What to KnowOn Sunday, Fasihuddin Fitrat, chief of staff at the Ministry of Defense told Afghan channel Tolo News, "We assure the people of Afghanistan that no agreement over even an inch of our soil is possible," directly rebuffing Trump's claim. Bagram has been under Taliban control since the U.S. and allied troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021.Fitrat and the Taliban emphasized that Afghanistan's independence and territorial integrity are non-negotiable. Afghanistan issued a statement reaffirming its commitment to a "balanced, economy-oriented foreign policy" grounded in Islamic principles and mutual interests, noting that the Islamic Emirate seeks constructive relations with all states.The statement also cited the 2020 Doha Agreement, under which the U.S. pledged not to use or threaten force against Afghanistan or interfere in its internal affairs, adding that Washington must remain faithful to these commitments.Loading twitter content...Trump's 'Bad Things' WarningLast week, Trump reiterated his desire to regain Bagram. On social media, he warned Afghanistan, "If Afghanistan doesn't give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!"Trump has highlighted Bagram's strategic importance, saying during a U.K. visit, "We were going to leave Afghanistan, but we were going to leave it with strength and dignity, and we were going to keep Bagram, the big air base—one of the biggest air bases in the world."He added, "We want that base back. But one of the reasons we want the base is, as you know, it's an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons," framing the location as crucial for U.S. regional oversight and monitoring security developments near China.Historical Context of BagramDuring America's 20-year war on terror, Bagram served as the main operational hub and detention site. Thousands were imprisoned there without charge, and many suffered abuse or torture. The base symbolized both U.S. military power and the controversial aspects of its presence in Afghanistan. After the 2021 withdrawal, the Taliban quickly regained control of the facility.What People Are SayingAfghanistan Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defense Fasihuddin Fitrat: "Recently, some voices claim that we are in talks with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan to negotiate the return of Bagram Airfield, or that we are seeking a political settlement after failing to take it by force. We assure the people of Afghanistan that no agreement over even an inch of our soil is possible."U.S. President Donald Trump: "If Afghanistan doesn't give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!"China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian: "China respects Afghanistan's territorial integrity and sovereignty. The future of Afghanistan should be in the hands of the Afghanistan people."What Happens NextThe dispute over Bagram is expected to remain unresolved, with the Taliban holding firm and the U.S. weighing its options. The standoff is likely to influence U.S.-Afghan relations and broader regional dynamics, particularly regarding strategic interests in South and Central Asia....Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
