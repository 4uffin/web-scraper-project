NewsJimmy FallonJimmy KimmelABCCharlie kirkJon stewartDonald TrumpNews ArticleLate-Night Hosts React To Jimmy Kimmel SuspensionPublishedSep 19, 2025 at 03:17 AM EDTBy Matthew RobinsonUS News EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA series of late-night hosts have reacted to the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel following backlash over comments he made about the assassination of the conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.Speaking on The Tonight Show on Thursday, Jimmy Fallon said: "The big story is that Jimmy Kimmel was suspended by ABC after pressure from the FCC [Federal Communications Commission], leaving everyone thinking, 'WTF?'"He added: "To be honest with you all, I don't know what's going on, and no one does. But I do know Jimmy Kimmel, and he's a decent, funny and loving guy, and I hope he comes back."Stephen Colbert said on his show on Thursday that "tonight, we are all Jimmy Kimmel.""With an autocrat, you cannot give an inch...if ABC thinks this is going to satisfy the regime, they are woefully naive, and clearly, they've never read the children's book 'If You Give a Mouse a Kimmel.' And to Jimmy, just let me say, I stand with you and your staff 100 percent," he said.Newsweek has contacted the White House via email outside of regular office hours....Why It MattersNational debates surrounding free speech protections and responses to political violence have flared following Kirk's assassination at Utah Valley University on September 10.Related StoriesEverything Charlie Kirk Said About Jimmy Kimmel5 min. readBarack Obama Responds to Jimmy Kimmel Being Taken Off Air6 min. readJimmy Fallon Abruptly Drops Out Of Event Following Kimmel’s Suspension5 min. readWhat To KnowABC announced on September 17 that Kimmel's show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, would be "pre-empted indefinitely."Kimmel had said during the opening monologue of his show on Monday: "We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it."In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving. On Friday, the White House flew the flags at half-staff, which got some criticism, but on a human level you can see how hard the president is taking this."Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, said in a statement: "Mr. Kimmel's comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located."Continuing to give Mr. Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time, and we have made the difficult decision to preempt his show in an effort to let cooler heads prevail as we move toward the resumption of respectful, constructive dialogue."Brendan Carr, the chair of the FCC, also threatened to "take action" over Kimmel's remarks."Local broadcasters have an obligation to serve the public interest," Carr told Fox News. "While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community values."Newsweek has contacted Kimmel's representatives for comment by email.What People Are SayingJimmy Fallon said on Thursday: "A lot of people are worried that we won't keep saying what we want to say or that we'll be censored. But I'm going to cover the president's trip to the U.K. like I normally would."Jon Stewart, the host of The Daily Show, said on Thursday: "You may call it free speech in jolly old England, but in America, we have little something called the First Amendment. And let me tell you how it works. There's something called a talent-o-meter. It's a completely scientific instrument that is kept on the president's desk, and it tells the president when a performer's TQ - talent quotient - measured mostly by niceness to the president, goes below a certain level, at which point the FCC must be notified to threaten the acquisition prospects for billion-dollar mergers of network affiliates. These affiliates are then asked to give ultimatums to the even larger mega-corporations that control the flow of state-approved content, or the FCC can just choose to threaten those licenses directly. It's basic science."Loading twitter content...David Letterman, the former late-night host, said on Thursday at The Atlantic Festival in New York: "I feel bad about this, because we all see where see this is going, correct? It's managed media. It's no good. It's silly. It's ridiculous."Wanda Sykes, the comedian, said in a post on social media: "I was supposed to go over and have a chat with my friend Jimmy Kimmel on his show, but as you have heard by now, the Jimmy Kimmel Show has been pulled indefinitely. Abruptly, because of complaints from the Trump administration. So let's see. He didn't end the Ukraine war or solve Gaza within his first week. But he did end freedom of speech within his first year. Hey, for those of you who pray, now's the time to do it. Love you Jimmy."Megyn Kelly, the conservative podcaster, said: "I'm not sure who needs to hear this but Jimmy Kimmel got on the air and falsely stated as a fact that Charlie Kirk's killer was MAGA, smearing an entire movement and Trump in particular with a vile disgusting lie—and at a time when the threat against those on the right is at an all-time high."President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: "Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy [Fallon] and Seth [Meyers], two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT"Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, told Newsweek: "This has nothing to do with free speech – low-ratings loser Jimmy Kimmel is free to make whatever bad jokes he wants, but a private company is under no obligation to lose money producing an unpopular show. Kimmel's ratings have declined over 63% since his show moved to its current timeslot and he has lost over 43% of his total audience since President Trump returned to office. Jimmy Kimmel's terrible product isn't a free speech problem; it's a talent problem. He is welcome to go start a substack like all the other low-ratings losers!"What Happens NextFallon's show remains on the air. Colbert's show will end in May 2026. ABC said Kimmel's show will be "pre‑empted indefinitely."Update 9/20/25, 4.40 a.m. ET: This article was updated to include comment from the White House.
