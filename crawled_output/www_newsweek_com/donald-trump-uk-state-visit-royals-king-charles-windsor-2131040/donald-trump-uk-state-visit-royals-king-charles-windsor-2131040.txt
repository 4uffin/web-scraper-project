CEO Tom Athron told the Financial Times that changes to country-of-origin rules and the removal of the "de minimis" exemption—previously allowing duty-free entry for goods under $800—have driven up costs for American consumers.A 250g canister of Royal Blend tea now costs at least $25.41 to ship to the U.S., nearly matching the product's retail price. Athron explained that new tariffs apply if any tea blend contains leaves from China or India, regardless of where it's processed. "The American authorities have told us—this is the tea industry in its entirety—that if you've got tea from China or India in your tea, then it is country of origin China or India, and therefore those enormous tariffs apply," he said.Despite blending and packing its teas in Newcastle, England, Fortnum's is subject to the broader tariff regime introduced by Trump in April, which includes a 10% baseline on UK imports.

Wayne Jordash KC, President of Global Rights Compliance, emphasized that any guarantees must include institutional support to prevent future atrocities."Any discussions on security guarantees for Ukraine during President Trump's visit to the UK this week must not be limited to military commitments or 'boots on the ground' pledges," Jordash said in a statement shared with Newsweek. "They must also critically build resilience into Ukraine's institutions and legal system to ensure that Russia is never again able to invade and commit atrocities."Global Rights Compliance's Mobile Justice Teams work alongside Ukraine's Office of the Prosecutor General to document and prosecute war crimes. Jordash added that support must include "unwavering support for the pursuit of accountability for the horrific crimes endured by civilians and prisoners of war," citing sexual violence, starvation tactics, and the forced abduction of children by Russian forces.Sep 17, 2025 at 09:15 AM EDTProtests gathering in LondonDemonstrators are assembling in central London for a major protest against President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom. Marchers are carrying signs with slogans such as "stop Trump," "stop fascism," and "stop the genocide," referencing Israel's military actions in Gaza.The march is expected to proceed through key areas of the city and conclude outside the Houses of Parliament.

Formal talks will follow tomorrow at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence, where both leaders are set to discuss trade, technology, and global security.Starmer has invested heavily in building a working relationship with Trump, stressing their shared appeal to voters seeking change. Trump, reportedly impressed by Labour's sweeping electoral victory, has expressed admiration for Starmer's political success. But the prime minister enters the talks under pressure: new polling from YouGov shows his favorability at just 21%, with a record-high 71% of Britons viewing him unfavorably—a net rating of -50.Despite the optics, British officials are focused on the substance of Thursday's meeting. Matthew Doyle, a former adviser to Starmer, described the visit as a strategic blend of ceremony and diplomacy. "There is always a kind of unofficial quid pro quo on these trips between the ceremonial and the substance," Doyle told CNN, noting that Trump's fondness for royal pageantry is being leveraged to secure meaningful outcomes.Talks at Chequers are expected to include announcements on tech and trade partnerships, with major U.S. CEOs in attendance. British officials also hope Trump will outline a strategy for engaging Russia diplomatically, with Ukraine topping the foreign policy agenda. For Starmer, the challenge is clear: deliver results while navigating a domestic approval crisis.Sep 17, 2025 at 08:51 AM EDTGreen Party leader Zack Polanski to address anti-Trump rally in WestminsterZack Polanski, newly elected leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, is set to speak at an anti-Trump rally in Westminster this afternoon, joining demonstrators opposed to President Donald Trump's state visit. In remarks shared ahead of the event, Polanski accused Trump of seeking legitimacy through royal pageantry while ignoring global humanitarian crises.Polanski specifically condemned Trump's stance on Gaza, describing the visit as an attempt to "whitewash his own complicity" in the ongoing conflict. He also criticized Nigel Farage, calling him a political opportunist aligned with Trump's pursuit of power and wealth.Framing the protest as part of Britain's tradition of defending the vulnerable, Polanski urged solidarity with children in Gaza, migrants in U.S. detention centers, and those facing poverty in the U.K.Sep 17, 2025 at 08:39 AM EDTMixed reactions in Windsor as Trump’s state visit sparks patriotism, protest, and pressFrom Jack Royston, Newsweek reporter on the ground in WindsorJoseph Afrane, 61, from Battersea, London, turned out in Windsor covered in British and American flags from head to toe, including on his sunglasses, and told Newsweek: "The visit is paying off."It is good for the economy in Windsor, the businesses are booming, look how many people are here. The hotels and restaurants, bars, they are going to benefit. All their revenues will go up."Trump loves his country, he loves America, and he's delivering his manifesto with his slogan, America First."Afrane is right that there are small crowds of people outside the Windsor Castle but this is no royal wedding and many of those gathered are journalists.Trump might have got bigger crowds if the carriage procession had been open to the public, but security concerns were no doubt too pronounced for that.It is not just the fans who stayed away, though. There were precious few protesters in Windsor, too.Sheila Dix, 69, went to Windsor from Manchester to protest and has also sent a letter to the king to voice her views."The only person who has any chance of influencing Trump is King Charles," she told Newsweek, "because he so, so wants to be in with the royal family. He's already said on the TV, 'he's my friend.'"Although the king doesn't like to get involved in things politically, how can he have Trump on an unprecedented visit while thousands of people are getting slaughtered in Gaza?"The cost of the visit to us is astronomical. He's criminal, he's a narcissist, he only cares about himself. Even if he says today he's going to do something wonderful for this country he'll change his mind in the morning."Stephen, 42, a Windsor local, wore a "Make America Great Again" hat and waved a U.S. flag: "I just came down to see if I could see the President, the leader of the free world. It's a state visit, everybody's out. It's time to celebrate, our closest allies are here."I would consider myself a Trump supporter. I think people buy into the media lies too much. I mean, he is so divisive but I think people feed into the media lies a lot."Sep 17, 2025 at 08:27 AM EDTTrump ally dismisses criticism of UK visit, shrugs off Sadiq Khan’s remarksBryan Lanza, a former senior adviser to President Donald Trump's campaign, pushed back against claims that Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom lacks public support. Speaking on BBC Radio's "Today" program, Lanza said, "There's obviously opposition, but at the end of the day, those who are opposed, they don't matter. The American people are the ones who voted this president in."Lanza also dismissed criticism from London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has repeatedly condemned Trump's political rhetoric and presence in the UK. "Who cares?" Lanza said. "He's just a local mayor. I think he should focus more on traffic and on the trash than trying to elevate himself to the diplomatic stage."Sep 17, 2025 at 08:13 AM EDTTrump welcomed with largest military ceremony ever staged for a visiting leader in the U.K.President Donald Trump's arrival at Windsor Castle was marked by the most expansive military pageantry ever assembled for a foreign leader in Britain.

The carriage procession through the estate was flanked by 80 soldiers from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, forming the Sovereign's escort. The Life Guards wore red tunics with white-plumed helmets, while the Blues and Royals donned blue uniforms with red feathered headgear.The route, closed to the public for security reasons, was lined by 22 half-companies representing all branches of the armed forces.

The inspection is proceeding smoothly, in contrast to his 2019 visit when Trump briefly walked ahead of Queen Elizabeth II—an action widely reported as a breach of royal protocol.At the time, palace officials clarified that no rules had been broken, noting that guests are often encouraged to lead during troop reviews. Today's inspection alongside King Charles III appears more coordinated, with both leaders moving in step as they review the assembled regiments.Sep 17, 2025 at 07:44 AM EDTGuard of honor greets Trump at Windsor Castle...President Donald Trump received a formal welcome at Windsor Castle today with a Guard of Honor representing the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards, and Scots Guards—marking the first time all three state colors have been assembled for a visiting head of state.The three regiments, each part of the Household Division, are known for their historic roles in royal and national defense.Sep 17, 2025 at 07:41 AM EDTTrump saluting during US national anthem...Sep 17, 2025 at 07:38 AM EDTTrump arrives at Windsor Castle for formal welcome ceremonyPresident Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have arrived at Windsor Castle by carriage, joining King Charles III and Queen Camilla on a ceremonial dais alongside the Prince and Princess of Wales.

The visit is centered at Windsor Castle.The invitation carries personal and political weight. In 1988, Trump hosted then-Prince Charles at Mar-a-Lago, and this week's events—including a carriage procession, wreath-laying at Queen Elizabeth II's tomb, and a state banquet—echo that early connection. British officials see the visit as a way to engage a president whose foreign policy has challenged postwar norms.Prime Minister Starmer, seeking to build rapport with Trump early in his second term, hopes the royal backdrop will ease negotiations on trade, tech investment, and nuclear energy. Thursday's agenda includes meetings at Chequers with business leaders and a joint press conference. While the royals avoid politics, the diplomatic stakes remain high, with unresolved tensions over Ukraine and lingering controversy surrounding former U.K. ambassador Peter Mandelson's ties to Jeffrey Epstein.Sep 17, 2025 at 07:24 AM EDTTrump welcomed by King Charles and Queen Camilla at WindsorPresident Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were formally received by King Charles III and Queen Camilla outside Victoria House on Wednesday morning, marking the ceremonial start of the president's second state visit to the United Kingdom.The arrival was accompanied by a performance from the Household Cavalry band, whose musicians wore ornate state dress uniforms originally designed in the 1600s and woven with pure gold thread.Following the greeting, the royal and presidential parties are expected to board horse-drawn carriages for a procession through the Windsor estate, continuing a day of pageantry ahead of diplomatic meetings scheduled for Thursday.Sep 17, 2025 at 07:22 AM EDTTrump arrives at Windsor, meets with the royalsSep 17, 2025 at 07:21 AM EDTRoyal optics and public dissent shape Trump’s state visitIngrid Seward, royal biographer and author of My Mother and I, described Trump's visit as "high stakes," noting that "the frill on the frock is the royalty" when speaking to Newsweek. She expects Queen Camilla to attend all scheduled events despite recent illness, adding, "Sinusitis is very painful but I think she'll just drug herself up and get through the day."Public sentiment in Windsor remains divided. Tim Miles, 62, stood near the castle gates wearing a red "Make America Go Away" hat, voicing strong opposition to the visit. "He's making enough of a mess of his own country," Miles told Newsweek. "I don't see why anyone should invite him anywhere else." His remarks reflect broader unease surrounding the optics of hosting Trump, even as the royal family maintains its traditional role in state diplomacy.Sep 17, 2025 at 07:20 AM EDTTrump arrives at Windsor Castle amid uncertain weather for planned flypastPresident Donald Trump has landed at Windsor Castle by helicopter after departing from Winfield House, the official residence of the U.S. ambassador in London.

Officials say these events have intensified threat assessments and prompted tighter control over all physical and aerial access points.Trump arrived in London on Tuesday evening and will be hosted by King Charles and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle on Wednesday. Thursday's agenda includes closed-door talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers, the prime minister's country estate.Thames Valley Police confirmed that all events will be held within secured private grounds, with no public-facing appearances, per The New York Times. Assistant Chief Constable Christian Bunt stressed the absence of public access.
