SportsBoxingFightingNews ArticleTop Boxing Promoter Teases Canelo Alvarez U.K. Mega Fight in 2026PublishedSep 22, 2025 at 08:23 PM EDTBy Antonio LosadaContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberChris Eubank Jr.'s promoter has pretty much confirmed plans to bring Canelo Alvarez to the United Kingdom, provided Eubank comes through his next test in November.Eubank is set for a contracted rematch with Conor Benn on Nov. 15 at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. He won their first bout by unanimous decision in April, and Eubank will once again fight at middleweight with a controversial 10-pound rehydration clause.Promoter Ben Shalom told ESPN on Saturday that an Eubank victory would set the stage for one of boxing's biggest events in early 2026."[2026 is] going to be a big year [for Eubank]," Shalom said. "I think he's going to come through this emphatically [against Benn] and then he wants the very best. Canelo, Crawford, those are the two names he'd like to fight, and hopefully we can make that happen early next year."Loading twitter content...Shalom was clear about which direction he sees things heading next year."I think [Canelo is] the fight," Shalom said. "Canelo has never fought in the UK, the biggest star in boxing, and you've got the biggest star in UK boxing [Eubank], the only one that could make sense for Canelo really."I think it sells out Wembley. I think it's one of the biggest fights that you could possibly make in world boxing."Alvarez is coming off just his third career loss, a unanimous decision defeat to Terence Crawford that drew more than 70,000 fans to Las Vegas."I feel very proud of everything I've achieved so far; we always want to win, but I accept this defeat with humility and learning," Canelo wrote on X (originally in Spanish)....Eubank, for his part, said he would gladly fight either man, but he prefers Alvarez."(Canelo) is still a superstar. He's still probably the biggest name in the sport even though he lost," Eubank said. "So for sure I'd love to fight him."Whether it's Alvarez at Wembley or Crawford at super middleweight, in the UK or elsewhere, Shalom stressed that Eubank will be facing a global superstar in 2026—as long as he takes care of business in November during his rematch with Benn.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
