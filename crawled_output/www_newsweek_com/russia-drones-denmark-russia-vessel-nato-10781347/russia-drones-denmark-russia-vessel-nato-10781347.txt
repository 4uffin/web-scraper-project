NewsEuropeNATORussiaDenmarkRussia-Ukraine WarRussian militaryNews ArticleRussian Navy Ship Caught Lurking Off Denmark’s Coast as Drones AttackPublishedSep 25, 2025 at 03:01 PM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 04:42 PM EDTBy Peter AitkenPolitics Weekend EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberDanish authorities have reported the sighting of a Russian warship on the edge of Danish waters with its tracking system turned off, indicating it is likely trying to avoid detection, according to Danish outlet Ekstra Bladet.Why It MattersRussian fighter planes last week violated Romanian and Estonian airspace, raising tensions between members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Russian military as pressure ramps up for Russia to end its invasion of Ukraine. Denmark this week also has suffered what officials have labeled a "hybrid attack" of drones flying through the country's airspace and disrupting the operations of critical infrastructure, prompting Denmark to invoke NATO Article 4.What To KnowA helicopter spotted the Russian vessel, identified as the landing vessel Aleksandr Shabalin, off the coast of Langeland, Denmark.The drone incursions over two different days forced the closure of major airports, including Aalborg airport, which is used for military and commercial flights, according to Reuters. All airports had resumed normal operations by Thursday morning.The drones also appeared near Skrydstrup air base, which is home to Denmark's F-16 and F-35 fighter jets.Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze told Reuters that the Danish government linked the drones to "state activity" but that European governments would await "further assessment" on potential responsible parties while stressing the need to "to invest in counter-drone capability." Russia has denied any involvement in the drone operations, but experts have suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be ordering the attacks from his "shadow fleet," a group of unlisted tankers that have been transporting oil for Russia in an effort to avoid the heavy sanctions imposed by Western nations in response to the invasion of Ukraine....What Is NATO's Article 4?NATO's Article 4 states: "The parties will consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened."The more well-known Article 5 invokes the collective defense of all NATO allies against another state or entity that has attacked a member, while Article 4 initiates formal discussions among members following a breach of territorial integrity or security.Is Denmark in NATO?Denmark is one of NATO's founding members, having signed the treaty in April 1949. Membership in the alliance has remained a cornerstone of Danish national security for decades after maintaining a long-time stance of neutrality. The policy is similar to what Sweden and Finland continued to observe until the last few years, at which point the invasion of Ukraine forced them to follow Denmark's example and abandon neutrality for NATO membership and greater security in the face of Russian aggression.Denmark was one of three Nordic countries to sign the initial treaty, along with Iceland and Norway. How Many Countries Are in NATO?NATO currently boasts a membership of 32 countries, having recently added Sweden and Finland. Membership provides critical cover and international security through the alliance's Article 5 clause, although the recent probing of NATO member airspace without clear military contact or attack has tested the limits of the alliance's ability to respond to external pressures.What People Are SayingDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters last week: "There is no doubt that Russia will be a threat to Europe and Denmark for years to come."NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte wrote on X: "Just spoke with Denmark’s PM Mette Frederiksen about the drone situation, which we take very seriously. NATO Allies and Denmark are working together on how we can ensure the safety and security of our critical infrastructure."Former Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis wrote on X: "If a Russian jet is shot down in NATO airspace today – historians will say that Russia started the war, in 2022. There is no need to let Putin gaslight us into allowing him into our airspace "to prevent war." But if we fear our own strength, we will become victims of Russia's."Update 9/25/25, 4:42 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.
