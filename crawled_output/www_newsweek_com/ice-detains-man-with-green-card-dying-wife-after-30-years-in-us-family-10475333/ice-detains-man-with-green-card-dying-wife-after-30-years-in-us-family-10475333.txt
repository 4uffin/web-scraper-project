A routine check-in should not lead to this kind of torture and separation. It’s becoming unbearable and I just hope the Judge sees the cruelty and unfairness here and allows him to come home."His attorney confirmed to Newsweek that he has lawful permanent residence status.A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson told Newsweek he "is an illegal alien from Jamaica with an extensive criminal history including an arrest for criminal possession of a firearm and drug possession in 1997."Why It MattersPresident Donald Trump campaigned heavily on immigration policy, calling for mass deportations of immigrants who entered the country illegally—particularly those with criminal records. His administration ramped up immigration enforcement upon his return to office in January, but polls suggest that some Americans have soured on his immigration policies.What to KnowICE detained 49-year-old Duwayne Baugh, of New York, who has lived in the U.S. since he immigrated from Jamaica when he was 14 years old, The City reported, adding that he holds lawful permanent residence status. He was arrested during a check-in with ICE at an office in the Bronx on August 13.ICE's database shows that Baugh is being held at the Orange County Correctional Center in Goshen, New York.His wife, Kaiisha, a U.S. citizen, was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2021. Doctors said last year she had less than a year to live, while her husband was in ICE custody on a previous occasion. Following that diagnosis, the Biden administration decided to free him to allow him to take care of his wife.He wrote in an August 27 affidavit, "Kaiisha is dying, and I cannot be there for her."The detainment stems from two gun charges that resulted in him spending more than two years in prison, The City reported.The first was in 2007, which he said occurred while he was bringing a friend’s gun to a buyback event in Staten Island, according to The City. While he was carrying the firearm, it reportedly malfunctioned, resulting in him being shot in the groin inside the Staten Island Ferry Terminal in Manhattan. He pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree and served his prison sentence.The second was in 2020, after his son was fatally stabbed. He told the publication he purchased a firearm because his family was facing threats from the individual believed to have stabbed his son. He was in possession of the firearm on December 1, 2020, when police officers approached him outside of a pizzeria. He tried to hide the firearm inside the pizzeria, but officers found it and arrested him, the publication reported.He was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm and served an eight-month sentence. He was set to be deported, but ICE released him to care for his wife.What People Are SayingA DHS spokesperson told Newsweek: "Duwayne Hylton Baugh is an illegal alien from Jamaica with an extensive criminal history including an arrest for criminal possession of a firearm and drug possession in 1997. In 1998, he was charged with trespassing. In 2007, he was charged AGAIN with illegal possession of a firearm and an ammunition feeding device. In 2020, he was charged with criminal possession of a firearm, criminal possession of a weapon on school grounds, and unlawful possession of a large capacity ammunition feeding device. In 2022, he was convicted of weapons trafficking. ICE arrested this serial career criminal on August 13, 2025. He will remain in custody pending removal proceedings."Kaiisha Baugh told The City: "He does have these charges, but he’s not an aggressive person. I try not to think that he’s going to get deported even though I know that is possible."A Customs and Border Patrol spokesperson previously told Newsweek: "A green card is a privilege, not a right, and under our nation's laws, our government has the authority to revoke a green card if our laws are broken and abused. Lawful Permanent Residents presenting at a U.S. port of entry with previous criminal convictions may be subject to mandatory detention and/or may be asked to provide additional documentation to be set up for an immigration hearing."What Happens NextBaugh's case continues to move through the courts. Meanwhile, immigration enforcement is likely to remain a major political issue in the coming years.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
