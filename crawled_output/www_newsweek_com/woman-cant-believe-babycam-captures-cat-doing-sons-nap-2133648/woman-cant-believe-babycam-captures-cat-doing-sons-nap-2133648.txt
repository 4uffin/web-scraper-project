"I saw Bobo walking in his cot and immediately thought, she's up to something."Cats may have a reputation for being aloof around human companions, but research suggests the majority are very attached....In 2019, a study published in the journal Current Biology found cats display a level of attachment to caregivers that's similar to the one dogs and babies demonstrate.Researchers reached that conclusion following a series of attachment tests involving 70 kittens. The kittens were put into a room with a caregiver for 2 minutes, then left alone for 2 minutes before being reunited.Researchers found that more than 60 percent of the kittens displayed "secure attachment" meaning they were distressed when their caregiver left but then showed a mix of attachment and exploration when they came back.This proportion is similar to the numbers produced in similar experiments involving infants and canines and indicates most cats think of their humans as something akin to parents.Bobo's relationship with Esmée is a little more complex though. They started out more like siblings than anything else, but then things changed."Bobo is almost 13 years old, and honestly, the older she gets, the crazier she becomes. When she was almost 1, my mom picked her up for us," Esmée said. "After my mom passed away 5.5 years ago, Bobo came to live with me and my partner. She's been my little shadow ever since."It would have been difficult to know how Bobo would react to the arrival of a baby. Would she see the infant as competition for Esmée's affections or, like she was all those years ago, a de facto sibling? Thankfully, it proved to be the latter."Since the baby was born, Bobo has been absolutely obsessed with him," Esmée said. "She's always looking for him, wanting to be close, and she loves to lie anywhere he has been."That desire to be close appears to be what led to Bobo being in the cot that particular day. However, as Esmée watched, it became apparent that Bobo was planning a dramatic escape.So, sensing something special was about to unfold, Esmée picked up her phone. "I quickly hit record," she said. "Sure enough, seconds later she made that dramatic jump!"In the resulting video, which Esmée later posted to her TikTok, Esmee_1145, Bobo can be seen preparing to leap from the cot over to a nearby dresser where a changing mat appears to be offering the opportunity for the softest of landings.That doesn't prove to be the case though. As Bobo lands on the mat, it quickly becomes apparent that the ground beneath her is unsteady as the mat is not entirely on the dresser.Rather than enjoying a smooth landing, Bobo ends up falling to the floor, with the changing mat following quickly behind. It's an embarrassing situation made all the more painful by the fact Esmée's son is wide awake throughout and witnesses the whole thing.Esmée's onscreen caption sums it up perfectly: "Your cat just embarrassed herself in front of the baby." At the time of writing, Esmée's TikTok video has been watched over 120,000 times. "I couldn't stop laughing when I first saw it," Esmée said.Though Bobo may be bruised by the encounter, it's her ego that has probably incurred the worst. "She was totally fine, just her usual silly self," Esmée said.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesPoliticsDemocrats React to Jimmy Kimmel’s Return from Suspension3 min. readPoliticsDonald Trump Tells Pregnant Women to ‘Tough it Out,’ Avoid Tylenol4 min. readPoliticsWhat We Know and Don’t Know About Trump’s H-1B Crackdown7 min. readPoliticsMap Shows Health Care H-1B Visas by State as Trump Floats Fee Exemption6 min. readPoliticsWhite House Shares Update on Antifa Crackdown as Trump Order Nears4 min. readPoliticsTrump Admin Vows to ‘Defend Every Inch of NATO’ After Russian Violations3 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
