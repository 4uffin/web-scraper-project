Personal FinanceHousingNew York CityRedditNews ArticleRent Split for NYC Apartment With Tiny Room Sparks DebatePublishedSep 17, 2025 at 03:22 AM EDTBy Soo KimLife and Trends ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA post about how two roommates should split the rent on a $6,340 New York City apartment where one bedroom is substantially smaller than the other has sparked debate on Reddit.The post, shared on September 11 by u/ActualDetective6249 on the r/ApartmentLiving subreddit, was titled: "how should I ask to split rent." It included a floor plan showing one bedroom significantly larger than the other and has since received 8,600 upvotes and thousands of comments."I don't want to be greedy, but my room is tiny in comparison to my roommate's and NYC is pricy," the poster wrote in the caption. "The apartment's 6,340 so I don't think it's fair I pay half of that for this small room."Reddit PostThe situation struck a chord with many readers as housing affordability remains a nationwide challenge.According to a 2024 report from Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies, nearly half of U.S. renter households are cost-burdened, meaning they spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent. The report also found that 12.1 million renters are "severely cost-burdened," devoting over half their income to housing.The post's popularity reflects ongoing tensions over rent distribution in expensive markets like New York, where housing costs remain among the nation's highest. The Harvard housing report found that home prices have surged in 97 of the top 100 U.S. markets, with the steepest increases seen in the northeast and Midwest, leaving many renters with few affordable options.In follow-up comments, the original poster noted that their roommate had already claimed the larger room. "She is very sure she wants the bigger room and has asked me how I want to split the price," they wrote.While the larger room comes with balcony access and a bigger closet, the poster pointed out they have a private ensuite bathroom. "We agreed the bathroom in the hall would be hers!! Also, I'm not super social, so wouldn't have many guests. But if I did, they would just use my bathroom," the poster added.'Cringing'The debate drew a flood of advice from fellow Redditors. Some suggested a pragmatic approach. "If one of them found it and is the only person on the lease, they can simply state that the other room rents for $X,XXX. The potential roommate can take it or leave it," wrote u/Funny247365.Others argued for a proportional division of costs. "60/40 by sq footage. You and your guests both use only your own bathrooms," said u/ParahoyRoit.SharpRoll5848 simply said: "My Midwestern brain is cringing seeing several thousand be thrown around as SPLITTING rent numbers..."Another commenter, u/Equal_Argument6418, echoed that approach, writing: "I think based on what OP [original poster] said 60 percent roommate 40 percent OP. Roommate does have balcony and bigger closet and arguably a private bathroom as well. OP has small room, smaller closet, smaller bathroom no balcony. I'd definitely say it's not 50/50."Some users offered more creative solutions. "You shouldn't be assigned rooms. You both bid percentage of how much you're willing to pay for the bigger room. Not happy paying 40 percent for smallest, how about paying 62 percent for biggest and they pay 38 percent for the smallest?" suggested u/Unresolved-Variable.Others recommended calculating an exact percentage based on apartment size. "Take the square footage of your room plus half of the living areas and divide that by the total area of the apartment," wrote u/Ptammitos. "That'll give you your percentage of the space you're actually using and allow you to calculate the exact percentage of rent. If they're upset about it you can suggest switching rooms?"Newsweek has contacted the original poster for comment via the Reddit messaging system....Do you have a housing-related video or story to share?
