General Secretary Antonio Guterres, and that the Secret Service were involved. Newsweek contacted the U.N. for comment via its online inquiry form on Thursday outside of regular office hours....Why It MattersTrump has clashed repeatedly with international institutions while pursuing his “America First” agenda. He previously withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization and the U.N. Human Rights Council after his inauguration in January.What To KnowOn Wednesday, Trump posted on Truth Social that "A REAL DISGRACE" had occurred at the U.N., with "not one, not two, but three very sinister events!"Firstly, an escalator came to an abrupt stop shortly after he and the first lady stepped onto it. Trump said it was an "absolute sabotage," citing a report suggesting that U.N. staff had been heard joking about what stunts they could pull on the president.Trump said the incident "would have been a disaster" if he and the first lady had not been "holding the handrail tightly," adding: "The people that did it should be arrested!"On Wednesday, U.N. spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said the incident was not deliberate, commenting: "The escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator."White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News there should be an investigation into the incident, adding: "If someone at the U.N. intentionally stopped the escalator…they need to be fired."Trump added that when he came to give his speech at the U.N. his "teleprompter didn’t work” for around 15 minutes, but said that he had "gotten fantastic reviews."Finally, Trump said the "sound was completely off in the Auditorium" during his speech, meaning he could only be heard through interpreters’ earpieces. Trump said he only discovered the issue after Melania said she "couldn’t hear a word" he said.Trump demanded an "immediate investigation" into what he called a "triple sabotage," and said the Secret Service was involved.What People Are SayingTrump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday: "A REAL DISGRACE took place at the United Nations yesterday — not one, not two, but three very sinister events! First, the escalator going up to the main speaking floor came to a screeching halt. It stopped on a dime. It’s amazing that Melania and I didn’t fall forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first. It was only that we were each holding the handrail tightly or, it would have been a disaster. This was absolutely sabotage, as noted by a day’s earlier 'post' in The London Times that said UN workers 'joked about turning off an escalator.' The people that did it should be arrested!"Then, as I stood before a television crowd of millions of people all over the world, and important leaders in the hall, my teleprompter didn’t work. It was stone cold dark. I immediately thought to myself, 'wow, first the escalator event, and now a bad teleprompter. What kind of a place is this?' I then proceeded to make a speech without a teleprompter, which kicked in about 15 minutes later. The good news is the speech has gotten fantastic reviews. Maybe they appreciated the fact that very few people could have done what I did." He added: "And third, after making the speech, I was told that the sound was completely off in the auditorium where the speech was made, that world leaders, unless they used the interpreters’ earpieces, couldn’t hear a thing. The first person I saw at the conclusion of the speech was Melania, who was sitting right up front. I said, 'how did I do?' And she said, 'I couldn’t hear a word you said.' This wasn’t a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN. They ought to be ashamed of themselves." White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday: “If someone at the U.N. intentionally stopped the escalator … they need to be fired and investigated immediately.” Stéphane Dujarric, a spokesperson for UN, said in a statement: “The escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator.”What Happens NextThe U.N. has yet to comment on whether it will launch an investigation into Tuesday’s incidents following Trump's request.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
