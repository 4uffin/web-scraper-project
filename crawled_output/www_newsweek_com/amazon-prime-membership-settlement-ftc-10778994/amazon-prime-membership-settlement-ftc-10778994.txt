NewsAmazonAmazon PrimeSettlementsBreaking NewsNews ArticleAmazon to Pay Historic $2.5B FTC Settlement Over Tricking Prime MembersPublishedSep 25, 2025 at 11:52 AM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 02:40 PM EDTBy Jenna Sundel and Amanda CastroShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberAmazon will pay a record $2.5 billion to settle a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit alleging it misled customers into enrolling in Prime and made it difficult to cancel, the agency announced Thursday. The Seattle-based company will pay $1 billion in civil penalties, the largest payment ever in a case involving an FTC rule violation, and $1.5 billion in refunds to affected users, the second-highest restitution award obtained by FTC action. Amazon admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement....Why It MattersAmazon Prime, a subscription service offering perks such as faster shipping and discounts at Whole Foods, has more than 200 million members.The FTC said the refunds will provide relief for an estimated 35 million consumers impacted by unwanted Prime enrollment or deferred cancellation.Eligible Prime customers include those who may have signed up for a membership through the Amazon's “Single Page Checkout” between June 23, 2019, to June 23, 2025.What To KnowThe FTC sued Amazon in federal court two years ago. The agency alleged that Amazon violated the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act, a 2010 law created to protect online customers from deceptive sales practices on the internet.The FTC alleged that Amazon deliberately made it difficult to purchase items without a Prime subscription.The agency said in a complaint that cancelling a Prime subscription was often complicated, and Amazon leadership slowed or rejected changes to make the process easier.“Today, the Trump-Vance FTC made history and secured a record-breaking, monumental win for the millions of Americans who are tired of deceptive subscriptions that feel impossible to cancel,” FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said in a statement. “The evidence showed that Amazon used sophisticated subscription traps designed to manipulate consumers into enrolling in Prime, and then made it exceedingly hard for consumers to end their subscription."An Amazon spokesperson told Newsweek that, while the company remains confident in its legal position, resolving the matter avoids a prolonged trial and potential appeals. The company emphasized its commitment to compliance and its dedication to serving customers and supporting its team.What People Are SayingAmazon in a statement to Newsweek: "Amazon and our executives have always followed the law and this settlement allows us to move forward and focus on innovating for customers. We work incredibly hard to make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up or cancel their Prime membership, and to offer substantial value for our many millions of loyal Prime members around the world. We will continue to do so, and look forward to what we’ll deliver for Prime members in the coming years."FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson, in a statement: "Today, we are putting billions of dollars back into Americans’ pockets, and making sure Amazon never does this again. The Trump-Vance FTC is committed to fighting back when companies try to cheat ordinary Americans out of their hard-earned pay.”Amazon, in a trial brief filed last month: "Occasional customer frustrations and mistakes are inevitable — especially for a program as popular as Amazon Prime."What Happens NextThe FTC said the settlement requires Amazon to make changes to Prime enrollment and cancellation, such as developing a "clear and conspicuous button" to deny Prime, providing an easy way to cancel Prime using the same method customers used to enroll and disclosing all terms during the Prime enrollment process.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.Do you have a story that Newsweek should be covering?
