At a time when sky-high home prices and stubbornly elevated borrowing costs have made homebuying unaffordable for millions of people in the U.S., Hispanic Americans are becoming homeowners at a faster rate than any other group, according to a new study.Data from the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals (NAHREP) shared with Newsweek found that 238,000 new Hispanic households were formed in 2024, representing over a third (35 percent) of the national net increase in homeownership last year. White Americans accounted for 22.2 percent, while Black Americans represented 20.3 percent of this overall growth.This trend is likely to continue in the coming years, experts say. By 2040, Hispanic Americans will account for 70 percent of all new homeowners, according to NAHREP projections.
"We're young, we're growing, and we're determined," Edwin Acevedo of CENTURY 21 LOTUS, NAHREP's 2025 president-elect, told Newsweek. "With a median age of 31 and rising economic mobility, Hispanic Americans are just getting started."Why Is Homeownership Growing Among Hispanic Americans More Than Any Other Group?Hispanic Americans have also been affected by the housing affordability crisis. In 2024, the rate of Hispanic homeownership fell year-over-year for the first time in a decade, dropping by half a percentage point to 49.0 percent. Despite this decline, more Hispanic Americans own their home now than ever before‚Äîabout 9.8 million households. The Hispanic population in the U.S. is estimated at 65.1 million.
"What we're seeing now is a powerful combination of demographic momentum and cultural strength," Acevedo said, explaining the growth in Hispanic American homeowners. "With a median age of just 31, Hispanic Americans are entering their prime homebuying years in huge numbers. In fact, between 2022 and 2023, Hispanics accounted for nearly all of the U.S. population growth."By comparison, the median age of the U.S. general population is 39.2. Latinos, according to the NAHREP report, tend to buy homes at younger ages than their non-Hispanic counterparts. In 2023, 42.8 percent of homes bought by Hispanic Americans were purchased by borrowers 45, compared to 37.6 percent of non-Hispanic borrowers.

But according to Acevedo, what sets Hispanic American homebuyers apart in the U.S. housing market is their adaptability, which is helping them become homeowners when many cannot afford it."Affordability is a challenge for everyone right now, but Hispanic buyers are meeting it head-on with creativity and flexibility. I've seen families relocate from high-cost cities like Los Angeles or New York to places like St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and Wichita‚Äîmarkets where home prices are still within reach and opportunities are growing," Acevedo said.For the third consecutive year, Texas was the state where most Hispanic Americans relocate to buy homes‚Äîa trend that has been going on for the past 15 years. Other affordable markets were identified in the Midwest and Northeast, as mentioned by Acevedo.Hispanic Americans, he said, are not only willing to relocate to new markets, but they are also open to leaning on family support or exploring alternative financing options."Families co-borrowing, tapping into alternative credit models, and stretching their purchasing power through multigenerational living," Acevedo said, describing some of the options Hispanic Americans homebuyers rely on to purchase property."It's not uncommon for three generations to live under one roof, sharing expenses and combining incomes to make homeownership possible. That kind of adaptability isn't just practical‚Äîit's a reflection of our values. We find a way, together," he said.Embracing and Reshaping the American DreamHomeownership has always been at the heart of the traditional idea of the American dream, a fantasy of financial stability embodied in the classic white picket fence home in the suburbs. But the past few decades and especially the past five years have challenged this dream, as home prices have shot through the roof amid high demand and a chronic lack of supply, far outpacing wage growth.As of August, the median sale price of a typical home in the U.S. was $439,894, according to Redfin data. Five years earlier, it was $327,649.The unaffordability of housing has pushed many Americans to rent instead. As of the last quarter of 2024, according to Redfin, the U.S. renter population was roughly 45.4 million, the largest figure in the country's history.But for Hispanic Americans, "homeownership is deeply rooted in the values of Hispanic families‚Äîit's not just about buying property, it's about building a legacy," Acevedo said. That is why so many homebuyers receive the support of family members to achieve their dream of homeownership."Multigenerational households often pool resources, family members cosign loans to help each other qualify, and many buyers take advantage of FHA loans that require lower down payments," Acevedo said. "These strategies reflect a community that's determined, resourceful, and deeply committed to owning a piece of the American dream."According to Acevedo, Hispanic Americans "won't just be a major force in the housing market," by 2040‚Äî"we'll be leading it," he said.
