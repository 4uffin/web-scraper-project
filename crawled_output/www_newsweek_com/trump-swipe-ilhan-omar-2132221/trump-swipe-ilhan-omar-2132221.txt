U.S.DemocratsDemocratic PartyIlhan OmarDonald TrumpRepublicansCharlie kirkNews ArticleTrump Takes a Swipe at Ilhan Omar in New Attack: ‘What Scum’PublishedSep 18, 2025 at 08:05 PM EDTBy Anna CommanderDeputy News EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberPresident Donald Trump blasted Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota on Thursday, ripping her birth country and questioning her citizenship.Newsweek reached out to the congresswoman's D.C. office Thursday evening and left a voicemail.Why It MattersThe post by the president arrives as Representative Omar faced a censure push initiated by Republican Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina over disputes tied to alleged comments about the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk.The dispute has escalated on social media and in the House, underscoring tensions on Capitol Hill and the broader politicized debate about political rhetoric and violence.What To KnowIn a post on Truth Social Thursday night, Trump said, "Ilhan Omar's Country of Somalia is plagued by a lack of central Government control, persistent Poverty, Hunger, Resurgent Terrorism, Piracy, decades of Civil War, Corruption, and pervasive Violence. 70% of the population lives in extreme Poverty, and widespread Food Insecurity."Somalia is consistently ranked among the World's Most Corrupt Countries, including Bribery, Embezzlement, and a Dysfunctional Government. All of this, and Ilhan Omar tells us how to run America! P.S. Wasn't she the one that married her brother in order to gain Citizenship??? What SCUM we have in our Country, telling us what to do, and how to do it. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"Omar reacted on X to Mace's censure move on Tuesday, saying, "Fun fact: Nancy Mace is trying to censure me over comments I never said. Her res does not contain a single quote from me because she couldn't find any. Unlike her, I have routinely condemned political violence, no matter the political ideology."Omar continued, "This is all an attempt to push a false story so she can fundraise and boost her run for Governor."Mace's attempt to censure Omar ultimately failed in the House this week.Trump's message singled out Omar's country of origin and repeatedly questioned her immigration status and past rumors surrounding her marriage history, framing those claims as relevant to her role in U.S. politics. This is not the first time the president has repeated these claims....What People Are SayingCongressman Brandon Gill, a Texas Republican, on X Thursday: "Ilhan Omar didn't just make reprehensible comments about Charlie Kirk's assassination. She shared a disgusting video claiming Charlie had it coming to him. People are losing their jobs for far less."Democratic Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota, on X Wednesday: "Just took a dip into the cesspool that is Nancy Mace's social media. It's shameful the way she is vilifying my friend Ilhan Omar to raise money for herself. Honestly, what Representative Mace has been doing illustrates all that is wrong with our politics right now."What Happens NextIt is unclear if more censure or possible impeachment efforts against Omar will continue.Update 9/18/25, 9:58 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
