NewsVenezuelaNicolas MaduroDonald TrumpWashingtonWarshipU.S. NavyMoreNews ArticleUS Sends New Missile Destroyer to Caribbean: Map, Photos and What We KnowPublishedSep 22, 2025 at 11:56 AM EDTupdatedSep 22, 2025 at 01:59 PM EDTBy Amir DaftariNews ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe USS Stockdale, a U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, has entered the Caribbean Sea after a high-profile transit of the Panama Canal, reinforcing U.S. naval presence in the region.The deployment is part of the Trump administration's efforts to disrupt narcotics trafficking networks linked to Venezuela. In Caracas, the Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello warned of a "devastating counterattack," in a sign of growing alarm there.Newsweek has reached out to the U.S. State Department and the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry for comment.Why It MattersThe Stockdale's deployment is part of a sizable U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean region that now includes no less than four guided-missile destroyers. The assets are positioned to disrupt narcotics networks, but also put increasing pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.The buildup has already included targeted strikes on vessels allegedly connected to Venezuelan drug cartels, signaling that Washington is willing to use lethal force to enforce its counter-narcotics strategy.For Venezuela, this concentration of hardware and the ongoing strikes represent a growing threat to Maduro's government and a visible demonstration of U.S. reach near its borders, heightening the stakes in regional tensions....What To KnowWebcam imagery released by the Panama Canal Authority showed the Stockdale passing through the Miraflores Locks late on Sunday, after which the ship reported its position in Panama's Limon Bay on the Atlantic side, according to publicly available ship-tracking data reviewed by Newsweek.The high-profile transit underscored once more the strategic importance of the canal to U.S. President Donald Trump for regional operations, with the Navy able to quickly move assets between the Pacific and Atlantic theaters.Third U.S. Warship in Panama in a MonthThe Stockdale is the third U.S. vessel to enter Panamanian waters in under a month, following the destroyer USS Sampson earlier this month and the cruiser USS Lake Erie in August. Each deployment was framed as part of joint cooperation with Panama to enhance security, combat organized crime, and counter foreign influence.The U.S. buildup in the Caribbean now includes multiple warships, an amphibious ready group—led by the USS Iwo Jima and carrying with thousands of Marines—F-35 stealth fighters, and surveillance drones in or around Puerto Rico.The platforms support the Trump administration's counter-narcotics operations but also publicly project hard power across the region, signaling U.S. strength to Maduro and other adversaries.
Trump's ThreatOn Saturday, Trump escalated rhetoric against Venezuela, demanding that it immediately repatriate individuals he described as "prisoners" and "people from mental institutions." On social media, he warned that failure to act would bring "incalculable" consequences, alleging—without evidence—that these individuals had caused harm in the U.S.Trump's latest threat came a day after he announced a U.S. strike on an alleged Venezuelan-linked drug vessel in the Caribbean that killed three men he labeled as "male narcoterrorists." Similar strikes have targeted other vessels tied to Venezuelan drug cartels in recent weeks.Loading twitter content...Venezuela's ResponseCabello, the Venezuelan official, who faces U.S. narcotrafficking accusations and a $25 million bounty, warned over the weekend that Venezuela would defend itself if necessary. "We do not seek war with anyone. We have never declared war on anyone," he said....What People Are SayingU.S. President Donald Trump: "We want Venezuela to immediately accept all of the prisoners, and people from mental institutions, which includes the Worst in the World Insane Asylums, that Venezuelan "Leadership" has forced into the United States of America. Thousands of people have been badly hurt, and even killed, by these "Monsters." GET THEM THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY, RIGHT NOW, OR THE PRICE YOU PAY WILL BE INCALCULABLE!"Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello: "We do not seek war with anyone. We have never declared war on anyone. But we have learned to defend ourselves, and we have also learned to carry out devastating counterattacks when necessary."...What Happens NextThe Stockdale's Panama Canal transit reinforces U.S. operational flexibility in the region while signaling Washington's ongoing commitment to counter-narcotics missions.Venezuela's warnings indicate the potential for heightened tension, and further deployments and joint exercises are expected as both nations maintain a watchful postureRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
