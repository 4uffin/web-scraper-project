A California judge has temporarily blocked the federal government from collecting personal information about Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants in 21 states and Washington, D.C.
A spokesperson for the USDA told Newsweek that it will "not comment on pending litigation."Why It MattersThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which manages SNAP, announced in May that states would be required to share benefit recipient data‚Äîincluding names, birth dates, addresses, and Social Security numbers‚Äîunder an executive order from President Donald Trump, thus expanding data sharing between federal and state programs.According to the USDA, the goal of the data collection is to help root out fraud in the program, which serves some 42 million people nationwide.But the federal government's effort has been met with backlash and legal action from certain states.What To KnowU.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney in California issued a temporary restraining order against the USDA on September 18, ruling that the states challenging the policy were likely to prevail, noting their argument that SNAP applicants' personal data may only be used for purposes tied to administering the food assistance program and cannot be broadly shared.California, New York, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin, were all part of the lawsuit.Nevada was also signed on, but is not covered by the temporary restraining order. The states cited privacy concerns as well as fears the data could be use for immigration enforcement.

In July, the USDA warned that states refusing to hand over SNAP enrollment data risked losing federal food assistance funding. In response, the coalition of states sued, arguing the SNAP Act requires states to protect applicants' information and only release it for specific, limited purposes tied to running or enforcing the program.In a May 6 letter to state SNAP agency directors, the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service wrote that it "will use the data it receives from processors to ensure program integrity, including by verifying the eligibility of benefit recipients" and "will ensure Americans in need receive assistance, while at the same time safeguarding taxpayer dollars from abuse."The USDA has acknowledged, according to the filing, that the data could be disclosed "to a large number of entities, including numerous entities that are not assistance programs, and for purposes other than the administration or enforcement of an assistance program."What People Are SayingAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a May 6 news release announcing the data-sharing plans: "President Trump is rightfully requiring the federal government to have access to all programs it funds, and SNAP is no exception. For years, this program has been on autopilot, with no USDA insight into real-time data. The department is focused on appropriate and lawful participation in SNAP, and today's request is one of many steps to ensure SNAP is preserved for only those eligible." Esther Reyes, campaign strategist at Protecting Immigrant Families, told Newsweek: "Providing food security for a child in need should be something we can all agree on: only this administration would turn it into an attack on immigrant families. We applaud the judge's ruling and thank the attorneys general who filed suit to hold the Trump administration accountable for breaking federal law."What Happens NextThe USDA has until September 26 to oppose the order. A hearing has been scheduled for October 9 to decide whether the block should remain in place.
