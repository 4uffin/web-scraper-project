The states cited privacy concerns as well as fears the data could be use for immigration enforcement....In July, the USDA warned that states refusing to hand over SNAP enrollment data risked losing federal food assistance funding. In response, the coalition of states sued, arguing the SNAP Act requires states to protect applicants' information and only release it for specific, limited purposes tied to running or enforcing the program.In a May 6 letter to state SNAP agency directors, the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service wrote that it "will use the data it receives from processors to ensure program integrity, including by verifying the eligibility of benefit recipients" and "will ensure Americans in need receive assistance, while at the same time safeguarding taxpayer dollars from abuse."The USDA has acknowledged, according to the filing, that the data could be disclosed "to a large number of entities, including numerous entities that are not assistance programs, and for purposes other than the administration or enforcement of an assistance program."What People Are SayingAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a May 6 news release announcing the data-sharing plans: "President Trump is rightfully requiring the federal government to have access to all programs it funds, and SNAP is no exception. For years, this program has been on autopilot, with no USDA insight into real-time data. The department is focused on appropriate and lawful participation in SNAP, and today's request is one of many steps to ensure SNAP is preserved for only those eligible." Esther Reyes, campaign strategist at Protecting Immigrant Families, told Newsweek: "Providing food security for a child in need should be something we can all agree on: only this administration would turn it into an attack on immigrant families. We applaud the judge's ruling and thank the attorneys general who filed suit to hold the Trump administration accountable for breaking federal law."What Happens NextThe USDA has until September 26 to oppose the order. A hearing has been scheduled for October 9 to decide whether the block should remain in place.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
