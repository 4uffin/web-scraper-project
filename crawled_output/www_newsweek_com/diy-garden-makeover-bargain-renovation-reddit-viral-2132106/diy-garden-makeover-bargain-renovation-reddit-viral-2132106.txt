Home & GardenHome DecorGardenRedditNews ArticleWoman Quoted $131K for Garden Makeover—She Does It Herself for a FractionPublishedSep 19, 2025 at 04:50 AM EDTBy Soo KimLife and Trends ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA post about a woman's DIY garden space makeover that saved her tens of thousands of dollars has gone viral on Reddit.The Reddit post, shared by u/GooseSubstantial2502 under the title "Quoted £96k [around $131,000], so I did it myself!" has garnered 18,000 upvotes since it was posted on September 15. The post includes a series of images showing the gradual transformation of the outdoor space."I live in central London [the capital of the United Kingdom] so I was expecting a steep quote, but £96,000?! No thanks!" she wrote. "I'll figure out how to do it myself. Nothing has ever made me feel as capable as manning a jackhammer, except maybe childbirth." She later managed to do the garden remake herself for around $22,000.Reddit PostFNF ModThe viral story comes as American homeowners are spending more on renovations. A 2024 survey by Houzz, a home design website, found that median home renovation spending in the United States rose by 60 percent in recent years—from $15,000 in 2020 to $24,000 in 2023.For the London homeowner in the Reddit post, the results are more than just financial. The project not only saved her over $108,000 but also gave her a sense of accomplishment."The pics [in the Reddit post] are in rough chronological order—the last one was taken this morning," she wrote, showcasing the finished space filled with plants and new outdoor features.The work began in February, with the homeowner first tackling the removal of artificial turf. "Had to get that astroturf OUT!—and have added, moved, and replanted probably 300 plants since then," she wrote. "I did it completely on my own, including carrying 2,000lbs of gravel from the street to my garden bag-by-bag."She explained that while the original landscaping quote included extras such as benches and a barbecue area, the price still seemed far too high. "To be fair, the landscaping company was quoting based on some built in elements I decided I could live without (benches, barbecue area, etc), but I still find it outrageous," she said.By taking on the project herself, the cost dropped dramatically. "All in, I've spent just under £16,000 [around $22,000] which includes everything: tools, materials, plants, soil, furniture, barbecue, and even a skip hire to remove the rubbish," she wrote. "I paid top-dollar for quality plants and soil and that has paid me back tenfold already. And it's been So. Much. Fun!"Newsweek has contacted the original poster for comment via the Reddit messaging system....Do you have a renovation-related video or story to share?
