The Insider's TrackGood morning,Exactly 24 years ago last night, less than a week after 9/11, Bill Maher made the insensitive but not altogether wrong point on his ABC late-night show Politically Incorrect that the hijackers were evil, but they weren't cowards: "We have been the cowards, lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away. That's cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building — say what you want about it, it's not cowardly."Those comments helped kicked off our post-9/11 national psychosis. The first volley in the cancel culture era, if you will. Dozens of ABC affiliates dropped Maher's show, advertisers bailed out and he was "suspended indefinitely" until ABC finally pulled the plug on the show the following spring. The man the network chose to replace Maher in its late night slot? None other than Jimmy Kimmel.Kimmel now finds himself in a similar situation to the comedian he replaced. Late yesterday, ABC yanked him off the air "indefinitely" for comments he made after Charlie Kirk's death. Kimmel said on Monday's show: "We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who killed Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it." You can watch the full clip here.Now I don't pay a lot of attention to late night TV, a dying and irrelevant medium if ever there was one. Are these shows all like this now? This overtly political, preachy and unfunny? (And in this case, incorrect. We knew on Monday that signs were pointing to the Kirk perp being on the left). Hard to imagine Carson, Leno or Letterman opening their shows like that. But that isn't really here nor there. It's Kimmel's show and he can say whatever he wants to the vanishing number of Boomers half-watching as they fall asleep.At least that was the case. Trump's FCC chief Brendan Carr took notice of the Kimmel thing and saw an opening. "This is a very, very serious issue right now for Disney. We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead." Good to recall here that ABC is owned by Disney, the most risk-averse entertainment conglomerate in America, run by Bob Iger who is also our savviest media mogul. Iger knows which way the wind is blowing.Carr's jawboning of ABC preceded Nexstar, a big right-leaning TV station group that happens to be in the midst of an important merger requiring FCC approval, to announce its affiliates would pull Kimmel. Sinclair, the other big station group, followed. Facing an affiliate backlash sparked by the White House, ABC then caved. Trump, our media critic-in-chief, openly celebrated the move and urged NBC to can Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers next.This is how state censorship now works. Biden did a version of this by pressuring social media platforms to censor or deplatform speech the Dems found offensive, though Trump of course is taking it to the extreme because, as we discussed yesterday, everything is about leveraging maximum power. Republicans are arguing this is an "actions have consequences" moment and a case of a prominent figure being held accountable for saying something false and arguably defamatory. But anyone who says this isn't a First Amendment issue is wrong. Carr's "easy way or hard way" threat is a pretty cut-and-dry case of executive action being used to chill speech, and Kimmel's probably got a good lawsuit on his hands.What we're seeing right now is exactly what I predicted last week. (Put it on my tombstone: "He was prescient, if nothing else...") Trump will use the Kirk assassination as a pretext to clamp down on speech he doesn't like, and many on the left will continue to make it easy for him. Remember, POTUS has had it out for these late-night guys for a long time. He got Colbert cancelled, now Kimmel suspended. Fallon must feel like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas walking into that empty room.The thing I think MAGA is failing to understand is all these precedents Trump is creating are just going to be used against them the next time a functioning, power-hungry Democrat is in office. President Newsom won't hesitate to use this Trump 2.0 playbook to his advantage. I don't really care about Kimmel one way or another and I kind of resent having to even defend him as I've always found the guy to be insufferable. But we're in a new political dynamic in the wake of Kirk. What Trump is doing is making that outwardly clear to a media-and-entertainment establishment that, he would say, has wielded its outsized cultural power against the right for too long. That is what is going to further chill speech, as none of these media companies are gonna want the regulatory hassle that now comes with their people speaking out against the admin. We really are in uncharted waters now.Tomorrow I will make my case for two final things we could do to help solve the crisis of young people being radicalized online. Sorry that the news keeps preempting this discussion, as I find it very cathartic to think about actual solutions to these problems rather than just whining about them. The RundownJimmy Kimmel 'Cancelled' Over Charlie Kirk Comments: Trump Celebrates, Hollywood FuryABC announced Wednesday evening that it has suspended Jimmy Kimmel Live! indefinitely following backlash over comments host Jimmy Kimmel made about the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.The decision came hours after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr publicly criticized Kimmel's remarks and suggested regulatory consequences. The suspension came amid calls from Carr for broadcasters to take action against what he called "garbage," and was swiftly praised by President Donald Trump.Now, major Hollywood unions and progressive groups are pushing back, accusing ABC and its affiliates of censorship and demanding a boycott of Disney properties.

"The U.S. has taken a step back at least in terms of providing material support for Ukraine, which has put a greater burden on Europe to take up the slack," John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told Newsweek.
