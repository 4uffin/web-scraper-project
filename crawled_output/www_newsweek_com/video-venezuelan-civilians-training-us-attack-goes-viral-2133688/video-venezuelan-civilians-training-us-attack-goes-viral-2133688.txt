What To KnowVenezuela has been holding large military exercises in recent days, involving civilians, amid fears of an attack by the United States, the country's military said.According to the Venezuelan Defense Ministry, the drills are in their second week and involve more than 1 million people. Official figures break down the mobilization as 150,000 soldiers, 328,000 civilians and roughly a half-million government officials.But according to AFP, turnout has been much lower, with relatively small groups observed at training sessions in Caracas and provincial cities such as San Crist√≥bal and Barinas.The exercises began on Ortiz Island and have spread to Caracas and other cities, where soldiers are training volunteers in the use of weapons, basic first aid and what state media calls "ideological thought."The military drills have taken on a grassroots dimension, with soldiers fanning out into neighborhoods such as Petare, Caracas's largest slum. The main avenue there was shut down for a day of weapons courses, first-aid instruction and "revolutionary resistance" tactics.Elsewhere, naval drills featured fishing boats cruising alongside Venezuelan warships. In the rural state of Aragua, Maduro rallied supporters, urging "millions" to "be prepared to take up arms and defend the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela if it were attacked by the American empire."The show of force comes after the U.S. deployed warships to the Caribbean this month as part of what officials in Washington described as an anti-drug and counterterrorism operation. The flotilla, which included seven vessels and a nuclear-powered submarine, was bolstered by F-35 fighters in Puerto Rico.Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L√≥pez accused the U.S. of waging "undeclared war" in the region after American forces killed more than a dozen alleged drug traffickers off the country's coast. Caracas has also charged Washington with seeking regime change and attempting to seize control of Venezuela's oil and mineral resources.The campaign also coincides with diplomatic friction over migration. The U.S. has begun repatriating undocumented Venezuelans, with more than 13,000 returned since President Donald Trump took office in January. Trump recently warned Caracas that it would face "incalculable" consequences if it refused to take back deported migrants.On Thursday, Venezuela said it had launched three days of large-scale military exercises in the Caribbean after several U.S. attacks on alleged drug trafficking boats.What Happens NextU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that Trump will keep using the military to target drug cartels.The Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker, said Monday that he plans to examine whether the U.S. military's strike on a Venezuelan boat was lawful."I need more information," Wicker told reporters. "I'm going to drill down and see what I can find out before I comment on that."
