Personal FinanceViralTrendsOnlineInternetRedditMoneyMoreNews ArticleMan Finds Receipt Outside ATM, Can’t Believe What’s Written on It: ‘Why’PublishedSep 19, 2025 at 10:16 AM EDTBy Alice GibbsSenior Life and Trends ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA simple ATM visit turned into a viral moment when Jeffrey Mitchell discovered a receipt showing more than $51,000 sitting in someone's checking account.Mitchell, who lives in Apache Junction, Arizona, said he stumbled upon the slip after choosing to use the ATM instead of waiting in a long bank line."The receipt was inside of the machine, the prior user never took it," Mitchell told Newsweek. "I looked at it and was surprised. My whole life, I have been told to keep an emergency fund, but $51,000+ was shocking to me. Why on Earth would anyone have that amount in a checking account?"Curious, Mitchell snapped a picture of the receipt and shared it on Reddit's r/povertyfinance community where it has 27,000 upvotes and thousands of comments. He wanted to know whether others thought keeping that much in a non–interest-bearing account made sense....Within 24 hours, the post had amassed over 5 million views, more than 27,000 upvotes, and 6,000 comments. It quickly became Mitchell's most-viewed post on the platform."I like to see the different perspectives shared," he said, "but I feel like maybe it got this attention because people are struggling right now. There is a huge 'us vs. them' or 'have vs. have not' in the economy right now."According to data from WalletHub, U.S. households hold an average of $16,891 in checking, much lower than $51,000, but the median balance is only around $2,800—meaning half of households keep less than that amount on hand. More recent estimates from ValuePenguin put the median closer to $3,400 as of 2024, reflecting slight growth but still underscoring how little liquidity most families maintain.These numbers highlight the divide between households with large reserves and the far more common reality of Americans keeping only a few thousand dollars in their checking accounts.Internet reactsThe Reddit thread turned into a lively debate as people discussed why someone may have such a large amount in their account."$50,000 might not be a lot to this person. They could have 99% tied up in increments and this is their pocket change that's 100% liquid," wrote one Redditor.While another said: "This person could have $10m invested for all you know. Money is relative.""I was behind a guy on a flight one time who had his bank pulled up on his laptop... $1.3 million just chilling in his checking," wrote another commenter."It's not just about money in a checking account. It's about what it represents to people right now," Mitchell said. "Whether that's envy, disbelief, or just plain financial advice."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesU.S.Exclusive: James Talarico on Texas, ‘Nonbinary’ God and Joe Rogan’s Support27 min. readNewsArmed Man Released on Bond Ahead of Charlie Kirk Memorial: Officials3 min. readNewsTrump Demands Venezuela Accept ‘Worst in the World’ Criminals4 min. readNewsThousands Protest on NYC Streets Ahead of Climate Week3 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Leaves Disney Facing ‘Existential Crisis’5 min. readHealthRecall for Kirkland Brand Tuna Poke Sold at Costco3 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
