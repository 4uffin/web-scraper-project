Spirit Airlines will furlough one-third of its flight attendants as part of a process to align their staffing with their fleet size, a company spokesperson told Newsweek in an emailed statement Monday.Roughly 1,800 flight attendants will be furloughed starting December 1 of this year, according to the statement.There are currently about 5,200 flight attendants employed by the airline, which offers affordable travel to over 75 destinations across North America, Latin America, and the Caribbean."We recognize the impact of this decision on affected Team Members, and we are committed to treating them with care and respect during this process," the statement said.The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA-CWA) told Newsweek in an emailed statement on Monday: "Management must offer voluntary furloughs first, before involuntary furloughs. Following award of the voluntary furlough, management will proceed with involuntary furlough in inverse order of system seniority up to the number announced in the WARN notices, per the Flight Attendant contract."

Why It MattersThe furlough announcement comes just days after the airline said it would reduce capacity by 25 percent starting in November.The changes to the fleet capacity and flight attendant numbers will impact operations for the airline and its customers, especially those who have come to rely on Spirit's cut-price fares.Spirit to Furlough Flight Attendants: What to KnowThere are about 5,200 flight attendants working for Spirit Airlines, with one-third, about 1,800, to be furloughed starting in December, according to a company statement.Spirit did not say how long the furlough might last or if any other staff cuts were planned.When Did Spirit File for Bankruptcy?The company filed for bankruptcy in November 2024 amid struggles with profitability and demand illustrated as a "substantial doubt as to the company's ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months," according to a quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Following the announcement, an email sent by CEO Dave Davis told employees that the wording was "required by our outside auditors to convey that there is risk if we do not make changes. But, we are."At the time of the bankruptcy announcement, Davis said the company would be "strategically growing our network in stronger markets with more opportunities." He added that the company also would have to make "difficult decisions" on whether to cancel "unprofitable routes."What People Are SayingSpirit Airlines, in a statement to Newsweek on Monday: "As part of our ongoing restructuring, we are taking steps to align staffing with our fleet size and expected flight volume. In line with this process, we have made the difficult decision to furlough approximately 1,800 Flight Attendants, effective Dec. 1, 2025. We recognize the impact of this decision on affected Team Members, and we are committed to treating them with care and respect during this process."Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA-CWA) told Newsweek in an emailed statement on Monday: "Spirit announced this morning that management plans to furlough approximated 1800 Flight Attendants. Management must offer voluntary furloughs first, before involuntary furloughs. Following award of the voluntary furlough, management will proceed with involuntary furlough in inverse order of system seniority up to the number announced in the WARN notices, per the Flight Attendant contract."What Happens NextAccording to the AFA-CWA, Spirit must first offer voluntary furloughs to employees under the Flight Attendant contract. Once those have been offered, involuntary furloughs will be offered based on seniority, the AFA-CWA said.No additional information has been provided by Spirit on additional cost-cutting moves and the impact to customers is not clear at this time.Update 9/22/25, 2:57 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with more information.
