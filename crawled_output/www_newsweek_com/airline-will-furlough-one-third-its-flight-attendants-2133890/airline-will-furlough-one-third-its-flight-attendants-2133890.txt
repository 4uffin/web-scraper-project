Following award of the voluntary furlough, management will proceed with involuntary furlough in inverse order of system seniority up to the number announced in the WARN notices, per the Flight Attendant contract."...Why It MattersThe furlough announcement comes just days after the airline said it would reduce capacity by 25 percent starting in November.The changes to the fleet capacity and flight attendant numbers will impact operations for the airline and its customers, especially those who have come to rely on Spirit's cut-price fares.Related StoriesFat Bear Week Starts: What To Know4 min. readTrump’s Platinum Card Gives Tax Break on Non-US Income to Foreigners4 min. readDOJ Charges Man With Aiming Laser Pointer at Marine One With Trump on Board5 min. readSpirit to Furlough Flight Attendants: What to KnowThere are about 5,200 flight attendants working for Spirit Airlines, with one-third, about 1,800, to be furloughed starting in December, according to a company statement.Spirit did not say how long the furlough might last or if any other staff cuts were planned.When Did Spirit File for Bankruptcy?The company filed for bankruptcy in November 2024 amid struggles with profitability and demand illustrated as a "substantial doubt as to the company's ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months," according to a quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Following the announcement, an email sent by CEO Dave Davis told employees that the wording was "required by our outside auditors to convey that there is risk if we do not make changes. But, we are."At the time of the bankruptcy announcement, Davis said the company would be "strategically growing our network in stronger markets with more opportunities." He added that the company also would have to make "difficult decisions" on whether to cancel "unprofitable routes."What People Are SayingSpirit Airlines, in a statement to Newsweek on Monday: "As part of our ongoing restructuring, we are taking steps to align staffing with our fleet size and expected flight volume. In line with this process, we have made the difficult decision to furlough approximately 1,800 Flight Attendants, effective Dec. 1, 2025. We recognize the impact of this decision on affected Team Members, and we are committed to treating them with care and respect during this process."Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA-CWA) told Newsweek in an emailed statement on Monday: "Spirit announced this morning that management plans to furlough approximated 1800 Flight Attendants. Management must offer voluntary furloughs first, before involuntary furloughs. Following award of the voluntary furlough, management will proceed with involuntary furlough in inverse order of system seniority up to the number announced in the WARN notices, per the Flight Attendant contract."What Happens NextAccording to the AFA-CWA, Spirit must first offer voluntary furloughs to employees under the Flight Attendant contract. Once those have been offered, involuntary furloughs will be offered based on seniority, the AFA-CWA said.No additional information has been provided by Spirit on additional cost-cutting moves and the impact to customers is not clear at this time.Update 9/22/25, 2:57 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with more information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
