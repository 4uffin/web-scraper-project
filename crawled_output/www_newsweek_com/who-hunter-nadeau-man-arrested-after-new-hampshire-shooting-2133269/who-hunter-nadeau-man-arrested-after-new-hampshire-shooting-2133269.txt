According to the police investigation into what happened, an adult man walked into the country club and opened fire several times.Witnesses said the shooting happened when guests were gathering on the dance floor to celebrate the newly wedded couple.Initial reports said that two shooters were involved, but that turned out not to be the case.

No information was shared on the identity of those who were injured in the shooting, nor their conditions.A wedding guest who was at the country club during the incident, Tom Bartelson of Pepperell, Massachusetts, said that he heard the shooter saying "the children are safe" and "free Palestine," as reported by NPR. Authorities have shared no information regarding such statements."Getting together for a dance for the bride and groom and then all chaos went off," Pepperell said. "We heard about six shots and everybody ducked for cover and next thing you know we're rushed into safe spots and things like that."Emily Ernst, another witness to the shooting, said she saw a gunman wearing all black, with a mask on."We just saw him raise the gun and then we ran," Ernst said. "I ran through the kitchen for my life."What Do We Know About Nadeau?Not much has been made known about Nadeau by authorities besides his name and age.The 23-year-old is the only person to have been apprehended in connection with the shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club, though he is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.Formella and Rourke said there is no known connection between Nadeau and DeCesare.
