The Foreign Ministry said three Russian fighter jets entered its airspace Friday without permission and remained for 12 minutes, the fourth such breach this year.Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said the government would begin consultations with NATO allies under Article 4 after what he described as yet another Russian incursion.Trump Reacts to Russia's Latest MovesPresident Donald Trump warned of "big trouble" when asked Friday about the reports of Russian fighter jets entering Estonia's airspace.The president responded to a question about the reports, "Well, I'm gonna have to look at it. They'll be briefing me in a short while, so I'll let you know about it tonight or tomorrow.He continued, "I don't love it. I don't like when that happens. This could be big trouble, but I'll let you know later they're going to brief me in about an hour."NATO spokesperson Allison Hart said Friday the North Atlantic Council, the alliance's top political decision-making body, will meet early next week to review the incident.What is the Petrobaltic Installation?The Petrobaltic platform is an oil and gas installation operated by Orlen Petrobaltic, a subsidiary of Poland's state-owned energy giant Orlen. Located in the Polish exclusive economic zone of the Baltic Sea, it is the country's only offshore oil platform and a strategic energy asset, producing crude oil and natural gas since the late 1980s.What is a Safety Zone?A safety zone is a protective buffer established around facilities or operations—such as oil platforms or military drills—meant to reduce risks but without the same legal weight as airspace, which is the sovereign territory above a nation's land and waters, where unauthorized entry is treated as a violation of national borders.Update: 9/19/25, 2:34 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Update: 9/19/25, 7:26 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
