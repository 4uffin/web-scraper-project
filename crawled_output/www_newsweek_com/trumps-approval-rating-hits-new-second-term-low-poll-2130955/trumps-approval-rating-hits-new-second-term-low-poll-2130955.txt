He's blowing up the economy. He hasn't done squat to help the working class. The Epstein scandal haunts him. He is a weak and failing president with his back against the wall. Keep up the pressure."Trump on Truth Social Tuesday: "The Republicans are going to do a Midterm Convention in order to show the great things we have done since the Presidential Election of 2024. Time and place to be determined. Stay tuned, it will be quite the Event, and very exciting! President DJT"Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on X in April: "Today's ABC poll has Trump's approval rating lower than any past president at his first 100 days in office. The American people do not want oligarchy, authoritarianism or attacks on Social Security, Medicaid or the VA. And the resistance is just beginning."What Happens NextPolitical strategists and pollsters say sustained sub-majority approval ratings can harm the sitting president's party in midterm elections by motivating opposition turnout and complicating messaging for swing-district Republican candidates.Historical patterns often show the president's party losing ground in midterms under similar conditions.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
