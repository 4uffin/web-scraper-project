Spirit 1300 traffic off your left wing by six mi--- or eight miles, 747. I'm sure you can see who it is. Keep an eye out for him—he's white and blue.""Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right," an air traffic controller radioed to the pilots, CBS News reported, citing recordings from liveatc.net. of the flight from Fort Lauderdale to Boston. Controllers said, according to CBS, "Pay attention. Get off the iPad."Preliminary flight data from Flightradar24 showed that the Spirit Airbus A321 and Air Force One were flying parallel to each other eight miles apart, and were 11 miles apart when they were on the closest path where they could converge.The FAA said that a preliminary investigation showed the aircraft maintained the required separation.A Spirit Airlines spokesperson told Newsweek that "safety is always our top priority" and that the pilots had followed procedures and Air Traffic Control (ATC) instructions and landed "uneventfully."It comes after a series of incidents in recent months of general aviation aircraft violating Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) airspace over Bedminster, New Jersey, when Trump was staying there.The U.S. Air Force said that last weekend, six general aviation aircraft had violated the TFRs and one plane had to be intercepted by NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) fighter aircraft, with flares being deployed to attract the pilot's attention.What People Are SayingAir Traffic Control audio: "Pay attention, Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right. Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right, now. Spirit wings 1300 turn 20 degrees right, immediately."A Spirit Airlines spokesperson told Newsweek: "Spirit Airlines flight 1300 followed procedures and Air Traffic Control (ATC) instructions while en route to Boston and landed uneventfully (in Boston). Safety is always our top priority."What Happens NextThe FAA has said that a preliminary investigation showed that the aircraft maintained the required separation, and the statement by Spirit Airlines that correct procedures had been followed suggested there would be no further action.Update 09/17/25, 08:32 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with further information.Update 09/17/25, 11:50 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with a response from Spirit Airlines.
