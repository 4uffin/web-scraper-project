A massive public memorial honoring conservative activist Charlie Kirk is underway in Glendale, Arizona, following his fatal shooting at a Utah university earlier this month. The event, held at State Farm Stadium, has drawn tens of thousands of mourners and features appearances from top Trump administration officials.
What to Know:
President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, widow Erika Kirk, and five Cabinet members are scheduled to speak at the service.
State Farm Stadium reached full capacity Sunday morning as mourners gathered for Charlie Kirk's memorial. With over 200,000 people attempting to attend, authorities began redirecting overflow crowds to a nearby arena after the 73,000-seat venue filled within hours of opening.
Kirk's widow, Erika, now leading Turning Point USA, will speak at the memorial. She has pledged to continue her husband's legacy and described the loss as "anguishing."
Mourners began lining up before sunrise, with many camping overnight to secure a spot.
Scheduled speakers include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.
RFK Jr said in his speech that both Kirk and Jesus "changed the trajectory of history." Meanwhile, Vance noted that today was more of a "revival" than a funeral for Kirk.

Charlie Kirk's Memorial Draws Thousands As Friends, Colleagues Push Mission Forward
Tens of thousands of people poured into State Farm Stadium on Sunday to commemorate the life of Charlie Kirk, many having arrived in the middle of the night and waited in lines ahead of 2 a.m. Attendees arrived in a range of styles from formal suits to shirts emblazoned with Kirk quotes or "I am Charlie Kirk" and MAGA apparel.
Many came from across the country, driving or flying in just for the weekend, but not everyone was a devout Turning Point USA (TPUSA) fan: Some attendees told Newsweek that they had never been to a TPUSA event, but they were either an ardent follower of Kirk's social media or saw his assassination online and decided to attend.
The over four hour-long memorial was much more than a few speakers reflecting on Kirk's life, instead serving as a "revival" both in a religious and political sense, urging forward momentum for both TPUSA and the wider conservative movement.
Most speeches didn't focus on sentimental remembrance but rather addressed Kirk's legacy, accomplishments, political savvy, and faith.
The memorial was heavily laden with evangelist music and speeches intertwining politics and divinity. Most speeches from both pastors and the Trump administration emphasized Charlie's faith, devotion, and the desire to bring a specific form of Christianity to the forefront of American leadership.
Several attendees told Newsweek that Kirk's legacy is going to far exceed the monumental growth seen in TPUSA already, which has seen a surge in requests for new chapters since Kirk's September 10 assassination.
Attendees praised the response to Kirk's death, with his widow, Erika, noting that no protests or violent riots occurred: Instead, national debate and growth in faith attendance and desire had prospered. Now as a "martyr," Kirk's legacy will only continue to grow, attendees told Newsweek, with thousands of supporters energized and steadfast in carrying it through.
Erika Kirk remained a fixture throughout the memorial, and her entrance to tens of thousands of people applauding her caused her to stop and choke back tears. Photos and videos of her and her husband adorned every corner of the stadium, and she was mentioned in most speeches.
Attendees noted their excitement that Erika will proceed as the new leader of TPUSA, taking the reins of the rapidly expanding organization. Many, in their optimism of her leadership, emphasized that Charlie Kirk repeatedly noted Erika is more conservative than him, and others highlighted her intellect and family values.
President Donald Trump closed out the memorial with a lengthy speech that touched on Kirk's central role in the MAGA movement - including his push to consider JD Vance for vice president - and various causes dear to Kirk as a growing leader in the conservative wing of America.
Trump and Erika Kirk embraced as they ended the memorial, and they wished God to bless all in attendance before dismissing them.

Erika Kirk Chokes Back Tears After Seeing Crowd Applaud Her Husband
Erika Kirk, Charlie's widow, paused as she walked on stage and choked back tears as the immense crowd cheered for her. She paused again in awe as the crowd cheered for her husband while she was speaking.
Erika related the rollercoaster of emotion she experienced since her husband was assassinated, describing her visit to identify her husband's body as "shock," "horror," and "a level of heartache that I didn't even know existed."
But then she saw "a faint smile" on his lips that let her know that he was at peace, that "one moment Charlie was doing the thing he loved ... and then he blinked, and saw his savior in paradise."
She praised the response to Charlie Kirk's death, which was not one of protests and riots, but one of prayer and conversation.
She also revealed that she recalled Charlie Kirk once saying to God that he opened himself to his will and asked him to "use me," and that "when you tell God that, he takes you up on it."
She also said that Charlie Kirk was not afraid to die because he "loved this world without regrets, he did 100 percent of what he could every day," and that he died with incomplete work but not unfinished business.
Her speech detailed the close relationship between her husband's faith and his political mission, and she charged the crowd to carry forward his mission, warning they must be prepared for challenges and trials of faith.
"Pray again, read the bible again, go to church next Sunday, and the Sunday after that, and break free of the shackles of this world," she said.

Vance praised Kirk as "a great American leader" and "a martyr for the Christian faith," saying, "Tonight we speak with Charlie and for Charlie louder than ever."
"He showed all of us how to carry on after his death," Vance said, adding, "America was his home and he was willing to die for it." He invoked ancient philosophy, noting Kirk "stood for a decision that Socrates established 5,000 years ago."
Vance urged the crowd to reject fear and embrace truth: "It is better to face a gunman than live your life afraid to speak the truth." He closed with a vow: "For Charlie, we will rebuild this United States of America to greatness. For Charlie, we will never shrink, we will never falter... even when staring down the barrel of a gun."

Vice President JD Vance accompanied Kirk's body on Air Force Two when it was transported to Arizona, where Kirk lived with his wife Erika and two children.
The service featured speeches from elected officials, faith leaders, and Kirk's colleagues. Former Kirk Chief of Staff Mikey McCoy quoted philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard, telling the crowd: "The tyrant dies and his rule is over. The martyr dies, and his rule has just begun."
Musk has been vocal on social media about Kirk's death, calling for jail time for those appearing to celebrate the killing and characterizing it in stark terms: "Charlie was murdered by the Dark for showing people the Light."

FBI director outlines expansive probe into Charlie Kirk assassination
FBI Director Kash Patel released a detailed update Sunday on the bureau's investigation into the assassination of Charlie Kirk, coinciding with the activist's memorial service in Arizona. Patel emphasized the agency's commitment to a "thorough and exhaustive" inquiry, noting that every lead is being pursued.
Among the theories under review is the possibility that "hand gestures observed as potential 'signals'" near Kirk at the time of the shooting may indicate coordination or complicity. Investigators are also examining the bullet's trajectory, the weapon's transport, digital communications, including Discord chats, and visitors to the alleged shooter's residence in the days leading up to the attack.
Patel addressed speculation about a nearby aircraft's transponder, clarifying that incomplete flight data‚Äînot tampering‚Äîcaused the apparent signal gap.
"The entire FBI mourns the loss of Charlie Kirk," Patel wrote. "We will not rest until justice is served."
