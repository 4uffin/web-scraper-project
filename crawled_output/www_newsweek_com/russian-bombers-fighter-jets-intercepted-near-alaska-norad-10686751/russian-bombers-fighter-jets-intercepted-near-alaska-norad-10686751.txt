Newsweek has contacted NORAD and the Russian defense ministry for comment....Why It Matters NORAD revealed the intercept days after Estonia said that Russian aircraft had breached the NATO member’s airspace, prompting Tallinn to invoke Article 4 of the alliance’s charter for security talks. Russian military aircraft flying near North America could be interpreted as another move by Moscow to test NATO's resolve during high tensions with the alliance. What To KnowThe ADIZ starts where sovereign airspace ends, usually 12 miles from the coast and all aircraft are expected to identify themselves. In a statement on Thursday, NORAD said that the previous day, it had intercepted four Russian aircraft which had entered the Alaska ADIZ but remained in international airspace. NORAD said that it deployed an E-3 Sentry surveillance plane, four F-16 Fighting Falcons and four KC-135 aerial tankers to identify and intercept the Russian aircraft which consisted of two Tupolev Tu-95 four-engine strategic bombers and two Su-35 fighters.  NORAD said this kind of Russian activity in the zone happens regularly and is not seen as a threat without giving more information about the route and length of the Russian flights. Wednesday’s incident was the first time Russian aircraft had appeared in the air defense zone since August 26, when an Ilyushin Il-20 surveillance plane made a two hour, 20-minute flight near the western Aleutian Islands. During one week in August, there were four flights in the Alaska ADIZ, two flights the previous month and other incidents in April and February. There were 12 such incidents in 2024, NORAD added. Last week, Estonia said that Russian MiG-31 jets breached its airspace, accusations which Moscow has denied, saying that they followed international regulations en route to Russia’s Kaliningrad region. On the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that NATO countries should be able to shoot down Russian military aircraft that violate their airspace. What People Are Saying The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said in a statement it had “detected and tracked two Tu-95s and two Su-35s operating in the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on Sept. 24, 2025.” What Happens Next The U.S. and its European allies will remain on high alert following incidents of Russian drones and aircraft breaching NATO airspace. Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
