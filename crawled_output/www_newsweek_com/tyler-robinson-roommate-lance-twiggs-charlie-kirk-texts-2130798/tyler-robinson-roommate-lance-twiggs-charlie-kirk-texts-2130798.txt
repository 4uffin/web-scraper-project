U.S.Breaking NewsUtahCharlie kirkTextingCrimeSchool shootingNews ArticleTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs RevealedPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 02:57 PM EDTupdatedSep 17, 2025 at 11:17 AM EDTBy Joshua Rhett Miller, Jesus Mesa, and Gabe WhisnantShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberProsecutors on Tuesday revealed text messages between accused gunman Tyler Robinson and his roommate, Lance Twiggs, in which Robinson admitted to killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk, described hiding his rifle and detailed his planning in the days before the shooting.According to court filings, Robinson first instructed Twiggs to look under his computer keyboard, where a handwritten note said, "I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it."When Twiggs responded in disbelief, Robinson wrote, "I am, I'm sorry," later explaining that police had mistakenly detained others while he tried to recover his weapon.Over the course of the exchange, Robinson justified the shooting as retaliation against Kirk's "hatred," discussed hiding the rifle in a bush, worried about leaving fingerprints, and told Twiggs to delete their messages.Robinson eventually wrote that he intended to surrender to authorities, telling his roommate, "You are all I worry about love."Why It MattersThe messages, included in court documents obtained by Newsweek, form the basis of a sweeping criminal case that charges Robinson, 22, with seven crimes, including capital murder, obstruction of justice, and tampering with a witness.The shooting occurred on September 10 during a public Turning Point USA event hosted by Kirk at Utah Valley University. Roughly 15 minutes into the event, Kirk was answering a question about transgender mass shooters when he was struck in the neck by a bullet fired from a rooftop roughly 160 yards away.Related StoriesMarjorie Taylor Greene Reveals Recent Text Messages From Charlie Kirk5 min. readBarack Obama Issues Political Violence Warning—’We Have to Be Concerned’5 min. readMan With Green Card Who Was Held by ICE for 77 Days Speaks Out—’Inhumane’3 min. readWhat To KnowIn the full text exchange included in the documents obtained by Newsweek, Robinson told Twiggs, "If I am able to grab my rifle unseen, I will have left no evidence," before adding, "Going to attempt to retrieve it again... I might have to abandon it and hope they don't find prints.""I worry about prints. I had to leave it in a bush where I changed outfits... Only thing I left was the rifle wrapped in a towel." He also referenced having engraved the bullets for shock value, texting, "If I see 'notices bulge uwu' on Fox News I might have a stroke".Asked how long the plan had been in motion, Robinson replied, "A bit over a week, I believe." He later wrote, "I'm wishing I had circled back and grabbed it as soon as I got to my vehicle."Robinson also urged Twiggs to delete their conversation and stay silent: "Don't talk to the media please... if any police ask you questions ask for a lawyer and stay silent".The documents state that children under 14 were visible near Kirk when he was shot — an aggravating factor under Utah law. Robinson has also been charged under a victim-targeting enhancement statute for allegedly choosing Kirk because of his political views.Robinson's parents became suspicious after seeing surveillance footage published by law enforcement. His father recognized the shooter's rifle as one given to Robinson as a gift. When asked to send a photo of the rifle, Robinson refused. He eventually confessed to his parents and turned himself in to police with the help of a retired sheriff's deputy family friend."There is too much evil and the guy spreads too much hate," Robinson reportedly told them, referring to Kirk."I'm gonna turn myself in willingly," Robinson texted Twiggs before his arrest. "You are all I worry about love".The Exchange in FullIn messages sent just after the shooting, Robinson directed Twiggs to look under his keyboard. The following exchange then took place, according to prosecutors:Twiggs: What?????????????? You're joking, right????Robinson: I am still ok my love, but am stuck in Orem for a little while longer yet. Shouldn't be long until I can come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still. To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you.Twiggs: You weren't the one who did it, right????Robinson: I am, I'm sorry.Twiggs: I thought they caught the person?Robinson: No, they grabbed some crazy old dude, then interrogated someone in similar clothing. I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down. It's quiet, almost enough to get out, but there's one vehicle lingering.Twiggs: Why?Robinson: Why did I do it?Twiggs: Yeah.Robinson: I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out. If I am able to grab my rifle unseen, I will have left no evidence. Going to attempt to retrieve it again, hopefully they have moved on. I haven't seen anything about them finding it.Twiggs: How long have you been planning this?Robinson: A bit over a week I believe. I can get close to it but there is a squad car parked right by it. I think they already swept that spot, but I don't wanna chance it.Robinson: I'm wishing I had circled back and grabbed it as soon as I got to my vehicle. I'm worried what my old man would do if I didn't bring back grandpa's rifle. Idek if it had a serial number, but it wouldn't trace to me. I worry about prints. I had to leave it in a bush where I changed outfits. Didn't have the ability or time to bring it with.Robinson: I might have to abandon it and hope they don't find prints. How the fuck will I explain losing it to my old man... Only thing I left was the rifle wrapped in a towel.Robinson: Remember how I was engraving bullets? The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme. If I see "notices bulge uwu" on Fox News I might have a stroke.Robinson: Alright I'm gonna have to leave it. That really fucking sucks.Robinson: Judging from today I'd say grandpa's gun does just fine idk. I think that was a $2k scope ;-;Robinson: Delete this exchange.Robinson: My dad wants photos of the rifle... he says grandpa wants to know who has what, the feds released a photo of the rifle, and it is very unique. He's calling me rn, not answering.Robinson: Since Trump got into office, [my dad] has been pretty diehard MAGA.Robinson: I'm gonna turn myself in willingly. One of my neighbors here is a deputy for the sheriff.Robinson: You are all I worry about love.Twiggs: I'm much more worried about you.Robinson: Don't talk to the media please. Don't take any interviews or make any comments. If any police ask you questions ask for a lawyer and stay silent.Who is Tyler Robinson's Roommate, Lance Twiggs?Lance Twiggs has been confirmed by the FBI as Robinson's romantic partner. Utah Governor Spencer Cox publicly identified Twiggs as a transgender individual and said she has fully cooperated with law enforcement. Twiggs has not been accused of wrongdoing, and officials say she was unaware of Robinson's plans prior to the shooting.Twiggs and Robinson lived together in St. George, Utah. A neighbor told reporters he had seen the two kissing and holding hands shortly before the attack. Family members of Twiggs have described her as politically outspoken, though investigators have not drawn conclusions about her influence on Robinson.What Has Tyler Robinson Been Charged With?Robinson is accused of planning and carrying out a targeted assassination and attempting to erase evidence in the aftermath. Prosecutors say he selected Charlie Kirk based on political views and fired a single shot from a rooftop sniper position.In addition to the murder charge, Robinson faces allegations that he tried to obstruct justice by discarding evidence and pressuring his roommate to stay silent.What People Are Saying Utah Governor Spencer Cox, during a press conference last week: "Social media is a cancer on our society right now, and I would encourage people to log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member. Go out and do good in the community."President Donald Trump told reporters on Sunday: "...if you look at the problem, the problem is on the left. It's not on the right...and when you look at the agitators, you look at the scum that speaks so badly of our country, the American flag burnings all over the place, that's the left, that's not the right."Jon Michaels, professor of law at the University of California, Los Angeles, told Newsweek: "For some time now, we've become increasingly inured to acts of unspeakable violence, most prominently and frequently on display in the form of mass shootings, often at schools or houses of worship."Luke Baumgartner, research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University: "The shooting of Charlie Kirk underscores how combustible American politics are right now. We're living in a time where political identities are now hardened into immutable characteristics and existential struggles. I think that violence is a recurring feature of our public life."What Happens NextRobinson is expected to be formally arraigned in court, where the charges against him will be read and he will be asked to enter a plea. Prosecutors have stated they intend to seek the death penalty due to the aggravated murder charge....Update: 9/16/25, 4:04 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
