For those experiencing less severe infections, symptoms may include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, which often last between one and three days, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).For more severe and potentially life-threatening infections, symptoms may include headaches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.Severe infections are particularly dangerous for young children, elderly people, and those with weakened immune systems. It can also lead to miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women.What To KnowThe recall, initiated on Saturday by Kent, Washington-based Western United Fish Company, follows a positive test for Listeria monocytogenes in the product's green onions.The recall affects approximately 3,315 pounds of Kirkland Signature brand Ahi Tuna Wasabi Poke packaged and sold at Costco deli sections on September 18, 2025. It has a sell by date of September 22, 2025. Impacted products were distributed across Costco Warehouses in at least 32 states, including but not limited to Alabama, Alaska, California, Florida, New York, Texas, and Washington.No illnesses have been reported in association with the product as of the recall date. Consumers who purchased the product are advised not to consume it and to return it to their local Costco for a full refund or dispose of it securely.Consumers are advised to remain vigilant for symptoms of listeriosis, such as fever, muscle aches, or gastrointestinal issues, and to seek medical attention if illness develops following consumption of the recalled product.Those with additional questions can contact Western United Fresh Co.
