For those experiencing less severe infections, symptoms may include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, which often last between one and three days, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).For more severe and potentially life-threatening infections, symptoms may include headaches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.Severe infections are particularly dangerous for young children, elderly people, and those with weakened immune systems. It can also lead to miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women.What To KnowThe recall, initiated on Saturday by Kent, Washington-based Western United Fish Company, follows a positive test for Listeria monocytogenes in the product's green onions.The recall affects approximately 3,315 pounds of Kirkland Signature brand Ahi Tuna Wasabi Poke packaged and sold at Costco deli sections on September 18, 2025.
