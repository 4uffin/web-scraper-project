Western United Fish Company has issued a recall for its Kirkland Signature brand Ahi Tuna Wasabi Poke, sold at Costco, over concerns that the green onions used in the product could have been potentially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.Why It MattersThe recall occurs amid heightened concerns about food safety and the prevalence of foodborne pathogens in ready-to-eat products distributed at major U.S. retailers.The recall occurs just months after a separate tuna recall at Costco over botulism risks, illustrating the persistent food safety challenges faced by industry and regulators alike.Listeria infection, or listeriosis, may lead to a range of symptoms in infected individuals. For those experiencing less severe infections, symptoms may include fever, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, which often last between one and three days, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).For more severe and potentially life-threatening infections, symptoms may include headaches, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions.Severe infections are particularly dangerous for young children, elderly people, and those with weakened immune systems. It can also lead to miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women.What To KnowThe recall, initiated on Saturday by Kent, Washington-based Western United Fish Company, follows a positive test for Listeria monocytogenes in the product's green onions.The recall affects approximately 3,315 pounds of Kirkland Signature brand Ahi Tuna Wasabi Poke packaged and sold at Costco deli sections on September 18, 2025. It has a sell by date of September 22, 2025. Impacted products were distributed across Costco Warehouses in at least 32 states, including but not limited to Alabama, Alaska, California, Florida, New York, Texas, and Washington.No illnesses have been reported in association with the product as of the recall date. Consumers who purchased the product are advised not to consume it and to return it to their local Costco for a full refund or dispose of it securely.Consumers are advised to remain vigilant for symptoms of listeriosis, such as fever, muscle aches, or gastrointestinal issues, and to seek medical attention if illness develops following consumption of the recalled product.Those with additional questions can contact Western United Fresh Co. DBA Annasea Foods Group at (425) 558-7809 during business hours or email info@annasea.com.What Happens Next?The FDA recommends continued monitoring of product recalls and encourages manufacturers to review sourcing and safety protocols. Updates on the recall will be posted to the FDA's notification channels and website.Consumers can track the status of this and any future recalls through official FDA channels.
