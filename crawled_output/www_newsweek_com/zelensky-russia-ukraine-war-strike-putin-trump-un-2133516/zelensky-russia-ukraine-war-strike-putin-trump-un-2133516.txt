WorldRussia-Ukraine WarVolodymyr ZelenskyZaporizhzhiaBreaking NewsWorld NewsNews ArticleZelensky Issues Tragic Update After Latest Russia StrikePublishedSep 22, 2025 at 03:14 AM EDTupdatedSep 22, 2025 at 04:48 AM EDTBy Robert Birsel and Shane CroucherShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of striking civilian homes with guided aerial bombs in an attack on the Zaporizhzhia region that killed at least three people.Newsweek has contacted the Kremlin via email for comment.Why It MattersThe Russian strikes on Ukraine come as President Donald Trump is showing increasing impatience with Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid attempts by the U.S. leader to find a solution to Moscow's war in Ukraine.Zelensky is expected to meet Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, where the Ukrainian leader is likely to press for greater U.S. pressure on Putin to make peace and end the war Russia started in February 2022 with its full invasion....What To KnowZelensky, in a post on X, said rescue efforts and rubble clearing were underway after a Russian strike on Zaporizhzhia."Fifteen apartment buildings and 10 private houses have been damaged. As of now, three people are confirmed killed. My condolences to their families and loved ones," Zelensky wrote."Donetsk, Dnipro, Sumy, Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Kherson regions also came under drone attacks overnight. Over 140 drones in total were launched," he said.Russia denies targeting civilian infrastructure and it, in turn, accuses Ukraine of striking civilian targets."It's for the fourth time in a row that Russia accompanies one of the world's highest-level annual diplomatic events with killings," Zelensky said, referring to world leaders gathering in New York for the U.N. General Assembly."That is precisely why it is so important for this diplomatic week to be productive."Zelensky called for "real, powerful pressure on Russia" and "new joint steps from everyone in the world who believes that international law must work again.""Action must be taken so that murder and war do not become routine."Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, accused Ukraine of using drones to "deliberately target civilian facilities and the peaceful population in Russian regions" in a statement on September 19.Last month, Trump had separate meetings with both Putin and Zelensky and he had raised the possibility of three-way talks between them, but the Kremlin leader has shown no inclination to pursue negotiations while his forces make advances on the ground and unleash airstrikes on a nightly basis.What People Are SayingUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an X post: "Europe, the United States, the G7 and the G20 countries—all who have real influence on Russia. Strong sanctions, strong political pressure, and accountability for Russia's war—all of this is needed. All of this will come. I thank everyone who is helping."What Happens NextTrump is expected to discuss a way forward on Ukraine in talks with Zelensky and European leaders in New York this week. With the Kremlin showing no real interest in talks, Ukraine and its allies will hope that the U.S. president will make good on threats to target Russian oil exports.Update 9/22/2025 4:25 a.m. ET: This article has been updated to include more information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
