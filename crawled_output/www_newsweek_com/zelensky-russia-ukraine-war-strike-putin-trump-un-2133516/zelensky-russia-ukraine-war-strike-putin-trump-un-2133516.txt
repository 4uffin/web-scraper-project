Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of striking civilian homes with guided aerial bombs in an attack on the Zaporizhzhia region that killed at least three people.Newsweek has contacted the Kremlin via email for comment.Why It MattersThe Russian strikes on Ukraine come as President Donald Trump is showing increasing impatience with Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid attempts by the U.S. leader to find a solution to Moscow's war in Ukraine.Zelensky is expected to meet Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, where the Ukrainian leader is likely to press for greater U.S. pressure on Putin to make peace and end the war Russia started in February 2022 with its full invasion.

What To KnowZelensky, in a post on X, said rescue efforts and rubble clearing were underway after a Russian strike on Zaporizhzhia."Fifteen apartment buildings and 10 private houses have been damaged. As of now, three people are confirmed killed. My condolences to their families and loved ones," Zelensky wrote."Donetsk, Dnipro, Sumy, Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Kherson regions also came under drone attacks overnight. Over 140 drones in total were launched," he said.Russia denies targeting civilian infrastructure and it, in turn, accuses Ukraine of striking civilian targets."It's for the fourth time in a row that Russia accompanies one of the world's highest-level annual diplomatic events with killings," Zelensky said, referring to world leaders gathering in New York for the U.N. General Assembly."That is precisely why it is so important for this diplomatic week to be productive."Zelensky called for "real, powerful pressure on Russia" and "new joint steps from everyone in the world who believes that international law must work again.""Action must be taken so that murder and war do not become routine."Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, accused Ukraine of using drones to "deliberately target civilian facilities and the peaceful population in Russian regions" in a statement on September 19.Last month, Trump had separate meetings with both Putin and Zelensky and he had raised the possibility of three-way talks between them, but the Kremlin leader has shown no inclination to pursue negotiations while his forces make advances on the ground and unleash airstrikes on a nightly basis.What People Are SayingUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an X post: "Europe, the United States, the G7 and the G20 countries‚Äîall who have real influence on Russia. Strong sanctions, strong political pressure, and accountability for Russia's war‚Äîall of this is needed. All of this will come. I thank everyone who is helping."What Happens NextTrump is expected to discuss a way forward on Ukraine in talks with Zelensky and European leaders in New York this week. With the Kremlin showing no real interest in talks, Ukraine and its allies will hope that the U.S. president will make good on threats to target Russian oil exports.Update 9/22/2025 4:25 a.m. ET: This article has been updated to include more information.
