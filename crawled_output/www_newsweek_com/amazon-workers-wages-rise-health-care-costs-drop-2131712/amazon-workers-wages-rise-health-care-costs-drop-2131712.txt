The website's data also shows that almost 50 percent of employees leave Amazon within a year.Amazon workers went on a series of strikes across the U.S. at the end of last year, with one on Black Friday and another in the lead-up to Christmas, over alleged labor violations, environmental harm and threats to democratic practices....What To KnowAmazon announced on Wednesday that average pay would increase this year to more than $23 per hour.Certain employees who have been with the company for a longer period of time will see increases in their wages of between $1.10 and $1.90 per hour, while other full-time employees will, on average, see annual pay go up by $1,600 per year, according to the company.Amazon's annual step plan also means that each year an employee stays with the company, their pay also increases. This year, the plan is being adjusted so that increases will be larger than seen previously.Alongside wage increases, the digital marketplace is also changing its entry-level health care plan and lowering the cost to pay $5 per week and $5 for copays, beginning in 2026.This reduces weekly contributions by 34 percent and copays by 87 percent for primary care, mental health and most non-specialist visits."These changes mean hundreds of dollars in savings each year, helping make health care more affordable for employees and their families," Amazon said in its news release.When asked whether the pay changes were influenced by Amazon workers' various strikes, company spokesperson Eileen Hards told Newsweek, "This wage increase was not based on the Teamsters."The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is a labor union that a number of Amazon workers joined forces with to strike at the end of last year."Our compensation decisions are based on regular market analysis and direct feedback from our employees. The fact is, Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting: competitive pay, health benefits on day one, and opportunities for career growth," Hards said.What People Are SayingUdit Madan, a senior vice president for Amazon Worldwide Operations, wrote in the company's release: "Fall is an exciting time across Amazon—it's the lead-up to some of our busiest shopping events, like Prime Big Deal Days and the holiday shopping season, and there's a bit of extra energy across our network. It's a time when we're reminded just how much the work that our teams do matters, because our customers are counting on us to not just deliver products they need, but to help make their holidays really special."He added: "It's also a time when we review our pay and benefits, and I get to share an update with our teammates about how we're continuing to invest in their experience and growth."The International Brotherhood of Teamsters told Newsweek: "Amazon's so-called wage increases amount to pennies on the dollar, and it's an insult to the workers who have built this 2 trillion-dollar global giant through their sweat and sacrifice. Thousands of Amazon workers are organizing with the Teamsters because they deserve lasting protections that cannot be taken away at a whim by this greedy corporation. Instead of hiding behind PR stunts while exploiting workers, Amazon must follow the law and negotiate real wage increases and protections with its Teamsters workforce."Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards told Newsweek: "The Teamsters continue to intentionally mislead the public—claiming that they represent 'thousands of Amazon employees and drivers.' They don't. What we saw in December was almost entirely outsiders—not Amazon employees or partners—and any suggestion otherwise is false. The truth is that they were unable to get enough support from our employees and partners and brought in outsiders to harass and intimidate our team, which resulted in no impact to our operations."Furthermore, our employees have the choice of whether or not to join a union. They always have. We favor opportunities for each person to be respected and valued as an individual, and to have their unique voice heard by working directly with our team. We look forward to working directly with our team to continue making Amazon a great place to work."What Happens NextAmazon's employees can expect to see their wages increase this year, with changes to health care benefits coming into effect next year.Update 9/18/25, 12:18 p.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.Update 9/19/25, 3:22 a.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from Eileen Hards.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
