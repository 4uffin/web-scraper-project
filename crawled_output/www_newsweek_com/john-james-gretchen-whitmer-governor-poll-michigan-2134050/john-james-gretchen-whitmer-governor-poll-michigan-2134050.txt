Representative John James' foray to become Michigan's next governor hit a snag with a recent straw poll placing the Republican in fourth place more than a year from the next election to replace term-limited incumbent Gretchen Whitmer.A spokesperson for James' campaign told Newsweek on Tuesday that "Michigan's primary voters are making their voices heard loud and clear, overwhelmingly supporting John James," pointing to an internal campaign poll showing the GOP congressman leading by nearly 50 points.Why It MattersJames, a businessman and military veteran, has represented Michigan's 10th congressional district since 2023 following redistricting.He has in the past set his sights on higher positions, including the U.S. Senate, but came up short in elections in 2018 and 2020, losing to Democrats Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, respectively.He announced his gubernatorial bid in April of this year but faces GOP opponents that will make this a tough primary as Republicans look to reverse course in 2026 after what will have been eight years of Whitmer.

What To KnowA straw poll surveyed about 500 registered attendees this past weekend at Mackinac Island in the northern portion of the state, as part of a biannual conference in which prospective gubernatorial candidates were able to speak with the press and potential supporters to garner name recognition.Conservative news outlet The Midwesterner conducted the poll, showing Michigan State Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt at the top of the GOP heap with 29 percent support. He was followed by former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard (23.5 percent) and former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox (18.5 percent).James was next at 14 percent. He was trailed by pastor Ralph Rebandt, a 2022 gubernatorial candidate, who received 5 percent, and activist Karla Wagner, who received less than 5 percent.James was absent from a gubernatorial forum with declared candidates and those weighing their options, according to The Detroit News. The Michigan Information & Research Service Inc., known as MIRS, reported that James and his campaign were not present to greet Republican supporters who made their way to the island for the festivities.An internal poll from James' campaign reported by The Daily Caller earlier this month showed GOP congressman leading his closest rival by nearly 50 points. The survey showed James with 55 percent compared to his challengers all in the single digits. Cox performed the best after James, coming in at 7 percent.James' straw poll numbers are also at odds with a May poll, when a Glengariff Group survey showed James as Republicans' preferred candidate for governor with 42 percent support from registered voters and 44 percent among Republicans who said they'd definitely vote in 2026, according to Michigan Advance.On the Democratic side, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson was the favorite in that Glengariff poll, receiving 59.3 percent support among registered Democratic voters and 65 percent support from definite voters.What People Are SayingJames' campaign spokesperson Hannah Osantowske in a statement to Newsweek: "Political insiders and their echo chambers, along with agenda-driven media outlets, are completely out of touch. Michigan's primary voters are making their voices heard loud and clear, overwhelmingly supporting John James, who leads the Republican primary by nearly 50 points."Representative John James, on X on Monday: "In the past 48 hours I've spoken with seven media outlets; local TV, radio and print. I've participated in three public and grassroots events in three cities on two peninsulas and still made time to take my three boys to church and call my mom on Sunday."Despite what the pundits say, know that I'll be a governor who continues to work as hard as you do!"Representative Lisa McClain, a Michigan Republican, told The Midwesterner that it was "100 percent not ideal" that James was leaving behind his district and putting it in jeopardy in what is expected to be a close midterm election next year. She later said James was "absolutely" jeopardizing GOP control by running for governor, per Michigan Advance.What Happens NextThe Republic primary in Michigan is slated for August 2026.Update, 9/23/25 at 5:33 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information and comment from James' campaign.
