NewsCharlie kirkFBIInvestigationKash PatelUtahAssassinationMoreNews ArticleFBI Investigating ‘Possibility of Accomplices’ in Kirk’s Shooting—PatelPublishedSep 21, 2025 at 05:44 PM EDTBy Hollie SilvermanDeputy Weekend EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberIn the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination earlier this month, FBI Director Kash Patel wrote in an X post on Sunday that authorities are continuing to pursue all leads—including the "possibility of accomplices."The update came the same day as Kirk's memorial service in Glendale, Arizona, which has attracted thousands of people to State Farm Stadium.When reached by email on Sunday, an FBI spokesperson told Newsweek they had nothing to add to Patel's post.Why It MattersThe high-profile investigation—unfolding against the backdrop of next year's midterm elections and heightened partisan rhetoric—has placed the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) under considerable scrutiny.Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA who was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University (UVU) on September 10, has rattled the American political landscape and intensified national conversations around political violence and the safety of prominent public figures.Officials, including President Donald Trump, have called for swift and severe penalties for those responsible, and the probe's outcome could have broad implications for legal standards regarding political assassinations and federal jurisdiction in such cases.Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in Kirk's murder, remains in custody, and has been charged with multiple felonies, including aggravated murder.Related StoriesSenator Addresses Trump’s Truth Social Post to Pam Bondi—’Happens in Iran’6 min. readCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readErika Kirk Rejects Revenge for Husband’s Killer5 min. readWhat To KnowOn Sunday, Patel wrote on X that agents are probing "the location from where the shot was taken, the possibility of accomplices, the text message confession and related conversations, Discord chats, the angle of the shot and bullet impact, how the weapon was transported, hand gestures observed as potential 'signals' near Charlie at the time of his assassination, and visitors to the alleged shooter's residence" leading up to Kirk's murder.The FBI's ongoing probe includes an analysis of internet chat logs and possible communications among Robinson and more than 20 individuals in a Discord channel. Investigators have yet to confirm whether any participants aided or conspired in Kirk's assassination.A series of published Discord messages believed to be from Robinson include one confessing to the murder.The messages, posted by journalist Ken Klippenstein on Substack, also include discussions about the 2020 presidential election and the 2019 impeachment inquiry into Trump.Patel also referenced a rumor concerning an airplane's transponder allegedly being turned off after departing near the scene of Kirk's death, clarifying that "incomplete flight data in rural areas caused the apparent gap," and that law enforcement found no evidence of deliberate transponder deactivation after interviewing the pilot and consulting the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)....What People Are SayingFBI Director Kash Patel wrote in part in a post on X Sunday: "As the Director of the FBI, I am committed to ensuring the investigation into Charlie Kirk's assassination is thorough and exhaustive, pursuing every lead to its conclusion...Some details are known today, while others are still being pursued to ensure every possibility is considered. Our primary focus is to complete this investigation and deliver justice. To protect the integrity of the investigation and subsequent prosecution, we cannot release every piece of information we have to the public right now. We will ensure every question is addressed at the appropriate moment."He added: "The entire FBI mourns the loss of Charlie Kirk. We will not rest until justice is served, and our investigation into this assassination will continue until every question is answered."President Donald Trump said in a statement following the assassination: "This is a tragedy and a disgrace. The harshest possible penalties must be applied."Vice President JD Vance said in a post on X Sunday: "Returned again to the Grand Canyon State this weekend to remember Charlie and honor his sacrifice."Utah Governor Spencer Cox during a recent press conference last week: "Social media is a cancer on our society right now, and I would encourage people to log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member. Go out and do good in the community."What Happens Next?As prosecutors continue reviewing evidence in the case, Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray announced last week that Robinson faces seven felony counts, including aggravated murder, and that the state will seek the death penalty.The FBI's investigation remains active, with efforts concentrated on analyzing digital communications and any leads regarding possible accomplices or a broader conspiracy.Members of the public with relevant tips are encouraged to contact federal authorities through official channels.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
