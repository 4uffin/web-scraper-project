Rescue and AdoptionCatsRedditAnimal RescueNews ArticleAfter Rescue From Tree, Stray Cat Follows Couple Home—They Know What To DoPublishedSep 19, 2025 at 11:21 AM EDTBy Lucy NotarantonioSenior Life and Trends ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe phrase "cat distribution system" is a popular online expression that refers to the idea that cats have a mysterious way of showing up in people's lives at just the right moment, often through chance encounters. One Reddit user recently experienced this phenomenon firsthand.The post titled, "I would like to lodge a complaint with the [cat distribution system]. Airdrop delivery got impeded by a tree and required rescue," has captivated readers with the story of an unexpected feline adoption.The woman, who goes by CleoTheDoggo on Reddit, explained: "I was on a dog walk and ran into a dude who apparently was went back to check on a tree where a cat got chased up it by his dog."She noted that the man was trying to "shake the cat out while the offending dog was running around unleashed. His plan B was to get a chainsaw and cut down the tree with cat in it."Loading reddit content...Alarmed by the man's plan, the woman offered to help. After rescuing the cat—who she believes came from a nearby stray colony—something unexpected happened.The four-month-old kitten didn't return to her feline friends."[She] started following us with the cutest meows," she wrote. "We couldn't resist that and so we took her home with us where she systematically discovered all sources of food in the apartment."The final photo shared on Reddit shows the black kitten sleeping peacefully in her new home, now shared with another cat and a dog."My dog doesn't seem to care too much though the adult cat is feeling a bit territorial so we are keeping them separated for now while we ween them into getting used to each other's presence."The adult cat is typically pretty chill so it is my hope she will eventually come around (my first time getting one cat to get used to another)," she added.How to Safely Rescue a Cat From a Tree...While the Reddit user didn't share details of the rescue technique, the Cat in a Tree Emergency Rescue website offers key advice:Be patient. Cats are skilled climbers and rarely fall. Most will come down on their own once calm, even if it takes overnight. Their claws are designed for climbing up, but descending requires backing down—a challenge for some.Don't rely on the fire department. Despite the popular image of firefighters rescuing cats, most departments won't respond to cat-in-tree calls because they need to remain available for human emergencies and may not have equipment to reach the animal. Smaller-town departments might occasionally help.Understand feline fear. Cats can become paralyzed by fear or shock, forgetting they can climb down.Leave it to the professionals. Never attempt a dangerous climb yourself. Contact a professional climber or a tree care company with experience and proper equipment.Avoid electric poles. It is illegal and dangerous to climb utility poles. Instead, call the utility company.Seek local help. If no professional climber is listed in your area, contact a local tree care company, animal shelter, or veterinarian for recommendations.Reddit ReactsThe original poster joked that the cat distribution system (CDS) "messed up," since most such "deliveries" happen on the ground. But Reddit users saw it differently."This was not a defect in the CDS Delivery System. This was, in fact, your final challenge of worthiness and problem solving," said one user."The delivery was done correctly, it was a test of your competence and dedication! Seriously, though great job," wrote another.A third chimed in: "Thank you for rescuing her! She looks very happy in the third picture, and pleased with how this all turned out."Newsweek reached out to u/CleoTheDoggo for comment.
