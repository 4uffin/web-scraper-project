NewsMapsJimmy KimmelCharlie kirkSinclair Broadcast GroupAssassinationNews ArticleMap Shows Where Jimmy Kimmel Won’t Be Aired By Sinclair Broadcast GroupPublishedSep 23, 2025 at 07:37 AM EDTupdatedSep 23, 2025 at 08:36 AM EDTBy Theo BurmanLive News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberWhile Jimmy Kimmel is set to return to his spot on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, not every broadcaster is on board with his return to the air.Sinclair Broadcast Group confirmed that its affiliate stations, which include almost 40 affiliates across the U.S., would not be showing Kimmel's return, and would instead "replace it with news programming".Why It MattersThe decision to pull Kimmel from the air came as national debate on political memorials, free-speech protections and responses to political violence followed conservative activist Charlie Kirk's September 10 assassination.Kirk, 31, was a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump and a face of MAGA for younger generations.Kirk used his social media platforms to engage with younger people and discuss topics related to the culture war, foreign policy, religion and other conservative values.What To KnowDisney announced that Kimmel would be returning to the air on Monday evening, saying in a statement that he was suspended "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country."However, Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns 39 affiliate stations across the country, said that it would continue with the block on Kimmel's show, and replace his segment tonight with other news broadcasts."Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming. Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return," the group said in a statement.Sinclair's 39 stations are stretched across 18 states and the District of Columbia, including Florida, Texas, California, Virginia and Illinois.Kimmel was taken off the air after he criticized how some Republicans reacted to Charlie Kirk's death.Kimmel alleged that conservatives were using Kirk's assassination for political advantage rather than mourning the conservative activist sincerely. Trump said Kimmel had said "a horrible thing" about Kirk and praised ABC's decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! off the air.ABC-Affiliate Stations Owned by SinclairWBMA-LD – Birmingham, ALWEAR-TV – Pensacola, FLKATV – Little Rock, ARKRCR-TV – Redding, CAKAEF-TV – Eureka, CAWJLA-TV – Washington, DCWGXA – Macon, GAWSYX – Columbus, OHWKEF – Dayton, OHKTUL – Tulsa, OKWSET-TV – Lynchburg, VAWCHS-TV – Charleston, WVWLOS – Asheville, NCWXLV-TV – Winston-Salem, NCKHGI-TV – Kearney, NEKWNB-TV – Hayes Center, NEKTXS-TV – Abilene, TXKVII-TV – Amarillo, TXKTXE-LD – San Angelo, TXWATM-TV – Altoona, PAWGTU – Traverse City, MIWTOM-TV – Cheboygan, MIWGTQ – Sault Ste.

We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday."What Happens NextKimmel is set to be back on the air Tuesday night on most stations.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
