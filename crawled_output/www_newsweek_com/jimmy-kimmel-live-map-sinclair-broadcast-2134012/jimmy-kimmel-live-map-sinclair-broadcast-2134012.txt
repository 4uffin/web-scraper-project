While Jimmy Kimmel is set to return to his spot on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, not every broadcaster is on board with his return to the air.Sinclair Broadcast Group confirmed that its affiliate stations, which include almost 40 affiliates across the U.S., would not be showing Kimmel's return, and would instead "replace it with news programming".Why It MattersThe decision to pull Kimmel from the air came as national debate on political memorials, free-speech protections and responses to political violence followed conservative activist Charlie Kirk's September 10 assassination.Kirk, 31, was a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump and a face of MAGA for younger generations.Kirk used his social media platforms to engage with younger people and discuss topics related to the culture war, foreign policy, religion and other conservative values.What To KnowDisney announced that Kimmel would be returning to the air on Monday evening, saying in a statement that he was suspended "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country."However, Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns 39 affiliate stations across the country, said that it would continue with the block on Kimmel's show, and replace his segment tonight with other news broadcasts."Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming. Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return," the group said in a statement.
Sinclair's 39 stations are stretched across 18 states and the District of Columbia, including Florida, Texas, California, Virginia and Illinois.Kimmel was taken off the air after he criticized how some Republicans reacted to Charlie Kirk's death.Kimmel alleged that conservatives were using Kirk's assassination for political advantage rather than mourning the conservative activist sincerely. Trump said Kimmel had said "a horrible thing" about Kirk and praised ABC's decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! off the air.ABC-Affiliate Stations Owned by SinclairWBMA-LD ‚Äì Birmingham, ALWEAR-TV ‚Äì Pensacola, FLKATV ‚Äì Little Rock, ARKRCR-TV ‚Äì Redding, CAKAEF-TV ‚Äì Eureka, CAWJLA-TV ‚Äì Washington, DCWGXA ‚Äì Macon, GAWSYX ‚Äì Columbus, OHWKEF ‚Äì Dayton, OHKTUL ‚Äì Tulsa, OKWSET-TV ‚Äì Lynchburg, VAWCHS-TV ‚Äì Charleston, WVWLOS ‚Äì Asheville, NCWXLV-TV ‚Äì Winston-Salem, NCKHGI-TV ‚Äì Kearney, NEKWNB-TV ‚Äì Hayes Center, NEKTXS-TV ‚Äì Abilene, TXKVII-TV ‚Äì Amarillo, TXKTXE-LD ‚Äì San Angelo, TXWATM-TV ‚Äì Altoona, PAWGTU ‚Äì Traverse City, MIWTOM-TV ‚Äì Cheboygan, MIWGTQ ‚Äì Sault Ste.

What People Are SayingThe Walt Disney Company said in a statement on Monday: "Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country."It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday."What Happens NextKimmel is set to be back on the air Tuesday night on most stations.
