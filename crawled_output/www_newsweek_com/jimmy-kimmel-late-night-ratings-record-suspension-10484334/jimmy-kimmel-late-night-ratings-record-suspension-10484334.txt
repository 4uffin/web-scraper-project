U.S.Jimmy KimmelBreaking NewsJimmy Kimmel Live!FCCABCDisneyMoreNews ArticleJimmy Kimmel Shatters His Late-Night Ratings Record in Return ShowPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 07:18 PM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 07:29 PM EDTBy Gabe WhisnantBreaking News EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberMillions of viewers tuned in Tuesday night to watch Jimmy Kimmel’s return to late-night television after a week-long suspension, propelling “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” to its highest ratings in a decade. ABC said 6.26 million people watched as the comedian mixed sincerity and humor while addressing the controversy that sidelined him and thanking fans for their support.It was the most-watched regularly scheduled episode in the show’s history, far outpacing its typical nightly average of 1.42 million viewers. Kimmel’s monologue, in which he pushed back against critics and defended political satire, also racked up nearly 26 million views across YouTube and Instagram by Wednesday afternoon.Why It MattersKimmel’s suspension and swift reinstatement put him at the center of a political storm over free expression, media independence and pressure from the Trump administration. His return quickly became a flashpoint for the broader debate about satire in American politics, with critics accusing the comedian of insensitivity and supporters saying he was unfairly targeted.The ratings surge underscores both the public appetite for late-night television when it intersects with politics and the fragility of the format in an era of cord-cutting and streaming. While traditional late-night shows have seen their audiences shrink in recent years, Kimmel’s return demonstrated that a high-profile controversy can still galvanize millions to tune in. The episode also highlighted tensions between broadcasters, regulators and politicians after federal officials hinted at possible fines for stations airing his program....What to KnowKimmel was suspended after remarks he made on Sept. 15 about the man accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk drew sharp criticism and political backlash. ABC parent company Disney reversed course six days later, bringing him back on air in what was widely viewed as an act of defiance against pressure from the Trump administration. The move also came amid a wave of subscription cancellations to Disney+ and Hulu by fans demanding his reinstatement.In his monologue, Kimmel addressed the controversy directly, telling viewers it was never his intent to make light of a young man’s murder. His voice broke as he defended satire against what he called “bullying” from the administration. He also poked fun at Disney’s business interests, jokingly reading scripted lines on how to reactivate Disney+ and Hulu accounts.Jimmy Kimmel’s 6.26 million viewers Tuesday night far exceeded the typical audience for any late-night show. In the second quarter of 2025, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert led the field with an average of about 2.42 million viewers, followed by Jimmy Kimmel Live! at 1.77 million and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon at 1.19 million. On cable, Fox News’ Gutfeld! — which has outpaced the broadcast shows in total viewership — draws roughly 2.2 million nightly viewers.Still, Kimmel's return did not reach all audiences. Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group, which together own or operate 70 ABC stations covering nearly a quarter of U.S. households, refused to air the program. That left gaps in major markets including Seattle, Nashville, Salt Lake City and Washington, D.C. Both companies said they are evaluating the future of carrying the show, while noting that episodes remain widely available through streaming.The political fallout extended to Washington. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr threatened investigations and possible license revocations for affiliates that aired the program, remarks that drew calls for his resignation from Democrats and skepticism from some Republicans. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, while not directly criticizing Carr or Trump, said government regulators should not pressure broadcasters, leaving programming decisions to networks and audiences.What People Are SayingNexstar said Wednesday that it is evaluating the status of the show, which it will continue to pre-empt on its ABC-affiliated local television stations:
"We are engaged in productive discussions with executives at The Walt Disney Company, with a focus on ensuring the program reflects and respects the diverse interests of the communities we serve."Speaking directly about Erika Kirk, Kimmel said during Tuesday's monologue that her ability to forgive the attacker is "an example we should follow.":
"If you believe in the teachings of Jesus as I do, there it was. That's it, a selfless act of grace, forgiveness from a grieving widow, that touched me deeply. And I hope it touches many and if there's anything we should take from this tragedy to carry forward, I hope it can be that and not this."What Happens NextKimmel’s future at ABC now depends as much on politics as on ratings. Disney executives are in discussions with station groups over the show’s distribution, while weighing how to balance creative independence with political and regulatory risks. For now, the network is standing by its star, pointing to the strong ratings and massive online engagement as evidence of his value to the brand.Meanwhile, Trump has continued to attack Kimmel on his Truth Social platform, calling him a partisan tool of Democrats and hinting at further action against ABC.
