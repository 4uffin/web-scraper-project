"A lion-hearted friend of Israel, he fought the lies and stood tall for Judeo-Christian civilization," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on X."I spoke to him only two weeks ago and invited him to Israel. Sadly, that visit will not take place," he added.Greene's X post comes as some prominent members on the right, including Tucker Carlson, have been discussing Kirk's relationship with Israel and the country's leaders. Carlson said on his show this week, Kirk "didn't hate Jews, he loved Jews … he loved the state of Israel, he loved going there, he did not like Bibi Netanyahu, he said that to me many times" which others like Candace Owens and Matt Gaetz, have backed.Carlson also said that Kirk felt Netanyahu was a "destructive force, he was appalled by what was happening in Gaza, he was above all resentful that he believed Netanyahu was using the United States to prosecute his wars for the benefit of his country."Greene nodded to the ongoing conversation in her X post, writing, "If you don't know who to believe, between Bibi Netanyahu (a foreign country's leader) or Charlie's personal friends Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson, I'm posting my last text message with Charlie. Believe Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson."The screenshot of the text from Kirk to Greene reads: "You should speak at Am-Fest!" in reference to Turning Point's annual AmericaFest conference, which is to be held in December."Would you want to also do a debate about aipac etc?" he asked, referring to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). "Not with me. No pressure. Well do whatever you want," he added.Greene concluded her post, writing, "Do not allow a foreign country, foreign agents, and another religion tell you about Charlie Kirk. And I hope a foreign country and foreign agents and another religion does not take over Christian Patriotic Turning Point USA."What People Are SayingIsraeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar in a September 11 X post: "Charlie Kirk was an incredible friend of Israel. Charlie represented the Judeo-Christian values that unite Israel and America."Candace Owens said in a September 16 X post: "Tucker Carlson just exposed everything Charlie was going through with his Jewish donors and what his true feelings were toward Bibi Netanyahu. Watch to comprehend how sinister the lies are the Zionist crowd is trying to tell right now. Messages exist. Stop lying."Former Representative Matt Gaetz said in an X post on Tuesday: "I have personal knowledge as to many of the claims Tucker is making here. They are 100 percent true."Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, said in an X post on Wednesday in response to Carlson's video: "I'm getting really tired of Tucker & his cronies falsely claiming 'Charlie agreed with me that Israel is terrible & the problem in America is all the damn Jews....' I knew Charlie well & indeed the very last conversation we had was how deeply concerned he was about the rising, toxic wave of antisemitism on the right."What Happens NextInvestigations into the shooting continue after 22-year-old Tyler Robinson made his first appearance in court via video link on Tuesday where prosecutors announced murder charges against him.Turning Point USA is set to hold a memorial for Kirk at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on September 21.Update 9/17/25, 11:03 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional informationUpdate 9/17/25, 12:03 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.
