PoliticsElise StefanikPollsNew York GovernorCrimeRepublicansZohran MamdaniNews ArticleElise Stefanik Gets Bad Polling News in New York Race Against Kathy HochulPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 02:06 PM EDTBy Nick MordowanecStaff WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberNew York Governor Kathy Hochul is leading potential Republican gubernatorial election challenger Representative Elise Stefanik by 25 percentage points and enjoying her highest levels of favorability since January 2024, according to a new Siena poll released Tuesday.A spokesperson for Stefanik, in remarks to Newsweek, called the poll a "fantasy" in Hochul's favor.Why It MattersHochul is New York's first female governor and vying for a second term after defeating Republican Lee Zeldin in 2022 in what was the state's narrowest gubernatorial result in nearly three decades. She rose to statewide political prominence after taking over for fellow Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo, who in 2021 resigned following sexual assault allegations.New York voters have heavily leaned Democratic in most local and statewide elections, though Republicans have made inroads due to a strong base combined with more political sway from independent voters. Stefanik, one of the GOP's highest-ranking Republicans in the House of Representatives, has represented New York's 21st congressional district since 2015. She has also chaired the House Republican Conference from 2021 to 2025.Polls highlight room for Republicans like Stefanik, or perhaps other challengers like Republican Representative Mike Lawler, to contest Hochul's reelection efforts.What To KnowBoth Hochul's job approval and favorability ratings are up from last month, according to a new Siena poll of 802 New York State registered voters conducted September 8-10. The poll has a margin of error of 4.2 percentage points....Hochul now leads Stefanik 52-27 percent in a hypothetical gubernatorial matchup, up from 45-31 percent in August. It's the first time Hochul has received support from more than 50 percent of survey respondents."[Hochul's] having a bit of a revival," Siena pollster Steven Greenberg told Newsweek via phone on Tuesday. "Her favorability is the best it's been in a year and a half. Her job approval, best it's been in 2 1/2 years. It's not major movement...but it's been a slow, steady climb."He said the 25-point differential between Hochul and Stefanik is more in line with historical trends in New York rather than what happened in 2022 in Hochul's race against Zeldin, which Greenberg said may have been the start of a Republican trend or merely a one-year anomaly.The poll found a majority or plurality of voters believe that Hochul works hard, demonstrates honesty, gets things done, provides decisive leadership, and cares about people—four categories where her numbers are up significantly from June 2024 (this is first time 'get things done' was asked)."This poll is fantasy the day after Kathy Hochul endorses the communist [New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani] and the communist refuses to endorse her," Alex DeGrasse, senior advisor to Chairwoman Stefanik, told Newsweek via email on Tuesday. "In no reality is Elise Stefanik winning only 60 percent of conservative voters."It is Kathy Hochul who is hemorrhaging support in her own party, not Elise Stefanik, who has the highest 'R' support of any 'R' in the state."DeGrasse called out Siena's historical performance, citing how in 2024 the pollster "demonstrated significant accuracy problems" by being inaccurate and presenting a bias in favor of Democrats.He also critiqued their methodology, including "bogus respondents" along with self-selection bias and demographic distortions."While Siena College polling may generate headlines, their documented methodological problems and poor 2024 performance record suggest their results should not be considered reliable indicators of actual voter sentiment in the New York gubernatorial race," DeGrasse added. "Decision-makers should prioritize polling from organizations with stronger accuracy records and more rigorous methodological standards."The poll also shows that New Yorkers believe over the last year that crime has gotten better overall, with 23 percent of voters in the new survey saying crime in the state has gotten better; 38 percent saying it's stayed about the same; and 35 percent saying it's gotten worse.That compares to just 12 percent in December 2024 saying it was better, while 54 percent said it was worse.However, 54 percent of New Yorkers today remain very or somewhat concerned they'll be a crime victim, compared to 45 percent who say they're not very or not at all concerned. That's down from December, when it was 58-41 percent.What People Are SayingT.J. McCormack, GOP communications specialist, to Newsweek: "Elise Stefanik has a GREAT chance to beat Kathy Hochul. Not only are Hochul's numbers in bad shape throughout the state, the congresswoman is vastly smarter and quicker than the dim bulb governor. After Stefanik's viral grilling of Hochul in a congressional hearing, a debate between the two would be almost unfair, but must-see viewing."Finally, given the magic number of about 30 percent in NYC that any Republican would need to win the governorship, if Zohran Mamdani's policies impact the city as many of us fear, Hochul's endorsement of the socialist could be her ultimate undoing."What Happens NextThe 2026 New York gubernatorial election is scheduled to take place on November 3, 2026"The election is, 14 months away," Greenberg said. "The primaries—if there are going to be primaries, which I assume there will be—[are] 10 months away. A lot's going to change."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
