WorldEarthquakeMexicoBreaking NewsNews ArticleMexico Rocked by Two Earthquakes Over 5.0 Magnitude: What We KnowPublishedSep 25, 2025 at 10:23 AM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 11:16 AM EDTBy Amanda CastroLive Blog EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberTwo moderate earthquakes struck off the coast of Mexico early Thursday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The first, a magnitude 5.7 quake, occurred at 10:16 a.m. UTC, followed five minutes later by a magnitude 5.1 tremor. Both were centered south-southwest of Emiliano Zapata, with depths of 10 kilometers. The USGS confirmed the events and classified them as reviewed, but no immediate reports of damage or injuries were available.Why It MattersMexico sits atop several active tectonic plates, making it one of the most seismically active regions in the world. While Thursday’s quakes were offshore and moderate in magnitude, they serve as a reminder of the region’s vulnerability to larger, more destructive seismic events....Was There an Earthquake in Mexico Today? On September 25, 2025, two earthquakes were recorded off the coast of southwestern Mexico. The first, a magnitude 5.7 quake, struck at 10:16 a.m. UTC, approximately 180 kilometers south-southwest of Emiliano Zapata. Just five minutes later, a second quake measuring 5.1 occurred 163 kilometers from the same location. Both events were shallow, with depths of 10 kilometers, and were confirmed by the USGS.The quakes occurred in a region known for its frequent seismic activity, resulting from the interaction between the Cocos and North American plates. While no damage has been reported, the USGS issued a green PAGER alert, indicating a low likelihood of casualties or economic disruption.The agency also released a ShakeMap showing estimated ground shaking intensity, which registered at level IV—light shaking. Citizen scientist contributions are being collected to help refine the impact assessment.Where Were the Earthquakes Felt?As of Thursday morning, no confirmed felt reports had been submitted to the USGS. Given the offshore location and moderate magnitude, it’s possible that the quakes were felt lightly along coastal areas of Jalisco and Colima, though this remains unverified.USGS Map Displays Location of QuakesInteractive maps published by the USGS show both earthquakes occurring in proximity to Mexico’s Pacific coast. The first quake was centered at 17.964°N, 105.802°W, and the second at 18.117°N, 105.759°W. Both locations fall within a 250-kilometer radius of Emiliano Zapata and are part of a seismically active offshore zone....What Was the Most Recent Earthquake in California? A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck near Berkeley, California, at 2:56 a.m. local time on September 22. Initially reported as a 4.6, the quake was later downgraded to a 4.5. It occurred along the Hayward fault and was widely felt across the San Francisco Bay Area, from Santa Rosa to Stockton.Despite waking many residents, the quake caused no significant damage or injuries. The Hayward fault is one of the most closely monitored in California due to its proximity to dense urban centers.
