Moved by what had happened, they decided to create a cage to protect the turtle's nest until a hatch arrives. That moment came on September 20, a photo of which was shared to the platform in the post."78 days ago, an Eastern box turtle dug a hole and laid her eggs in our garden," the post read. "I made a cage to protect the nest, and last night, we had a hatch!"The Reddit user, who goes by u/Sea_Ganache620 on the platform, had uploaded several images showing both the small cage and a tiny hatchling that was later born in it. The post has been upvoted more than 41,000 times to date, moving viewers and sparking widespread intrigue.The Eastern box turtle is a small, land-dwelling turtle native to the eastern U.S.It has a high-domed, hinged shell that allows it to completely close itself inside for protection, a trait that distinguishes it from many other turtle species.Their shells are usually brown or black with bright yellow, orange, or reddish patterns, giving each turtle a unique appearance. Eastern box turtles live in forests, meadows, and marshy areas, where they feed on a varied diet of insects, worms, fruits, fungi, and leafy vegetation, which could have led this particular turtle to the Reddit user's garden.Eastern box turtles are slow to mature and can live for several decades, sometimes over 50 years.Viewers on the platform were quick to share their delight at the surprise scene in the garden."The turtle shaped protection dome is adorable," one viewer said, adding in capital letters: "ADORABLE!""Oh my gosh, I didn't realize at first that it was turtle shaped," another poster added. "I was just like 'oh, OP [original poster] repurposed some kind of decorative wood thing they had lying around, good idea.' SO CUTE.""I'm guessing this isn't the first or last time turtles laid eggs in their garden," a third viewer shared, to which the Reddit user responded: "I wouldn't have known mama made a nest if I hadn't seen her doing it. She covered it up so well afterward, that I had to look at the pictures I took, to know where to put the cage. This is a first for me, and even if it never happens again, that cage will make a nice piece of folk art to hang on the patio wall, with a story behind it!"Newsweek reached out to u/sea_ganache620 for more information via Reddit....Do you have any funny or adorable videos or pictures that you want to share?
