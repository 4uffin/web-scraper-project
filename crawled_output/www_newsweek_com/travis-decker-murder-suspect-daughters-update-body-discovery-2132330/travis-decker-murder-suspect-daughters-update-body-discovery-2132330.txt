U.S.CrimeTrue CrimeWashingtonPoliceManhuntNews ArticleTravis Decker Update: Human Remains Discovered Believed To Be Murder SuspectPublishedSep 19, 2025 at 06:15 AM EDTBy Daniel OrtonEditor, Live NewsShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberHuman remains believed to be those of Travis Decker were found in a remote wooded area south of Leavenworth, Washington, officials said, and the scene was being processed by local and state crime-scene teams while DNA analysis was planned to confirm identity.Why It MattersMore than three months ago, the bodies of Decker's three young daughters were found near the Rock Island Campground and after a multi-agency search for the 32-year-old who had been charged with first-degree murder and kidnapping. Authorities described the findings as preliminary and said identification would rely on forensic testing, a step that determines whether charges or other legal steps change as the investigation continues....What To KnowThe Chelan County Sheriff's Office said it was processing the site with help from the Washington State Patrol crime scene response team; DNA testing will follow to confirm identity.The three children—Paityn, 9; Evelyn, 8; and Olivia, 5—were reported missing on May 30 after they did not return from a scheduled visit with their father. Their bodies were discovered June 2 near the Rock Island Campground; a Chelan County medical examiner determined the cause of death to be suffocation and the manner of death to be homicide, and investigators reported that the girls had been bound with zip ties and had plastic bags placed over their heads.More than 100 personnel from state and federal agencies searched hundreds of square miles by land, water and air; the U.S. Marshals Service offered a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to Decker's capture.What People Are SayingThe Chelan County Sheriff's Office said in its statement: "While positive identification has not yet been confirmed, preliminary findings suggest the remains belong to Travis Decker."Arianna Cozart, attorney for the girls' mother and Decker's ex-wife Whitney Decker, told ABC News: "We are praying that the remains found are confirmed to be Travis's. We continue to be grateful for law enforcement's efforts in this case and are forever appreciative of the world's love, compassion, and support for Whitney."What Happens NextInvestigators will complete on-scene evidence processing, then submit samples for DNA testing to attempt positive identification. If laboratory testing confirms the remains are Decker's, prosecutors and investigators will determine whether to change the status of outstanding charges (which include first-degree murder and kidnapping) or to close active aspects of the search. Agencies involved in the search said they will release additional information as forensic and investigative steps conclude.This article contains reporting by The Associated PressRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
