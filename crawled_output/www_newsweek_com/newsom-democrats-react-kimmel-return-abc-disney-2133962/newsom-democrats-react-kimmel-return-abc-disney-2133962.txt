Some took shots at Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr, who publicly warned that broadcasters airing content like Kimmel's could face regulatory review, a statement critics argued was intended to pressure networks into compliance.Why It MattersThe decision to pull Kimmel from the air came as national debate on political memorials, free-speech protections and responses to political violence followed conservative activist Charlie Kirk's September 10 assassination.Kirk, 31, was a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump and a face of MAGA for younger generations. Kirk utilized his social media platforms to engage with younger people and discuss topics related to the culture war, foreign policy, religion and other conservative values.Other broadcasters like Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar Media Group pulled the plug on Kimmel's Jimmy Kimmel Live!, as the companies own many ABC local affiliates. The broadcasters have not commented on Disney's decision to reinstate Kimmel as of Monday evening.What To KnowNewsom posted to X on Monday in reaction to the move, "Thank you to everyone but @BrendanCarrFCC.
