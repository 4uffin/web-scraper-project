Democrats, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, reacted to the news Monday afternoon that Jimmy Kimmel is being reinstated to host his ABC late-night show. Some took shots at Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr, who publicly warned that broadcasters airing content like Kimmel's could face regulatory review, a statement critics argued was intended to pressure networks into compliance.Why It MattersThe decision to pull Kimmel from the air came as national debate on political memorials, free-speech protections and responses to political violence followed conservative activist Charlie Kirk's September 10 assassination.Kirk, 31, was a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump and a face of MAGA for younger generations. Kirk utilized his social media platforms to engage with younger people and discuss topics related to the culture war, foreign policy, religion and other conservative values.Other broadcasters like Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar Media Group pulled the plug on Kimmel's Jimmy Kimmel Live!, as the companies own many ABC local affiliates. The broadcasters have not commented on Disney's decision to reinstate Kimmel as of Monday evening.What To KnowNewsom posted to X on Monday in reaction to the move, "Thank you to everyone but @BrendanCarrFCC. This is a win for free speech everywhere."Democratic influencer Harry Sisson wrote on X, "BREAKING: Jimmy Kimmel's show will return on September 23rd! Disney and ABC were terrified of the boycotts and they caved to the people. Your voice is effective. Huge win!"He said in a separate post, "MAGA is in total shambles over Jimmy Kimmel getting reinstated. The boycotts worked and they hate it!"Chris Jackson, a Democratic Party activist, posted, "Kimmel is back! Cry more, Donald! He said in a separate post, "Let this be a warning to every spineless executive thinking about caving to MAGA threats: the other side pays your salaries too‚Äîif not more. Don't forget who's really keeping your lights on."Jon Favreau, co-host of Pod Save America and ex-speechwriter for former President Barack Obama, said on X, "Eat [expletive], @BrendanCarrFCC."Trump has yet to publicly comment on Disney's pivot.

What People Are SayingDemocratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, on X Monday: "This is big: Jimmy Kimmel is coming back! This is about fighting for free speech and against these abuses by Donald Trump and Brendan Carr."Illinois Democratic Governor JB Pritzker, on X Monday: "'Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear. Remember that.' Looking forward to seeing Jimmy back on the air."Ellen DeGeneres, on Instagram Monday: "Cannot wait to hear @JimmyKimmel's monologue tomorrow."David Hogg, on X Monday: "HES BACK!"Democratic Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota, on X Monday: "FREE SPEECH WINS ü¶Öüá∫üá∏"Steve Krakauer, executive producer of The Megyn Kelly Show, on X Monday: "Jimmy Kimmel getting a four-show vacation completely ruins the whole 'fascism' narrative. Don't think authoritarian regimes allow dissidents back on the air because some celebs signed a strongly-worded letter!"What Happens NextKimmel is set to be back on the air Tuesday night.Update 9/22/25, 5:53 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.
