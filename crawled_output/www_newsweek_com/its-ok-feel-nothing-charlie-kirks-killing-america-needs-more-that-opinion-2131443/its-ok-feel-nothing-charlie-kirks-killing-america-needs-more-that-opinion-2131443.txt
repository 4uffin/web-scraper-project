America Needs More Than That | OpinionPublishedSep 19, 2025 at 06:30 AM EDTBy Stephen Kentlibertarian commentatorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberI didn't much care for Charlie Kirk. In the nexus of conservative talkers and campus warriors, Kirk was never at the top of my list. I've always enjoyed the motormouthed takedowns of Ben Shapiro, the soothing theology of Ross Douthat, and the tin foil hat takes of Tucker Carlson. If there's time in a day for Glenn Beck or Brett Cooper, I spread the love, but Kirk wasn't my thing.After graduating college in 2014, and starting work as a grassroots organizer for a conservative nonprofit, Turning Point USA was our competition on campus for young people interested in free speech, lower taxes, and entitlement reform. Kirk's TPUSA outperformed us everywhere. Their message was better, and Kirk's presence was massive....When news broke on X on September 10, 2025, of Kirk being shot in the throat on the campus of Utah Valley University, I made the mistake of watching the most up-close video circulating online. Verification was important to me.What I didn't expect, as someone who knew plenty about Kirk but felt entirely neutral about his "Prove Me Wrong" booth schtick and the viral videos, was that I'd break down into tears at my desk. The feeling was overwhelming.Feelings are not voluntary; they visit you like uninvited house guests wearing masks, often not revealing their true nature until you sit with and interrogate them.For all of our "friends" and acquaintances collected on social media, moments of national horror present a pressure to react. No one person enforces that we all post our thoughts on mass shootings, floods, or political assassinations, but social media's hive mind creates a culture of "personal press releases" being the norm. Comedian Ryan Long demonstrated this with almost embarrassing clarity.There is a reason we joke about how a celebrity's "silence is deafening." When Taylor Swift fails to post enough online about Gaza or alt-right memes, it's taken as an endorsement. So we post, and then wonder about our friends who are quiet.Charlie Kirk wasn't a fan of "empathy." To him, it was "new age" and inherently disingenuous to pretend publicly that you always feel what other people are feeling. Kirk was right. We don't. It's a worthy aim, but inevitably selective, as Bluesky has illustrated for the world to see after Kirk's murder.YouGov reconfirmed what polling has long shown, which is that liberals are four times more likely to defend expressions of joy over the deaths of political enemies—"16% of liberals say this is usually or always acceptable" versus only "4% of conservatives." Small numbers overall, but enough to incense the country.Empathy in the civic realm links feeling with virtue, and it's not helpful. More than ever, we need a nation of virtue, not a republic of feelings.Years of overexposure to injustice, snuff content, and tragedy has led us all to build walls to protect ourselves from the world's pain. Countless Americans are convinced that if they don't feel anything substantial after learning of a controversial person's murder, that nothing immoral has occurred.Emotivism is substituting for moral judgment on politics."Moral violation scenarios require a high level of cognitive and emotional processing, as well as an evaluation of standards of right and wrong," said Morteza Dehghani, assistant professor of psychology at the University of Southern California, about USC's study on conservatives and liberals' physical reactions to moral outrage."Standards" is an important word choice here. USC's research showed that liberals' cues for moral injury manifested in the crotch area, chest, and a bit in the head. Conservatives showed violation almost exclusively in their heads.Our body, mind, and spirit speak to one another.C.S. Lewis asserted in The Abolition of Man that modernity was churning out "men without chests" to describe a mediating force between the head's reason and the appetite or emotions of the gut.What we end up with is what you see in America on TV and social media: equivocation about murder and resentment that our neighbors had nothing to say about the bad things from a week ago.Our emotions aren't enough. A mediating force benefits everyone in a diverse country, and they may well be "standards" that were handed to us like an onboarding packet at a new job.Charlie Kirk's assassination isn't wrong because you knew him, or identified with his ideas, or you saw it happen—it's wrong because at some point you decided it's wrong. You can't have a country if 50 percent or more of the population considers murder by sniper rifle to be just deserts for rejecting Juneteenth as an American holiday.I wept for Charlie Kirk for reasons I don't fully understand. Perhaps it's because of how strongly I've always admired his courage in facing down the campus progressives I was too scared to debate in my 20s. Maybe it marks the end of conservative intellectual resistance on campuses.Regardless, it was wrong. If you don't know what to say without equivocating, say that.You can choose to live within the guardrails imposed by people who came before you. You can choose to color within the lines because you recognize, as Ben Shapiro said to Bill Maher this weekend on Biblical morality, "That you were born morally on third base."Stephen Kent is a conservative political writer and host of Geeky Stoics on YouTube and Substack.
