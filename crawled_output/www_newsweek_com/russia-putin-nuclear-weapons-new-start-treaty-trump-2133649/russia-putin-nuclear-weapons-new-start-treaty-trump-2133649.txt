Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would uphold the restrictions on nuclear weapons agreed under the New START Treaty with the U.S. for one year after it expires in February 2026.Newsweek has contacted the State Department for comment.Putin, speaking in Russian in comments broadcast live from a meeting of the Kremlin's Security Council on Monday, warned that its lapsing means the "imminent disappearance of the last international agreement on direct limitations of missile-nuclear potential."The erosion of arms control agreements raises the risk of a nuclear war at a time when tensions between NATO and Russia escalate over Ukraine and a series of alleged airspace violations by Russian military aircraft, including those of allies Estonia and Poland.Putin: New START Rejection 'Shortsighted'Russia suspended the New START Treaty in February 2023 after the U.S. accused Moscow of being in violation of it, in particular Moscow's alleged failure to uphold the mutual monitoring elements of the agreement around inspections."A complete rejection of the legacy of this treaty would, in many respects, be a mistaken and shortsighted step‚Äîone that, in our opinion, would also negatively affect the objectives of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons," Putin said."To avoid provoking a further arms race, and to ensure an acceptable level of predictability and restraint, we consider it justified to attempt to preserve, at this turbulent stage, the framework that has been established thanks to New START."The Kremlin has described NATO as at war with Russia, though neither side has declared war against the other. Russia has also said NATO allies have not provided evidence that it committed airspace violations.

Nuclear Arms Treaty SuspensionThe New START, signed by then-Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.Its looming expiration and the lack of dialogue on anchoring a successor deal have worried arms control advocates.The agreement envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance, but they have been dormant since 2020.In February 2023, Putin suspended Moscow's participation in the treaty, saying Russia could not allow U.S. inspections of its nuclear sites at a time when Washington and its NATO allies have openly declared Moscow's defeat in Ukraine as their goal.Moscow has emphasized, however, that it wasn't withdrawing from the pact altogether and would continue to respect the caps on nuclear weapons the treaty set.Updated, 9/22/25, 9:28 a.m. ET: This article was updated with more information.This article includes reporting by The Associated Press.
