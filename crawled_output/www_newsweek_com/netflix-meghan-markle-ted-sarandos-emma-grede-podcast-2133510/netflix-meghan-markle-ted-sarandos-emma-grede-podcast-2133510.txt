Meghan Markle has "remarkable influence" and the original Netflix biopic with Prince Harry was "successful in every measure," according to the streaming giant's chief executive.Ted Sarandos heaped praise on the Duchess of Sussex despite a lukewarm response to her latest release, Season 2 of cooking show With Love, Meghan.Why It MattersHis comments, on the Aspire with Emma Grede podcast, are the first he has made after Meghan and Prince Harry signed a hotly debated new Netflix deal.They also follow With Love's Season 2's failure to breach the top on Netflix globally, or in the U.S. or U.K.
Meghan Markle smiles as she films the second season of her Netflix cooking show 'With Love, Meghan,' released in August 2025.

What To KnowSarandos praised Meghan's ability to sell out consumer goods featured in her shows, which is particularly relevant because With Love is paired with her online shop As Ever. The store sells produce and wine and Netflix is an equity partner, meaning it profits when she profits.He said: "One thing we learned early with Meghan... she has remarkable influence‚Äîremarkable."So when we did the documentary on her and Harry, the trailer, when we ran the trailer announcing it, people... hundreds of people... broke down every frame of the trailer.""The $20 shoes that she got from ... a village that was making these shoes sold out all over the world," he said."And the $1,500 blanket that was on the chair sold out all over the world. She has incredible power and influence. So that for me, it's like okay well how can we enable this to be a more holistic thing. So that's what that relationship is about."The documentary Sarandos mentioned was the original biopic Harry and Meghan, which launched in two parts, spanning six episodes in December 2022."And by the way, the documentary itself," Sarandos added, "was also one of the most watched documentaries we've ever had."So it was very it was successful in every measure. Now I don't think that you can have a consumer products business if you don't have a great entertainment business. So that's got to come first."The Significance of Sarandos' Renewed SupportThe Netflix chief executive has made similar comments endorsing Meghan before, to Variety in March, just after season one of the show was released.However, much has changed since then. Season one was pummelled by reviewers and mocked on social media but did secure a spot in the Netflix top ten, whereas season two did not.Also, after his original comments As Ever, her online store, launched but sold out of produce in minutes, on two separate product releases months apart.While that may sound like a good thing, experts told Newsweek it can be frustrating for fans if they are unable to buy any produce.Since then, her supply chain has stabilized and there have been products, including both wine and food, on sale consistently in September.A Sussex source told Newsweek: "The company continues to go from strength to strength. The huge demand right from the outset maybe caught us a little off-guard, but it's testament to the support she has and the quality of the product being made."There's still work to be done in ensuring the supply can meet the demand, but one thing the Duchess has been clear on since the very start, she won't compromise on the quality, just to increase availability."
Meghan and Harry also signed a new Netflix deal in August on less favorable terms than their original 2020 five year deal.The new contract is a "first look deal" which continues the partnership but without guaranteeing the couple the sky-high sums they were promised first time around.Some sought to frame the change as a blow to the Sussexes while experts told Newsweek it was a sensible move for them.Either way, Sarandos' latest endorsement is a key sign he still backs her despite the rollercoaster ride her brand has experienced in the past six month.What People Are SayingSarandos told Grede about Netflix's relevance: "Yeah, look, I think what we have is cultural relevance. YouTube does too but I would say that we have cultural relevance in a way that most outlets do not."When you go to a dinner party and someone says, 'Oh my god, did you see?' the chances are they have Netflix and they can go home and push play and watch it. That's a very big thing."Grede agreed that Meghan's influence was "remarkable" and added that "we're seeing this on a on a micro level right now."What Happens NextMeghan is preparing to drop a holiday special of With Love, Meghan in December.Do you have a question about King Charles III and Queen Camilla, Prince William and Princess Kate, Meghan and Harry, or their family that you would like our experienced royal correspondents to answer?
