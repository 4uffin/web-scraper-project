Kim's government says the weapons are for self-defense, blaming "provocative" military cooperation between the United States and its treaty allies South Korea and Japan.Newsweek reached out to the North Korean embassy in Beijing, China, and to the White House via emailed requests for comment.What To KnowKim told North Korea's lawmakers that the nation was "making unremitting leaps and bounds in strengthening the country's defense capability.""We have acquired new secret weapons and achieved considerable results in defense science and research that will greatly contribute to a further radical leap forward in our military capabilities," he said, according to a transcript published on Monday by the state-run Korean Central News Agency.Kim did not offer details about these new weapons. He also praised progress in modernizing North Korea's modest navy, calling the launch of two destroyers this year a "major step" toward becoming a maritime power....Kim accused the U.S. and its allies of "adventurous" military actions that have raised the risk of nuclear confrontation, calling the security situation "more severe than ever."He used the occasion to double down on nuclear and missile development and dismissed denuclearization efforts, vowing they would not succeed "even after 100 years."However, Kim said North Korea was prepared to pursue "peaceful coexistence" with the U.S. if it dropped what he called its "absurd obsession with denuclearization."As Pyongyang continues to expand both its nuclear and conventional arsenals, U.S. and allied officials believe North Korea has acquired advanced Russian military technology in exchange for supplying munitions and troops for Russia's war in Ukraine.South Korean officials have cited intelligence that Russia, which signed a new military agreement with North Korea last year, has agreed to provide Pyongyang with fighter jets and nuclear submarine technology.Kim's comments come as South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung expressed willingness to accept a deal that would allow the North to temporarily freeze its nuclear program rather than immediately start the denuclearization process.What People Have SaidLee Jae Myung, South Korean president, told the BBC: "The question is whether to insist on the fruitless final goal [denuclearization], or to set a more realistic goal and achieve at least part of it."U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters last month: "I get along with him really well. I look forward to meeting with Kim Jong Un in the appropriate future."What's NextU.S. President Donald Trump, who met with Kim three times during his first term in a failed push for denuclearization, has said he is open to another summit with the 41-year-old leader.It remains unclear whether Trump will reconsider Washington's longstanding demand for denuclearization, however.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
