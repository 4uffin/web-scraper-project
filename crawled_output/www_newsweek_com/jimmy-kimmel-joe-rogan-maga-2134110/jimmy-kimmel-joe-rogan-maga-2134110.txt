U.S.Jimmy KimmelJoe RoganMagaCharlie kirkFree speechNews ArticleJoe Rogan Issues Warning to MAGA Over Jimmy Kimmel DramaPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 07:27 AM EDTBy Kate PlummerSenior US News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberJoe Rogan has issued a free speech warning to MAGA over Jimmy Kimmel's TV suspension.Speaking on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, the comedian reacted to the ongoing controversy surrounding Kimmel, who was suspended from Jimmy Kimmel Live! over comments he made about the Make America Great Again movement's response to the death of Charlie Kirk.Rogan, who has been influential in American politics because of his large listener base—which exceeds 20.2 million subscribers on YouTube alone—said that if Kimmel could be canceled, right-wing figures could be too.Why It MattersKimmel returned to air on Tuesday after a weeklong suspension from ABC over a monologue he made in the wake of Kirk's killing. "The MAGA gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it," Kimmel said.The comedian's suspension sparked a debate about the line between free speech and hate speech. While some right-wing figures celebrated Kimmel's removal, others questioned whether the right was embracing cancel culture, something Kirk spoke out against....What To KnowSpeaking with guest Andrew Santino on Tuesday's episode of his podcast, Rogan said: "I definitely don't think that the government should be involved ever in dictating what a comedian can and cannot say in a monologue. That's f*****g crazy."He added that people on the right who celebrated companies such as ABC "being pressured by the government" were "crazy" for doing so."You're crazy for supporting this because this will be used on you," Rogan said. "You don't think that that the f*****g globalist lizard people who run the world are sitting here going: 'Great. What do we got? Three years. We'll wait this out. We'll wait this out. Yeah, let 'em say the government should be involved in censoring people's speech.'"What People Are SayingLate-night host Seth Meyers said on his NBC show on Monday: "It is possible to stand up to this kind of bullying and censorship. For example, Trump tried to sue The New York Times, and that suit has already been thrown out. And minutes before we started taping, we got word that our friend Jimmy Kimmel will be back on the air tomorrow."Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote on X: "For everyone who spoke up and said Trump's censorship of Kimmel is wrong, your voice mattered."President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: "I can't believe ABC Fake News gave Jimmy Kimmel his job back. The White House was told by ABC that his Show was cancelled! Something happened between then and now because his audience is GONE, and his 'talent' was never there. Why would they want someone back who does so poorly, who's not funny, and who puts the Network in jeopardy by playing 99 percent positive Democrat GARBAGE."What Happens NextWhile Kimmel's show has returned, Sinclair and Nexstar, which own dozens of ABC affiliates, continue to block it from airing locally.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
