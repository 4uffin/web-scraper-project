Kimmel had criticized MAGA figures for politicizing Kirk's death, prompting outrage from conservative activists.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has suggested that networks regularly criticize him should potentially have their licenses taken away. "They're 97% against, they give me wholly bad publicity... I mean, they're getting a license, I would think maybe their license should be taken away" Trump told reporters on Thursday. "When you have a network and you have evening shows and all they do is hit Trump...They're not allowed to do that."What to Know:ABC and parent company Disney also faced pressure from Sinclair and Nexstar, owners of more than 60 local ABC stations, who said they were planning to "indefinitely preempt" Jimmy Kimmel Live! after Carr's comments, according to the Wall Street Journal.Nexstar Media Group has a pending $6.2 billion merger with Tegna, which is subject to FCC approval—raising questions about whether corporate and regulatory pressures influenced the network's response.The suspension came amid calls from Carr for broadcasters to take action against what he called "garbage," and was swiftly praised by President Donald Trump.Now, major Hollywood unions and progressive groups are pushing back, accusing ABC and its affiliates of censorship and demanding a boycott of Disney properties.After years of progressive-led cancellations targeting conservative voices, the tables have turned, marking a significant moment in the culture wars.Newsweek's live blog is closed.Sep 18, 2025 at 08:04 PM EDTKimmel had been set to address FCC chair’s comments on Wednesday showJimmy Kimmel had been preparing to address Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr's criticisms on his Wednesday show, before he was suspended, the Wall Street Journal reports.Sinclair and Nexstar, owners of more than 60 local ABC stations, had told ABC that they were planning to "indefinitely preempt" Jimmy Kimmel Live! in the wake of Carr's comments - starting immediately. Their decision would have severely effected the late-night show's audience figures.Kimmel was planning to address Carr's comments head-on during his Wednesday show, by saying that his words were being twisted by members of MAGA, the Journal reports.Co-chairman of Disney Entertainment, Dana Walden, spoke with Kimmel about his planned speech, before he was due to go on-air on Wednesday, but she left their discussion concerned the approach could further inflame the situation, sources told the newspaper. There were also reported concerns that Kimmel show staff were being doxed and threatened after Carr's remarks.Walden spoke with her team and Disney CEO Bob Iger before coming to the decision to take Kimmel's show off the air on a temporary basis, the Journal reported.

Robert Garcia and Maxwell Frost wrote to ABC, Sinclair, and the Trump Administration on Thursday demanding answers after the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel.The lawmakers also wrote to the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) accusing it of weaponizing its federal regulatory authority."This action should serve as a warning to all Americans—the Constitution's right to free speech is under attack by the Trump Administration," they said in their joint letter to the FCC. This corrupt political intimidation is unacceptable... and ABC's preemption of programming that may be critical of President Trump represents a dangerous escalation in attacks on press freedom and protected speech."On Thursday, Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer agreed to work in a bipartisan manner to bring FCC Chair Brandon Carr before the Committee to face questions the move."We can all agree that what happened to Charlie Kirk was horrific and that we must condemn all political violence. But recent threats from this Administration are an attack on the media and the First Amendment," said Rep. Garcia, Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. "This Administration has shown that it will target critics and threaten their platforms simply because they disagree with them."Let me be clear: Americans will not be silenced. The right to free speech is sacred in this country, and we must defend it at all costs," said Ranking Member Robert GarciaRep. Frost, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs, added, "The suspension of Jimmy Kimmel is illegal government censorship and the work of a corrupt coalition championed by President Trump, that silences opposition in exchange for corporate profits."FCC Chair Brendan Carr, at the direction of Donald Trump, is manipulating companies in order to attack our First Amendment rights and must be held accountable. Nexstar has the ability to resist this pressure, but they decided to protect their potential merger and profits rather than protecting their right to deliver content free from government influence."Sep 18, 2025 at 07:02 PM EDTJimmy Kimmel spotted driving to what appeared to be lawyer’s office: ReportJimmy Kimmel was seen leaving his Los Angeles home, after being suspended by ABC on Wednesday.The Jimmy Kimmel Live! host was seen driving to what appeared to be a lawyer's office, according to the New York Post.Kimmel, 57, pulled at a Century City complex, in L.A., that houses multiple law firms on Thursday afternoon, the Post reports.He declined to make any comment on his recent suspension.Sep 18, 2025 at 06:47 PM EDTTucker Carlson urges ‘civil disobedience’ if Trump DOJ targets hate speechTucker Carlson warned in a special episode of his show on Tuesday that "civil disobedience" could erupt should the Trump administration and other "bad actors" use Charlie Kirk's death as a means to attack free speech.Carlson opened Wednesday's episode of The Tucker Carlson Show, a tribute to Kirk called "America After Charlie Kirk," featuring conservative and liberal guests, including Megyn Kelly and Cenk Uygur, with a near 35-minute introduction about the former conservative commentator's legacy and how free speech is essentially more vital than ever."Consider what it means if you don't respect free speech, which is another way of saying free conscience—the right of other people to make up their own minds about the basic questions of what is right or wrong, and to express their views on those issues," Carlson said."If you don't respect the right of other people to do that, and if you take steps to prevent them from doing that, what are you really saying? You're saying, "I don't think you have a soul. You're a meat puppet I can control. I think you're an animal, maybe a sub-animal. You're a slave.'"Read in full from Nick Mordowanec on Newsweek. Sep 18, 2025 at 06:36 PM EDTJD Vance’s past remarks on free speech resurface as Kimmel pulled off airA February video clip of U.S. President JD Vance promising a more transparent presidential administration devoid of free speech repercussions has resurfaced in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's killing, ABC's suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel and the Trump administration's guidance to clamp down on "hate speech."Vance, the former senator from Ohio, promised during remarks on February 14 at the Munich Security Conference that the current rendition of the Trump administration would be more pro-free speech than the previous Biden administration."Our own government encouraged private companies to silence people who dared to utter what turned out to be an obvious truth," Vance said. "So, I come here today not just with an observation but with an offer. And just as the Biden administration seemed desperate to silence people for speaking their minds, so the Trump administration will do precisely the opposite; and I hope that we can work together on that."In Washington, there is a new sheriff in town; and under Donald Trump's leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square, agree or disagree."Vance also said in Munich that he feared free speech in Great Britain and across Europe "is in retreat," adding that allowing citizens to speak freely would make them "stronger."Loading twitter content...Sep 18, 2025 at 06:21 PM EDT‘If this was the last word, I’m glad it was mine,’ says Kimmel’s final musical guestLoading twitter content...Sep 18, 2025 at 06:04 PM EDTProtesters gather outside Disney studioProtesters gathered outside the Disney studio in Burbank, California, on Thursday in the wake of ABC's decision to take Jimmy Kimmel Live! off air.Many of the demonstrators told CNN that they had already canceled their Disney+ subscriptions in protest against the move.Actor Jake Ferree, who was holding a sign that read "Disney stop bowing to a dictator," told CNN, "This affects every aspect of free speech."We should be able to express ourselves. That's the point of art."Film production accountant Taylor Smith said she hopes that this "wakes people up" as she warned that the implications were bigger that just Kimmel.It's "about our rights being taken away from us in real time," she said.Sep 18, 2025 at 05:49 PM EDTKimmel sent his ‘love to the Kirk’s immediately after shootingOn the day of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Jimmy Kimmel shared a message, sending his "love" to the commentator's family and urging people to agree that it was "monstrous" to shoot another person."Instead of the angry finger pointing can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human? On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence," he wrote on Instagram within hours of the shooting.Kimmel was suspended for his comments about Kirk's death, that he made on Monday.While he never criticized Kirk or made light of his death, he did accuse Trump supporters of attempting to capitalize on the murder and distance themselves from the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson."We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it," Kimmel said.Kimmel mocked President Trump's seemingly uninvolved response to a reporter's question on Kirk's death.A post shared by instagramSep 18, 2025 at 05:26 PM EDTWhy was Jimmy Kimmel’s show suspended?ABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show off the air after comments the comedian made about the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk, and following pressure from the network's affiliates as well as the nation's TV regulator."Jimmy Kimmel Live will be preempted indefinitely," a spokesperson for the Disney-owned broadcaster said in a statement shared with various news outlets on Wednesday.The move has drawn praise from allies and supporters of President Donald Trump, but sparked condemnation from Democratic lawmakers and free expression advocates.The context of Kimmel's cancellation has led to allegations that business interests—particularly those concerning a delicate merger approval process involving the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and ABC affiliate Nexstar—may have played a role.Taken together, some have interpreted this as a form of indirect censorship of the political Left by the Trump administration. Similar concerns were raised following the recent cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."First Colbert, now Kimmel. Last-minute settlements, secret side deals, multi-billion dollar mergers pending Donald Trump's approval," said Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren. "Trump silencing free speech stifles our democracy."Newsweek has contacted ABC, Nexstar and the FCC via email for comment.Read in full from Hugh Cameron on Newsweek.

"Under current law, the FCC has no authority to cancel or suspend programming," Segal noted. "ABC clearly succumbed to political pressure."Segal, author of The Crisis Casebook, said the move has sent "a chill throughout corporate America and in many board rooms," warning that if criticism of figures like Charlie Kirk is off-limits today, "there is no way to know what topics may be on the chopping block tomorrow."He urged companies to audit their internal policies around employee speech and prepare for worst-case scenarios. "Other networks and platforms should think through their responses now," he said. "If they do not have plans, they should prepare them ASAP."Segal also cautioned against overreacting or underreacting to politically motivated pressure campaigns, saying both can escalate reputational damage. "Companies are now all walking a political tightrope," he said.Asked whether a chilling effect is already underway, Segal was blunt: "We are already seeing it." His advice to boards and executives: "Plan, prepare, and practice. One false or poorly considered move, and they could crash."Sep 18, 2025 at 03:46 PM EDTLate-night shakeups threaten network loyalty, consumer trustWith Jimmy Kimmel Live! suspended and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert canceled as of May 2026, the late-night landscape is undergoing a seismic shift—and networks may face serious fallout. New data from consumer intelligence firm Resonate reveals that both hosts commanded deeply engaged, brand-loyal audiences whose absence could disrupt advertiser strategy and viewer retention.Kimmel's 7.1 million U.S. viewers are politically distinct: 58% oppose Trump's policies, and only 10% favor brands aligned with Republican positions. These viewers are 2.5 times more likely than average to watch ABC, with 74% tuning in regularly. Their habits are consistent—75% watch comedy, 73% follow news—and their motivations are rooted in optimism and authenticity.Colbert's 5.3 million fans show similar traits. They value trust and positivity, with 60% driven by a desire to be trusted. Like Kimmel's audience, they skew older and affluent: 54% are 55+, and 55% earn over $75K annually.Both groups represent a prime advertising demographic—balanced, loyal, and politically aware. Their displacement raises questions about how networks will retain engagement and whether advertisers will recalibrate in response to shifting media dynamics.Sep 18, 2025 at 03:33 PM EDTStephen A. Smith criticizes Jimmy Kimmel over Kirk remarks on SiriusXM debut...On the premiere episode of his SiriusXM show Straight Shooter, ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith weighed in on the controversy surrounding Jimmy Kimmel's suspension from ABC, questioning the intent and tone of the late-night host's remarks about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk."The only thing that I would say as it pertains to Jimmy Kimmel is, where was the joke?" Smith said. "Because you're a late-night host — and obviously that has a comedic attachment to it. Where was the joke? Obviously, it wasn't anything funny about that."Kimmel's Monday monologue criticized political reactions to Kirk's death and mocked President Trump's response, saying, "He's at the fourth stage of grief: construction... This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish." The segment drew backlash from affiliates and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, leading ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel Live! indefinitely.Smith, a longtime Disney colleague of Kimmel through ESPN, also condemned any celebration of Kirk's death, saying on his podcast, "Shame on you!" His guest, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, thanked Smith for his empathy and clarity during a politically charged moment.Sep 18, 2025 at 03:20 PM EDTTrump suggests revoking broadcast licenses over negative coveragePresident Donald Trump on Thursday floated the idea of revoking broadcast licenses from television networks he claims are biased against him. Speaking to reporters, Trump said, "They're 97% against, they give me only bad press. They're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away."The remarks came one day after ABC suspended *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* following the host's comments linking the alleged killer of Charlie Kirk to Trump's MAGA movement. Trump referenced his 2024 election win, saying he prevailed in "all 7 swing states" despite overwhelmingly negative media coverage.Trump indicated that any licensing decision would fall to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, whom he praised as "a patriot" and "a tough guy." Carr has already publicly criticized Kimmel's remarks and suggested regulatory consequences for ABC affiliates.Sep 18, 2025 at 03:07 PM EDTChris Hayes faces scrutiny over contrasting takes on Carlson and KimmelMSNBC host Chris Hayes is facing criticism for what some consider a double standard in his reactions to the high-profile exits of Tucker Carlson and Jimmy Kimmel. On Wednesday, Hayes condemned ABC's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel Live!, calling it "the latest chapter in Donald Trump's ongoing campaign to crack down on free speech, dominate the media, and essentially render the First Amendment meaningless."However, a resurfaced clip from April 2023 shows Hayes taking a sharply different tone when Fox News parted ways with Carlson. "He believed he could say anything, no matter how vile, no matter how disgusting," Hayes said at the time. "If you act like a sociopath over and over... eventually, people will be rightly offended."Sep 18, 2025 at 02:52 PM EDTSinclair issues demands for Kimmel’s return, cites FCC pressure and community standardsSinclair Broadcast Group, the nation's largest ABC affiliate operator, announced Wednesday it will not air Jimmy Kimmel Live! until specific conditions are met, following the network's decision to suspend the show indefinitely. The move came after Kimmel's controversial remarks about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and mounting pressure from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr."Mr. Kimmel's remarks were inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country," said Sinclair vice chairman Jason Smith in a statement. "We believe broadcasters have a responsibility to educate and elevate respectful, constructive dialogue in our communities."Sinclair outlined three demands for reinstating the show: formal discussions with ABC about its commitment to professionalism, a direct apology from Kimmel to the Kirk family, and a personal donation to both the family and Turning Point USA, Kirk's nonprofit.The company also announced it will air a "special in remembrance" of Kirk in Kimmel's timeslot across 30 markets, including Seattle, Washington, D.C., and Portland. "Regardless of ABC's plans for the future of the program," Sinclair stated, "it won't return until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform."FCC Chair Carr praised Sinclair's swift action, saying it reflects "the needs and values of the local communities you serve." Nexstar Media Group, another major ABC affiliate owner, also pulled the show and is currently seeking FCC approval for a $6.2 billion merger with Tegna.While President Trump celebrated the suspension, calling it "Great News for America," Kimmel has received support from fellow entertainers and unions, and has publicly expressed condolences to Kirk's family.Sep 18, 2025 at 02:39 PM EDT‘The View’ silent on Kimmel suspension amid FCC scrutiny...ABC's daytime talk show The View did not address the network's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! during Thursday's broadcast, despite growing controversy surrounding the decision. The absence of commentary comes as FCC Chairman Brendan Carr—whose public threat preceded Kimmel's removal—has previously singled out The View as a potential target for regulatory scrutiny.In a July interview with Fox News, Carr said the show was "in the crosshairs of this administration," citing co-host Joy Behar's outspoken criticism of President Trump. The silence from The View has raised questions about internal network dynamics and whether other ABC programs may face similar pressure.Sep 18, 2025 at 02:33 PM EDTWATCH: Trump dismisses free speech concerns, says Kimmel ‘had bad ratings’Sep 18, 2025 at 02:25 PM EDTSen. Alsobrooks calls Kimmel suspension a ‘five-alarm fire’ on MSNBCSenator Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD) issued a stark warning Thursday on MSNBC, calling ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! a "five-alarm fire" for free speech. Speaking with anchor Ana Cabrera, Alsobrooks condemned what she described as blatant government interference, referencing FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's public threats to ABC over Kimmel's recent monologue criticizing President Trump's response to Charlie Kirk's death.Alsobrooks argued that the First Amendment is under siege, saying, "We didn't have to agree with what Jimmy Kimmel said, but we have a right in this country to speak freely." She warned that government censorship of media voices sets a dangerous precedent and undermines democratic norms.The senator also discussed broader concerns about political retaliation and public health leadership, citing testimony from former CDC officials who criticized HHS Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.'s vaccine policies. Alsobrooks urged bipartisan action, saying the erosion of scientific credibility and constitutional rights poses long-term risks to the country's safety and global standing.Sep 18, 2025 at 02:19 PM EDTFCC chair Brendan Carr claims Kimmel was trying to mislead fansFCC chair Brendan Carr told CNBC that Jimmy Kimmel had been trying to "directly mislead the American public" about the shooting of Charlie Kirk.Carr said that Kimmel's comments were "not a joke" but he was being misleading about "one of the most significant political events we've had in a long time."Sep 18, 2025 at 02:08 PM EDTKimmel suspension sparks concerns over political pressure and media mergersJimmy Kimmel's late-night show was suspended on Wednesday after FCC Chairman Brendan Carr publicly warned ABC and its affiliates to take action against the comedian, who has frequently mocked President Trump. Carr suggested broadcast licenses could be at risk, prompting ABC's parent company, Disney, to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! within hours.The timing has raised questions about political influence and corporate vulnerability. Nexstar Media Group, one of the affiliates that moved to drop Kimmel's show, is currently seeking federal approval for a $6.2 billion merger with Tegna—placing the company under direct scrutiny from the Trump administration.Critics argue that ABC could have resisted the pressure on First Amendment grounds, but Carr's public warning made the stakes clear. The episode follows a broader pattern of media entanglements, including CBS's recent cancellation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert and its settlement of a lawsuit brought by Trump against 60 Minutes, both occurring amid merger negotiations.Observers say the Kimmel decision reflects a growing trend of political leverage shaping network programming, with implications for press freedom and editorial independence.Sep 18, 2025 at 02:05 PM EDTGOP Senator Marshall claims Kimmel was turning his show into ‘political agenda’Sen. Roger Marshall celebrated the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday, after he accused the late-night talk show host of turning his "show into another political agenda.""Hallelujah," the Republican senator said on Newsmax to the news of Kimmel's suspension."I was thinking last night, as I saw that news, I thought back, what did Johnny Carson do with politics? What did Jay Leno do with politics? And by the way, they were both a lot funnier and more entertaining than Jimmy Kimmel."So they didn't touch politics, is my point, and they certainly didn't attack people personally like Mr. Kimmel did."So look, he was on his way to the bottom as far as ratings go, anyway. America was tired of that type of rhetoric. They were tired of basically him turning a show into another political agenda, and we just wish him the best. We'll just be very polite here."Sep 18, 2025 at 01:48 PM EDTWho is Brendan Carr? Trump’s FCC chair and co-author of Project 2025Brendan Carr is the current chair of the FCC (Federal Communications Commission).He first joined the FCC as an attorney in the Office of General Counsel in 2012.

He was confirmed by the Senate and has served as a commissioner since.In January 2025, when Trump returned to office, he nominated Carr to become Chair of the FCC.Carr has said his focus is on deregulation, expanding oversight of tech platforms (especially around claims of "censorship"), reexamining media-ownership and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies.The chair also wrote a chapter about the agency in Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's controversial blueprint for a conservative presidency.Sep 18, 2025 at 01:35 PM EDTSenator calls Kimmel’s suspension a ‘five-alarm fire’ for free speechSen. Angela Alsobrooks said she found the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, over his comments about Charlie Kirk, "deeply concerning."Speaking on MSNBC on Thursday, the Democratic Maryland senator said that she was not surprised that the new FCC chair had made the decision, because he was "one of the authors of Project 25.""And what we know is that we - this is a five-alarm fire. And I hope that every American watching understands clearly what we are seeing. The First Amendment in our country is sacrosanct. It is the basis of our country. And having the right to freely speak is a basic right. It is not partisan either. It is not partisan. But this is a five-alarm fire."It is deeply concerning to me and ought to be to every single person watching the perilous course that we are on. We didn't have to agree with what Jimmy Kimmel said, but we have a right in this country to speak freely. And having the government sanction what we say, to censor what we say, to control what we say is a very dangerous, dangerous precedent."Sep 18, 2025 at 01:19 PM EDTEverything Charlie Kirk said about Jimmy KimmelCharlie Kirk criticized Jimmy Kimmel, whose show has been taken off the air over his remarks about the assassination of the conservative activist, at several points over the years.Kirk has made critiques against Kimmel as early as October 2017, when he wrote to a post on X that Kimmel "isn't funny." In the following years, Kirk made a number of remarks about Kimmel, who has been critical of Trump and other Republicans.In 2020, Kirk wrote that "everyone who has been caught in blackface is a leftist," while listing several celebrities who have faced criticism for alleged use of blackface, a practice that is widely considered to be racist. Kimmel apologized for using blackface in a sketch in 2020."There is nothing more important to me than your respect, and I apologize to those who were genuinely hurt or offended by the makeup I wore or the words I spoke," he said, according to NPR.In March of 2024, Kirk mocked Kimmel for reading a Truth Social post made by Trump while hosting the Oscars, in which Trump asked if there had ever been a "worse host" than Kimmel."Jimmy Kimmel reads Trump's Truth Social post ripping Kimmel as a mediocre, woke host of this year's Oscar's. He lives rent free in these people's minds," Kirk wrote to X.Weeks later, in April, Kirk mentioned Kimmel in a post about former President Joe Biden's reelection chances."The Rock says he regrets endorsing Joe Biden. Former TDS patient, actor Michael Rapaport, says he will not vote for Biden. James Carville warns of young men fleeing the Democrat Party. Minority voters are flocking to Trump. Jimmy Kimmel can't fathom why Trump is ahead in several crucial swing states. Joe Biden is spending money defending Minnesota and Maine," he wrote.In August 10, he posted a video of Kimmel criticizing some voices on the left "repelling" people from the Democratic Party."Jimmy Kimmel says 'repulsive' liberal voices drive people away from Democrat Party but somehow fails to admit he's one of them," Kirk responded.He also discussed Kimmel earlier this year after Kimmel's monologue about people vandalizing Tesla vehicles with Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican. Kirk said that not a "single advertiser" would say his remarks went "too far," while Lee described his remarks as "shameful."Sep 18, 2025 at 01:12 PM EDTJimmy Fallon abruptly drops out of event following Kimmel’s suspensionJimmy Fallon has pulled out of a festival shortly before he was set to make a public appearance, organizers confirmed.The NBC late-night host was expected to appear on a New York conference panel at the Fast Company Innovation Festival on Thursday morning.
