There's ugly speech. There's gross speech. There's evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment. Keep America free."Bondi spoke about hate speech on an episode of The Katie Miller Podcast."There's free speech and then there's hate speech, and there is no place, especially now, especially after what happened to Charlie, in our society," Bondi said.Bondi added, "We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech."Newsweek reached out to Hasan via social media for comment....Why It MattersBondi's comments have faced criticism by a number of prominent MAGA voices online.Related StoriesMarjorie Taylor Greene Reveals Recent Text Messages From Charlie Kirk5 min. readBarack Obama Issues Political Violence Warning—’We Have to Be Concerned’5 min. readMan With Green Card Who Was Held by ICE for 77 Days Speaks Out—’Inhumane’3 min. read"'There's free speech and then there's hate speech' is the most destructive phrase that has ever been uttered. And Pam Bondi just said it. She needs to be removed as attorney general now," Turning Point USA contributor Savanah Hernandez wrote on X.Actor Rob Schneider said Bondi "is WRONG on this one.""If FREE SPEECH means anything it's the freedom to say things that OTHER people may LOATHE! Outside of the incitement to violence, FREE SPEECH IS ALL SPEECH! You are either for ALL of it or NONE of it!" Schneider wrote.What To KnowBondi added further context to her comments on hate speech in an X post on Tuesday."Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. It's a crime," Bondi wrote on X.Bondi stated that every threat "will be met with the full force of the law.""Free speech protects ideas, debate, even dissent but it does NOT and will NEVER protect violence," Bondi said. "It is clear this violent rhetoric is designed to silence others from voicing conservative ideals. We will never be silenced. Not for our families, not for our freedoms, and never for Charlie. His legacy will not be erased by fear or intimidation."Bondi told reporters on Monday that the First Amendment "is one of our most important amendments.""We will always protect the First Amendment, but you cannot, you cannot create violence, and that's what's happening," Bondi said.The Department of Justice directed Newsweek to Bondi's comments on X and to reporters when reached for comment.Kirk, a conservative activist and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was assassinated while speaking at Utah Valley University on September 10. He was 31.Republican Utah Governor Spencer Cox announced at a press conference on Friday that Tyler Robinson was taken into custody in connection with the fatal shooting.What People Are SayingAttorney General Pam Bondi, on X: "You cannot call for someone's murder. You cannot swat a Member of Congress. You cannot dox a conservative family and think it will be brushed off as 'free speech.' These acts are punishable crimes, and every single threat will be met with the full force of the law."Vice President JD Vance, on The Charlie Kirk Show: "When you see someone celebrating Charlie's murder, call them out. And hell, call their employer."What Happens NextRobinson is expected to appear in court on Tuesday after the Utah County Attorney's Office announces what charges he will face.Do you have a story that Newsweek should be covering?
