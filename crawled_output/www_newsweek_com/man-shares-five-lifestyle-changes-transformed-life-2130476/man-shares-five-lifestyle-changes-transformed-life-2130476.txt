The 32-year-old teacher from Dallas, Texas, is smiling in both photos, but in the newer image his face appears noticeably slimmer following a 10-pound weight loss.Speaking to Newsweek, Micklos said that quitting alcohol, walking regularly, intermittent fasting, and prioritizing sleep and hydration were key to transforming his health and mindset."I feel a lot better in my 30s than my 20s," he said. "I encourage anyone to begin their journey, and not compare their progress to others. The only person you need to be better than is the one you were yesterday."...Quitting AlcoholBack in 2023, Micklos said he was drinking most nights as he struggled with loneliness and isolation after leaving his hometown to live alone while pursuing a master's degree and student teaching. At the time, he weighed 160 pounds; today, he weighs 150."I would look in the mirror and the man I saw was not who I felt like on the inside," he told Newsweek.Micklos began by quitting alcohol for 30 days, a decision that ultimately extended into three years without a drop of liquor. Now, he only drinks on special occasions."My lifestyle was best described as lonely and lacking confidence," he said. "I played video games and did the bare minimum at work and to maintain my relationships."Prioritizing Sleep...The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises adults to aim for at least seven hours of sleep each night. But with today's devices, that's often easier said than done. Whether it's late-night doomscrolling on a phone or marathon video gaming, these habits can easily cut into much-needed rest.Adequate sleep is vital for many reasons, including maintaining a healthy weight. Research has linked insufficient sleep to weight gain."I still went to the gym but I basically never saw any progress," Micklos explained. "I was destroying my sleep most nights and never fully recovering."Newsweek previously spoke to Dr. Marcio Griebeler, director of the Diabetes and Obesity Center at the Cleveland Clinic's Endocrinology & Metabolism Institute, who said: "If you do not sleep well, you release all those counter-regulatory hormones that make it much more difficult to lose weight. It is kind of a stress in your body. In addition, you will be tired during the day so you will most likely be less active."Micklos said: "I average at least seven hours of sleep during the work week and nine on the weekends."Alcohol absolutely wrecks your sleep and recovery. Even if you get the correct amount of sleep, you are not getting the deep and rapid eye movement sleep (REM) that your body so badly needs."Sleep is king, and it is truly the first puzzle piece in all of our lives. Without focusing on it and prioritizing it, nothing else reaches its potential."My sweet spot is eight hours and 20 minutes—I wake up feeling like Superman."Exercise...At the start of his journey, Micklos trained in the gym almost every day. He is currently recovering from a back injury caused by a car accident, but still makes movement a priority by walking for 15 minutes in the morning and again after dinner.He said: "My mobility is limited, I still always do what I can. It could be a walk, a light swim, a sauna session, or some yoga."Diet and Intermittent FastingMicklos focuses on a whole-food diet and intermittent fasting—an eating plan that cycles between periods of eating and voluntary fasting—during the working week."They say abs are made in the kitchen, but so is clear skin and bright eyes," he said. "As humans, we have been socialized to always feel the need to eat throughout the day. A solid protein-rich meal or two and some coffee with collagen in the morning for breakfast is plenty sufficient for a transformation."A Life Transformed"I feel incredible," Micklos said. "I have tons more energy, less brain fog, and carry myself with a confidence that I have earned. These lifestyle changes led me to become the person I always knew I was. And it helped me to meet my beautiful girlfriend, Diane. I am so grateful I had the courage to begin.""I would describe my lifestyle as laid back and community-oriented in comparison to how it was before my transformation," he said. "I no longer do the bare minimum in regard to my career and taking care of myself. I find myself interacting more with residents of my community, riding my longboard around White Rock Lake, and spending more time outdoors—even if it's just to sit and relax without distractions."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesPoliticsDemocrats React to Jimmy Kimmel’s Return from Suspension3 min. readPoliticsDonald Trump Tells Pregnant Women to ‘Tough it Out,’ Avoid Tylenol4 min. readPoliticsWhat We Know and Don’t Know About Trump’s H-1B Crackdown7 min. readPoliticsMap Shows Health Care H-1B Visas by State as Trump Floats Fee Exemption6 min. readPoliticsWhite House Shares Update on Antifa Crackdown as Trump Order Nears4 min. readPoliticsTrump Admin Vows to ‘Defend Every Inch of NATO’ After Russian Violations3 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
