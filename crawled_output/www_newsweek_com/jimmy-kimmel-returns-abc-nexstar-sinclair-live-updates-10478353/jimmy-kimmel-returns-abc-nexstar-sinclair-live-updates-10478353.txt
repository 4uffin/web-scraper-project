No injuries were reported, but bullet holes were found in the station’s windows. A search of Hernandez Santana’s vehicle revealed handwritten notes referencing federal officials and political grievances.Hernandez Santana, a former lobbyist, faces both state and federal charges, including firearms violations and interference with radio communications. His arraignment was postponed, and a detention hearing is scheduled for Thursday.Kimmel returned to air last night, following a week-long suspension that sparked national debate over free speech and media pressure....20 hours agoSep 24, 2025 at 01:30 AM EDTWill Kimmel stay on the air?Jimmy Kimmel may be back on ABC tonight, but not all viewers saw him return.

What to know...ABC's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel Live! has sparked questions about whether the late-night host could pursue legal action, particularly against President Donald Trump and federal regulators.In criticizing how some Republicans reacted to Charlie Kirk's death, Jimmy Kimmel alleged that conservatives were using Kirk's assassination for political advantage rather than mourning the conservative activist sincerely. Trump said Kimmel had said "a horrible thing" about Kirk and praised ABC's decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! off the air.The dispute cuts to the heart of how far government officials can pressure media outlets without violating the First Amendment. If regulators can threaten broadcasters' licenses to influence programming decisions, critics warn it could chill not only comedians but also journalists, academics and other public voices from speaking freely.The outcome could set an important precedent for media independence and democratic norms in an era of escalating political polarization.Read the full story by Robert Alexander on Newsweek.21 hours agoSep 23, 2025 at 11:54 PM EDTKimmel moved by Erika Kirk’s forgiveness in emotional momentDuring his return to Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Kimmel grew emotional while reflecting on Erika Kirk’s public forgiveness of the man who fatally shot her husband, conservative activist Charlie Kirk. “That is the example we should follow,” Kimmel said, pausing as he acknowledged how deeply her grace had affected him.“It touched me deeply,” he added. “If there’s anything that we should take from this tragedy moving forward, it should be this.” With those words, Kimmel transitioned to a commercial break.21 hours agoSep 23, 2025 at 11:52 PM EDTKimmel fires back at Trump, jokes about ratings and Disney returnJimmy Kimmel didn’t hold back during his return to late-night Tuesday, responding directly to President Donald Trump’s attack, calling him a “whack job” with “no ratings.” “Well, I do tonight,” Kimmel quipped, adding that Trump’s attempt to cancel him only drove millions to tune in.Kimmel acknowledged his frustration over being pulled off the air, but thanked Disney for ultimately reinstating him. He joked that the only condition for his return was reading a statement encouraging viewers to reactivate their Disney+ and Hulu accounts.Addressing Trump’s criticism more seriously, Kimmel said, “The president of the United States made it very clear that he wanted to see us lose our jobs... because he can’t take a joke.” 21 hours agoSep 23, 2025 at 11:45 PM EDTJimmy Fallon pokes fun at Kimmel confusion amid suspension dramaDuring his own show’s opening, Jimmy Fallon joked about the buzz surrounding Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension, telling viewers, “If you’re tuning in to see what I’ll say about my suspension the last couple days, again, you’re watching the wrong Jimmy, Dad—the other Jimmy, Dad.” 21 hours agoSep 23, 2025 at 11:44 PM EDTKimmel gets emotional in return, defends free speech and clarifies remarksJimmy Kimmel returned to Jimmy Kimmel Live!

Controversy explainedJimmy Kimmel is going to resume hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live! tonight, following a week-long suspension by ABC over controversial remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The network, owned by Disney, cited “ill-timed and insensitive” comments as the reason for the pause. Still, the move quickly escalated into a national debate over free speech and media accountability.Kimmel’s September 15 monologue accused MAGA supporters of distorting the shooter’s motives, despite reports that the assailant leaned left politically. The backlash was swift, with figures like Senator Ted Cruz condemning the remarks and FCC Chair Brendan Carr threatening to scrutinize ABC’s broadcast standards.In response, the ACLU and a wave of Hollywood talent—including Jennifer Aniston and Tom Hanks—defended Kimmel, framing Disney’s suspension as a threat to constitutional rights. A Change.org petition and widespread subscription cancellations added pressure.Disney lifted the suspension after what it called “thoughtful conversations” with Kimmel, though analysts point to business interests and pushback against federal pressure as key factors. Still, the show’s return is not universal: several ABC affiliates, especially those owned by Sinclair, continue to block the program, leaving viewers in major markets without access and highlighting a growing rift in network distribution.22 hours agoSep 23, 2025 at 10:49 PM EDTTrump slams ABC for reinstating Jimmy Kimmel, threatens legal actionDonald Trump took to social media Tuesday night to criticize ABC’s decision to bring Jimmy Kimmel back to air following a brief suspension.

ABC has yet to respond publicly to Trump’s remarks.22 hours agoSep 23, 2025 at 10:46 PM EDTJimmy Kimmel isn’t available everywhere: how to watchJimmy Kimmel is back on air tonight, following ABC’s decision to reinstate Jimmy Kimmel Live! after a brief suspension.
