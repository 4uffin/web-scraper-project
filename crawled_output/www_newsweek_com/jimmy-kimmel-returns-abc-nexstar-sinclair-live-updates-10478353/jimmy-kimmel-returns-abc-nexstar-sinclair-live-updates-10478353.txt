Jimmy Kimmel can pound sand," Loesch posted to X."I hope ABC continues to hemorrhage money on this barely-scraping-a-4-share loser."Jack Posobiec, a right-wing activist and friend of Kirk's, wrote on X: "In typical leftist fashion, Jimmy makes the victim himself...There was no apology."Mollie Hemingway, editor at conservative website The Federalist, posted to X: "No semblance of an apology.

A transparent attempt to deny and obfuscate assassin’s political motivation."Sep 24, 2025 at 02:00 AM EDTSuspect in ABC Sacramento shooting may have been motivated by Kimmel suspensionAuthorities in Sacramento say the man accused of firing shots at ABC affiliate KXTV last week may have been politically motivated, citing the network’s recent suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! as a possible factor. Sacramento County District Attorney Thien Ho said there is “circumstantial evidence” suggesting Anibal Hernandez Santana, 64, targeted the station in response to ABC’s decision to pull Kimmel off the air.The shooting occurred on September 19, days after Kimmel’s remarks about the political fallout surrounding the death of activist Charlie Kirk. No injuries were reported, but bullet holes were found in the station’s windows. A search of Hernandez Santana’s vehicle revealed handwritten notes referencing federal officials and political grievances.Hernandez Santana, a former lobbyist, faces both state and federal charges, including firearms violations and interference with radio communications. His arraignment was postponed, and a detention hearing is scheduled for Thursday.Kimmel returned to air last night, following a week-long suspension that sparked national debate over free speech and media pressure....Sep 24, 2025 at 01:30 AM EDTWill Kimmel stay on the air?Jimmy Kimmel may be back on ABC tonight, but not all viewers saw him return. Nexstar and Sinclair, which control dozens of ABC affiliates, continue to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! with alternate programming despite the network’s decision to reinstate the show.Kimmel has hosted the late-night staple since 2003, but his current contract with ABC is set to expire in May 2026. With affiliate resistance and political tensions still simmering, the show's future—and its distribution—remain uncertain.Sep 24, 2025 at 01:00 AM EDT‘The First Amendment is not for sale’: Sen. WarrenSen. Elizabeth Warren said on Monday that Jimmy Kimmel's reinstatement showed everyone who had spoken up against his suspension that their voice mattered."For everyone who spoke up and said Trump's censorship of Kimmel is wrong, your voice mattered," the Democratic senator wrote on X.But Sen. Warren warned that the "fight isn't over.""Trump won't stop corruptly pressuring media companies. CEOs must not bend the knee to secure mergers and regulatory favors. The First Amendment is not for sale," she added.Loading twitter content...Sep 24, 2025 at 12:30 AM EDTDisney stars joined Disney boycott ahead of Kimmel being reinstatedBacklash over Jimmy Kimmel Live!'s brief suspension rippled through Hollywood before the show was reinstated on Monday.

And I love you.”Sep 24, 2025 at 12:00 AM EDTCould Jimmy Kimmel sue Donald Trump after being ‘canceled’? What to know...ABC's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel Live! has sparked questions about whether the late-night host could pursue legal action, particularly against President Donald Trump and federal regulators.In criticizing how some Republicans reacted to Charlie Kirk's death, Jimmy Kimmel alleged that conservatives were using Kirk's assassination for political advantage rather than mourning the conservative activist sincerely. Trump said Kimmel had said "a horrible thing" about Kirk and praised ABC's decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! off the air.The dispute cuts to the heart of how far government officials can pressure media outlets without violating the First Amendment. If regulators can threaten broadcasters' licenses to influence programming decisions, critics warn it could chill not only comedians but also journalists, academics and other public voices from speaking freely.The outcome could set an important precedent for media independence and democratic norms in an era of escalating political polarization.Read the full story by Robert Alexander on Newsweek.Sep 23, 2025 at 11:54 PM EDTKimmel moved by Erika Kirk’s forgiveness in emotional momentDuring his return to Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Kimmel grew emotional while reflecting on Erika Kirk’s public forgiveness of the man who fatally shot her husband, conservative activist Charlie Kirk. “That is the example we should follow,” Kimmel said, pausing as he acknowledged how deeply her grace had affected him.“It touched me deeply,” he added. “If there’s anything that we should take from this tragedy moving forward, it should be this.” With those words, Kimmel transitioned to a commercial break.Sep 23, 2025 at 11:52 PM EDTKimmel fires back at Trump, jokes about ratings and Disney returnJimmy Kimmel didn’t hold back during his return to late-night Tuesday, responding directly to President Donald Trump’s attack, calling him a “whack job” with “no ratings.” “Well, I do tonight,” Kimmel quipped, adding that Trump’s attempt to cancel him only drove millions to tune in.Kimmel acknowledged his frustration over being pulled off the air, but thanked Disney for ultimately reinstating him. He joked that the only condition for his return was reading a statement encouraging viewers to reactivate their Disney+ and Hulu accounts.Addressing Trump’s criticism more seriously, Kimmel said, “The president of the United States made it very clear that he wanted to see us lose our jobs... because he can’t take a joke.” Sep 23, 2025 at 11:45 PM EDTJimmy Fallon pokes fun at Kimmel confusion amid suspension dramaDuring his own show’s opening, Jimmy Fallon joked about the buzz surrounding Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension, telling viewers, “If you’re tuning in to see what I’ll say about my suspension the last couple days, again, you’re watching the wrong Jimmy, Dad—the other Jimmy, Dad.” Sep 23, 2025 at 11:44 PM EDTKimmel gets emotional in return, defends free speech and clarifies remarksJimmy Kimmel returned to Jimmy Kimmel Live!

Protests, subscription cancellations, and an ACLU-backed letter signed by over 400 celebrities have amplified the moment.If even a portion of that engaged audience tunes in, Kimmel could see a ratings spike similar to the surge The Late Show with Stephen Colbert experienced after its cancellation announcement, when viewership jumped to over 3 million per night.Sep 23, 2025 at 11:22 PM EDTWho are the guests attending Jimmy Kimmel’s first show back on airJimmy Kimmel’s comeback episode kicks off with Twisters star Glen Powell as the first guest, marking the late-night host’s return after a week-long suspension.

Controversy explainedJimmy Kimmel is going to resume hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live! tonight, following a week-long suspension by ABC over controversial remarks about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The network, owned by Disney, cited “ill-timed and insensitive” comments as the reason for the pause. Still, the move quickly escalated into a national debate over free speech and media accountability.Kimmel’s September 15 monologue accused MAGA supporters of distorting the shooter’s motives, despite reports that the assailant leaned left politically. The backlash was swift, with figures like Senator Ted Cruz condemning the remarks and FCC Chair Brendan Carr threatening to scrutinize ABC’s broadcast standards.In response, the ACLU and a wave of Hollywood talent—including Jennifer Aniston and Tom Hanks—defended Kimmel, framing Disney’s suspension as a threat to constitutional rights. A Change.org petition and widespread subscription cancellations added pressure.Disney lifted the suspension after what it called “thoughtful conversations” with Kimmel, though analysts point to business interests and pushback against federal pressure as key factors. Still, the show’s return is not universal: several ABC affiliates, especially those owned by Sinclair, continue to block the program, leaving viewers in major markets without access and highlighting a growing rift in network distribution.Sep 23, 2025 at 10:49 PM EDTTrump slams ABC for reinstating Jimmy Kimmel, threatens legal actionDonald Trump took to social media Tuesday night to criticize ABC’s decision to bring Jimmy Kimmel back to air following a brief suspension.

ABC has yet to respond publicly to Trump’s remarks.Sep 23, 2025 at 10:46 PM EDTJimmy Kimmel isn’t available everywhere: how to watchJimmy Kimmel is back on air tonight, following ABC’s decision to reinstate Jimmy Kimmel Live! after a brief suspension.
