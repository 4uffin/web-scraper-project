The Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, DC (GMCW) was among those impacted: our $15,000 grant for FY25 was canceled without warning. This is part of a broader political strategy to silence the spaces where LGBTQ youth find safety, community, and the freedom to express themselves.At a time when LGBTQ youth are already being relentlessly targeted by lawmakers, school boards, and national rhetoric, the destruction of affirming and creative spaces has now become federal policy....While bans on books, performances, and classroom discussions about identity dominate headlines, the erosion of arts education often gets less attention. From rural towns to major cities, school districts are also increasingly slashing arts programs, eliminating the spaces where young people have long turned to feel seen, safe, and celebrated. We're in a crisis of belonging.The same politicians who speak loudly about "freedom" are pushing policies that erase LGBTQ youth from classrooms, libraries, and stages. In Tennessee, a law targeting drag performances brands queer expression as dangerous, and in Texas, stagnant school funding has left districts with massive deficits, forcing cuts to electives and creative programs, including the arts.Now, the federal government has escalated those attacks. Senior NEA officials resigned in protest, and President Donald Trump has proposed eliminating the agency next year.This development will only exacerbate the struggle arts organizations are facing. Nearly 80 percent of U.S. school districts have made cuts to arts education over the last five years. These losses come on top of already inequitable funding systems. The students who lose access to music, theater, dance, and visual art are often the ones who need it most. Add in the current political climate, and you begin to see the full picture: a generation being told, in more ways than one, that there is no room for them.LGBTQ youth with access to affirming spaces, like arts programs, report significantly lower rates of suicide attempts. When queer kids are surrounded by community and empowered to express themselves, they are safer, stronger, and more resilient.At the GenOUT Youth Chorus, an outreach ensemble of GMCW, we've seen that life-changing impact. Through musical expression, our chorus members stand taller, speak up more, and take the stage as themselves. This is what happens when young people have access to artistic spaces where they are encouraged to express who they are without shame or fear.When young people are given a stage, literally and figuratively, they rise. GenOUT performs everywhere from Pride celebrations to interfaith services to national stages, using their voices to challenge, uplift, and unite. Our repertoire includes songs of protest, healing, and joy. But the most important impact is in the transformation we witness: young people learning to take up space, tell their stories, and lead with confidence. The power of these performances lies in the act of showing up as yourself and being met with acceptance."This community has allowed me to imagine a future for myself, one where I can embrace all of who I am," said a member of the GenOUT Youth Chorus.Arts organizations like ours are doing what we can to fill the gap. But we cannot, and should not, be expected to do it alone. The mass withdrawal of NEA grants proves that even the most effective, community-rooted programs are vulnerable when culture becomes a political target.We need policies that reflect what we already know to be true, that the arts are essential, not expendable. We need funding that prioritizes creativity, self-expression, and inclusion, especially for the young people who are most often left behind. And we need leaders, at every level, willing to stand up for the idea that all students, regardless of who they are or where they come from, deserve the right to imagine and express their full selves.We do this work because the need is urgent. LGBTQ youth shouldn't have to fight for a place to be themselves. But once again, they are being forced to. The stage should be there when they need it, and so should we.Dr. Thea Kano is artistic director of Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, DC.The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsErika Kirk on Husband Charlie’s Killer: ‘I Forgive Him’3 min. readNewsMusk and Trump Chat Warmly in First Meeting Since Summer Fallout3 min. readNewsTwo Killed, Five Injured in Indiana Shooting—Police3 min. readNewsUK, Canada, Australia Recognize Palestinian State7 min. readU.S.Exclusive: James Talarico on Texas, ‘Nonbinary’ God and Joe Rogan’s Support27 min. readU.S.Students Return to Books as Schools Ban Phones9 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
