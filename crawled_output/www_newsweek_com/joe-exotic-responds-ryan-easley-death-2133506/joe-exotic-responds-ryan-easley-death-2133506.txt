NewsTiger KingTigerNews ArticleJoe Exotic Responds After Tiger Trainer Ryan Easley Mauled to DeathPublishedSep 22, 2025 at 03:05 AM EDTupdatedSep 22, 2025 at 06:00 AM EDTBy Alia ShoaibNews ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project member"Tiger King" Joe Exotic has hit out after news reports linked him to a tiger trainer who was mauled to death."This is the c**p I am sick of. CNN drags me into this story to make a headline worth reading, and I had nothing to do with this dude other than 18 years ago I let him keep his tigers at my zoo for one winter," Exotic, whose real name is Joseph Allen Maldonado, wrote on X."Sick of being exploited for headlines," he said, adding, "President Trump let's sue CNN."Ryan Easley was killed on Saturday by a tiger under his care at the Growler Pines Tiger Preserve in Oklahoma, according to a statement from the preserve.Newsweek contacted CNN, Exotic and Growler Pines for comment via email on Monday outside regular working hours.Why It MattersEasley's death is the latest incident involving captive big cats in the U.S. While fatalities are rare, they are serious risks.The incident has also drawn attention to Exotic, who gained notoriety after Netflix's Tiger King documentary exposed allegations of abuse, neglect and questionable breeding practices at his Oklahoma zoo.What To KnowThe Growler Pines Tiger Preserve confirmed their founder Easley's passing in a statement on Sunday, saying he lost his life "in an accident involving a tiger under his care."Easley opened Growler Pines, a tiger preserve that offers educational tours, in 2021 with his wife, according to Oklahoma Living. He also incorporated ShowMe Tigers, a traveling tiger show he had been running for more than a decade, into the preserve.Many outlets reporting on Easley's death made reference to Exotic, the country's most notorious tiger handler, who is serving a 21-year prison sentence for a murder-for-hire plot and violations of wildlife laws....In its reporting, CNN cited a statement from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals that said Easley had previously obtained tigers from Exotic and Bhagavan "Doc" Antle for ShowMe Tigers.PETA added, "When Joe Exotic was operating his Oklahoma roadside zoo, G.W. Exotic Animal Park, Easley boarded his tigers in cramped cages at the roadside zoo during the winter."PETA's statement about Easley's death noted the organization's belief that animal shows were cruel and made allegations of historic animal mistreatment.Growler Pines' website highlights ShowMe Tigers' animal care record, saying it underwent 32 unannounced inspections by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and passed them all without any issues.The Oklahoman reported that Exotic posted messages of condolence on social media following Easley's death but later deleted them.What People Are SayingGrowler Pines Tiger Preserve said in a statement: "This tragedy is a painful reminder of both the beauty and unpredictability of the natural world. Ryan understood those risks—not out of recklessness but out of love. The animals under his care were not just animals to him, but beings he formed a connection with—one rooted in respect, daily care and love."PETA Foundation Senior Director of Captive Wildlife Debbie Metzler said in a statement: "It's never safe for humans to interact directly with apex predators, and it's never a surprise when a human is attacked by a stressed big cat who has been caged, whipped, and denied everything natural and important to them."What Happens NextAll tours at the Growler Pines Tiger Preserve have been canceled until further notice.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
