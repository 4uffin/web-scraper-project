It had gone from clean white to a blue and purple tone all of a sudden.Gogolli, 32, was perplexed by the unexplained change and she couldn't work out what was causing it. She told Newsweek that she tried to remove the stain "with every cleaning product imaginable," but nothing would get rid of the blue-purple tone."Our brains logically went to it being caused by color transfer from clothes," Gogolli, who resides in Brooklyn, New York, said. "I wondered if one of us was wearing cheap jeans and was transferring the color from our skin to the toilet. But none of us had any new clothes at the time. It was also right at the start of COVID, and so to be honest, we were in pajamas or loungewear most of the time."The couple continued trying to clean the toilet seat but to no avail....At one point, Peter even started researching theories and cleaning techniques. He came across an online theory that suggests a toilet seat may turn blue or purple in the early stages of pregnancy.When he jokingly put that idea to his wife, she said "absolutely not." Gogolli had only come off birth control around two months prior, so she didn't possibly think she could be pregnant already.Just days later, Gogolli's mom and sister came over for dinner and the saga took another turn. Gogolli's sister had a feeling that something was different, and she continued to joke that Gogolli was expecting.Gogolli said: "She mentioned it a few times during the evening. After they left, we were cleaning up their food and I was throwing out the food scrapes from one of their plates. Me, a woman who usually has a stomach of steel, ran to my purple toilet seat to vomit. As I was throwing up with the bathroom door open, my husband was laughing and saying I was pregnant."Seeing his wife throwing up suddenly with no obvious reason why was enough evidence for Peter. He insisted that the toilet seat was the first sign that they were expanding their family."The next day, I took the test and realized the purple toilet seat was right," Gogolli continued.At that point, it was likely that she was only around three weeks pregnant, and she hadn't even missed a period. If it wasn't for the toilet seat, they certainly wouldn't have taken a pregnancy test that early on....There is no scientific proof that pregnancy can make a toilet seat blue, and there is no medical research to support the theory.Amusing as the theory is, Dr. Christine Greves of the Orlando Health Women's Institute tells Newsweek that a blue toilet seat is "not the first thing that comes to mind" as an OBGYN."My thoughts of this being on the internet as a possible need to take a pregnancy test brought a huge smile to my face, and it serves a reminder that certain conditions in the air can affect the color of our sweat which can be different colors," said Greves, who is board-certified in Obstetrics and Gynecology, and a fellow of the American Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG).Among the social media speculation, many have suggested that the coating on the toilet seat may react to the fluctuating pregnancy hormones, that it's a by-product of prenatal hormones, or that it's the ink on newly purchased maternity jeans.Another suggestion is a condition called chromhidrosis, which causes the secretion of colored sweat. Additionally, pseudochromhidrosis is when sweat appears colorless but can change color when it interacts with something else.For Greves however, the "most plausible" answer is that it's simply ink rubbing off clothes."As a medical professional, it never cease to be amazed at what can be found on social media," Greves said.Gogolli's first son was born on December 14, 2020, and now the couple joke that their toilet seat knew they were having a family before they did.In August, Gogolli shared a video on TikTok (@.naginah) detailing the toilet seat theory and it's captured plenty of attention online. The video has generated more than 2.7 million views and over 185,300 likes on TikTok at the time of writing.She never imagined her experience would pique so much interest online, but Gogolli has also been amazed by the number of women who reached out to share similar stories."I was shocked at how many other women have experienced a purple/blue toilet seat in the beginning of their pregnancy," Gogolli told Newsweek. "It was a validating feeling being able to have a shared experience. So many women, myself included, were also told by medical providers that they had not heard of it."Of course, we know that color transfer or medical conditions such as chromhidrosis can be a cause, but we shouldn't ignore and dismiss women saying that something specific is happening to them," she continued.Gogolli now has two children, but the blue tinge never came out of the toilet seat, so eventually she just replaced it with a new one.The TikTok video has already amassed over 1,400 comments, as many people wanted to share their thoughts.One comment reads: "I automatically knew because I made my toilet seat blue."Another TikTok user wrote: "Oh my gosh, I thought I was the only one that turned everything blue when I was pregnant!"While another person replied: "I learn new things every day."Is there a health issue that's worrying you?
