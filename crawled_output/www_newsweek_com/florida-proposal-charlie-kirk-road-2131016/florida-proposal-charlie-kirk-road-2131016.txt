NewsCharlie kirkFloridaNews ArticleFlorida Rejects Proposal to Rename Road After Charlie KirkPublishedSep 17, 2025 at 06:25 AM EDTBy Theo BurmanLive News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberEscambia County commissioners unanimously voted to drop a proposal to rename a street in Pensacola after Charlie Kirk.The decision came after a tense public meeting on Tuesday where dozens of residents voiced opposition to the idea, criticizing the political implications and questioning Kirk's ties to the local Florida community.Kirk, 31, was fatally shot during a speech at Utah Valley University on September 10 during his "American Comeback Tour." A suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, is in custody having been charged with his murder.Why It MattersKirk was a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and played a key role in organizing young Republican voters. His killing has raised national concern about political violence. While many of his supporters responded to his death with messages of grief, some critics have been either indifferent or even celebratory.The debate in Escambia comes as there have been various proposals to honor Kirk across the U.S. The New College of Florida announced on Tuesday that it will be commissioning a statue of Kirk to be placed on its campus, to honor the work that he did in engaging students....What To KnowEscambia County Commissioner Mike Kohler had initially introduced the measure to honor Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, a conservative youth organization. Kohler proposed changing the name of North 65th Avenue, located near Escambia High School, to either "Charlie Kirk Way" or "Turning Point USA Road."While some attendees at the commission meeting spoke in favor of the renaming, the backlash from other community members was swift and vocal, with many questioning why Kirk, a national figure with no apparent connection to the area, should be honored in this way.Several residents noted the symbolic impact of renaming a street adjacent to a high school that has grappled with racial tensions in the past. Escambia High School opened in the 1950s and was forcibly desegregated in the late 1960s.Others pointed out the contrast between honoring Kirk and longtime local civil rights leaders. One speaker suggested renaming a street instead for H.K. Matthews, a local activist who led demonstrations in the 1960s and 1970s.Kohler formally withdrew the measure following more than two hours of testimony from residents, including homeowners, educators, clergy, and civil rights advocates.What People Are SayingRev. Paul Blackmon of First Baptist Church of Ferry Pass, urged commissioners to reject the proposal, reportedly saying: "To name a street after him because you agree with his ideology is wrong." Paraphrasing Kirk, he continued: "'If I see a black pilot, I'm going to be like, boy, I hope he's qualified.' He said that in January of 2024. Is this the kind of ideology we as a community want to embrace? I don't think so."Father Jack Campbell, a pastor at Little Flower Catholic Church near N 65th Ave, said, according to local media reports: "Anything that memorializes his name, his legacy, I think is a great thing... This area, our nation needs inspiration. I think he was very inspirational. He was a man of god, of family, and our country. And it could be a great idea."Escambia High School teacher Tara Hartman, who lives on the street in question, was reported as telling the commission: "My son does not stand with the views of Charlie Kirk, and therefore, he shouldn't have his address reflect that."Community activist Dianne Krumel reportedly said: "It's right there where Escambia High School is. And that goes back to the race riots that I lived through back in the early '70s," . "And for them to do something like this, for me, it's like pulling a scab off a wound that has healed... It's almost like a slap in the face and insult to the Black community."Kohler ultimately acknowledged the concerns, saying: "I listened to each and every one of you, and I'm not going to force that road on you... This was never about offending Black people. This was about literally fighting against political assassination."What's NextAfter withdrawing the motion, Kohler called for a broader community discussion on political violence and how to commemorate figures in ways that unify, rather than divide. Commissioner Lumon May formally moved to strike the renaming proposal from the agenda, which the board passed without dissent.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
