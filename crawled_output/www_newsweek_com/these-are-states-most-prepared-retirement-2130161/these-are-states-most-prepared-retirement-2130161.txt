U.S.RetirementseniorsPersonal financeMoneyStatesRankingsNews ArticleThese Are The States Most Prepared for RetirementPublishedSep 15, 2025 at 01:27 PM EDTupdatedSep 15, 2025 at 01:28 PM EDTBy Suzanne BlakeReporter, Consumer & Social TrendsShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberSeniors across the country are preparing for retirement, but how ready you are for those golden years can vary dramatically based on where you live.Cost of living for housing, transportation and healthcare can impact your retirement preparedness in addition to your financial assets and savings, and a new report from Caring.com ranked the best and worst states for this.Why It MattersSeniors are facing high inflation on everyday items like groceries, in addition to housing and healthcare.That, plus Social Security's impending funding shortfall, means that retirees need to be more financially prepared as they enter their life post-workforce....What To KnowCaring.com ranked the states based on average retirement income, savings, homeownership rates, and annual cost of a comfortable retirement.Delaware's average retirement income of $31,300/household, high 75 percent homeownership rate and personal savings caused the state to be ranked number 1 as the most prepared state for retirement.Also in the top five were Virginia, Connecticut, Minnesota and Illinois.The average amount Virginians saved to retire is $492,965, the sixth-highest retirement nest egg amount in the country, while Connecticut allows automatic enrollment in public sector retirement plans like 401(k)s. That brought Connecticut's average retiree savings to $545,754."States with a lower cost of living, no Social Security taxation, and low or no consumption taxes give retirees more breathing room," Kevin Thompson, the CEO of 9i Capital Group and the host of the 9innings podcast, told Newsweek."On the other hand, states that are less retirement-friendly usually have higher taxes or fewer amenities that matter to older populations—like easy access to healthcare and senior services."What People Are SayingThompson told Newsweek: "The common narrative is that cost of living makes the biggest difference, but I'd argue healthcare infrastructure might be even more important. Truly retirement-friendly states don't just look good on paper financially—they have hospitals, senior living facilities, and treatment centers within reach. That kind of accessibility can be life-saving, and it often gets overlooked in these rankings."Drew Powers, the founder of Illinois-based Powers Financial Group, told Newsweek: "Retirement needs are highly-individualized. Pre-retirees need to proceed with caution. One should not see a study that uses broad averages and apply that to their own situation, or worse yet, see that their state is better for retirement and use that as an excuse to delay their planning for another year. It simply won't work."Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: "The top states for retirement preparedness are a fascinating mixture that don't play into assumptions by most Americans of great landing spots for their golden years. From Connecticut to Iowa to New Mexico, the elements of all of these states that may have few other things in common are higher than average retiree savings, strong home ownership numbers, and a cost of living that may not always be affordable, but it's less than their geographical peers."Ultimately, preparedness is not as much about which state is the cheapest for retirees but rather which state masters multiple factors that set this age group up for a comfortable retirement."What Happens NextWhile homeownership affects how financially secure seniors feel in retirement alongside their savings and investments, inflation is also stalling retirees' financial comfort later in life."The reality is retirement is becoming harder to navigate as inflation stays persistent. That pushes retirees into riskier portfolio decisions just to keep pace with rising costs," Thompson said. "Comfort in retirement is no longer just about savings—it's about where you live, what access you have to care, and how well you can manage risk in a higher-inflation world."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting2 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
