NewsCharlie kirkTurning Point USAOklahomaNews ArticleTurning Point USA Planned for Every High School: Oklahoma Superintendent PublishedSep 23, 2025 at 10:00 PM EDTBy Robert BirselReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberOklahoma aims to become the first state to open a chapter of Turning Point USA—co-founded by assassinated conservative commentator Charlie Kirk—in every high school to resist “radical leftists ... (who) push woke indoctrination" of children, state schools superintendent Ryan Walters said. Why It MattersKirk, 31, was fatally shot during a question and answer session at Utah Valley University on September 10 during his "American Comeback Tour." A suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, is in custody, charged with aggravated murder and other offenses.The late activist played a key role in organizing young Republican voters through Turning Point, which organized students on high school and college campuses across the country. Conservatives have pledged to continue funding and supporting the organization following Kirk's death.What To KnowWalters said he had seen an outpouring from parents, teachers and students wanting to be involved with the organization.“They want their young people to be engaged in a process that understands free speech, open engagement, dialogue about American greatness, a dialogue around American values,” he said in a video posted to X in which he announced his plan for a Turning Point chapter in every state high school. “For far too long, we have seen radical leftists with the teachers' union dominate classrooms and push woke indoctrination of our kids. They fight parents' rights, they push parents out of the classroom and they lie to our kids about American history,” Walters said. Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, has been named the next CEO of Turning Point, which has seen a flood of donations and chapter requests following Kirk’s assassination.The organization wrote in a September 16 post to X that it had received more than 54,000 requests from high school or college students across the country to either begin a chapter or join an existing one. There were about 1,200 high school chapters and 900 college branches before the assassination, reported The Guardian.The organization has not publicly disclosed the exact amount it has raised through donations following Kirk's death.Walters, when asked in an interview with FOX 25 if his announcement on opening chapters was a mandate or a recommendation, said there will be repercussions for school districts that refuse to launch a chapter."We're saying, ‘look we need to have a Turning Point chapter in every school in Oklahoma.’ We want to be the first state to do that,” he said."I mean we would go after their accreditation. We would go after their certificates. So … they would be in danger of not being a school district if they decided to reject a club that is here to promote civic engagement.“Absolutely, they would be violating the law. They would be violating the rules set forth to them by our agency. So yeah, everything would be on the table in that scenario," Walters said.What People Are SayingWalters, in a letter to parents about his plan, posted on Facebook: “Charlie Kirk inspired a generation to love America, to speak boldly, and to never shy away from debate. Our kids must get involved and active. We will fight back against the liberal propaganda, pushed by the radical left, and the teachers unions. Our fight starts now.”What Happens NextLaw enforcement officials continue investigating Kirk’s assassination. Erika Kirk has announced her intention to lead Turning Point and further her late husband’s mission.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
