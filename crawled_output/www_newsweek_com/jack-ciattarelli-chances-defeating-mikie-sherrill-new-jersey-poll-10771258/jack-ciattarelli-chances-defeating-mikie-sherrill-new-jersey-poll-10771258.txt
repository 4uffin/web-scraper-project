PoliticsNew JerseyPollUS PoliticsDemocratsRepublicansNews ArticleJack Ciattarelli Chances of Defeating Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey—New PollPublishedSep 25, 2025 at 11:00 AM EDTBy Andrew StantonWeekend Staff WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberDemocratic Representative Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are in a “dead heat” in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, according to a new poll from Emerson College.Newsweek reached out to the Ciattarelli and Sherrill campaigns for comment via email.Why It MattersThe New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial elections are viewed as key bellwethers for the mood of the nation’s electorate ahead of the 2026 midterms, when Democrats are hoping for a 2018-style blue wave to lead them to victories across the country. If Democrats win big in this year’s elections, they may feel more optimistic about 2026. But Republicans outperforming expectations would be a red flag for the party.Sherrill, a moderate representing a suburban North Jersey district, has consistently led most polling of the race. Prior to the Emerson poll, every public poll except for one internal poll from Ciattarelli’s campaign has shown her with a lead. But both parties still consider it competitive, with just over a month until Election Day.What To KnowThe Emerson College poll released Thursday showed that both Ciattarelli and Sherrill received 43 percent support from New Jersey voters, while three percent said they would vote for someone else. An additional 11 percent remained undecided about whom they would vote for.Sherrill performs well with younger voters, winning 56 percent of those between the ages of 18 and 29, compared to 18 percent of the same age group backing Ciattarelli. But the Republican candidate does better with older voters, the poll found. There is also a gender divide—Sherrill is winning women by a 46-36 percent margin, while Ciattarelli is winning men by a 51-39 percent margin....The poll surveyed 935 likely voters from September 22 to September 23, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.The poll could be “part of a new trend,” but more surveys are needed to show similar results to know for sure that the race has narrowed, Ashley Koning, an assistant research professor and director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, told Newsweek on Thursday“We’re facing the wild west of polling methodology right now,” she said. “It becomes difficult to compare polls, because a lot of it comes down to basically apples and oranges, since everybody is using different modes and likely voting models and different questionnaire formatting, ordering and construction.”The race is going to be competitive and “undoubtingly” could narrow, she said, noting that it’s an open seat with no incumbent.New Jersey is historically a blue-leaning state, but Democrats’ margins have narrowed in recent years. The state voted for former President Joe Biden by nearly 16 points in 2020 and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 14 points in 2016. But in 2024, it backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by only about six points.Ciattarelli, a former state legislator, was also the GOP’s gubernatorial nominee in 2021, when he nearly unseated incumbent Democratic Governor Phil Murphy, losing by about three points.The Emerson poll comes just days after a Ciattarelli internal poll showed him up one point over Sherrill (46 percent to 45 percent). The poll, first reported by the New Jersey Globe, surveyed 600 likely voters from September 16 to September 18. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.A Quinnipiac University poll, conducted among 1,238 likely voters from September 11 to September 15, showed Sherrill leading by about nine points (51 percent to 42 percent). It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. A Rutgers University poll, which surveyed 1,650 likely voters from July 31 to August 11, showed Sherrill up 10 points (47 percent to 37 percent). It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.Utility hike rates and affordability have become the top issues in the race, Koning said.“It’s at the forefront of New Jerseyans’ minds. The utility hikes simply make that all the more tangible. I think we’ve seen a real discussion of these kitchen table issues by the candidates, talking about different taxes in New Jersey, talking about the rate hikes and potential rate freezes. I think a lot of messaging we’ve seen in past few weeks has centered around this, and the candidates really going after each other on both of these issues,” she said.What People Are SayingSpencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, wrote in a polling memo: “Both President Trump and Governor Murphy are underwater among Jersey voters. Sherrill is trying to tie Ciattarelli to Trump, at the national level, and Ciattarelli is trying to tie Sherrill to Murphy and the cost of living at the state level.”CNN data analyst Harry Enten said earlier in September: "Why am I saying it's a flashing red siren for Republicans? If the same party has won in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races dating back to 1989, guess who won the U.S. House the following year? Six out of seven times, the same party wins nationally, and they win the U.S. House of Representatives if in fact win in both Virginia and New Jersey."President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social: “Wow!!! A just out poll has Jack Ciattarelli essentially beating close to incompetent Mike Sherrill in the race for Governor of New Jersey. Jack is tough on crime and cutting taxes, two things that people really demand today. He will be a GREAT Governor, and Sherrill wants Open Borders (again!), men playing in Women’s Sports, Transgender for everyone, and all of the things that almost DESTROYED America. She is a big supporter of the perhaps future Communist Mayor of New York City! We need Jack in New Jersey!!! President DJT.”What Happens NextEarly voting in New Jersey will begin on October 25, according to the New Jersey Secretary of State's office. Forecasters give Sherrill an advantage, with both the Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball classifying the race as Leans Democrat.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
