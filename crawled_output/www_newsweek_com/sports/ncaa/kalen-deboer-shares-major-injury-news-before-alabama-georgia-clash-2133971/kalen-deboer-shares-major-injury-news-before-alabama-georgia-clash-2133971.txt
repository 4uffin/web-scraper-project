NCAAAlabama Crimson TideNCAA FootballCollege FootballGeorgia BulldogsNcaaNews ArticleKalen DeBoer Shares Major Injury News Before Alabama-Georgia ClashPublishedSep 22, 2025 at 05:55 PM EDTBy Matt AudiletContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberKalen DeBoer and the No. 17 Alabama Crimson Tide will travel to Athens for a top-25 SEC clash against Kirby Smart and the No. 6 Georgia Bulldogs on Saturday.And when they do, a pair of key contributors will be making their season debuts.Alabama opened the 2025 college football season with a disastrous 31-17 loss to the Florida State Seminoles. Since then, the team bounced back with dominant victories over UL Monroe and Wisconsin.The Crimson Tide had the week off this past weekend, allowing their injured players some extra time to recover. Now, both running back Jam Miller and defensive lineman Tim Keenan III are expected to make their 2025 debuts against the Bulldogs this weekend....More Football: Marcus Freeman Stands Firm Amid Criticism of Notre Dame's DefenseMiller has been out with a collarbone injury, but DeBoer expects him to be back on the field for Saturday's matchup against Georgia."I do expect him to go. He practiced yesterday," DeBoer said on Monday."Jam's a complete back all around. He's someone that we trust at the highest level. He's just been super consistent as a pass protector, not just as a guy who can carry the football."Loading twitter content...More Football: Nick Saban Sends Strong Wake-Up Call to Clemson's Dabo SwinneyKeenan injured his ankle before the Crimson Tide's season-opening loss to Florida State. Now recovered from his "tightrope" surgery, the veteran DL will return to the field on Saturday."He was voted team captain for a reason," DeBoer said of Keenan. "So the energy he's brought the last even two to three weeks, just his juice, and he's that way naturally. He loves this place. I think his perspective of being on the sideline has brought another level of energy to him that our defense and our whole team has responded to."And then on top of it, he's a big anchor, big body in there that can kind of hold down the line of scrimmage, get a push in the pocket on pass plays. So, it's good to have him back, and he's had a couple good days here, continued to build here through the week of practice is what we're expecting."Saturday's Alabama-Georgia game will kickoff at 7:30 p.m. ET.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
