SportsMLBNew York MetsNews ArticlePete Alonso Sends ‘Simple’ Message Amid Mets CollapsePublishedSep 23, 2025 at 08:32 AM EDTBy Aaliyan MohammedContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe New York Mets are still fighting to secure a wild card spot. The team is in a tight race with the Cincinnati Reds and Arizona Diamondbacks for the final spot in the National League.The Mets entered Tuesday tied with the Reds for the final spot. The Mets will take on the Chicago Cubs and Miami Marlins to finish the season and the Reds will take on the Pittsburgh Pirates and Milwaukee Brewers. The Mets have put themselves in a tough position, but Pete Alonso is not focused on that. He is only focused on what lies ahead."We’ve just got to win," Alonso said, per the New York Post's Dan Martin. "It’s that simple. Winning solves everything at this point. We’ve just got to do it."...The Mets were once in a position to compete for the division title. However, they have not played well in the second half. The rotation is relying on young arms, and injuries have plagued the team. Additionally, deadline additions have not worked out as the team had hoped.Regardless, the Mets have a talented roster. Juan Soto is having a great year and Francisco Lindor, Pete Alonso and Brandon Nimmo are all capable of making a huge impact in the final week of the regular season. The Mets were in a similar situation last year, and ended up making an improbable run to the postseason. The team did not clinch a postseason berth until the final day of the regular season. This year may not be much different.More MLB: Braves Cut Ties with Two Pitchers to Activate Charlie MortonRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
