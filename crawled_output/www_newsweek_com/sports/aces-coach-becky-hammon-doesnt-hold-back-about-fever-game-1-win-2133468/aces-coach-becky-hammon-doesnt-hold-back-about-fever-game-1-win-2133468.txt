She scored 34 points on 12-for-23 shooting. Odyssey Sims had a good game as well with 17 points, while Natasha Howard scored 12 points to go along with 11 rebounds.Read more: Caitlin Clark Delivers Strong Shoutout to Kelsey Mitchell After Fever's Playoff WinAs for the Aces, A'ja Wilson scored 16 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, but shot just 6-for-22 from the floor.

Following the game, Aces head coach Becky Hammon spoke out with a strong quote about Mitchell. She was not happy with the way her team allowed the Fever guard to get going on the offensive end of the court."[Fever] won all three categories and they played with a greater sense of urgency," Hammon said. "Clearly, we had no answer for [Kelsey] Mitchell‚Äîcouldn't even attempt to slow her down a little bit. I thought it was poor, really poor... she had a hot night and we let her get going."With Caitlin Clark out for the rest of the season, Mitchell has become the clear go-to player for Indiana. There is no excuse for not finding a way to slow her down.Outside of Clark, the Fever are missing plenty of other players. Among them are Sophie Cunningham, Chloe Bibby, and Aari McDonald. To see them still finding ways to win at a high level is incredibly impressive.Read more: WNBA Punishes Caitlin Clark For What She Said After Fever Playoff Win Over DreamObviously, Game 1 did not go according to plan for Hammon and Las Vegas. In Game 2, the Aces will need to figure out how to defend Mitchell.In a best-of-five series, losing one game is not a crushing blow. However, Las Vegas cannot allow their struggles to continue to the next game and head back to Indiana facing a 2-0 series deficit.Speaking of Game 2, that will be played on Tuesday night with tip time scheduled at 9:30 p.m. ET.For more on the Indiana Fever and all things WNBA, head to Newsweek Sports.
