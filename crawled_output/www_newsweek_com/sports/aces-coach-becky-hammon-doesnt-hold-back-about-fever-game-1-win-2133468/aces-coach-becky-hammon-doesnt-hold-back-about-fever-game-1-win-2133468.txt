Jackie Young led the way in scoring for Las Vegas with 19 points, while Dana Evans had 14 and Chelsea Gray had 13....Following the game, Aces head coach Becky Hammon spoke out with a strong quote about Mitchell. She was not happy with the way her team allowed the Fever guard to get going on the offensive end of the court."[Fever] won all three categories and they played with a greater sense of urgency," Hammon said. "Clearly, we had no answer for [Kelsey] Mitchell—couldn't even attempt to slow her down a little bit. I thought it was poor, really poor... she had a hot night and we let her get going."With Caitlin Clark out for the rest of the season, Mitchell has become the clear go-to player for Indiana. There is no excuse for not finding a way to slow her down.Outside of Clark, the Fever are missing plenty of other players. Among them are Sophie Cunningham, Chloe Bibby, and Aari McDonald. To see them still finding ways to win at a high level is incredibly impressive.Read more: WNBA Punishes Caitlin Clark For What She Said After Fever Playoff Win Over DreamObviously, Game 1 did not go according to plan for Hammon and Las Vegas.
