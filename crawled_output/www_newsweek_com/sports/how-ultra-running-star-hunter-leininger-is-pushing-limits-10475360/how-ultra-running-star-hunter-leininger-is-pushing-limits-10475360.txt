SportsRunningRacingColoradoMarathonNews ArticleHow Ultra-Running Star Hunter Leininger Is Pushing LimitsPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 05:00 AM EDTBy Joe KozlowskiSports Team LeadShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberRunning is a pretty universal experience. From children on the playground to adults simply trying to keep fit, there’s something understandable about lacing up your shoes and seeing how far your legs can take you.  Hunter Leininger does things a bit differently. He’s not going out for a jog around the block or even pushing to finish a marathon. Instead, he’s working with distances that cover states or an entire country—and setting records in the process.  “I love this long-distance running right now,” he told Newsweek ahead of one of his biggest endeavors: a 760-mile run across Colorado featuring 300,000 feet of elevation change. “I ran across Florida, ran across Iceland. Best experiences I’ve had in a long time. It’s like, all right, let’s run across Colorado, my favorite state.”  Favoritism can only count for so much, however. Running in Colorado brings altitude and, in the summer, all sorts of extreme weather into the equation. Beyond that, the sheer size of the state required him to run roughly two marathons a day for two weeks. And not only did Leininger traverse the Centennial State—with the additional challenges like hunkering down under a tarp amid lightning and hail—but he did so in what he hopes will be confirmed as an FKT, or fastest known time.  “We ended up beating it [the record] by over a week, so it took 18 days to run the whole thing, and it was just the craziest adventure ever—like the best I’ve ever felt and the worst I’ve ever felt in any record attempt I’ve ever done,” he said afterward.  Following in His Parents’ FootstepsWhile there might not be a Little League-style equivalent for extreme endurance events, Leininger still managed to catch the bug early on.  “My story begins, I guess, 17 years ago now. My dad was an adventure racer,” he said. “Adventure racing is basically an off-road triathlon. It’s running, biking and canoeing all off trails, all map and compass navigation.... My dad did that sport for years. And I was always out there watching him as a little kid and cheering him on. And there became a point when I was like 6 years old and I was like, ‘Hey Dad, can I join you for one of these races?’ And he was like, ‘Absolutely not. No kids are allowed to do this sport. It is way too dangerous.’”  But children are nothing if not persistent, and eventually Leininger found his way into the field.  “So after a year of begging him, [my dad] finally was like, ‘All right, I’ll let you come do a race just to like shut you up, so you stop asking.’ And we had to go through a lot of loopholes—how to get insurance just for myself to protect a kid from doing this race. But I finally went out there and did a race when I was 7 years old with him,” Leininger said.  After pushing the limits of adventure racing, his mother’s sport entered the picture.  ...“My mom was an ultra-runner, so she ran a 100-mile race and I was like, ‘I think I could do that. That sounds fun.’ So I signed up for a 100 miler off a whim and it was one of the worst experiences of my life,” Leininger said.  “It hurt so bad. The whole time my legs were killing me. I was crying. It was just like so painful. But I’m like, ‘All right, I don’t know what I’m doing here, but I’ve got to keep learning how to figure this out.’ And it just basically hooked me from there.”  Building a FoundationLeininger’s experiences prove that physical preparation and mental fortitude have to enter the picture, but what does that foundation look when you’re planning to run across an entire state—especially when you can’t put in the full distance ahead of time? “I think it’s almost physically impossible to train for a [760]-mile run,” Leininger said. “Nobody can really do that because it’s so long to put in that much mileage. You would get injured in your training leading up to it.  “The mindset...with these longer things is, the first few days trains you for the next few days, then [that] trains you for the next few days. So...all I had to really train for was 150 miles.”  “If I average 50 miles a day...[and] get through the first three days...[then] that’s going to train you for the next three days, and then go forth from there.” With that solid foundation, Leininger could focus on the know-how. “When it comes to these really long expedition races, most of it comes down to the experience and the mindset,” he said. While he agrees that “physically you need to be in shape,” Leininger said “a lot of it’s like, I know what happens when I’m 30 hours into a nonstop push. I’m super sleep-deprived and I can’t keep eyes open, and I’m stumbling everywhere and my toes are infected because they’re blistered so bad. I know what to do when that happens. That comes from experience. If I was the most trained person ever but didn’t have the experience that I’ve had over the past 17 years, I would probably quit when all those things went wrong.”  Yet managing fatigue and discomfort is only half of the battle. Adding doubt and fear only increases the burden. With that in mind, Leininger prefers to focus on the positives, even if they might not seem obvious.  “The biggest mindset thing that I go back to is just being grateful for everything,” he said. “Grateful that my feet are so messed up and I have blisters and I’m cramping all over and like the weather’s horrible. I’m just grateful for it all because, yeah, my blisters on my feet hurt really bad, but I’m grateful that I still have feet. Some people out there don’t have legs, and they would wish they could feel pain like I feel right now.”  “Being even grateful for the horrible things that are happening to me is my superpower.... I could be on the highest high and feeling amazing and you’re seeing me out there with big smile, super happy because I’m grateful for how great everything feels. But I’m the exact same way when everything’s falling apart and like I end up in the ER,” he said. As with the physical side of things, the hardest-earned lessons make the biggest difference. “It finally ticked over a few years ago and it’s like ever since then, it’s like every tough adventure I’ve done, it’s been easy in my head because it’s like, ‘What? I’m still alive, I’m still going, this is amazing.’”  Running Through SicknessIt was this mentality that helped carry Leininger through his record-setting Colorado run, which began on July 1, though some challenges did arise early in the adventure. “The week before I started I got pretty sick,” he said. “I actually postponed the start date by a few days so I could recover a little bit more, and I started feeling a little better. So, I was like, ‘Oh, I might as well just start this thing.’  “And within an hour of starting it, my heart rate was exponentially higher. I was coughing so much. I couldn’t breathe that well and I was like, ‘Oh man, this is going to be a long, long 760 miles here.’ But I just believed that it would go away and I took it a little easier the first day, took it a little easier the second day, but I was just getting more and more sick. It didn’t really go away. And I basically dealt with the sickness for the entire run. That was definitely the worst part of it.”  If that combined with the altitude wasn’t enough, thunderstorms also rolled through regularly. But even in those moments, gratitude—inspired by the landscape—was still his secret weapon.  ...“Every single mile was absolutely breathtaking,” Leininger said. “I think this run was the easiest for me because it was just so beautiful. I’ve run the length of Florida and I love Florida, but it’s not super-stunning all the time. With this, it was truly like every mile I would like stop and just look around and be like, ‘Where am I? This is just amazing.’ Like even when I’m suffering and everything’s falling apart and I can’t breathe, I’m coughing, I feel really sick, I would just get out of my head and just stop for a second, just look around and just like pinch myself and be so grateful...And it was like, ‘Just keep moving.’”  Inspiring Others Over the years, Leininger has taken a similar approach to setting records. What originally started out as a point of pride has evolved to something more: showing others a potential way forward.  “I don’t really care about the record,” he said. “Even if the record doesn’t get verified, whatever.... That doesn’t change anything. I don’t need a trophy on my shelf to look back and be like, ‘That represents this entire thing.’ For me, what represents the whole thing was just the whole experience of the training leading up to it, the prep. The miles, each mile was so special to me. Those are the things I look back on.   “The world records, for me, it’s for everybody else. It’s for people to be inspired and really just understand what I’m going through and what I did, and to give them hope that they could do something just like that. So that’s why I continue doing them.” Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
