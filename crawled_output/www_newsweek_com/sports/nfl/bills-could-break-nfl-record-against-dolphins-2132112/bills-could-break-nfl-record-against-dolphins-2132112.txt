NFLBuffalo BillsMiami DolphinsRecordsNews ArticleBills Could Break NFL Record Against DolphinsPublishedSep 18, 2025 at 03:46 PM EDTBy Reice ShipleyContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberOn paper, the Buffalo Bills stand to be heavy favorites to come away with a victory against the Miami Dolphins on Thursday night given how the season has gone for the two teams thus far. But when you look deeper into the history between the two teams when playing at Highmark Stadium, things are even more lopsided in the Bills favor.The Bills have not only beaten the Miami Dolphins in their last eight home matchups. But in those games, Bills star quarterback Josh Allen has looked dominant doing so, throwing for multiple touchdowns in the eight home matchups he has played in against the Dolphins....According to OptaStats on X, Allen's eight multi-passing touchdown games that the Bills have won over the Dolphins is tied for an NFL record, which the Bills could very well break in their Week 3 matchup with their AFC East rivals on Thursday night.Loading twitter content...More news: Chiefs' Travis Kelce Defends Patrick Mahomes After Costly MistakeIt's particularly impressive to see this kind of dominance from the Bills over the Dolphins when you consider the fact that the Dolphins have largely been a very solid team in that timeframe, finishing with a winning record in four of the seven seasons that this stat dates back to.This stat certainly doesn't bode well for a Dolphins team that is desperately looking for answers after a rough start to the 2025 season. And based on just how bad the Dolphins defense has looked thus far this season, the Bills may very well end up breaking this NFL record.Thus far in 2025, the Dolphins have allowed the seventh most total yards, while allowing the second-most points of any team in football. And their defensive struggles will likely only be amplified on Thursday night going up against a Bills offense led by the reigning MVP that ranks first in yards-per-game on the year.More news: 49ers' Kyle Shanahan Shares Major Brock Purdy Injury UpdateJust about every metric you could possible point to would suggest that the Bills should be able to walk through the Dolphins in Thursday's matchup. So unless we see a Dolphins team that shows up looking much different than the team we have seen to this point, it may be a mere formality that the Dolphins will fall to 0-3 on the season.For more on the Buffalo Bills and all things NFL, head over to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesPoliticsDemocrats React to Jimmy Kimmel’s Return from Suspension3 min. readPoliticsDonald Trump Tells Pregnant Women to ‘Tough it Out,’ Avoid Tylenol4 min. readPoliticsWhat We Know and Don’t Know About Trump’s H-1B Crackdown7 min. readPoliticsMap Shows Health Care H-1B Visas by State as Trump Floats Fee Exemption6 min. readPoliticsWhite House Shares Update on Antifa Crackdown as Trump Order Nears4 min. readPoliticsTrump Admin Vows to ‘Defend Every Inch of NATO’ After Russian Violations3 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
