NFLBuffalo BillsMiami DolphinsRecordsNews ArticleBills Could Break NFL Record Against DolphinsPublishedSep 18, 2025 at 03:46 PM EDTBy Reice ShipleyContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberOn paper, the Buffalo Bills stand to be heavy favorites to come away with a victory against the Miami Dolphins on Thursday night given how the season has gone for the two teams thus far. But when you look deeper into the history between the two teams when playing at Highmark Stadium, things are even more lopsided in the Bills favor.The Bills have not only beaten the Miami Dolphins in their last eight home matchups. But in those games, Bills star quarterback Josh Allen has looked dominant doing so, throwing for multiple touchdowns in the eight home matchups he has played in against the Dolphins....According to OptaStats on X, Allen's eight multi-passing touchdown games that the Bills have won over the Dolphins is tied for an NFL record, which the Bills could very well break in their Week 3 matchup with their AFC East rivals on Thursday night.Loading twitter content...More news: Chiefs' Travis Kelce Defends Patrick Mahomes After Costly MistakeIt's particularly impressive to see this kind of dominance from the Bills over the Dolphins when you consider the fact that the Dolphins have largely been a very solid team in that timeframe, finishing with a winning record in four of the seven seasons that this stat dates back to.This stat certainly doesn't bode well for a Dolphins team that is desperately looking for answers after a rough start to the 2025 season. And based on just how bad the Dolphins defense has looked thus far this season, the Bills may very well end up breaking this NFL record.Thus far in 2025, the Dolphins have allowed the seventh most total yards, while allowing the second-most points of any team in football. And their defensive struggles will likely only be amplified on Thursday night going up against a Bills offense led by the reigning MVP that ranks first in yards-per-game on the year.More news: 49ers' Kyle Shanahan Shares Major Brock Purdy Injury UpdateJust about every metric you could possible point to would suggest that the Bills should be able to walk through the Dolphins in Thursday's matchup. So unless we see a Dolphins team that shows up looking much different than the team we have seen to this point, it may be a mere formality that the Dolphins will fall to 0-3 on the season.For more on the Buffalo Bills and all things NFL, head over to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
