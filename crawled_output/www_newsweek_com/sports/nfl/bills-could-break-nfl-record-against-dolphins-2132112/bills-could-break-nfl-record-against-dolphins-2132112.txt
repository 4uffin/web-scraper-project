NFLBuffalo BillsMiami DolphinsRecordsNews ArticleBills Could Break NFL Record Against DolphinsPublishedSep 18, 2025 at 03:46 PM EDTBy Reice ShipleyContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberOn paper, the Buffalo Bills stand to be heavy favorites to come away with a victory against the Miami Dolphins on Thursday night given how the season has gone for the two teams thus far. But when you look deeper into the history between the two teams when playing at Highmark Stadium, things are even more lopsided in the Bills favor.The Bills have not only beaten the Miami Dolphins in their last eight home matchups. But in those games, Bills star quarterback Josh Allen has looked dominant doing so, throwing for multiple touchdowns in the eight home matchups he has played in against the Dolphins....According to OptaStats on X, Allen's eight multi-passing touchdown games that the Bills have won over the Dolphins is tied for an NFL record, which the Bills could very well break in their Week 3 matchup with their AFC East rivals on Thursday night.Loading twitter content...More news: Chiefs' Travis Kelce Defends Patrick Mahomes After Costly MistakeIt's particularly impressive to see this kind of dominance from the Bills over the Dolphins when you consider the fact that the Dolphins have largely been a very solid team in that timeframe, finishing with a winning record in four of the seven seasons that this stat dates back to.This stat certainly doesn't bode well for a Dolphins team that is desperately looking for answers after a rough start to the 2025 season. And based on just how bad the Dolphins defense has looked thus far this season, the Bills may very well end up breaking this NFL record.Thus far in 2025, the Dolphins have allowed the seventh most total yards, while allowing the second-most points of any team in football. And their defensive struggles will likely only be amplified on Thursday night going up against a Bills offense led by the reigning MVP that ranks first in yards-per-game on the year.More news: 49ers' Kyle Shanahan Shares Major Brock Purdy Injury UpdateJust about every metric you could possible point to would suggest that the Bills should be able to walk through the Dolphins in Thursday's matchup. So unless we see a Dolphins team that shows up looking much different than the team we have seen to this point, it may be a mere formality that the Dolphins will fall to 0-3 on the season.For more on the Buffalo Bills and all things NFL, head over to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting3 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
