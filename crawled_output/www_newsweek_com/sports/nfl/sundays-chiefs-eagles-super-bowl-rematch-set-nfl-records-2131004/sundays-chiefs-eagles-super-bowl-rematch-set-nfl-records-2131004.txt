NFLKansas City ChiefsPhiladelphia EaglesPatrick MahomesNews ArticleSunday’s Chiefs-Eagles Super Bowl Rematch Set NFL RecordsPublishedSep 17, 2025 at 10:00 AM EDTBy Robert MarviContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThere has been talk over the last few years that ratings for NFL games have been down and that some fans have stopped watching the league for various reasons. But football remains the most popular sport in our nation, and one game this past Sunday was proof of how much NFL football is still a robust beast when it comes to ratings.The marquee matchup of Week 2 was the Kansas City Chiefs taking on the Philadelphia Eagles in a rematch of February's Super Bowl. It was an opportunity for Patrick Mahomes and crew to avenge their blowout loss in the big game to the Eagles, while the Eagles had the opportunity to prove that they truly deserved to call themselves world champions.The contest, which was broadcast on Fox, not only got strong ratings, but it was actually the network's most-watched Sunday NFL telecast in its 32 seasons of televising games. It also set three other viewership records, and overall, 33.8 million people tuned in to watch.Loading twitter content...Read more: Eagles' Jalen Hurts Savagely Trolls Chiefs' Chris Jones Following WinChiefs games over the last year or two have been doing well in terms of ratings, and it is no doubt partly due to the influence of pop superstar Taylor Swift. Swift hooked up with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce during the 2023 season, and the two recently got engaged.Sunday's game was a bit closer than that championship matchup this past winter. Kansas City forged a 10-7 lead in the second quarter when Mahomes rushed for a touchdown, but it would be the last lead the team would hold that day.Philly scored 13 unanswered points to double-up the Chiefs, 20-10, in the fourth quarter, and while a Tyquan Thornton touchdown with just over three minutes left made it a three-point game, the Chiefs wouldn't get the football back....The Chiefs are now 0-2 on the season, and they seem to be in some trouble. Not too many teams that start 0-2 end up making the playoffs, and Kansas City has some tough games coming up over the next two months.But there is also a sense that they may be OK. Wide receiver Rashee Rice, arguably their biggest threat in their passing game, has served two games of his six-game suspension, and Thornton has filled in nicely for Rice so far.Read more: Jalen Hurts Joins Joe Burrow in Exclusive Patrick Mahomes-Related ClubMeanwhile, the Eagles are 2-0 and haven't really shown any signs of a championship hangover so far. They will face three more strong opponents in the Los Angeles Rams, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Denver Broncos over the next three weeks.For more on the Chiefs and Eagles, as well as general NFL news, head over to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
