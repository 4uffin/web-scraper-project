NFLPhiladelphia EaglesNews ArticleNick Sirianni Doesn’t Hold Back on Jalen Hurts Play-Calling RumorsPublishedSep 23, 2025 at 11:35 PM EDTBy Matt AudiletContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Philadelphia Eagles improved to 3-0 this season with a thrilling 33-26 victory over the visiting Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.While the Eagles ultimately came out victorious, it wasn't necessarily pretty early on.The Philadelphia offense looked completely stagnant for much of the game. When the Rams took a 26-7 lead in the third quarter, a chorus of boos rained down from the home fans at Lincoln Financial Field.From that point on, the Eagles offense completely turned on its head. After two full quarters of conservative play-calling, Jalen Hurts and his offensive unit began employing a far more aggressive attack.Hurts led the Eagles' furious comeback, throwing three unanswered touchdown passes. The reigning Super Bowl MVP got all of his weapons involved, connecting with tight end Dallas Goedert, and receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith for TD scores.The change from half to half was so stark that rumors began to swirl about who was calling the shots in the third and fourth quarters. Some fans got the impression that Hurts took over the play calls from first-year offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo.Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni shut down that theory with a clear response on Monday."Kevin (Patullo) called the plays yesterday in the second half. But make no mistake, Jalen communicates — Jalen sees the field really, really well," Sirianni said, via Zach Berman of The Athletic.Loading twitter content...More Football: Cowboys' Jerry Jones Responds to Backlash Over CeeDee Lamb DecisionHurts finished Sunday's game with 226 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions while completing 21 of his 32 passes. Much of that production came as the Eagles mounted their second-half comeback.Brown led the way in the receiving game with six catches for 109 yards and a touchdown — marking his best game of the 2025 season so far. Smith also put together an impressive stat line, reeling in eight catches for 60 yards and a score.“Now, we completely did that to ourselves in the first half and that’s something we got to fix. It’s as simple as that. It’s unacceptable,” Hurts said in his postgame interview with Fox Sports' Pam Oliver.“We play so many styles of football where in that first half we got to get out of this playing not to lose," he continued. "We got to come out aggressive and play our game. You saw our game in the second half.”More Football: Jerry Jones Sends Strong Message to Micah Parsons Before Packers-CowboysLoading twitter content...The Eagles travel to Tampa Bay this Sunday to face the Buccaneers in a Week 4 battle of unbeaten teams.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
