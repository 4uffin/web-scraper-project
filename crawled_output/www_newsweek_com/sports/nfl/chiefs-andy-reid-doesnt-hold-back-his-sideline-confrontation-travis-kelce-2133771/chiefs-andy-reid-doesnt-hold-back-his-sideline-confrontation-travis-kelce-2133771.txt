Many Kansas City Chiefs fans likely had flashbacks to Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas two years ago during Sunday's Week 3 matchup against the New York Giants.Following a Harrison Butker missed 40-yard field goal late in the second quarter, star tight end Travis Kelce confronted head coach Andy Reid on the sideline.The 10-time Pro Bowler bumped into his 67-year-old head coach in an incident that was similar to the one that played out during their Super Bowl matchup against the San Francisco 49ers in February 2024, in which a visibly upset Kelce grabbed Reid by the arm and shouted at him for a few seconds.Reid told reporters after that game that he appreciated Kelce's passion and harbored no hard feelings for the incident, while the All-Pro pass-catcher admitted on his "New Heights" podcast that he wasn't proud of the way he vented his frustration.More NFL: Cowboys' CeeDee Lamb Provides Major Injury Update on Himself

More NFL: 49ers' Kyle Shanahan Reveals Concerning Details About Nick Bosa's Injury"I can't get that fired up to the point where I'm bumping coach and it's getting him off balance and stuff," Kelce stated. "When he stumbled, I was just like, 'Oh [expletive]' in my head. Yeah, I know [there's better ways to handle things]. I'm a passionate guy."Reid didn't have a problem with Kelce's behavior back then, and he didn't seem to have an issue with it when the 35-year-old TE purposely bumped into him on Sunday night against the Giants.I actually think this is positive. I like seeing Andy Reid get passionate even with all his success,
and still having no fear getting into Travis Kelce's grill. #Chiefspic.twitter.com/eW4NlkTtkM‚Äî JosinaAnderson (@JosinaAnderson) September 22, 2025

"I've been through a lot of things with him, so that's all part of it. I love that he loves to play the game. That's what I love."More NFL: Steelers-Tyreek Hill Trade Rumors Get Major Update
