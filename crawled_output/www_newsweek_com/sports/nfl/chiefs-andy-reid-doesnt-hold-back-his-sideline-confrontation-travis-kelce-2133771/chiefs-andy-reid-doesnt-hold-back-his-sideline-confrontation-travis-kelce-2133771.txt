NFLKansas City ChiefsTravis KelceNews ArticleChiefs’ Andy Reid Doesn’t Hold Back on His Sideline Confrontation With Travis KelcePublishedSep 22, 2025 at 11:36 AM EDTupdatedSep 22, 2025 at 07:11 PM EDTBy Michael GallagherContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberMany Kansas City Chiefs fans likely had flashbacks to Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas two years ago during Sunday's Week 3 matchup against the New York Giants.Following a Harrison Butker missed 40-yard field goal late in the second quarter, star tight end Travis Kelce confronted head coach Andy Reid on the sideline.The 10-time Pro Bowler bumped into his 67-year-old head coach in an incident that was similar to the one that played out during their Super Bowl matchup against the San Francisco 49ers in February 2024, in which a visibly upset Kelce grabbed Reid by the arm and shouted at him for a few seconds.Reid told reporters after that game that he appreciated Kelce's passion and harbored no hard feelings for the incident, while the All-Pro pass-catcher admitted on his "New Heights" podcast that he wasn't proud of the way he vented his frustration.More NFL: Cowboys' CeeDee Lamb Provides Major Injury Update on Himself...More NFL: 49ers' Kyle Shanahan Reveals Concerning Details About Nick Bosa's Injury"I can't get that fired up to the point where I'm bumping coach and it's getting him off balance and stuff," Kelce stated. "When he stumbled, I was just like, 'Oh [expletive]' in my head. Yeah, I know [there's better ways to handle things]. I'm a passionate guy."Reid didn't have a problem with Kelce's behavior back then, and he didn't seem to have an issue with it when the 35-year-old TE purposely bumped into him on Sunday night against the Giants.Loading twitter content...More NFL: Buccaneers Announce Troubling Mike Evans Update After Win Over JetsThe three-time Super Bowl champion was asked by NBC Sports sideline reporter Melissa Stark at halftime about the dust-up between himself and Kelce."That's OK — we needs some juice, so that's good," Reid stated.He addressed the scuffle again during his postgame media availability, surprisingly defending Kelce's actions as just a passionate player getting a little carried away."He's a passionate guy and I love that part," Reid said, via KC Sports Network. "I've been through a lot of things with him, so that's all part of it. I love that he loves to play the game. That's what I love."More NFL: Steelers-Tyreek Hill Trade Rumors Get Major UpdateRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
