NFLDallas CowboysNews ArticleCowboys Linked to Major WR Trade Following CeeDee Lamb InjuryPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 10:35 AM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 10:09 AM EDTBy Evan MasseyContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Dallas Cowboys hold a 1-2 record as they head into their Week 4 showdown on Sunday Night Football against the Green Bay Packers. Unfortunately, the team will enter this week's game facing a major injury issue.CeeDee Lamb, the Cowboys' star wide receiver, went down with an ankle injury against the Chicago Bears. He's expected to miss at least two games due to the injury. It's a huge blow for the team's offense.Losing Lamb is an eye-opening reality for Dallas. Should he or George Pickens go down with a more serious injury, the team would be in trouble. Behind those two wideouts, the Cowboys have Jalen Tolbert and KaVontae Turpin as their top wideouts.Both of those players are quality players, but the offense won't be able to survive without Lamb and Pickens both on the field.Read more: Bears’ Ben Johnson Doesn’t Hold Back About Caleb WilliamsTo that end, a trade idea has been suggested for Dallas. It would be a major trade to land a talented young wide receiver for Dak Prescott to work with.Kristopher Knox of Bleacher Report has suggested the Cowboys as a top potential landing spot for Carolina Panthers wide receiver Xavier Legette.Legette has gotten off to a brutal start to the 2025 NFL season. After showing promise during his rookie season last year, Legette has caught just four passes for eight yards in two games this year.Speaking of his promising rookie season in 2024, Legette racked up 49 catches for 497 yards and four touchdowns. Coming into the 2025 campaign, there were many who expected the 24-year-old wide receiver to be a huge breakout candidate. That obviously has not happened yet.In addition to suggesting Dallas as a possible trade suitor for Legette, Knox also suggested what kind of price tag it would take to acquire him. He believes that Legette could be had for a conditional 2026 third-round pick.Read more: Colts Linked to Major Quarterback Move to Replace Daniel JonesShould that actually be the price tag, the Cowboys should look into the option. Legette still has some time playing on his rookie contract and he could provide another impact target for Prescott in the passing game. It will be interesting to see if Jerry Jones and company look to make a move to beef up the team's offensive depth. Legette would be one way to do just that.For more on the Dallas Cowboys and general NFL news, head over to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
