NFLPhiladelphia EaglesNews ArticleDrew Brees Takes Major Shot at ‘Boring’ Eagles OffensePublishedSep 24, 2025 at 10:42 AM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 10:43 AM EDTBy James BrizuelaContributing WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Philadelphia Eagles have been catching a lot of flak this season, but that has everything to do with the currently controversial "tush push" play.More news: Packers’ Micah Parsons Sends Four-Word Warning to Dak PrescottThe NFL rules committee nearly banned the play in the offseason, and more people are now coming to the conclusion that the play might be altered or banned at some point soon. The Eagles have perfected the play, but there is video evidence pointing to players jumping offside to ensure the play is successful. Either way, the Eagles are certainly catching a lot of heat over that specific play. Now, the team is also catching some heat from NFL legend Drew Brees.Brees joined "First Take" to discuss the Eagles, and he let it be known that he is not a fan of the offense. In fact, he called the offense "boring."Loading twitter content...“I respect Philly. They are winning games…..I can’t stand to watch that offense. It’s the most boring offense," Brees stated.Brees also said that he respects the Eagles and understands they are winning a lot of games. However, he did state that Philadelphia has a "boring" offense. He also stated that he will wait to see how things play out, as the NFL is only heading into Week 4.More news: Texans Shockingly Release Former Interceptions Leader Amid 0-3 StartIt is a bit strange that Brees would say he is not a fan of the Eagles, who currently house Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, A.J. Brown, and DeVonta Smith. All of these players are molded into one of the better offenses in the league.Brees could be pointing to the "tush push," which is becoming far more frequent. Still, the Eagles are 3-0, and are heading into a major game with the also undefeated Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This could very well be a preview of the NFC Championship.For more on the Eagles and NFL, head to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
