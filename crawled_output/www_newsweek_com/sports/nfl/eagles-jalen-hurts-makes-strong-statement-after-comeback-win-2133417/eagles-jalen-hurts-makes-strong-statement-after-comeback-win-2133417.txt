Completely. That's something we gotta fix. It's as simple as that. It's unacceptable.""We gotta come out aggressive and play our game. You saw our game in the second half," Hurts said.The Eagles star called it a "gritty" win but said "everbody got together and made plays" when necessary.Loading twitter content..."We will fix the things that we need to fix," Hurts also stated.While Hurts didn't throw any interceptions or get sacked, he fumbled and lost the ball once during the game. Despite that mistake and others by Philadelphia, Hurts led his team on an impressive 91-yard drive to get the lead.The late-game heroics included Davis' huge blocked field goal in the fourth quarter, which the defensive tackle returned 61 yards for a touchdown.With the win, the Eagles improved to 3-0 on the season.
