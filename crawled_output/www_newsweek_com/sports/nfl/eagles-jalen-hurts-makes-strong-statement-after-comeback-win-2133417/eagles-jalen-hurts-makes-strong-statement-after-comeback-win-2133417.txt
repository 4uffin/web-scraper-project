On Sunday, it appeared the undefeated Philadelphia Eagles might suffer their first loss against the Los Angeles Rams. Despite being down double digits into the second half, the defending champions kept fighting until they captured a 33-26 win.The Eagles' thrilling win wouldn't be possible without quarterback Jalen Hurts, who threw for three touchdowns and 226 yards. He also ran for 40 yards and another touchdown on the ground.Hurts' three touchdown recipients also performed well. A.J. Brown led all receivers with six receptions for 109 yards, while DeVonta Smith had 60 yards, and Dallas Goedert recorded 33 yards.Read more: Terry Bradshaw Sounds Off on Bears' Caleb Williams StrugglesThat made up for a rough outing from star running back Saquon Barkley, who finished with 46 rushing yards on 18 carries.However, several defensive stars also came up big. Jalen Carter and Jordan Davis blocked two field goals, including one that would've won the game for the Rams.Following his team's impressive comeback victory, Hurts shared his postgame thoughts with Fox Sports' sideline reporter Pam Oliver.

Hurts had to collect his thoughts momentarily before saying, "It's always good to get a win.""If that doesn't show you what type of team we are, I don't know what does," he said, adding,"We completely did that to ourselves in the first half. Completely. That's something we gotta fix. It's as simple as that. It's unacceptable.""We gotta come out aggressive and play our game. You saw our game in the second half," Hurts said.The Eagles star called it a "gritty" win but said "everbody got together and made plays" when necessary."If that doesn't show you what type of team we are, I don't know what does."

"We will fix the things that we need to fix," Hurts also stated.While Hurts didn't throw any interceptions or get sacked, he fumbled and lost the ball once during the game. Despite that mistake and others by Philadelphia, Hurts led his team on an impressive 91-yard drive to get the lead.The late-game heroics included Davis' huge blocked field goal in the fourth quarter, which the defensive tackle returned 61 yards for a touchdown.With the win, the Eagles improved to 3-0 on the season. They also remain among strong favorites to win the Super Bowl. The defending champions are currently tied with the Green Bay Packers at +700 at Fanduel Sportsbook. They trail only the AFC's Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens.Read more: Panthers Receive Major Injury Update for Falcons GameFor more about the Philadelphia Eagles and NFL, visit Newsweek Sports.
