NFLLos Angeles ChargersLas Vegas RaidersNews ArticleAmazing Stat Illustrates How Chargers’ Defense Suffocated the RaidersPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 09:35 PM EDTBy Robert MarviContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Los Angeles Chargers may not be a legitimate Super Bowl contender right now. But a growing number of people seem to be picking the team to finish first in the AFC West.Los Angeles went 11-6 and made the playoffs last season in Jim Harbaugh's first go-around as its head coach. This season, its key players are a little more seasoned and used to Harbaugh's system, and Harbaugh, in turn, has opened up the offense a little bit for quarterback Justin Herbert.But, in true Harbaugh fashion, it is defense that is carrying the 2-0 Chargers. Through two games, they rank third in points allowed and first in passing touchdowns given up. In fact, in their 20-9 win on Monday over the Las Vegas Raiders, they had a whopping seven players with at least two passes defended, which is tied for the most such players in one game since the stat was first kept in 1999.Loading twitter content...Read more: Tom Brady Was Seen in Raiders' Coaching Booth During Chargers GameHarbaugh's teams in both college and the NFL have always played defense like Secret Service men. Last year, L.A. led everyone in points given up and allowed over 20 points in just four regular-season games.On Monday, it forced Raiders quarterback Geno Smith into three interceptions without giving up a single touchdown. Smith, who had a 70.4% pass completion rate last year, completed just 24 of his 43 pass attempts....On the other side of the football, the Chargers are still a work in progress, but they are making progress. Herbert is playing outstanding football, and while their running game has been very pedestrian, their air attack is looking good.Quentin Johnson, a third-year wide receiver who had been considered a disappointment, has 150 yards and three touchdowns on just eight catches this season. Veteran WR Keenan Allen, who spent his first 11 seasons with the Chargers, is back after playing for the Chicago Bears in 2024, and he has caught 12 passes for 129 yards and two touchdowns this year.Read more: Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs Have a Major Issue That Could Derail 2025This coming Sunday, L.A. will host the Denver Broncos, another up-and-coming young team in the AFC West that has been winning with defense. A third win would serve notice that the Bolts could wreak some real havoc across the league the rest of the way.For more on the Chargers and general NFL news, head over to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting2 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
