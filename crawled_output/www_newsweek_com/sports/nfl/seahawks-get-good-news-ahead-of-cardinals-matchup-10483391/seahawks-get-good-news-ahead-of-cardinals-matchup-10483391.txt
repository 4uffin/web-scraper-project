NFLSeattle seahawksFootballNews ArticleSeahawks Get Good News Ahead of Cardinals MatchupPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 09:59 PM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 10:57 PM EDTBy Anne EricksonShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Seattle Seahawks are coming off their second win of the season, and they're looking to make that three by the end of Thursday night. The team will travel to Glendale to face the Arizona Cardinals in a key NFC West challenge at State Farm Stadium on "Thursday Night Football."Ahead of the game, the Seahawks got some good news regarding a few of their key players. On Wednesday, the team released its newest injury report showing who's in and who's out for the Cardinals matchup, and it shows that Seattle is getting back two important members of its secondary.The Seahawks will have Pro-Bowl defensive backs Devon Witherspoon and Julian Love back on the field after both missed last week's game due to injuries. They don't have game-status designations for Thursday's matchup, as both are expected to be on the field. Though they were able to pull off a strong win last weekend without both players, getting Witherspoon and Love back should be a big boost for the Seahawks....The injury report also sheds some light on players who won't be going up against the Cardinals. Safety Nick Emmanwori, who's dealing with an ankle injury, is listed as doubtful, and running back Zach Charbonnet, who's nursing a foot injury, is listed as questionable. Others who are questionable for Thursday's game include outside linebacker Boye Mafe, who is dealing with a toe injury, and Anthony Bradford, who has a back injury.Backup offensive tackle Josh Jones has been ruled out for the Cardinals game because of an ankle injury. The Seahawks also put fullback Robbie Ouzts on injured reserve on Wednesday due to an ankle injury.In some additions to the lineup, Seattle also signed safety D'Anthony Bell off of its practice squad and added him to the 53-man roster ahead of Week 4, and the team also signed safety Jerrick Reed II to the practice squad just one day after waiving him. Tight end Elijah Arroyo, linebacker Ernest Jones IV, center Jalen Sundell, and defensive end Leonard Williams all appeared on the injury report recently but appear to be a go for Thursday's contest.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
