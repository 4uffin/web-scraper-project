NFLSan Francisco 49ersNews Article49ers Have Made Big Franchise Decision Ahead of Week 4PublishedSep 25, 2025 at 10:37 AM EDTBy Robert MarviContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe San Francisco 49ers, despite numerous injuries to their key players, have a 3-0 record, and they look revitalized and more stable after the disaster that was their 2024 season. Star defensive end Nick Bosa is out for the year after tearing his ACL in Week 3, but several of their young prospects have stepped up on defense, and second-year Ricky Pearsall is starting to look like a star in the making.Off the field, the 49ers have gone through some changes in recent months. In May, they sold a 6.2% minority stake in the franchise, and they have now struck a deal to sell 3.2% of the team, per Sports Business Journal."The 49ers have a deal in place to sell 3.2% of the franchise to Fortress Investment Group Managing Partner/Board Chairman Pete Briger Jr., sources said," wrote Ben Fischer. "The deal is said to be at the same valuation as the club’s divestment in May, sources said, or $8.6B."Briger, based in Menlo Park outside S.F., joins a roster of 49ers limited partners that is becoming a Who’s Who of Silicon Valley. In May, Sun Microsystems co-founder and Khosla Ventures founder Vinod Khosla, Bessemer Venture Partners partner Byron Deeter and ICONIQ Capital partner Will Griffith and their families bought about 6.2% of the team."Read more: Undefeated 49ers Ranked Lower Than Chiefs in Wild Power RankingsThe team's $8.6 billion valuation reportedly set a new record for a sports team valuation during a sale. According to CNBC, the Niners are the eighth-most valuable team in the NFL.The franchise's modern history began in 1977 when Edward DeBartolo Jr. bought it. Within a few years, it started to stack up Super Bowl championships following the arrival of legendary quarterback Joe Montana and head coach Bill Walsh. DeBartolo presided over a dynasty that lasted deep into the 1990s and yielded five Vince Lombardi Trophies....In 2000, his sister, Denise, and her husband, Dr. John York, took over ownership of the Niners. Jed York, the couple's son, has been the team's CEO since 2008 and their principal owner since March 2024. The younger York will reportedly continue in his role as principal owner after the sale to Briger becomes fully official."49ers controlling owner Jed York and his family will still hold about 88% of the club after this deal closes, which is expected after required approval by NFL owners in October," Fischer wrote.Read more: 49ers Trade Idea Lands Team Perfect Nick Bosa ReplacementOver the last several years, San Francisco has had a roster that has been considered one of the best in the NFL. But despite four trips to the NFC Championship Game and two Super Bowl appearances since the 2019 season, it has failed to bring home another world championship.The team shed a lot of salary during the offseason by letting a number of veterans leave in free agency. This was thought to be a transition year for it, but instead, it has shown signs that it will remain competitive despite its roster turnover and injury problems.For more on the 49ers and general NFL news, head over to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
