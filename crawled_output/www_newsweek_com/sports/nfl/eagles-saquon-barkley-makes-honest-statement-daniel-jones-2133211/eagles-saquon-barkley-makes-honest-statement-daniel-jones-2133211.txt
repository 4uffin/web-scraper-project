Jones was signed by the Indianapolis Colts this off-season, where he ended up beating out Anthony Richardson for the starting job. The Colts are currently 2-0, and became the first team in NFL history to not to have to punt the ball once in its first two games.It has been an impressive start for the quarterback, no one is more excited to see it than Jones' former running back."Outside of the Philadelphia Eagles and myself, I want no one else to perform at a high level (more than) Daniel Jones," Barkley told reporters. "The fact that he's off to a hot start... to go out there now and play at a high level and get to show people the player that I know and the person I know. I'm a big believer in anything, it might not happen in football, but the way he carries himself and the way he works and the way he competes, it's going to show at some point."Saquon Barkley on Daniel Jones: "Outside of the Philadelphia Eagles and myself, I want no one else to perform at a high level (more than) Daniel Jones.

Jones has been absolutely fantastic to start the year. Through two games, he is 45-of-63 for 588 yards and two touchdowns, while adding another three touchdowns on the ground.Combine that with Jonathan Taylor, who is currently second in the NFL, and there is a reason why the Colts are off to a historic start.It wasn't all bad for Jones in New York, as he took the team to the playoffs during the 2022 season, even leading the team to a playoff win at the Minnesota Vikings.However, in his final two seasons in New York, he was able to play in only 16 total games as he battled injuries. When he did play, he really struggled as he threw 10 touchdowns and 13 interceptions.Now, it wasn't all on Jones as he had a bad offensive line, and really no offensive talent around him except for Malik Nabers in his final year.It is still early in the season, and teams are going to start having a much better defensive gameplan for the Colts offense. However, he has done everything the Colts could have envisioned, and even more.He is the talking point of the NFL through two weeks, and no one is happier to see Jones having the success he is than his former running back.The Colts and Jones will look to continue the hot start to the season against the Tennessee Titans in Week 3.
