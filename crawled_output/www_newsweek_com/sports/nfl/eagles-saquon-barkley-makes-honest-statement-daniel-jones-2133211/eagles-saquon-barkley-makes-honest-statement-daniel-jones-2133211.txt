NFLPhiladelphia EaglesNews ArticleEagles’ Saquon Barkley Makes Honest Statement on Daniel JonesPublishedSep 20, 2025 at 11:33 PM EDTBy Mark KernContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberSaquon Barkley and Daniel Jones were teammates for the New York Giants for five seasons, where they were able to make the playoffs once.Barkley has moved on to the Philadelphia Eagles, where he instantly reminded the league how good he is. He was a catalyst in the team winning the Super Bowl last year, as he was named the Offensive Player of the Year....Jones was signed by the Indianapolis Colts this off-season, where he ended up beating out Anthony Richardson for the starting job. The Colts are currently 2-0, and became the first team in NFL history to not to have to punt the ball once in its first two games.It has been an impressive start for the quarterback, no one is more excited to see it than Jones' former running back."Outside of the Philadelphia Eagles and myself, I want no one else to perform at a high level (more than) Daniel Jones," Barkley told reporters. "The fact that he's off to a hot start... to go out there now and play at a high level and get to show people the player that I know and the person I know. I'm a big believer in anything, it might not happen in football, but the way he carries himself and the way he works and the way he competes, it's going to show at some point."Loading twitter content...Jones has been absolutely fantastic to start the year. Through two games, he is 45-of-63 for 588 yards and two touchdowns, while adding another three touchdowns on the ground.Combine that with Jonathan Taylor, who is currently second in the NFL, and there is a reason why the Colts are off to a historic start.It wasn't all bad for Jones in New York, as he took the team to the playoffs during the 2022 season, even leading the team to a playoff win at the Minnesota Vikings.However, in his final two seasons in New York, he was able to play in only 16 total games as he battled injuries. When he did play, he really struggled as he threw 10 touchdowns and 13 interceptions.Now, it wasn't all on Jones as he had a bad offensive line, and really no offensive talent around him except for Malik Nabers in his final year.It is still early in the season, and teams are going to start having a much better defensive gameplan for the Colts offense. However, he has done everything the Colts could have envisioned, and even more.He is the talking point of the NFL through two weeks, and no one is happier to see Jones having the success he is than his former running back.The Colts and Jones will look to continue the hot start to the season against the Tennessee Titans in Week 3.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting3 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
