NFLSan Francisco 49ersNews Article49ers Coach Kyle Shanahan Suggests Possible Trade After Nick Bosa InjuryPublishedSep 23, 2025 at 10:26 AM EDTupdatedSep 23, 2025 at 11:25 AM EDTBy Evan MasseyContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe San Francisco 49ers have been unable to catch a break from an injury perspective over the last couple of years. Already this season, the team has seen George Kittle go down, Brock Purdy go down, and have had both Brandon Aiyuk and Jauan Jennings dealing with injuries to start off the year.Unfortunately, in Week 3, the 49ers suffered another key injury loss.Despite finding a way to defeat the Arizona Cardinals by a final score of 16-15, San Francisco lost star pass rusher Nick Bosa to a knee injury. There was hope that it wasn't a season-ending injury, but that hope quickly faded.Read more: Packers Could Shock NFL With $90 Million Superstar TradeBosa ended up being diagnosed with a season-ending torn ACL. The 49ers will now have to figure out a way to replace one of the best players in the NFL on the defensive side of the football.To kick off the season, Bosa had been a dominant force. He was well on his way to putting up huge numbers and helping lead San Francisco back to being a serious contender in the stacked NFC.Throughout the first three games of the season, Bosa had recorded 17 total tackles to go along with two sacks, two forced fumbles, and a fumble recovery. Losing that kind of production will be very difficult to replace.With that being said, head coach Kyle Shanahan spoke out about the team potentially pursuing a trade to help fill the void left by Bosa's injury."We’ll look at trades like we always do," Shanahan said. "But, there’s got to be trade options that make sense for you and another team, but you can’t just do that stuff just to do it.”Read more: Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones Makes Surprising Micah Parsons DecisionLooking around the NFL, there are a few potential options that San Francisco could look to pursue. Miami Dolphins pass rusher Bradley Chubb has been talked about as a possible name to watch. Depending on the price tag, he could make perfect sense for the 49ers.Expect to continue hearing rumors about what San Francisco could do on the trade market. It's unfortunate that the 49ers have to look into trade options to replace Bosa, but injuries happen and the team will need to figure out a way to adapt.For more on the San Francisco 49ers and general NFL news, head over to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
