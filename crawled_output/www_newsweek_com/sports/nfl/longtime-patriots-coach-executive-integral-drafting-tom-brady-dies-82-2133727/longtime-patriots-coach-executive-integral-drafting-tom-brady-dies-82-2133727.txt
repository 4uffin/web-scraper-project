The New England Patriots won six Super Bowls with Tom Brady as the quarterback. A key piece in bringing Brady to the Patriots, Bobby Grier, has died at 82, according to ESPN's Mike Reiss.Grier served as a key member of the Patriots from 1981-2000. He was an offensive backfield coach in 1981 and 1985, a scout from 1982-1985, a running game coordinator from 1986-1992, the director of pro scouting from 1993-1995, the director of player personnel from 1995-1997 and the vice president of player personnel from 1997-2000.Grier wore many hats as a member of the Patriots' executive staff. He was even in charge of making draft decisions before Bill Belichick's arrival. One of his final acts with the team was scouting Brady, who the Patriots ended up drafting in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.

"He'll never let me or anyone else know about it or talk about it, but just being around him and talking with my brother, I know that he's pretty proud of that draft class and Tom in particular," Grier's youngest son, Mike Grier, told ESPN in 2011, per Reiss.Grier was also the father of Miami Dolphins general manager Chris Grier. After the 2000 NFL Draft, he left the Patriots to join the Houston Texans. He served as the associate director of pro scouting from 2000-2012 and a senior personnel advisor from 2012-2016.Grier's career in football spanned seven decades. He was an important part of multiple teams landing star players through the draft.More NFL: Jim Harbaugh Confirms Achilles Injury for Chargers RB Najee Harris
