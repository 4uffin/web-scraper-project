One of his final acts with the team was scouting Brady, who the Patriots ended up drafting in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft...."He'll never let me or anyone else know about it or talk about it, but just being around him and talking with my brother, I know that he's pretty proud of that draft class and Tom in particular," Grier's youngest son, Mike Grier, told ESPN in 2011, per Reiss.Grier was also the father of Miami Dolphins general manager Chris Grier.
