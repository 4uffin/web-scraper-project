NFLChicago BearsNews ArticleBen Johnson Fires up Bears With Strong Postgame Speech After First WinPublishedSep 21, 2025 at 09:50 PM EDTupdatedSep 22, 2025 at 11:13 AM EDTBy Matthew CoudenContributing WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Chicago Bears officially recorded their first win of the season in Week 3, as they efficiently defeated the visiting Dallas Cowboys, 31-14. The victory featured a standout effort from quarterback Caleb Williams, who may have quieted his critics for at least a week.Williams ended the game with 19-of-28 completed passes for 298 yards and four touchdowns without any sacks or interceptions. Among his highlights was an impressive throw downfield to wide receiver Luther Burden III for a 65-yard touchdown pass.That wowed commentator Tom Brady as he marveled at the play in real time, and continued to compliment Williams' pass while breaking down the highlight.Along with that, the defense stepped up significantly, with several key interceptions to stop Dallas' momentum on attempts to score.Read more: Terry Bradshaw Sounds Off on Bears' Caleb Williams StrugglesThe commentary team didn't hesitate to point out the lack of emotions from first-year head coach Ben Johnson on the sidelines. With his team entering the game winless, he was looking to get that important first victory of the season to silence his critics, but kept a poker face throughout the event.And while he didn't show much emotion on the sidelines, Johnson demonstrated plenty of emotion in a fired-up speech he delivered to his team in the locker room after the win....A postgame clip surfaced on the Chicago Bears' social media accounts featuring Johnson as he yelled at his players, but only to make sure they received heaps of much-deserved praise."We said coming into this game now, it was gonna be about situational football. We did. Third down defense, they were 3-of-11. [On] offense, we were 8-of-14. From the red zone, they were 1-of-4, and we were 2-of-3," Johnson informed everyone.Johnson called how his team handled things before halftime "outstanding" and praised the defense for effectively closing the game out.It didn't stop there, as the Bears coach handed out several game balls to the star players from offense and defense.Unsurprisingly, he tossed a game ball to quarterback Caleb Williams, as Johnson mentioned his 142.6 passer rating from the win."I love y'all boys. Couldn't do this without y'all. We're 1-0 this week. We got to go 1-0 next week. We gotta come back and prepare and do the same thing," the Bears QB told his teammates.On defense, Johnson highlighted that Tremaine Edmunds had two interceptions, which helped in the Bears' first win of the season. He received the other game ball after the big victory.Following those two game balls, Williams spoke again and tossed a football to "the boss man," recognizing Johnson for his first home win as the Bears coach.The team crowded around Johnson and offered hugs with celebratory cheers, shaking him around as Johnson got a bright smile on his face.He closed things out by leading them in a rousing "Good, better, best!" chant.The Bears will look to carry today's performance and that fired-up locker room postgame vibe into their next game. In Week 4, they'll visit the Las Vegas Raiders and attempt to even their record at 2-2 before getting a bye week.Read more: Bengals QB Joe Burrow Gets Major Surgery, Return UpdateFor more on the Chicago Bears and the NFL, head to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
