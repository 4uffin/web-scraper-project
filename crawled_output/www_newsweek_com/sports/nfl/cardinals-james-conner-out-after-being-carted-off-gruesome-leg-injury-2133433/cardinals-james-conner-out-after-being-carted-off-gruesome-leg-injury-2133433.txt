Following the horrific injury incident, Connor was ruled out immediately with an ankle injury. There are no details about the severity of the injury, but things look a bit grim currently.#Cardinals RB James Conner, who was carted off moments ago, has already been ruled out with an ankle injury.‚Äî Tom Pelissero (@TomPelissero) September 21, 2025
There have been instances when a player is ruled out, but they only suffer minor injuries. In some cases, those injuries do not require multiple weeks out. However, Connor may have also suffered a season-ending ailment.The Cardinals will do their due diligence and Connor will get testing done to determine how serious the injury is that he suffered.Mechanism, cart, and immediate rules out increases concern for a fracture https://t.co/M16P45BXOG‚Äî Tom Christ, PT, DPT, OCS, FAAOMPT (@FantasyInjuryT) September 21, 2025
A sports doctor has predicted that Connor may have suffered an ankle fracture, which could knock him out for the rest of the season.Connor had nine carries for 22 yards before suffering the injury. Through Weeks 1 and 2, he secured 73 yards and one touchdown.Ever since Connor arrived in Arizona, he has rebounded his career in a big way. He secured over 1,000 rushing yards in 2023 and 2024, and was aiming to do the same in 2025.Now, Connor may have to spend the remainder of the season on the sidelines. The hope is that it won't be the case, but the Cardinals will offer an update on his status as it becomes available.For more on the Cardinals and NFL, head to Newsweek Sports.
