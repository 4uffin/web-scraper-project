NFLCincinnati BengalsNews ArticleBengals QB Joe Burrow Gets Major Surgery, Return UpdatePublishedSep 19, 2025 at 01:09 PM EDTupdatedSep 19, 2025 at 04:00 PM EDTBy Matthew CoudenContributing WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Cincinnati Bengals and their star quarterback, Joe Burrow, recently received a significant update regarding Burrow's surgery and potential return.In just his second game of the season against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Burrow was sacked in the second quarter and had to leave for the medical tent. Ultimately, an update revealed he was unable to return to play in the game.Thankfully, his team still managed to secure a 31-27 win behind backup QB Jake Browning, but the bigger news was the potential loss of Burrow for an extended period.Read more: Bengals Get Joe Burrow Surgery Update for Difficult InjuryInitial reports indicated a toe injury, and later reports revealed that Burrow had turf toe, which he sustained after being sacked.Due to the injury, Burrow was scheduled for surgery on Friday, provided swelling remained low enough to allow it....On Friday, ESPN Bengals reporter Ben Baby reported that Burrow underwent successful surgery for his injury at the Andrews Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center in Birmingham.Baby indicated that Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said the surgery "went well" and now Burrow is "in recovery."Loading twitter content...However, Baby also said there isn't any official timeline for Burrow's return. Previous estimates on Burrow's timeline for return suggested at least three months, which would bring him back in mid-December.However, if the Bengals aren't competing for a playoff spot or the recovery takes longer, it wouldn't be surprising to see him sidelined for the rest of the season.Burrow suffered several other significant injuries during his NFL career, including tearing his ACL and MCL in his left knee during his rookie season. In his 2023 season, a difficult wrist injury sidelined him. These previous injuries also required surgery.He won the NFL Comeback Player of the Year award in each of his seasons after returning from those injuries, though.Currently, the Bengals (2-0) continue to rely on Browning to lead the offense. Cincinnati will face the Minnesota Vikings in Week 3, who are also without their starting quarterback, J.J. McCarthy, due to injury.Read more: Ravens QB Lamar Jackson Gets Major Prediction From TeammateFor more on the Cincinnati Bengals and the NFL, head over to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesPoliticsDemocrats React to Jimmy Kimmel’s Return from Suspension3 min. readPoliticsDonald Trump Tells Pregnant Women to ‘Tough it Out,’ Avoid Tylenol4 min. readPoliticsWhat We Know and Don’t Know About Trump’s H-1B Crackdown7 min. readPoliticsMap Shows Health Care H-1B Visas by State as Trump Floats Fee Exemption6 min. readPoliticsWhite House Shares Update on Antifa Crackdown as Trump Order Nears4 min. readPoliticsTrump Admin Vows to ‘Defend Every Inch of NATO’ After Russian Violations3 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
