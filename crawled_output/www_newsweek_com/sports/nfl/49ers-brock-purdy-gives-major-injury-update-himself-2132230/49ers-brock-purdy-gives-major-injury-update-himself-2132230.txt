NFLSan Francisco 49ersNews Article49ers’ Brock Purdy Gives Major Injury Update on HimselfPublishedSep 18, 2025 at 09:35 PM EDTBy Robert MarviContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberSan Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy has something to prove this season. He made the Pro Bowl and led the NFL in passer rating and QBR in 2023, his first full season as a starter, but his numbers dipped last year amidst a gnarly rash of injuries to his teammates.He sat out his team's Week 2 win over the New Orleans Saints with a toe injury, and it was initially feared that he would have to miss multiple games. But after the victory, head coach Kyle Shanahan told the media that there was a chance Purdy could return as early as Week 3.Read more: 49ers' Kyle Shanahan Drops Surprise Brock Purdy Update After Saints WinPurdy returned to practice in a limited capacity on Wednesday, and he was a limited participant again on Thursday. He implied that he may be a game-time decision on Sunday when the Niners take on the Arizona Cardinals at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara."[We've] just got to see come game time how I feel," Purdy said, per ESPN. "I want to play every game. I want to be out there. You only get 17 regular-season games, and every game matters, especially a divisional [game] going against the Cardinals. If you ask me, I'd love to, but I'm trying to be smart with my body here. You never know. We'll see when the game comes."...There is no question that the Niners are banged up right now. In addition to wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk, who continues to recover from the torn ACL and MCL he suffered last October, star tight end George Kittle is out with a hamstring ailment. Kittle was placed on injured reserve and will return, at the earliest, when San Francisco faces the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.In addition, wideout Jauan Jennings, who emerged as a major threat last season, did not take part in practice over the last two days because of ankle and shoulder issues.Read more: Colin Cowherd Makes Wild Claim About 49ers' Mac JonesIn Week 1, Purdy threw two interceptions, but he also guided the 49ers through the game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter and threw the decisive touchdown pass with under two minutes remaining to tight end Jake Tonges. It was his second touchdown pass on a day in which he completed 26 of 35 passing attempts for 277 yards.For more on the 49ers and general NFL news, head over to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting3 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
