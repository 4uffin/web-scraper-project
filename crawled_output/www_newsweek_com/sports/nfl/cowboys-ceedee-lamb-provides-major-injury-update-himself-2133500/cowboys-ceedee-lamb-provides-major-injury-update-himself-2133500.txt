"So, once I start feeling much better and I start to get the strength back in my ankle as far as mobility and able to cut and like real dynamic movements ‚Äî I was ready to go back out there but then they told me not to."... For sure, absolutely [it feels like something I can play through next week]."Owner/general manager Jerry Jones affirmed the Cowboys dodged a bullet, stating the team doctors reassured him the Oklahoma alum avoided what could have been a serious injury."I talked to him, he felt good about it," Jones said, via the team's official website.
