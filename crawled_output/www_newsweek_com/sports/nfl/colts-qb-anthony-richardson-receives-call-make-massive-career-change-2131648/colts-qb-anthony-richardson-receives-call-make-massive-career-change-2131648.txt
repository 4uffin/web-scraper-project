NFLIndianapolis ColtsNews ArticleColts QB Anthony Richardson Receives Call to Make Massive Career ChangePublishedSep 17, 2025 at 09:53 PM EDTupdatedSep 18, 2025 at 09:36 AM EDTBy Evan MasseyContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberAhead of the 2025 NFL season, Indianapolis Colts' young quarterback, Anthony Richardson, suffered a major career setback. He was unable to defeat Daniel Jones in the team's open quarterback competition and entered the year as the primary backup.Richardson, who was the Colts' No. 4 overall pick back in the 2023 NFL Draft, has been unable to live up to the hype. There are some who worry that his career could be in jeopardy.Despite the setback, Richardson has been focused on working hard and preparing himself for his next opportunity. Unfortunately for the former Florida standout, Jones has been starring in his new role as the starter in Indianapolis.Read more: Chiefs Linked to Trade for New Offensive Weapon Amid StrugglesIt's possible that Richardson won't see the field this season....That being said, a call has been made for him to consider a massive career change. The source of the call was surprising.Former NBA star Jeff Teague has suggested that Richardson switch to being a tight end. He thinks that the 23-year-old signal caller should change his position and become the next Taysom Hill type of player."Bro going to tight end," Teague said. "I'm saying to get him on the field. He too talented as an athlete not to be on the field. The new Taysom Hill."Truthfully, that could make some level of sense. Hill found a lot of success with the New Orleans Saints in different packages. A natural quarterback, his fit at tight end changed his entire career.Standing in at 6-foot-4 and just under 250 pounds, Richardson has the size to play the tight end position. He has been injury-prone, which could be a concern. Head coach Shane Steichen could get creative if he used Richardson in a Hill-type role.Read more: NFL Insider Reveals Expected Date for Browns' QB ChangeIt may not be likely that Richardson will actually make that kind of a change at this stage of his career. He's still young and could get another opportunity either with the Colts or another team. Taking the risk of playing tight end might not be of interest to him yet.However, sitting on the sideline for an entire year isn't ideal for a young player.Throughout his two-year NFL career thus far, Richardson has played in 15 games. He has completed 50.6 percent of his passes for 2,391 yards, 11 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions, while also running for 635 yards and 10 more scores.For more on the Indianapolis Colts and general NFL news, head over to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
