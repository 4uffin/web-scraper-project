NFLNew York GiantsNews ArticleReport: Giants Are Benching Russell Wilson in Favor of Jaxson DartPublishedSep 23, 2025 at 12:31 PM EDTupdatedSep 23, 2025 at 10:09 PM EDTBy James BrizuelaContributing WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe New York Giants are making the change.More news: Browns HC Kevin Stefanski Delivers Big Decision on Joe Flacco Following WinIt has been announced that the Giants are benching Russell Wilson and will now allow rookie Jaxson Dart to take over the offense moving forward.Loading twitter content...The change to Dart was expected, though there was plenty of discussion regarding when Brian Daboll would finally make the call. After three weeks of Wilson struggling, Dart will get his chance to turn things around.Wilson put together 778 yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions through three games. The Giants are also 0-3, and will have to climb out of this hole, but Dart could be the right quarterback to get the job done.More news: Bengals QB Joe Burrow Handed Devastating New Recovery PredictionSadly, Dart will make his Giants debut as the starting quarterback against a very tough Los Angeles Chargers defense. The Chargers are 3-0, and have a defense that continues to apply pressure and force takeaways.The Giants may have had an easier time with Dart starting against the New Orleans Saints, but they will instead throw him out there to face the tough Chargers. Dart was drafted 25th overall in the 2025 NFL Draft out of Ole Miss, after impressing through four seasons of action. Dart also played one season with USC before transferring to Ole Miss in the 2022 season.Dart finished his collegiate career with 11,970 yards, 81 touchdowns, and 27 interceptions. He also logged 1,541 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns. The Giants have a very strong offense, especially with a solid receiver like Malik Nabers ready to catch passes. That also includes Darius Slayton, Wan'Dale Robinson, and more. Dart will now command this offense, as Wilson will be the primary backup should anything happen to the rookie. With fans constantly calling for Daboll to make the switch, he did just that. Now, will Dart be able to help jumpstart this slow start for the Giants?For more on the Giants and NFL, head to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
