NFLPhiladelphia EaglesNews ArticleExclusive: Eagles Legend Brian Westbrook on How Philly Can RepeatPublishedSep 19, 2025 at 02:50 PM EDTupdatedSep 19, 2025 at 03:38 PM EDTBy James BrizuelaContributing WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberPhiladelphia Eagles legend Brian Westbrook knows a thing or two about his former team, as he is currently a correspondent for CSN Philly and offers plenty of takes on the team and the community. When he isn't talking Eagles football, he is also giving back in a big way.More news: Exclusive: Eagles Star Cooper DeJean on Evolving and Chasing a Big Rival InterceptionWestbrook partnered with USAA for the "USAA's Recycled Rides" program, where a refurbished car was gifted to an active military member.A post shared by instagramWestbrook sat down with Newsweek Sports to discuss this amazing cause and how he sees the Eagles repeating their Super Bowl success.What can you tell me about your partnership with USAA?Yeah, USAA and myself, we partnered to be able to give a young man, a young, active military airman, Kisco, an opportunity to receive a new car, and they remodeled it. They rebuilt it, and it is a great-looking Toyota Camry. Looks brand new. I jumped in it for a little bit. It smells good, smells like a new car. Looks like a new car. Is absolutely amazing. You know, Kisco, a young man who just started in the military this past December, was having trouble getting back and forth to work, and he needed something that was reliable to get him back and forth to work."And just imagine young men and women that are actively serving our country having a hard time getting back and forth to protect us, to protect our rights and our ability to watch football and basketball and baseball and enjoy entertainment like that. And USAA has taken it upon themselves to dedicate their time, and, of course, their money and their resources to make sure that young men and young women that are serving in our military have the ability to do that. And this is an amazing cause, and I'm so happy to have partnered with them, absolutely."Westbrook covers the Eagles at CSN Philly and knows a lot about the team's current trajectory. In terms of being able to repeat, he believes they can if they remain healthy....More news: Report: Dolphins Owner Has Made up Mind on Firing Mike McDanielDo you think the Eagles have a good chance to repeat this year?"Well, I mean, I think they have a really good team. I think they have a really good opportunity ahead of them. I'm just not one of these guys that say that they're going to go repeat just because they have a great team, they have potential, and they have really good players offensively.They have really good players defensively. They're gonna have to stay healthy, they're going to have to stay hungry. And if you can do that, they'll have a chance. Don't win 13 and 14 games if they can do that, but it will depend on health, and it will depend on their focus. And I believe that they have one of the best leaders in football, and Jalen Hurts."Westbrook played for the Eagles under head coach Andy Reid, who is now the leader of the Kansas City Chiefs. In terms of the differences between Reid and current head coach Nick Sirianni, Westbrook sees the team as a whole being very good.What sets this team apart with Nick Sirianni, as opposed to when you played with Andy Reid?Well, I mean, I just think they have great players all across the board. They have one of the best offensive lines in the league, if not the best. They have a great decision-making quarterback that's going to put you in a position either with his legs, with his arms, and going to make the right decision. You have a great receiving core as well as a tight end that is you talking about All-Pros. And then you have the best player in the NFL at your running back position."So offensively, you're looking at offense like, do you try to stop the run with the pass or the quarterback run? And it's just hard to do that. Then defensively, you have a defensive coordinator, Vic Fangio, that has figured things out. There were points last year I was like, I don't know if he's an answer, but he continued to get better and better and continue to put his players in a position to win at all costs."There is a lot of competition in the NFC, and that is already being shown with the Packers having picked up Micah Parsons. In terms of the trade happening, Westbrook was just happy he was taken from the Dallas Cowboys.What was your reaction to that trade?"Well, I was happy that the Cowboys lost him. I think they made a big mess of that down there. But I was also happy that Michael found a way to the final team that paid him what he believes he's worth. And I'll tell you this, the Packers got a lot better, and they're really good football teams, so they got a lot better. Those are one of the teams that I certainly will be looking out for this season, absolutely."In terms of what teams could be in the Super Bowl come February, Westbrook picked some surprises in both the NFC and AFC.Who are the teams to watch in the NFC and AFC?I think the Packers are going to be tough. I think Detroit will come back and be tough. I think the 49ers will be tough as well there. I mean, there are teams, and there's always a couple of teams that pop up when you, maybe it's Tampa Bay, maybe it's another team, but there's always a couple of teams that pop up when you, surprise you throughout the season.""Kansas City, Buffalo, and Baltimore, it's hard to go against those teams. They're super talented. They have the ability to win games in multiple ways, and they have a quarterback who can lead them up and down the football field at any chance. If they find a defense and the defensive way to get stops, it's just hard to beat those teams."To listen and see the entire interview, watch the video above.For more on the Eagles and NFL, head to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesPoliticsDemocrats React to Jimmy Kimmel’s Return from Suspension3 min. readPoliticsDonald Trump Tells Pregnant Women to ‘Tough it Out,’ Avoid Tylenol4 min. readPoliticsWhat We Know and Don’t Know About Trump’s H-1B Crackdown7 min. readPoliticsMap Shows Health Care H-1B Visas by State as Trump Floats Fee Exemption6 min. readPoliticsWhite House Shares Update on Antifa Crackdown as Trump Order Nears4 min. readPoliticsTrump Admin Vows to ‘Defend Every Inch of NATO’ After Russian Violations3 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
