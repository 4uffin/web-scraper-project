In that game, the Fever shocked the world and pulled off a comeback win to eliminate the Dream.Read more: Dwyane Wade Boldly Proclaims A'ja Wilson Could Beat NBA PlayersFollowing the surprising series win, Indiana did not hesitate to fire a quick message to those who doubted them heading into the series.

Clark also took to her social media with a pair of posts. Her excitement to move on in the playoffs was clear, even though she has been ruled out for the remainder of the season due to the groin injury she suffered.FEVVVVVVV SHOOWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è @IndianaFever‚Äî Caitlin Clark (@CaitlinClark22) September 19, 2025

Needless to say, Indiana deserves a lot of credit. Being able to overcome the injury suffered by Clark, in addition to season-ending injuries to Sophie Cunningham, Aari McDonald, Sydney Colson, and Chloe Bibby, is impressive.Now, the Fever will wait to see who they will play in the next round of the WNBA Playoffs. Their opponent will be either the Las Vegas Aces or the Seattle Storm.Once again, the majority of the media will be picking against Indiana. It's clear that the Fever are enjoying playing the underdog role. They'll happily stay that way.Read more: Dallas Wings' Paige Bueckers Surprised With Major WNBA HonorWhile making a championship run won't be easy without Clark on the floor, no one should count Indiana out.

When that is known, fans are sure to keep a close eye on whether or not the Fever get more respect and get a pick or two in their next series.For more on the Indiana Fever and all things WNBA, head to Newsweek Sports.
