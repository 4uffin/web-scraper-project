SportsMLBNew York YankeesNews ArticleYankees’ Aaron Judge Points Out Key Factors for Success in October BaseballPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 09:57 AM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 09:58 AM EDTBy Julio Cesar Valdera MoralesContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe New York Yankees beat the Chicago White Sox 3-2 on Tuesday, scoring the tying and winning runs in sensational fashion in the bottom of the ninth inning. The victory was even more special because it clinched the Bronx Bombers' spot in the playoffs.As if written for the spotlight, team icon Aaron Judge crossed home plate for the winning run, brought in from third by Jose Caballero’s walk-off single to center field. However, Judge's individual performance was overshadowed by the collective celebration of what will be his eighth appearance in October baseball.Judge showed that he is completely focused on what lies ahead. When speaking to the press amid the team's celebration, his words were not meant to highlight what had been achieved, but to point out what remains to be done."We got all the talent in the world, but I think it's just the mindset of this team," he said in an interview with SNY that was later posted to X by the network's official account."You know, even going back to the game (Tuesday), where we got an early lead, you know, we lose it. But I think the guys all the way down the last strike knew we were going to win that game. So, it's just about having that grit and determination and just knowing that we're going to pull out every single game as long as we trust each other."As of Wednesday, the New York Yankees have an 89-68 record this season and are second in the AL Wild Card standings. They are just one game behind the Toronto Blue Jays, who are also qualified, while the Boston Red Sox, currently 86-71, will take the third spot, although they have not yet officially secured it.Loading twitter content...If nothing changes in the current team standings, the Yankees would face the Blue Jays in the wild card series at Rogers Centre.Judge also described where the team needs to focus when that time comes."I think it comes down to the little things," he said in the same interview. "You know, we saw that last October. It's about us taking care of the little things throughout the game, but backing up a base, you know, making the routine plays, coming up with a big hit, moving a runner over. You know, we've talked about this all year. You know, it's about the little things that are going to help us, you know, win games in October. So, we just got to keep doing what we're doing."Last season, the Yankees went all the way to the World Series, where they lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games.More MLB: MLB Confirms League-Wide Use of Ball-Strike Challenge System Starting 2026Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
