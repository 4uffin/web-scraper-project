More Basketball: WNBA Punishes Caitlin Clark For What She Said After Fever Playoff Win Over Dream"I had hoped to share a better update, but I will not be returning to play this season. I spent hours in the gym every day with the singular goal of getting back out there, disappointed isn't a big enough word to describe how I am feeling," Clark wrote."I want to thank everyone who had my back through all the uncertainty. This has been incredibly frustrating, but even in the bad, there is good. The way the fans continued to show up for me, and for the Fever, brought me so much joy and important perspective. I am so proud of how this team has only gotten stronger through adversity this year."With a 1-0 series lead, Mitchell and the Fever will face off against the Aces in Game 2 on Tuesday night.
