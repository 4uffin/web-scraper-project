NBANew York KnicksNews ArticleKnicks Guard Takes Shot at Fired Coach Tom ThibodeauPublishedSep 17, 2025 at 09:59 AM EDTBy Alex KirschenbaumContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe 2024-25 season was the New York Knicks' best in 25 years.The club notched a solid 51-31 record and secured the Eastern Conference's No. 3 seed. While the Knicks have had better regular season finishes since 2000, they hadn't advanced past the second round until this past spring, when New York made the Eastern Conference Finals — where the team fell to its 2000 Eastern Conference Finals foe, the Indiana Pacers, in six games.More news: Knicks Sign 2 Former Lakers in Free AgencyLed by All-NBA standouts Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns, plus All-Defensive wings Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby, New York enjoyed a robust run. Thanks to Achilles tendon ruptures incurred in the playoffs by East All-Stars Tyrese Haliburton, Jayson Tatum, and Damian Lillard (who is now on the Portland Trail Blazers, following a buyout by the Milwaukee Bucks), the Knicks appear primed for another deep playoff run this year.But the club's strong season finish and solid 2025-26 outlook wasn't enough for New York. The Knicks fired Tom Thibodeau in June after five years with the club that included four playoff appearances, four playoff series wins and one Coach of the Year award.Thibodeau finished with a 226-174 regular season record and a 24-23 playoff record with New York....Knicks reserve guard Miles "Deuce" McBride recently got candid about the team's relatively static offense under Thibodeau, and expressed excitement that his replacement Mike Brown could help add some new wrinkles and dimension on that end of the hardwood."Last year, we might've gotten a little bit stagnant, and the last couple years," McBride told Stefan Bondy of The New York Post. "And I feel like what [Brown's] been preaching is just being able to play with pace, and it's not just the guy with the ball. And everybody is a possibility [to score] and able to take it off the dribble, of course."This summer, New York brought in two solid free agent vets in power forward Guerschon Yabusele and combo guard Jordan Clarkson to help bulk up its bench depth. Heading into the year, the Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers sport the two most talented rosters in a deflated East.A more egalitarian offense could help unlock New York's attack even further."I've talked to [Brown] a lot, and I think the big thing is just going to be a lot of player movement," McBride said. "He's giving us the foundation, and we're just going to work off of it. So I'm really excited to see all our creativity with each other that we've been working on these last couple months. Really excited to see where it takes us."More news: Knicks' Karl-Anthony Towns Sends Message to CriticsFor all the latest NBA news and rumors, head over to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
