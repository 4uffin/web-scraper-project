NBANew York KnicksNews ArticleKnicks Guard Takes Shot at Fired Coach Tom ThibodeauPublishedSep 17, 2025 at 09:59 AM EDTBy Alex KirschenbaumContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe 2024-25 season was the New York Knicks' best in 25 years.The club notched a solid 51-31 record and secured the Eastern Conference's No. 3 seed. While the Knicks have had better regular season finishes since 2000, they hadn't advanced past the second round until this past spring, when New York made the Eastern Conference Finals — where the team fell to its 2000 Eastern Conference Finals foe, the Indiana Pacers, in six games.More news: Knicks Sign 2 Former Lakers in Free AgencyLed by All-NBA standouts Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns, plus All-Defensive wings Mikal Bridges and OG Anunoby, New York enjoyed a robust run. Thanks to Achilles tendon ruptures incurred in the playoffs by East All-Stars Tyrese Haliburton, Jayson Tatum, and Damian Lillard (who is now on the Portland Trail Blazers, following a buyout by the Milwaukee Bucks), the Knicks appear primed for another deep playoff run this year.But the club's strong season finish and solid 2025-26 outlook wasn't enough for New York. The Knicks fired Tom Thibodeau in June after five years with the club that included four playoff appearances, four playoff series wins and one Coach of the Year award.Thibodeau finished with a 226-174 regular season record and a 24-23 playoff record with New York....Knicks reserve guard Miles "Deuce" McBride recently got candid about the team's relatively static offense under Thibodeau, and expressed excitement that his replacement Mike Brown could help add some new wrinkles and dimension on that end of the hardwood."Last year, we might've gotten a little bit stagnant, and the last couple years," McBride told Stefan Bondy of The New York Post. "And I feel like what [Brown's] been preaching is just being able to play with pace, and it's not just the guy with the ball. And everybody is a possibility [to score] and able to take it off the dribble, of course."This summer, New York brought in two solid free agent vets in power forward Guerschon Yabusele and combo guard Jordan Clarkson to help bulk up its bench depth. Heading into the year, the Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers sport the two most talented rosters in a deflated East.A more egalitarian offense could help unlock New York's attack even further."I've talked to [Brown] a lot, and I think the big thing is just going to be a lot of player movement," McBride said. "He's giving us the foundation, and we're just going to work off of it. So I'm really excited to see all our creativity with each other that we've been working on these last couple months. Really excited to see where it takes us."More news: Knicks' Karl-Anthony Towns Sends Message to CriticsFor all the latest NBA news and rumors, head over to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting2 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
