Although Los Angeles Lakers superstar Luka Doncic and Dirk Nowitzki spent only one season together in Dallas, it's clear that the Hall of Famer made a lasting impact on the Slovenian star.Ahead of the 2025-26 season, Doncic sat down with the Wall Street Journal this week to discuss a wide range of topics, including his time in Dallas.After talking about his first impressions of Texas prior to the 2018-19 season, Doncic was asked about the biggest takeaway from his time playing alongside Nowitzki during his rookie year:"Professionalism. How professional he was with everything, even in his 21st season. He had the whole routine every day. Start this at that time, he would start at that time. Just the routine was unbelievable to see."While Nowitzki has been open about the fact that he believes he should have retired sooner, his decision to stick around for one more year helped establish a relationship with Doncic and his family that's continued to this day.Read More: Clippers Reportedly 'Done' Building Around Kawhi Leonard
