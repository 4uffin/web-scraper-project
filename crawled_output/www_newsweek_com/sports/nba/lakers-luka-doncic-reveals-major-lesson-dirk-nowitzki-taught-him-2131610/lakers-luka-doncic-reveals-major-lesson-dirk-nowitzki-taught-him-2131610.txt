How professional he was with everything, even in his 21st season. He had the whole routine every day. Start this at that time, he would start at that time. Just the routine was unbelievable to see."While Nowitzki has been open about the fact that he believes he should have retired sooner, his decision to stick around for one more year helped establish a relationship with Doncic and his family that's continued to this day.Read More: Clippers Reportedly 'Done' Building Around Kawhi Leonard...
