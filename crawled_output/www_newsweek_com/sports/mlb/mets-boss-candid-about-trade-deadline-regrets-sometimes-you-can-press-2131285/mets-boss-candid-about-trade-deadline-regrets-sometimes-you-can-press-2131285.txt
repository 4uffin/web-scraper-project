MLBNew York MetsNews ArticleMets Boss Candid About Trade Deadline Regrets: ‘Sometimes You Can Press’PublishedSep 17, 2025 at 10:30 AM EDTBy Peter ChawagaContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe New York Mets earned a much needed win on Tuesday by besting the San Diego Padres as their hold on a playoff spot remains tenuous.The Mets are clinging to a slim lead over the Arizona Diamondbacks for the National League's final postseason berth and will need some more wins if they hope to hold on. It has been a surprising fall for the Mets, who appeared to be the best team in their division earlier this season.And in the midst of that surprising turnaround, president of baseball operations David Stearns reflected on some regrets from a trade deadline that did not do enough to reinforce the roster."We've had various segments of our team that haven't performed certainly to the level that we anticipated as we approached the trade deadline, and had I had that knowledge going in, yes, it would have changed what we did," Stearns said, according to SNY's Alex Smith. "So I think certainly we have to learn from this and determine whether there are things we could have seen that we did not."...The Mets added reigning National League Reliever of the Year Ryan Helsley in a trade with the St. Louis Cardinals and he has proceeded to log a brutal 10.29 ERA so far in Queens. But the team has to also be disappointed in the results from Cedric Mullins, who was added from the Baltimore Orioles only to see all of his offensive numbers dip after joining the Mets.Mullins has slashed just .190/.293/.305 in 105 at-bats since joining his new team, and Stearns offered some comments on that disappointment in particular."I think Cedric came over to a new team for the first time in his career, adjusting to a new organization, little bit of a different role," Stearns said, per Smith. "Got off to a little bit of a struggle, and sometimes that can put pressure on players, and I think he's spoken about that a little bit, that sometimes you can press."Stearns added that he feels Mullins' at-bats are getting better lately. But as the team's record has gotten worse since landing its trade deadline acquisitions, Stearns' acknowledgment that he wishes he had done some things differently is significant.And with Mullins and Helsley headed toward free agency at the end of the season, a longer stint with the Mets for either of them seems unlikely.More MLB: Yankees Hurler Declares Bullpen 'One of the Best' Despite EvidenceRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
