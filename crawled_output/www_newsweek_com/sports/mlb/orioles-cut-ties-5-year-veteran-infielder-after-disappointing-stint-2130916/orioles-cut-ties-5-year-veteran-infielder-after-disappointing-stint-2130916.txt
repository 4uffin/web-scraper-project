MLBBaltimore OriolesNews ArticleOrioles Cut Ties With 5-Year Veteran Infielder After Disappointing StintPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 07:40 PM EDTBy Jackson RobertsContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberAt the end of a lost season, the Baltimore Orioles are still making important roster decisions at all times.This is not supposed to be a rebuild. The Orioles expected to contend for an American League East title this year, and though they've played better baseball since bumbling to a 16-34 start, they have a lot of questions to sort out by March.Trading away a heap of veterans at the July deadline allowed the Orioles to get a look at some players who didn't necessarily project to be a big part of the future, but might carve out bench or utility roles for themselves if they stepped up....Unfortunately, infielder Emmanuel Rivera did not prove to be one of those players.On Tuesday, the Orioles announced that Rivera had been designated for assignment as the corresponding move for infielder Jordan Westburg's return from the injured list.Left-handed pitcher José Castillo was also activated after being claimed off waivers from the Seattle Mariners, while fellow southpaw Grant Wolfram was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk.Rivera came to Baltimore on a waiver claim from the Miami Marlins last August, and Tuesday was his third time being DFA'd by the Orioles. The first two times, he was waived and accepted an outright assignment to Triple-A. It remains to be seen whether that process will play out again.In 42 games at the major league level this season, Rivera totaled a .250/.291/.283 slash line and no home runs. He showed some promise early in his career with the Arizona Diamondbacks and was on the team's World Series roster in 2023, but it's largely been downhill since.Once a 19th-round draft pick of the Kansas City Royals, Rivera has already played parts of five major league seasons for four different teams. We'll see if the 29-year-old gets another look in the big leagues any time soon.More MLB: Blue Jays Officially Release Former Top Prospect Orelvis MartinezRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
