MLBPhiladelphia PhilliesNews ArticlePhillies Hopeful to Get Trea Turner At-Bats in Final Series Against TwinsPublishedSep 23, 2025 at 09:07 PM EDTBy Drew VonScioContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Philadelphia Phillies may be getting their shortstop, Trea Turner, back before the end of the regular season.In a recent story, Matt Gelb of The Athletic reported that the team is hopeful Turner can return for the final series beginning Friday against the Minnesota Twins...."The biggest drama remaining in the regular season is whether Turner can recover in time for some at-bats," wrote Gelb. "The Phillies are thrilled with the shortstop’s progress; he’s continued to increase his activities while they were on the road. The team will bring three minor-league pitchers — Daniel Harper, Tommy McCollum and Andrew Walling — to Citizens Bank Park to throw to Turner this week. Turner could be activated for the final series of the season against the Minnesota Twins."Turner has been sidelined since Sept. 7 with a hamstring injury, and the Phillies have remained hopeful since then that he would be back and ready to go for the playoffs.Given the New York Mets' collapse, the team didn't have to worry too much about rushing him back for the final stretch of the regular season. However, they know he is an integral part of their lineup and want him on the field for their first playoff game. Turner's presence also helps with the team's lineup construction."Once Turner returns, the Phillies can drop Harrison Bader lower in the lineup," wrote Gelb. "(J.T.) Realmuto may go from hitting cleanup for most of September to seventh if the Phillies have (Alec) Bohm fourth, Brandon Marsh fifth and Bader sixth."The more Turner can play against the Twins, the better. The Phillies remain hopeful he will be ready to go for the series opener on Friday.More MLB: Yankees Game 3 Starter for Wild Card Series Remains Unanswered QuestionRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
