MLBNew York YankeesNews ArticleYankees Had Better Heed Vladimir Guerrero Jr.’s Postseason WarningPublishedSep 21, 2025 at 08:24 PM EDTBy Aaliyan MohammedContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Toronto Blue Jays have punched their ticket to the postseason, but they have not won the American League East yet.The New York Yankees still have a chance to win the division. The Blue Jays have a two-game lead following play on Friday. With a postseason spot now guaranteed, the Yankees may think the Blue Jays will relax and the door is open to pounce on the division lead.However, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. sent a clear message the Yankees had better heed if they think the Blue Jays are about to take the foot off the gas...."The job is not finished," Guerrero told MLB.com's Keegan Matheson. "We want to win the division."Guerrero signed a 14-year, $500 million extension this year, cementing himself as the face of the franchise. He has a .298/.389/.480 slash line and 23 home runs. He was named an All-Star for the fifth time and is a key reason why the Blue Jays are in the position they are in.The Blue Jays are not only trying to win the division, but the team also has a chance to be the top seed in the AL. Claiming the top seed and securing a bye would be huge for the Blue Jays in their quest for a World Series.The Boston Red Sox also have an outside chance at winning the division, and the Blue Jays play a three-game series with the Red Sox starting Tuesday. Winning that series could go a long way in winning the AL East.The Blue Jays' magic number to win the division sits at four games. The Yankees are not going to give up until the Blue Jays officially lock up the AL East.More MLB: End of the Road?
