MLBlos angeles dodgersNews ArticleDodgers Place Veteran Pitcher On IL, Shake Up Roster With Postseason LoomingPublishedSep 19, 2025 at 08:27 PM EDTBy Zach PressnellContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Los Angeles Dodgers have battled injuries all season. Their pitching staff has been destroyed at every stage of the season, with starters and relievers alike facing injuries.They've gotten healthier as the season has gone on, which is a good thing, but one hurler recently landed on the injured list at one of the worst possible times.Michael Kopech has seemingly battled a few injuries over the last few days. He's been excellent this year, but the righty has allowed runs in each of his last two outings.On Friday, manager Dave Roberts announced that Kopech was heading to the injured list. Roberts noted that Kopech was battling multiple physical ailments, but didn't specify what they were...."I'm battling a couple things right now. I'll leave it at that," Kopech said, via Dodgers insider Fabian Ardaya.In the corresponding move, the Dodgers brought up 25-year-old reliever Will Klein. He has been solid for the Dodgers in a small sample size this season, but his WHIP sits near 2.00, so it's hard to be too optimistic about the righty.Klein has an ERA over 6.00 and a WHIP over 2.00 in 18 career innings. Los Angeles is desperately going to need Kopech to return to the team in the near future.Kopech has only pitched in 14 games for the Dodgers this season due to injuries. In that time, he's been excellent, allowing three runs across 11 innings.Even if Kopech can't return, the Dodgers are going to need to find some reliable arms to work in their bullpen down the stretch. They're another injury or two away from disaster with the season on the line and the postseason coming up.More MLB: Giants 'Definitely' Interested In Re-Signing $15 Million Veteran PitcherRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
