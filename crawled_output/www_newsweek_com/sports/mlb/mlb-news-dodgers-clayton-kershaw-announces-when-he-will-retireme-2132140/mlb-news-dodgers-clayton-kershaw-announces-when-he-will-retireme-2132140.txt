MLBlos angeles dodgersClayton kershawNews ArticleMLB News: Dodgers Clayton Kershaw Suddenly Announces When He Will RetirePublishedSep 18, 2025 at 04:05 PM EDTupdatedSep 19, 2025 at 04:02 PM EDTBy Jon Paul HoornstraContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberPitcher Clayton Kershaw will retire after this season, his 18th in Major League Baseball, the Los Angeles Dodgers announced Thursday.Loading twitter content...Kershaw, 37, has played his entire career in a Dodgers uniform. His final regular season home start will be Friday."On behalf of the Dodgers, I congratulate Clayton on a fabulous career and thank him for the many moments he gave to Dodger fans and baseball fans everywhere, as well as for all of his profound charitable endeavors," Mark Walter, the Dodgers' principal owner and chairman, said in a statement. "His is a truly legendary career, one that we know will lead to his induction in the Baseball Hall of Fame."...The Dodgers host the rival San Francisco Giants in a four-game series beginning Thursday.Kershaw made his 11th appearance at an All-Star Game in July. He has been a boon to the Dodgers' injury-depleted rotation this season, going 10-2 with a 3.53 ERA in 20 starts. Still, retirement always loomed as a question of when, not if.In a recent interview, Kershaw revealed some of what he did and did not have in store for his post-playing career.More news: Dodgers Pitcher Loses No-Hitter Attempt in Heartbreaking FashionKershaw said in an appearance on "Almost Athletes with Dude Perfect" that he might take up golf in retirement, or take summer vacations to escape the heat in his native Dallas. In general, though, his post-playing plans seemed anything but concrete beyond being present for his family. (Kershaw and his wife, Ellen, are expecting their fifth child in December.)A plaque at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y., awaits Kershaw as soon as he's eligible for induction. He is 222-96 with a 2.54 ERA in 452 career games. His resume includes three Cy Young Awards, one National League MVP, 11 All-Star Game appearances and two World Series championships.More news: 12-Year Veteran Pitcher, Brother of Dodgers' Owner, Passes AwayBefore injuries hampered his availability, Kershaw was generally regarded as the best left-handed pitcher in baseball for most of the 2010s.From 2011-17, he went 118-31 with a 2.10 ERA, tossing 14 shutouts in 207 starts. That period of dominance coincided with the Dodgers' ascent into a perennial postseason contender.More news: Former World Series Champion Passes AwayUntil their championship in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, Kershaw struggled to carry the Dodgers to the World Series title that had eluded them since 1988. This October he will look to improve his career postseason record of 13-13 in 39 games (32 starts).Kershaw made two starts in the 2020 World Series against the Tampa Bay Rays, pitching a total of 11.2 innings and winning both games by allowing a total of three runs.More news: One MLB Team Won't Sign Framber Valdez After He Deceived Teammate: ReportKershaw was sidelined by injuries to his toe and knee — both of which eventually required surgery — during the Dodgers' 2024 postseason run, which culminated with a five-game World Series win over the New York Yankees.The year before, Kershaw had surgery on his left shoulder following the Dodgers' abrupt first-round exit at the hands of the eventual NL champion Diamondbacks.More news: Former Dodgers All-Star Announces Immediate Retirement From BaseballDespite chronic injuries, Kershaw remained a valuable pitcher after his peak. From ages 30-37, Kershaw went 78-32 with a 2.91 ERA despite never making more than 30 starts in a season.Kershaw's late-career effectiveness makes the timing of Thursday's announcement somewhat of a surprise. Yet the Dallas native never made bold predictions about pitching to a certain age, or collecting a certain number of trophies or individual awards before hanging up his cleats.Now, he can ride off into the Los Angeles sunset as he arrived as a 20-year-old in 2008: healthy, with a chance to lead the Dodgers to a championship as a valuable member of their starting rotation.For more MLB news, head over to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting3 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
