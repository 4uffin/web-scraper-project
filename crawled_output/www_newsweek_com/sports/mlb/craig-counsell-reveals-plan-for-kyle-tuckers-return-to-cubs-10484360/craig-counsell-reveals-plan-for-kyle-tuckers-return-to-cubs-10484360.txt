MLBChicago CubsNews ArticleCraig Counsell Reveals Plan for Kyle Tucker’s Return to CubsPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 09:21 PM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 09:22 PM EDTBy Andrew WrightContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe return of Chicago Cubs right fielder Kyle Tucker appears to be coming in the near future.Cubs' manager Craig Counsell spoke to the media prior to Wednesday's game and revealed the current plans for Tucker's return to the lineup...."I think our goal right now is to be in the lineup on Friday," Counsell said via a video on X from Marquee Sports Network. "I think we're trending toward that. I don't have a report on today, but I think in talking to him before the day started, we were kind of on the same page with that."Tucker has been dealing with a calf injury that has sidelined him since the beginning of September. Originally, Tucker was expected to miss just one or two games, but it ultimately turned into what will be over three weeks of game action missed.By his standards, Tucker is having a bit of a down-year, as he has posted a .270 average with 22 home runs and 73 RBIs. Tucker had 23 home runs last season in just 78 games played compared to 133 so far this season, so it is safe to say he has seen a bit of a dip in the power department.Despite the numbers being a bit below what Cubs fans and the organization expected, everyone is still well aware of the superstar caliber player that Tucker is. His planned addition to Chicago's lineup not only Friday, but for the entirety of the postseason will give it one of the most dangerous lineups in the playoff field.More MLB: Why These Two Red Sox Hitters Will Benefit Most From MLB’s ABS DecisionRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
