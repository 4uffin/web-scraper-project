MLBDetroit TigersNews ArticleEnd of the Road? Veteran Right-Hander Released Prior to PostseasonPublishedSep 21, 2025 at 05:41 PM EDTBy Andrew WrightContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe month of September has been completely unkind to the Detroit Tigers.After being swept by the Atlanta Braves, Detroit holds just a one game lead atop the American League Central. Detroit's pitching staff lost a veteran arm prior to Sunday's game as it was announced that it had DFA'd veteran right-hander Charlie Morton....Morton was acquired by the Tigers from the Baltimore Orioles prior to the MLB trade deadline. He had a 5.42 ERA at the time of being traded, but it felt like that was due to a bit of bad luck and it would be able to get fixed.It ultimately was not, as Morton went 2-3 with a 7.09 ERA across nine starts and 39 1/3 innings pitched with Detroit. He allowed multiple runs in seven of those nine starts, as well as allowing five-plus runs in four of the nine. His last outing came Friday when he lasted just 1 1/3 innings and allowed six runs to the Atlanta Braves.Loading twitter content...At 41 years old, Morton's career is obviously much closer to the end than it is the beginning. He's been in the majors since 2008 and has thrown 2,266 1/3 innings in his career. Combine that age with a season ERA of 5.89 across two stops and it looks more likely that Morton may not be able to land another gig in the major leagues.It will be intriguing to see how he feels about trying to pitch next season, but Sunday's release may have very well marked the end of what has been a stellar MLB career for Morton.More MLB: Dodgers' 3-Time All-Star Suffers Possible Season-Ending InjuryRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting3 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
