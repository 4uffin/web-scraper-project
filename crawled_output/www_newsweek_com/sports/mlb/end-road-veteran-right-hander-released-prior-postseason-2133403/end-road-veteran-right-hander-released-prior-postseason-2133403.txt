MLBDetroit TigersNews ArticleEnd of the Road? Veteran Right-Hander Released Prior to PostseasonPublishedSep 21, 2025 at 05:41 PM EDTBy Andrew WrightContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe month of September has been completely unkind to the Detroit Tigers.After being swept by the Atlanta Braves, Detroit holds just a one game lead atop the American League Central. Detroit's pitching staff lost a veteran arm prior to Sunday's game as it was announced that it had DFA'd veteran right-hander Charlie Morton....Morton was acquired by the Tigers from the Baltimore Orioles prior to the MLB trade deadline. He had a 5.42 ERA at the time of being traded, but it felt like that was due to a bit of bad luck and it would be able to get fixed.It ultimately was not, as Morton went 2-3 with a 7.09 ERA across nine starts and 39 1/3 innings pitched with Detroit. He allowed multiple runs in seven of those nine starts, as well as allowing five-plus runs in four of the nine. His last outing came Friday when he lasted just 1 1/3 innings and allowed six runs to the Atlanta Braves.Loading twitter content...At 41 years old, Morton's career is obviously much closer to the end than it is the beginning. He's been in the majors since 2008 and has thrown 2,266 1/3 innings in his career. Combine that age with a season ERA of 5.89 across two stops and it looks more likely that Morton may not be able to land another gig in the major leagues.It will be intriguing to see how he feels about trying to pitch next season, but Sunday's release may have very well marked the end of what has been a stellar MLB career for Morton.More MLB: Dodgers' 3-Time All-Star Suffers Possible Season-Ending InjuryRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesPoliticsDemocrats React to Jimmy Kimmel’s Return from Suspension3 min. readPoliticsDonald Trump Tells Pregnant Women to ‘Tough it Out,’ Avoid Tylenol4 min. readPoliticsWhat We Know and Don’t Know About Trump’s H-1B Crackdown7 min. readPoliticsMap Shows Health Care H-1B Visas by State as Trump Floats Fee Exemption6 min. readPoliticsWhite House Shares Update on Antifa Crackdown as Trump Order Nears4 min. readPoliticsTrump Admin Vows to ‘Defend Every Inch of NATO’ After Russian Violations3 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
