MLBDetroit TigersNews ArticleEnd of the Road? Veteran Right-Hander Released Prior to PostseasonPublishedSep 21, 2025 at 05:41 PM EDTBy Andrew WrightContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe month of September has been completely unkind to the Detroit Tigers.After being swept by the Atlanta Braves, Detroit holds just a one game lead atop the American League Central. Detroit's pitching staff lost a veteran arm prior to Sunday's game as it was announced that it had DFA'd veteran right-hander Charlie Morton....Morton was acquired by the Tigers from the Baltimore Orioles prior to the MLB trade deadline. He had a 5.42 ERA at the time of being traded, but it felt like that was due to a bit of bad luck and it would be able to get fixed.It ultimately was not, as Morton went 2-3 with a 7.09 ERA across nine starts and 39 1/3 innings pitched with Detroit. He allowed multiple runs in seven of those nine starts, as well as allowing five-plus runs in four of the nine. His last outing came Friday when he lasted just 1 1/3 innings and allowed six runs to the Atlanta Braves.Loading twitter content...At 41 years old, Morton's career is obviously much closer to the end than it is the beginning. He's been in the majors since 2008 and has thrown 2,266 1/3 innings in his career. Combine that age with a season ERA of 5.89 across two stops and it looks more likely that Morton may not be able to land another gig in the major leagues.It will be intriguing to see how he feels about trying to pitch next season, but Sunday's release may have very well marked the end of what has been a stellar MLB career for Morton.More MLB: Dodgers' 3-Time All-Star Suffers Possible Season-Ending InjuryRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
