The month of September has been completely unkind to the Detroit Tigers.After being swept by the Atlanta Braves, Detroit holds just a one game lead atop the American League Central. Detroit's pitching staff lost a veteran arm prior to Sunday's game as it was announced that it had DFA'd veteran right-hander Charlie Morton.

Morton was acquired by the Tigers from the Baltimore Orioles prior to the MLB trade deadline. He had a 5.42 ERA at the time of being traded, but it felt like that was due to a bit of bad luck and it would be able to get fixed.It ultimately was not, as Morton went 2-3 with a 7.09 ERA across nine starts and 39 1/3 innings pitched with Detroit. He allowed multiple runs in seven of those nine starts, as well as allowing five-plus runs in four of the nine. His last outing came Friday when he lasted just 1 1/3 innings and allowed six runs to the Atlanta Braves.The Tigers have designated Charlie Morton for assignment.Morton had a 7.09 ERA through 9 starts after being acquired by Detroit at the trade deadline. pic.twitter.com/Anb3OfP49d‚Äî FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) September 21, 2025
At 41 years old, Morton's career is obviously much closer to the end than it is the beginning. He's been in the majors since 2008 and has thrown 2,266 1/3 innings in his career. Combine that age with a season ERA of 5.89 across two stops and it looks more likely that Morton may not be able to land another gig in the major leagues.It will be intriguing to see how he feels about trying to pitch next season, but Sunday's release may have very well marked the end of what has been a stellar MLB career for Morton.More MLB: Dodgers' 3-Time All-Star Suffers Possible Season-Ending Injury
