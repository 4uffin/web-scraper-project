MLBNew York YankeesNews ArticleYankees’ Paul Goldschmidt Breaks Silence on Retirement DecisionPublishedSep 25, 2025 at 09:30 AM EDTBy Peter ChawagaContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe New York Yankees won their fourth game in a row on Wednesday, defeating the Chicago White Sox and pulling back into a tie for first place in the American League East division with the Toronto Blue Jays.Now, with only a few games left and the chance for a first-round bye looming, the team will be focused on keeping its win streak going for as long as possible.But whenever their season does end, a few Yankees players will have some big decisions to make. Outfield star Cody Bellinger will have to decide if he wants to opt out of his contract and test free agency again. Pitcher Luke Weaver will have to decide if he wants to continue on as a reliever or look for a new deal with a team that will give him the chance to start.And former Most Valuable Player Award winner Paul Goldschmidt will have to decide if he wants to keep his stellar major-league career going at all....Goldschmidt joined the Yankees this past winter on a one-year deal and, at 38 years old, he is no longer the player he once was. He is now only playing against left-handed pitchers and has logged career lows in homers and RBI this year.If he does want to keep his career going, he’d likely have to settle for a diminished role with a new team, as it seems the Yankees would no longer have a spot for him. But when asked if he will retire after this season, Goldschmidt responded by keeping that possibility open without committing one way or another.“I’ll just worry about it (in the offseason),” Goldschmidt said, per Gary Phillips of the New York Daily News. “I’m always someone who stays in the moment. Whatever the future holds, there’ll be a time to think about that and deal with that then.”The fact that Goldschmidt has maintained a positive outlook and professional approach to his changing role could be a sign that he’d happily return next year no matter how much he might get to play. “I’m enjoying playing and I don’t want to let my focus shift from today’s game or this year,” Goldschmidt added, according to Phillips. The legendary first baseman might be keeping his focus on the unfinished business for the Yankees this season, but sooner or later he will have to evaluate the remaining options for him to return next year and decide if one is worth taking.More MLB: Blue Jays Manager Gives Fiery Response After Second Straight LossRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
