WrestlingWWEProfessional WrestlingNews ArticleTop WWE Star Is Upset After Missing Out On Major OpportunityPublishedSep 20, 2025 at 08:54 AM EDTupdatedSep 20, 2025 at 05:33 PM EDTBy Andrew Ravens‎Contributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberJohn Cena's retirement tour is almost at its end, with just less than three months remaining. He didn't get to face many names and that includes Drew McIntyre, which is why McIntyre has now slammed Cena's heel run as a wasted opportunity.While speaking on the "Cheap Heat" podcast, Drew McIntyre said he's happy with the version of John Cena we're seeing now, that's the Cena he wanted to face.Drew McIntyre On John Cena's Heel RunMcIntyre admitted he said some harsh things about Cena over the past several months and meant them at the time, because he felt that wasn't the kind of Cena he wanted to fight. Drew thought Cody Rhodes was the best in-ring opponent right now and still believes that, but he feels once he beats Cody at Wrestlepalooza, he'll prove he's the best.Drew praised Cena's recent run, saying Cena has been performing at a very high level and looks like "Super Cena" again, going out in a blaze of glory with his recent matches."Absolutely. The John Cena we're seeing right now — that's the scene I wanted to see," McIntyre said. "Again, I've said some horrible things about him over these past seven, eight months, and I genuinely meant it. I was like, this is not the scene I want to see. This is not the scene I want to fight. I wanted Cody Rhodes."He's the best we've got in-ring right now, and I still believe that. But once I beat him at WrestlePalooza, I'll be the best. And I want this John Cena. He's been killing it. He's going out in a blaze of glory right now with these last couple of matches. Super Cena is back."A Wasted John Cena Opportunity...The Scottish Warrior explained he's always wanted a match and the mic time with Cena to show he belongs at the top. Seeing Cena's shorter entrances and blank stares felt like wasted chances to Drew, because Cena could have been trading promos with someone like him. That frustrated Drew, who knows how good Cena can be.McIntyre doesn't think the short entrances were a deliberate slight, but he admits he talked a lot of trash because it annoyed him to watch Cena hold back. Now that Cena is showing his full ability, Drew is more motivated than ever, but he's worried he might not get the chance to finish the story he wants.McIntyre said he needs the Undisputed WWE Title and wants to put something big in front of Cena to get his attention, to make Cena step up and prove himself against tough opponents. Drew wants that opportunity so he can prove to the world he can stand toe-to-toe with the best, just as he did when he faced CM Punk."All that time I was like, I want one of those matches. I want that opportunity on the microphone with him," he explained. "This is how I prove that I belong, how I tell everybody I belong at the top of this industry — to go toe-to-toe with that man."I saw that time, the black tron, the walkout, the blank stare, and I saw it as a wasted opportunity where he could have been going back and forth with someone like Drew McIntyre. Call it selfish all you want — I just know what he's capable of, and it was so much more. We're seeing it right now."More news: WWE Superstar Announces Retirement Match"So yeah, I don't think it was deliberate to walk in and do a two-minute Cena entrance that got people talking. But I just know how good he is and what he's capable of, and I talked so much trash because watching him sit on that and not go all the way was pissing me off. Now we're seeing how good he is, but what pisses me off now is the finish line — and I might not get that opportunity."I need that title. I need to dangle that carrot in front of him so he pays attention and goes, 'Alright, maybe I go over here and I'll show Drew what's up. I'll tear him to shreds.' I want that because I want to prove to the world I can stand toe-to-toe with everybody, just like I did with Punk."If McIntyre wins the Undisputed WWE Championship, it might be the perfect bait to lure Cena into one last epic match. So we'll have to see if McIntyre will end up facing Cena this year.More WWE News:Released WWE Superstar Retires From Pro WrestlingReleased WWE Star Breaks Silence On DepartureReleased WWE Star Wants To Join AEWFor more on WWE, head to Newsweek Sports.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesPoliticsDemocrats React to Jimmy Kimmel’s Return from Suspension3 min. readPoliticsDonald Trump Tells Pregnant Women to ‘Tough it Out,’ Avoid Tylenol4 min. readPoliticsWhat We Know and Don’t Know About Trump’s H-1B Crackdown7 min. readPoliticsMap Shows Health Care H-1B Visas by State as Trump Floats Fee Exemption6 min. readPoliticsWhite House Shares Update on Antifa Crackdown as Trump Order Nears4 min. readPoliticsTrump Admin Vows to ‘Defend Every Inch of NATO’ After Russian Violations3 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
