Two WWE stars completed their heel turns at the conclusion of "Monday Night Raw." During a backstage segment, Rhea Ripley challenged Asuka to a singles match after weeks of tension involving former WWE Women's World Champion Iyo Sky. Ripley and Asuka ultimately shared the ring in the main event of the red brand.Near the end of the match, Sane was hesitant before attempting to hit Ripley with a spinning backfist. Ripley thwarted the attack and pinned Asuka. After the match, Asuka spat green mist in the eyes of Ripley. When Sky attempted to make the save, she was attacked by her former allies.Asuka and Kairi, what have you done? ü´¢Rhea and IYO did NOT deserve this. pic.twitter.com/mIjgPIYZO6‚Äî WWE (@WWE) September 23, 2025

More News: Reigning WWE Champion Shares Big Personal NewsAsuka's History With Iyo SkyAsuka and Sky were members of the defunct Damage CTRL faction. Sky, Bayley, and Dakota Kai were the original three members of the group. Asuka and her Kabuki Warriors partner, Sane, eventually joined the stable.Before Ripley's match with Asuka took place, she advised Sky to watch her back around "The Empress of Tomorrow." Sky was offended by Ripley's suggestion and called Asuka "family." She then questioned if she could trust Ripley.Asuka and Kairi SaneIn the weeks leading up to Monday's episode of "WWE Raw," Asuka gave Sane orders to follow her around and stay away from Ripley. Prior to the main event, Sky asked Sane to speak to Asuka about her behavior. Sane told Sky that Asuka is the reason they're on the WWE roster.Sane had tried playing peacemaker to avoid a meltdown between Asuka and Sky, but she made her decision to remain a member of The Kabuki Warriors. While not confirmed at this time, speculation among fans is that a tag team match between Sky and Ripley and The Kabuki Warriors will be booked, possibly for "Crown Jewel" in Perth on Oct. 11.More News:New WWE World Champion Crowned in Wrestlepalooza StunnerBrock Lesnar Reunites With WWE Legend During WrestlepaloozaPlanned WWE Wrestlepalooza Match Moved to Another Show: ReportFor more on WWE content, head to Newsweek Sports.
