During a recent appearance on the Impaulsive Podcast, UFC President and CEO Dana White spoke about WrestleMania 41, noting that he was impressed by the business side of the event.More Pro Wrestling: Fan-Favorite WWE Superstar Bianca Belair Drops Major Update on Return"Yeah, I was blown away," White said. "First of all, I mean, selling out, you know, the Allegiant stadium, at that time, you guys had the biggest gate in Allegiant history, which is huge. I mean, the Super Bowl was there and everything else. We just beat you with Canelo Crawford. Yeah, it's impressive."
Despite this, White let the world know that he isn't a fan of professional wrestling and doesn't watch WWE.

"I'm not a fan," White stated. "I don't watch WWE. I'm into fighting man, that's what I do. You know how when you go on Instagram and then you go on your search page?

This echoed White's sentiment about independent wrestlers during an appearance on the Cutler Cast, where he suggested they join Power Slap instead."There is a bunch of people out there that want to get into the AEW or WWE, right?" White asked, per Skylar Russell of Fightful. "These guys will fucking jump off a ladder onto a table full of tacks for $50 a night. You can come into Power Slap and make a shit load of money."These guys are all tough guys, big guys so we're looking at these guys that wanted to be professional wrestlers and a lot of other athletes around the world to come into Power Slap."More Pro Wrestling: WWE Announces The Return Of Former ChampionWWE Suddenly Pulls Top Superstar From Big MatchTop AEW Champion Rules Out WWE Return In Definitive StatementFor more WWE and professional wrestling news, head on over to Newsweek Sports.
