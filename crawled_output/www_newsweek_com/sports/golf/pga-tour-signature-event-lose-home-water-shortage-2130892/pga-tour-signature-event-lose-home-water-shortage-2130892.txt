The 2026 PGA Tour schedule is slated to look very similar to what fans experience this year. However, there is a new glaring change to one of its signature events.On Tuesday, the PGA Tour announced that The Sentry will not be held at its usual venue on the Plantation Course at Kapalua. Maui Country in Hawaii has experienced extreme drought conditions that has impacted more than 140,000 residents, according to state data.A replacement site for the tournament wasn't announced.Due to the water shortage, conservation efforts have been focused on helping the local community. It is no secret that maintaining a pristine golf course utilizes an exorbitant amount of water.But there are also logistical concerns, including vendor coordination, shipping deadlines and tournament infrastructure build-out. All of which are even more difficult due to the remote destination of the tournament.

"Following discussions with the Governor's office, as well as leadership from Sentry Insurance, Kapalua Resort and Maui County, the PGA TOUR has determined the 2026 playing of The Sentry will not be contested at The Plantation Course at Kapalua due to ongoing drought conditions, water conservation requirements, agronomic conditions and logistical challenges," the PGA Tour said in a statement."Additional event information will be shared when appropriate."The Tour's agronomy team visited the site earlier this month, per PGATour.com. It was determined that the drought had severely compromised the grounds and potential playing conditions.With the tournament less than four months away, time was of the essence. So, the decision was made to relocate the 2026 version of The Sentry.The Sentry kicked off the PGA Tour season from 1986 until 2013. The tradition was picked back up in 2024 when the Tour reverted to the calendar-year schedule.Hideki Matsuyama is the reigning champion of the signature event. But he will not be the only player saddened by the news.Collin Morikawa, who has a soft spot in his heart for the island, has played particularly well there. Over the last six seasons, Morikawa has finished inside the top 10 each time, with two runner-up finishes.More Golf: Golf Insiders Predict Ryder Cup Will Be Unlike Anything the Sport Has Ever Seen
