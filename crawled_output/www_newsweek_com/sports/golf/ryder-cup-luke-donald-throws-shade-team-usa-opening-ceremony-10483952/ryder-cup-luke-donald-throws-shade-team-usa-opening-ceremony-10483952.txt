GolfRyder CupNews ArticleLuke Donald Throws Shade at Team USA During Ryder Cup CeremonyPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 08:52 PM EDTBy Devlina SarkarContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberAfter turning heads at Tuesday night’s gala dinner with sharp suits and red carpet glam, both Ryder Cup teams returned to Bethpage Black on Wednesday evening to wrap up their rescheduled opening ceremony.But while the outfits dazzled the night before, it was the words on Wednesday that reignited the simmering debate over Ryder Cup payments....The ceremony opened with European captain Luke Donald’s speech, and he didn’t shy away from the headlines. With the pay controversy dominating the lead-up to this year’s event, Donald leaned into the moment.“We didn’t come here just to be a part of the show,” Donald declared during the ceremony on Wednesday. “We came here to earn our place in Ryder Cup folklore. We’re not just playing to win, we’re playing for each other and for every young golfer back home who dreams about one day representing Team Europe.”He continued, taking an early shot at the US team. “We know it won’t be easy ... But we are fueled by something money cannot buy. Purpose, brotherhood and a responsibility to honor those who came before us. While inspiring those whose time is yet to come.”Loading twitter content...It wasn’t the first time Donald had aimed at the payment issue. Earlier in the week, he confirmed that Team Europe had declined a monetary offer tied to Ryder Cup participation.His comments have added fuel to an already heated storyline. With Team USA players set to receive $500,000 each, $300,000 of which will be donated to charity, the decision has split opinion across the golf world.Experts warn that if Team USA falters early, the money factor could quickly become a distraction, especially under the weight of the unapologetic crowd at New York.And that crowd is already reacting. As Donald’s speech made the rounds on social media, fans took to X with mixed emotions.Golf Fans React to Luke Donald’s Dig at Team USA“He’s just angering the fans and they will let them know on Friday,” one user posted, responding to a clip shared by Nuclr Golf on X.Another tried to cool the tension, commenting, “Relax man, it’s just a golf competition,” under the same post. But not everyone was critical. Some applauded Donald’s stance, with comments reading, “Spot on from Luke,” and “This was needed.”As the countdown to Friday’s first tee at Bethpage Black continues, it's clear that the tone has already been set with a war outside the course.More Golf: Ryder Cup 2025: Tee Times and Full Match Schedule at Bethpage BlackRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
