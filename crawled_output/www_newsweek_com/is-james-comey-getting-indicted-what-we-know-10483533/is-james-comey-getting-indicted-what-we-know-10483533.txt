NewsDonald TrumpJames ComeyFBIFBI DirectorFBI InvestigationNews ArticleIs James Comey Getting Indicted? What We KnowPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 05:27 PM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 12:33 AM EDT...By Hollie Silverman, Jenna Sundel, and Robert BirselShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberFormer FBI Director James Comey could face perjury charges due to alleged false statements made to Congress during a 2020 testimony, according to reports from multiple media outlets.Federal prosecutors are still deciding whether to bring those charges forward as the legal deadline looms, CNN reported, citing people familiar with the situation.Although prosecutors haven't found sufficient evidence to charge Comey, the US Attorney in Virginia plans to ask a grand jury to indict him, according to a report from ABC News.The possible charges stem from alleged false statements Comey made on September 30, 2020, while giving testimony on possible Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, according to CNN.Why It MattersComey, who was first appointed by former President Barack Obama, was fired by President Donald Trump for his handling of an investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of her personal email.Since his firing, Comey has been a critic of Trump and his administration.What To KnowComey has not been charged with a crime and has maintained that he’s been truthful under oath, CNN reported.Earlier this week, prosecutors presented Lindsey Halligan, a former personal attorney of Trump who he selected to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, with a memo recommending she decline to bring perjury and obstruction charges against Comey, ABC News reported, citing sources familiar with the memo.Trump referenced Comey in a recent Truth Social post directly addressing Attorney General Pam Bondi.Trump wrote, "Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, 'same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam 'Shifty' Schiff, Leticia??? They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done.' Then we almost put in a Democrat supported U.S. Attorney, in Virginia, with a really bad Republican past. A Woke RINO, who was never going to do his job. That’s why two of the worst Dem Senators PUSHED him so hard. He even lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case. No, I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so."The president continued, "Lindsey Halligan is a really good lawyer, and likes you, a lot. We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!"What Happens NextUnder criminal law, prosecutors would generally only have five years to the day to file such charges, CNN reported.Update 9/25/25, 12:20 a.m. ET: This breaking news story was updated with additional information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
