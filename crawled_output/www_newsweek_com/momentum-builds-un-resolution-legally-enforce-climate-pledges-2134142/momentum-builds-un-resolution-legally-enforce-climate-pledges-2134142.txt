WorldNewsweek Climate Week 2025 EventVanuatuExclusiveInterviewInternational AffairsClimate ChangeMoreNews ArticleMomentum Builds for UN Resolution to Legally Enforce Climate PledgesPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 12:44 PM EDTBy Gemma WatsonShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA diplomatic campaign to ensure countries deliver on climate change commitments was underway this week at the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.It follows a landmark Advisory Opinion issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in July, when the world's highest international court unanimously determined that a failure to act on climate change commitments by countries could be a breach of international law.The case was heard after a campaign from the small island nation of Vanuatu. Following that success, they are now campaigning for a UN General Assembly resolution endorsing the court's findings.Speaking exclusively to Newsweek, the Minister for Climate Change of Vanuatu, Ralph Regenvanu, was bullish about their chances of success. "You need a simple majority of states, and we have that."A vote on Vanuatu's resolution is expected to be held later this year. They and other countries in favor have spent much of the annual gathering of the UN General Assembly in New York this week building alliances."We are here to build support for a resolution to bring back to the General Assembly endorsing the Advisory Opinion and asking for its operationalization as part of the UN system and in states."We are building a coalition of the willing to take that resolution forward, so that we can start to see implementation of some of its recommendations in the UN system itself and in some states as well."...Regenvanu was speaking on the Climate Week NYC Daily Show produced by Newsweek and Hi Impact."We are saying that these things we sign up to, like the Paris Agreement, these are legal instruments. You are legally obligated. What has been happening is we haven't seen the action to match the commitments that have been made.""We've seen with this Advisory Opinion, it says when you make a commitment you are obliged under international law to do it. That will give us a lot more strength to negotiate in these forums, for example like COP30 coming up this year.""For climate groups that are in countries that are non-compliant, taking their own governments to court. You can now use the Advisory Opinion in any court, at any level domestically because the ICJ is the highest court in the world."Newsweek is celebrating New York City's 2025 Climate Week with events throughout the week. Pillars of the Green Transition will take place on September 24 and Powering Ahead: Innovations in Energy and Plastics Technology will take place on September 25. Both events will be held at Newsweek's global headquarters at One World Trade Center in New York City.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
