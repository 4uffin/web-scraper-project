U.S.Donald TrumpXi JingpingVladimir PutinKim Jon UnDictatorshipSouth DakotaMoreNews Article‘Mount Rushmore’ Of Trump, Putin, Kim Jong Un and Xi Jinping UnveiledPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 10:01 AM EDTBy Martha McHardyUS News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA new monument depicting a “Mount Rushmore” of world leaders—Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, and Xi Jinping—has been unveiled.Newsweek has contacted the White House for comment via email.Why It Matters The satirical display equates Trump with authoritarian leaders such as Putin, Xi, and Kim, a comparison that reflects ongoing global debates over his political style and rhetoric. By borrowing the imagery of Mount Rushmore—a monument celebrating U.S. democracy—the installation highlights anxieties about whether Trump belongs among strongmen rather than statesmen....What To KnowThe sculpture was unveiled on September 23 in the atrium of Bangkok’s Seacon Square, a huge shopping mall, as part of a camping-themed event.The two-storey replica was built to promote the Somewhere Else The Series–The Summit Camp event. Visitors can pay 99 baht ($3.09) to scale a rock-climbing wall beside the installation or take part in archery activities. Camping gear, free food, and beverages are also on offer near the display.The installation takes its inspiration from Mount Rushmore, the granite monument in South Dakota completed in 1941, which features the carved faces of U.S. presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln to represent the country’s founding, growth, development, and preservation.Is Trump a Dictator? Trump has faced mounting accusations in 2025 of behaving like a dictator, with critics pointing to a series of moves they say undermine democratic institutions and concentrate power in the presidency.Democratic leaders have been some of the loudest voices sounding the alarm. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned that Trump’s efforts to use the Justice Department to target political opponents marked “the path to a dictatorship.” Senator Chris Murphy echoed the concern, saying the U.S. risked becoming a “banana republic” if the Justice Department were weaponized against critics.That came after Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to step up investigations into his political rivals. In a social media post directed at Bondi, he wrote: "We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility."He went on to complain that "nothing is being done," while specifically calling for probes into former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and Democratic Senator Adam Schiff, who led his first impeachment trial.Trump has also leaned heavily on aggressive rhetoric when dealing with U.S. cities. He threatened to send National Guard troops and immigration agents into Chicago, even releasing a stylized image portraying a “war” on the city. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker condemned the move, calling Trump a “wannabe dictator.” Authoritarian MovesAt times, Trump has directly addressed the accusation. “I’m not a dictator. I don’t like a dictator,” he has said in response to criticism. But in other contexts, he has appeared to toy with the label, claiming, “a lot of people are saying ‘maybe we’d like a dictator,’” when defending his tough-on-crime policies.Scholars and experts argue that the comparisons are not just rhetorical. Kim Lane Scheppele, a Princeton University professor who studies authoritarian governments, told The Guardian Trump’s willingness to mobilize the National Guard suggested he was preparing “a military, repressive force … to just put down the whole thing by force.” Political scientist Steven Levitsky likewise warned that Trump’s actions amounted to authoritarianism, pointing to the systematic abuse of power, efforts to tilt the playing field, and erosion of democratic guardrails.Could Trump Go On Rushmore? Earlier this year, Republican Representative Anna Paulina Luna introduced a bill to add Trump's face to Mount Rushmore. The bill stalled in the House Committee on Natural Resources.“President Trump’s bold leadership and steadfast dedication to America’s greatness have cemented his place in history," Luna said in a press release. "Mount Rushmore, a timeless symbol of our nation’s freedom and strength, deserves to reflect his towering legacy—a legacy further solidified by the powerful start to his second term." The original sculptor, Gutzon Borglum, previously said he doubted anyone else could fit on the monument, as NBC News reported.That has not stopped Trump supporters from suggesting his face be added. “Well, they certainly have room for it there,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told Lara Trump on her Fox News show when she asked if Trump could one day appear on the monument.Trump himself addressed the idea back in August 2020, denying a report that White House aides had contacted then–South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem about the process. “Never suggested it although, based on all of the many things accomplished during the first 3 1/2 years, perhaps more than any other Presidency, sounds like a good idea to me!” he wrote on Twitter. He would not be the first president whose supporters sought such recognition. After Ronald Reagan’s death in 2004, there were calls to add him to the monument. Even before Mount Rushmore was completed, first lady Eleanor Roosevelt advocated for including suffragist Susan B. Anthony.What Happens NextSomewhere Else The Series–The Summit Camp begins on September 24.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
