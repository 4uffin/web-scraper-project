WorldRussiaVladimir PutinDonald TrumpRussia-Ukraine WarKremlinBreaking NewsMoreNews ArticleRussia Mocks Donald Trump’s ‘Paper Tiger’ RemarkPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 03:56 AM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 05:34 AM EDTBy Robert Birsel and Shane CroucherShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA Kremlin spokesman has rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's characterization of Russia as a "paper tiger," noting that the country is traditionally seen as a bear, not a tiger, and there are "no paper bears".Why It MattersDmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, was responding to remarks on Tuesday by Trump who has grown increasingly frustrated with Putin as he seeks to broker an end to Russia's war in Ukraine. Russia has intensified the war as Trump tries to end it.Trump was referring to Russia's inability to defeat Ukraine since Putin ordered his forces to invade in February 2022, and the U.S. president's comments appeared to signal a sharp shift from his earlier calls for Ukraine to make concessions.What To Know"Russia is by no means a tiger. After all, Russia is more associated with a bear. There are no 'paper bears,' and Russia is a real bear," the Kremlin spokesman said, as reported by TASS, a state-run news agency in Moscow. Peskov said that Putin "has repeatedly and with varying emotion described our bear; you can recall this for yourself. There's nothing paper-based here; Russia maintains its resilience, Russia maintains macroeconomic stability," Peskov added, apparently referring to Trump's assertion on Tuesday that Russia was in "big economic trouble."Trump is pushing European allies to end their imports of all Russian oil and gas, and said the U.S. would follow their lead on tougher sanctions against China, Moscow's key strategic partner.Peskov said that Trump is a businessman and is trying to make the world buy more expensive American oil and gas, TASS reported.Peskov also said that Putin appreciates Trump's willingness to find a solution to the Ukraine conflict, and that a settlement will coincide with a revival of U.S.-Russia relations.Trump, in a marked change from his earlier position, wrote on his Truth Social platform that he thinks Ukraine, with the help of European NATO allies, can win back all of the territory seized by Russia."Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like 'a paper tiger'," Trump wrote.Trump has for months been pressing Ukraine to make concessions and floating the idea of territorial swaps with Russia.Trump's changing stance on the Russia-Ukraine war signals a major shift in the U.S. foreign policy with global implications.Trump shared the new position in a social media post shortly after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly....What People Are SayingTrump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday: “I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and win all of Ukraine back in its original form. With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original borders from where this war started is very much an option.”Zelensky, in comments to reporters after meeting Trump on Tuesday, said China's leader could also help to end the war: “I see that Trump is a game changer, and Xi Jinping can also have influence on Russia.” What Happens NextDespite Trump's efforts, there is no sign of any let-up in the fighting in Ukraine. Both sides reported more drone and missile attacks on Wednesday.
