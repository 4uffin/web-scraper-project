Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he had concluded that "no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive."It is a critical period in the government funding cycle, with just days to go before federal money runs out with the end of the fiscal year on Tuesday, September 30. A shutdown would halt certain parts of the federal government, furlough hundreds of thousands of workers, and cut off access to some services and facilities.The president was due to meet on Thursday with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. He accused them of seeking over $1 trillion of new spending for, among other things, transgender surgery for minors and benefits and free health care for illegal aliens."These Radical Left Views and Policies is what allowed me to win the Presidential Election, including all seven Swing States, and the Popular Vote, IN A HISTORIC LANDSLIDE," Trump said. "There are consequences to losing Elections but, based on their letter to me, the Democrats haven’t figured that out yet."Trump left the door open to a future meeting "if they get serious about the future of our Nation," he said.Newsweek reached out to Schumer and Jeffries' offices for comment.Schumer posted to X after Trump's latest comments: "When you’re finished ranting, we can sit down and discuss health care."Jeffries wrote: "Trump Always Chickens Out...The extremists want to shut down the government because they are unwilling to address the Republican healthcare crisis that is devastating America."...Government Shutdown Deadline LoomsCongress has failed to pass legislation to keep the government running after having deadlocked following rounds of voting late last week.While the House approved a Republican proposal to keep the federal government funded through November, the measure failed in the Senate, where the rules require a higher 60-vote threshold, meaning support is needed from both Republicans and Democrats. A Democratic proposal that would have boosted health care funds also failed.Democrats are working to protect health care programs. The Democratic proposal would extend enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, as well as reverse Medicaid cuts included in Republicans’ big tax break and spending cut bill enacted earlier this year.Republicans have said the Democrats’ demands to reverse the Medicaid changes are a nonstarter, but they have also said there is time to address the health insurance subsidy issue in the months ahead.In an earlier joint statement, Schumer and Jeffries had welcomed Trump's agreement to meet at the Oval Office.The Democratic leaders said they planned to "emphasize the importance of addressing rising costs, including the Republican healthcare crisis. It’s past time to meet and work to avoid a Republican-caused shutdown.”This article includes reporting by The Associated Press.Update 9/23/25, 10:55 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional informationUpdate 9/23/25, 11:18 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
