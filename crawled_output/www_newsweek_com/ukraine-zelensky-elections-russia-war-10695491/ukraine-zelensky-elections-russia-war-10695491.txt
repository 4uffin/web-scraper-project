WorldRussia-Ukraine WarVolodymyr ZelenskyUkraineBreaking NewsWorld NewsNews ArticleZelensky Says He’ll End Ukraine Presidency Once War With Russia Is OverPublishedSep 25, 2025 at 06:00 AM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 09:12 AM EDTBy Brendan Cole and Shane CroucherShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he does not seek to lead his country during peacetime once Russia's war is over. "My goal is to finish the war," Zelensky told Axios in a new interview, saying Ukraine would hold presidential elections when the Russian invasion ends. Only part of Zelensky's interview was published. The rest is due for release on Friday, Axios said.Newsweek has contacted the Kremlin for comment....Why It MattersDue to martial law invoked because of the Russian invasion, Ukraine cannot hold elections, a fact that Zelensky's opponents have used to criticize his leadership and question his mandate—including Moscow. But Zelensky’s comments suggest that despite the difficult security situation and Ukraine's constitution, a ballot was still possible, signaling he was open to a political shift in Kyiv to give a leader a new mandate to run the country after the war. What To KnowZelensky was elected in a landslide in 2019 and if it had not been for Russia’s invasion his five-year term would have ended in May 2024. Zelensky’s popularity has fluctuated from the highs of over 90 percent at the start of the war to still well above 60 percent.   Despite his popularity as a wartime leader, Zelensky faced the first major protests of the conflict in July after his allies in Parliament tried to weaken the country’s independent anti-corruption agencies, before the move was reversed.  Rumors of an election go back months, with David Arakhamia, head of Ukraine’s Servant of the People party, denying reports of a meeting in the President’s Office about preparations for a ballot. However, Zelensky’s comments to Axios suggest that a ballot could be on the horizon. "During the ceasefire, I think security can give the possibility to have elections," he told the outlet. If Zelensky endorsed a bill for elections, this would likely pass given his party’s large majority in Parliament.    Zelensky also told The Axios Show that if Russia did not end the war, Russian officials should ensure they know where the nearest bomb shelter is.  The Ukrainian president reportedly said he had Donald Trump’s backing to hit Russian targets including energy infrastructure and drone factories in tit-for-tat strikes. He also said he told Trump of his desire for an additional weapon system to speed up the end of the war. What People Are Saying Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, to Axios: "we can use this period of time, and I can give this signal to the Parliament" for elections and that Ukrainians may want "a leader with ... a new mandate." He added: "During the ceasefire, I think security can give the possibility to have elections." What Happens Next Zelensky gave no time frame for an election but his suggestion that it might happen during a ceasefire means that are many obstacles ahead. A peace settlement that would end Russia's war is stuck on two major points: territorial concessions and the future architecture of Ukraine's security. Russia demands that Ukraine recognize its control of the territory seized during its invasion. It also says it will not agree to anything that deepens NATO's involvement in Ukraine, such as peacekeeping troops from allies such as France and the U.K.Update 09/25/25, 09:09 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with further information.
