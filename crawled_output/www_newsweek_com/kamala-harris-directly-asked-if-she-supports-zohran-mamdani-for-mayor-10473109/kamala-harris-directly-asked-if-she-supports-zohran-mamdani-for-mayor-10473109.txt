Why It MattersHarris' endorsement represents a potential lift for Mamdani's campaign amid ongoing divisions within the Democratic Party over his candidacy.The former vice president's support contrasts with the reluctance of key Democratic leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, who have remained neutral.What To KnowOn Maddow's eponymous The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC, the host directly asked Harris if she endorsed Mamdani's candidacy. Harris responded: "Look, as far as I'm concerned, he's the Democratic nominee, and he should be supported."The former vice president went on to pivot the discussion to lesser-known Democratic leaders running in other mayoral campaigns, including state Representative Barbara Drummond of Alabama and Helena Moreno of New Orleans.Mamdani's campaign has gained significant momentum following Mayor Eric Adams' decision to remain in the race, which paradoxically boosted the assemblyman's chances from 79.7 percent to 85 percent on Polymarket prediction markets. Polling data reveals Mamdani's dominance across multiple surveys conducted in early September, consistently showing double-digit leads over his closest rival, former Governor Andrew Cuomo.Five major polls demonstrate Mamdani's commanding position. A CBS News/YouGov poll showed him leading 43 percent to Cuomo's 28 percent, while a Marist survey recorded a 45 percent to 24 percent advantage. Quinnipiac University's poll gave Mamdani a 22-point lead at 45 percent to 23 percent and an Emerson College poll showed 43 percent to 28 percent. The New York Times/Siena poll recorded Mamdani at 46 percent versus Cuomo's 24 percent.However, when hypothetical head-to-head matchups remove Adams from the equation, Mamdani's lead narrows significantly in some scenarios. While maintaining substantial advantages in most polls, the gap tightens to as little as 4 points in the Times/Siena survey, suggesting Cuomo could absorb anti-Mamdani votes in a more consolidated field.New York State Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs announced he would not endorse Mamdani, citing fundamental disagreements over policy approaches and specifically opposing his views on Israel. Jacobs said he "strongly disagree[s] with his views on the State of Israel" and rejects "the platform of the so-called 'Democratic Socialists of America.'"Despite calls from President Donald Trump for candidates to consolidate against Mamdani, both Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa have refused to exit the race. Adams spokesperson Todd Shapiro emphatically denied rumors earlier this month of the mayor's withdrawal, saying Adams "is in this race to win it," with more than 20 events scheduled and multiple fundraisers planned.What People Are SayingMaddow, during the interview: "Arguably the fastest rising star right now in Democratic politics is Zohran Mamdani who is going to be elected mayor of New York City, and, um, probably in a landslide, if the polls are anything to go by. Lots of mainline Democrats have been very shy about his candidacy."Jacobs: "Mr. Mamdani and I are in agreement that America's greatest problem is the continued growth in income disparity in our nation. On how to address it--we fundamentally disagree."Trump, on Truth Social: "Governor Kathy Hochul of New York has Endorsed the 'Liddle' Communist,' Zohran Mamdani, running for Mayor of New York. This is a rather shocking development, and a very bad one for New York City."Independent U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont: "The oligarchs are panicking. They will spend as much as it takes to try to defeat Zohran Mamdani. They've got the money. We've got the people."What Happens Next?With less than six weeks until the general election, the focus shifts to whether Harris' endorsement will encourage Democratic leaders to follow suit and publicly support Mamdani.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
