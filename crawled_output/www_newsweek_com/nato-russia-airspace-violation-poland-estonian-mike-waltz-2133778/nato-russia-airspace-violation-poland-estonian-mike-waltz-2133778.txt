Mike Waltz, President Donald Trump's new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, delivered his first remarks before the Security Council on Monday after months of delays and procedural hurdles held up his confirmation. He was confirmed late last week.Waltz spoke during an emergency session of the council on Russia's recent incursion into Estonian airspace."As we said nine days ago, the United States stands by our NATO allies in the face of these airspace violations," said Waltz, a former Republican congressman."I want to take this first opportunity to repeat and to emphasize: The United States and our allies will defend every inch of NATO territory."Trump Set for 'Major' UN SpeechTrump will travel to New York City later Monday ahead of what White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described as a "major speech" Tuesday at the United Nations on the "renewal of American strength around the world" under his leadership.Leavitt said Trump will also meet individually with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, along with the leaders of Ukraine, Argentina and the European Union. He is scheduled to hold a group session with officials from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.The president will return to Washington after hosting a reception Tuesday night for more than 100 world leaders.

White House Reacts to Russia's Nuclear Weapons UpdateThe White House on Monday said a Russian proposal to extend a nuclear arms control treaty by one year "sounds pretty good."Leavitt told reporters that Trump is aware of President Vladimir Putin's offer to prolong the pact, which limits both nations' nuclear arsenals.She added that while the president views the idea favorably, he plans to address it himself during an Oval Office appearance later Monday tied to an unrelated announcement on autism.What is NATO's Article 4?Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty allows any member state to call for consultations when it feels its territorial integrity, political independence or security is threatened. Unlike Article 5, which commits the alliance to collective defense, Article 4 does not require military action but opens the door for political dialogue and possible joint measures. Member nations have invoked Article 4 several times, including in response to the war in Ukraine and instability along NATO's eastern borders.Is Estonia in NATO?Estonia joined NATO in March 2004 alongside six other Eastern European countries, part of the alliance's largest expansion to date. The Baltic nation of 1.3 million shares a border with Russia and has been a strong advocate for NATO's presence in the region. U.S. and allied troops regularly take part in military exercises there as part of the alliance's efforts to deter Russian aggression.When did Russian drones enter Polish airspace?Poland has reported several airspace violations by Russian drones since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Poland invoked Article 4 after it said over 20 Russian drones entered its airspace on September 10 and later Romania scrambled jets in response to a Russian drone encroaching its territory.Updates: 9/22/25, 11:59 a.m. ET: This article was updated with new information.Updates: 9/22/25, 2:37 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.
