Unlike Article 5, which commits the alliance to collective defense, Article 4 does not require military action but opens the door for political dialogue and possible joint measures. Member nations have invoked Article 4 several times, including in response to the war in Ukraine and instability along NATO's eastern borders.Is Estonia in NATO?Estonia joined NATO in March 2004 alongside six other Eastern European countries, part of the alliance's largest expansion to date. The Baltic nation of 1.3 million shares a border with Russia and has been a strong advocate for NATO's presence in the region. U.S. and allied troops regularly take part in military exercises there as part of the alliance's efforts to deter Russian aggression.When did Russian drones enter Polish airspace?Poland has reported several airspace violations by Russian drones since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Poland invoked Article 4 after it said over 20 Russian drones entered its airspace on September 10 and later Romania scrambled jets in response to a Russian drone encroaching its territory.Updates: 9/22/25, 11:59 a.m. ET: This article was updated with new information.Updates: 9/22/25, 2:37 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
