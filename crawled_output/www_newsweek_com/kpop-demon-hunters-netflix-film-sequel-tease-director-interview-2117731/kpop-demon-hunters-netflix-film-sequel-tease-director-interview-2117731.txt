EntertainmentFilmsNetflixSouth KoreaAnimationNews Article‘KPop Demon Hunters’ Director Teases Sequel for Netflix’s Biggest AnimationPublishedAug 22, 2025 at 12:27 PM EDTupdatedSep 17, 2025 at 12:35 PM EDTBy Soo KimLife and Trends ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberKPop Demon Hunters, Netflix's smash-hit animation film, has taken the world by storm since its release this summer. With no signs of slowing down, its directors are "excited to explore what's next" for the budding franchise, Chris Appelhans, one of the film's directors, told Newsweek.Since its release in June, KPop Demon Hunters, which is produced by Sony Pictures Animation, has become Netflix's biggest animation film of all time and second-biggest film ever. It is currently the No. 1 film on Netflix and has been in its top 10 global film ranking for nine weeks, as of the week of August 11 to 17, according to the streamer's latest report. Its original soundtrack has swept up the top rankings across various charts on Billboard, Spotify and others worldwide.If that wasn't enough, the film's star-studded cast also includes Squid Game star Lee Byung-hun and Ahn Hyo-seop from a string of K-dramas including Business Proposal. There is also Ken Jeong from The Hangover film series, and Daniel Dae Kim and Yunjin Kim known from the famed Lost American television series....The film, codirected with Maggie Kang, follows a fictional K-pop girl band called HUNTR/X; their other mission in life, when not selling out arenas, is to hunt down and chase away any demons who try to take human souls away from the Earth.They soon meet a new rival group called the Saja Boys—demons disguised as a boy band looking to catch human souls. The film sees the two bands battle it out, both on and off stage, for the lives of their fans.As niche as that plot may sound, its story is rooted in Korean tradition, where many shamans in Korea, who tend to be women, perform various rituals to chase demons away from a household or home.The captivating film is full of blink-and-you'll-miss-it references to various aspects of Korean culture, both old and new, but at its heart is, of course, the music....Speaking to Newsweek ahead of a special theatrical release of the film this weekend in the U.S. and other countries, Appelhans said: "I had always wanted to make a movie centered on music, but in a nontraditional format. So, when Maggie first told me about her idea for the film, it felt like a perfect fit."Appelhans added: "We both have this pretty earnest belief that music is a force for good in the world, and so developing characters and a mythology where music could be an actual superpower was one of the first writing challenges we had to crack."Having "absolutely" been a longtime fan of Korean culture and entertainment, Appelhans has drawn inspiration from various works, from films to K-dramas."I saw My Sassy Girlfriend in college, and it redefined rom-coms for me. Then I saw The Host [from Parasite director Bong Joon-ho], which redefined what I thought was possible with tone," Appelhans said.He added that his "first K-pop crush" was the singer-songwriter/actor Rain, while his "first K-drama crush" was Boys Over Flowers, the 2009 series starring Pachinko's Lee Min-ho, "and it's just never stopped since."...The director said: "We're entering a time where my generation of U.S. filmmakers have formative influences coming from other countries and cultures, and I think that's great. Film is a universal language."KPop Demon Hunters' electrifying original soundtrack, which features a host of powerful, anthemic tunes, has also become a global phenomenon on its own. So much so that the film will be screened in cinemas across the U.S., United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand as a sing-along version on August 23 and 24.Appelhans said: "We worked really hard to find the 'story' of each song, but we also insisted that they always work as stand-alone pop tracks. A song like 'Golden' is basically the 'I want' song for Rumi, Mira and Zoey [the members of HUNTR/X]—but it can also be an anthem to anyone who's trying to find themselves and their place in the world. It's a credit to the whole music and story team that we were able to strike that balance."The film's songs pay not just a homage to K-pop, but also are very much chart-toppers in their own right that sound like they can easily appear on any K-pop album....The song "Golden" by HUNTR/X claimed the No. 1 spot on both the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts for the fourth nonconsecutive week in the week of August 16. The song also made history by becoming the first by an all-female group to top the Billboard Streaming Songs chart, according to Netflix.Back in July, the fictional girl band also beat real-life global K-pop stars Blackpink on the U.S. Spotify chart with "Golden," becoming the highest-charting female K-pop band. The film's Saja Boys usurped K-pop giant BTS as the highest-charting male K-pop band on the U.S. Spotify ranking with their song "Your Idol."The film features mesmerizing unique dance sequences, which were developed in collaboration with Korean choreographers. Appelhans said they worked with several "great choreographers in Korea" and an "awesome group called the KTigers" who mix dance with tae kwon do, the Korean martial art.Appelhans added: "We also asked our animators to push the movements and poses beyond the video reference, to distill and exaggerate in a way only animation can do, and they did an amazing job."...The film's combination of catchy tunes with dazzling dance moves has been especially popular with younger audiences such as Gen Alpha, which was "not at all" the film's deliberate target demographic, Appelhans said. He and Kang just "made the movie we wanted to see, with the characters, ideas and influences that we hadn't yet seen in an animated film," he added."That said, it's cool to see how much of the subtext the younger audience understands. I think we underestimate them a lot," Appelhans said.Asked whether there were any creative elements or character ideas that got cut from the final film that he wishes audiences could have seen, Appelhans said: "There's always more depth and detail to your characters than you can fit in the movie, but, for this particular chapter of their story, I think we're happy with what ended up on screen."With the film's unprecedented runaway success, could this be the start of another major global franchise, joining the likes of Squid Game?Asked about the movie's franchise possibilities and any upcoming sequels, Appelhans said: "For sure, Maggie and I are excited to explore what's next for KPop Demon Hunters, and we're thrilled the film is resonating with so many people globally."KPop Demon Hunters will be screened in select cinemas across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand on August 23 and 24. The movie is available for streaming on Netflix.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
