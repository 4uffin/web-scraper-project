"We hope our loyal guests will continue to dine with us at our many other Maple Street locations."Why It MattersThe restaurant industry has battled a number of headwinds in 2025, and is one of the sectors expected to be hit hardest by marked declines in consumer confidence and elective spending. For Cracker Barrel, the decision comes after the iconic restaurant and gift store chain altered its logo for the first time in nearly 50 years. While the company has shifted back to its "Old Timer" logo, the fallout has seen its share price plummet, with Cracker Barrel also acknowledging that this has negatively impacted sales.What To KnowCracker Barrel acquired Maple Street Biscuit Company in 2019 for $36 million. In a statement to Newsweek, the company said it was closing the underperforming locations as these "simply didn’t meet our financial expectations."The company has not disclosed which locations will be affected by the move, or provided a timeline for when the closures will complete. On Thursday, however, Cracker Barrel told Newsweek that the 14 stores had "already ceased operations," but that guests would still be able to visit the more than 50 remaining Maple Street locations across the U.S.In its most recent earnings release, Cracker Barrel reported $868 million in revenue for the fourth quarter, surpassing market expectations. Earnings per share, however, came in short at 74 cents....In a subsequent call with analysts, the company's chief financial officer, Craig Pommells, noted that the company had incurred a non-cash store impairment charge of $16.2 million in the fourth quarter, which he said was "primarily related to low-performing Maple Street stores."Pommells added that since August 19—when Cracker Barrel initially announced its logo change—store traffic had declined around 8 percent. Should this trend continue, the company anticipates a 7 to 8 percent drop for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.What People Are SayingCracker Barrel president and chief executive officer Julie Masino, in a recent earnings release, said: "We thank our guests for sharing their voices and their passion for Cracker Barrel in recent weeks, and we've listened, switching back to our 'Old Timer' logo, hitting pause on remodels, and placing an even bigger emphasis in the kitchen and other areas that enhance the guest experience."What Happens Next?Looking ahead, Cracker Barrel expects total revenue of $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion for fiscal 2026, compared to 3.48 billion in the prior year, alongside a comparable store traffic decline of 4 percent to 7 percent.Update 09/25/25 9:50 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information and comments from Cracker Barrel.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
