And you also have a beautiful name. I got use of that name, it's Kamala," Trump said, per the Times.Harris said that Trump also pronounced her name correctly on the call after mispronouncing it while campaigning, the outlet added.The former vice president also highlighted her selection of a running mate, saying she felt the world was not ready for a Black woman and a gay man on one ticket, so she did not choose former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg."He would have been an ideal partner," Harris wrote, "if I were a straight white man. But we were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man. But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk," per an excerpt reported by the Times.She said Buttigieg had been her first choice for running mate but she instead chose Tim Walz, governor of Minnesota, and they lost the election.Buttigieg told Politico on Thursday that he was surprised to read how Harris explained her decision, adding that he believes in "giving Americans more credit" than assuming they couldn't vote for a Harris-Buttigieg ticket."My experience in politics has been that the way that you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you're going to do for their lives, not on categories," Buttigieg said....What People Are SayingConservative commentator Scott Jennings, on X Thursday: "Kamala Harris claims she couldn't pick Pete Buttigieg as her VP because he's gay, so she settled for buffoon Tim Walz. So to her, being gay is a bigger liability than endorsing taxpayer-funded sex changes for minors?! This logic is incoherent. Voters made the right choice."Buttigieg told Politico:
"You just have to go to voters with what you think you can do for them...Politics is about the results we can get for people and not about these other things."What Happens Next107 Days will be released by Simon & Schuster on September 23.Update 9/19/2025 1:00 a.m. ET: This story has been updated to include more information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
