Trump announced on August 25 that he was firing Cook, "in light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter," adding that he no longer had "confidence in your integrity." He cited allegations of mortgage fraud.The case has sparked questions about presidential power and the independence of the Federal Reserve under the Trump administration.What to KnowThe former officials warned that immediately ousting Cook “would expose the Federal Reserve to political influences, thereby eroding public confidence in the Fed’s independence and jeopardizing the credibility and efficacy of U.S. monetary policy.”"Maintaining the status quo while the lawfulness of the termination is adjudicated, in contrast, would serve the public’s interest by safeguarding the independence and stability of the system that governs monetary policy in this country," the officials wrote.The independence of the Federal Reserve is a "critical feature of our national monetary system," they wrote, adding that trust that the U.S. will not have high inflation is necessary for the Fed's "mandate of achieving price stability and to ensure that the United States government, businesses, and households can borrow at moderate interest rates."..."Allowing the government to remove a member of the Board of Governors for the first time in the Nation’s history, while under the cloud of legal challenge, will erode public confidence in the Fed’s independence and threaten the long-term stability of our economy," the officials warned.Michael McAuliffe, a former federal prosecutor and former elected state attorney, told Newsweek on Thursday that the Supreme Court has indicated through its interim rulings that “its longstanding precedent endorsing Congress's limits on a president’s ability to fully control the leadership of independent agencies is at grave risk."This means that many of these independent agencies may "lose the historical protections that provided a measure of independence to their missions."However, the Federal Reserve may be an “exception,” he said, as some justices have "outlined the view that the Federal Reserve may not suffer the same fate.""The Federal Reserve is a congressionally created body and system of monetary policy and regulation. It has the distinction of being part-public and part-private. Its fundamental independence was a key element considered in its creation. Those attributes—historical separateness, special monetary policy mission, quasi-public—have been relied upon to assert that the Federal Reserve should be treated differently when it comes to presidential oversight/control," he said.Former federal prosecutor Barbara McQuade told Newsweek that Trump does not have the authority to fire Cook, and that “conflicting evidence about mortgage fraud does not seem to amount to cause.”At stake in the case is whether or not Congress “can serve as a check on a president who wants to replace career professionals with loyalists.”“Since the passing of the Pendleton Act in 1973, the law has protected employees from being fired without cause. That law has allowed the United States to develop a career civil service that acts with independence and expertise. Good people will no longer seek government jobs if they can be fired every time a new president takes office. In addition, we will lose the expertise and institutional knowledge that helps our government run effectively,” she said.She said that while some justices seem open to the “once-fringe unitary executive theory,” they could view the Federal Reserve differently, as it is a quasi-private organization.“Perhaps they recognize the danger of allowing a president to replace governors, who might out the president's short-term political interests over their best professional advice for long-term economic stability,” she said.Trump’s push to remove Cook marks an unprecedented effort to reshape the Fed, which was structured to be insulated from partisan politics. In its 112-year history, no president has ever fired a sitting Fed governor.Why did Donald Trump Allegedly Fire Lisa Cook? An appeals court previously upheld a lower court ruling that Trump cannot fire Cook. The administration has since appealed to the Supreme Court.Trump has raised concerns about potential mortgage fraud, alleging she claimed two properties as "primary residences" in July 2021 before joining the Fed board. Such designations can result in lower mortgage rates and reduced down payment requirements compared to rental or second-home classifications. Cook has denied those allegations, and Reuters has reported that unearthed documents challenged the Trump administration's allegations.What People Are SayingThe officials wrote: “An independent Federal Reserve’s ability to support strong and stable economic performance depends on the perceptions of businesses, workers, consumers, investors, and other members of the public. When confidence in Fed independence weakens, those independent actors will react to monetary policy in a way that undermines the long-term goals of the Federal Reserve. Because the Fed largely influences the national economy by setting expectations, rather than by directly controlling independent economic actors, it is crucial that those independent actors view the Fed as credible when it announces long-term goals and plans.”McAuliffe also told Newsweek: "One additional issue in the Cook matter is how the Court evaluates the meaning of 'for cause' which is the applicable standard for the president terminating a Fed governor. One could see the Supreme Court sidestepping the major issue of independence and somehow deciding the case on the narrow ground of what constitutes 'cause.'"Trump, in his termination letter, in part: "At a minimum, the conduct at issue exhibits the sort of gross negligence in financial transactions that calls into question your competence and trustworthiness as a financial regulator."Alan Blinder, former vice chair at the Fed, told CNN on August 25: "The bigger picture is sadly simple: The Federal Reserve is designed to be independent of politics, for very good reasons. He is trying to end that and make it an arm of the Trump administration, which will be very bad for monetary policy if it happens."What Happens NextHow the Supreme Court will rule on the case is yet to be seen, but its decision may have key implications for monetary policy moving forward.Update 9/25/2025 2:10 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.Update 9/25/2025 5:30 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsElon Musk’s Grok AI Inks Deal With Trump Admin to Integrate With Government3 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
