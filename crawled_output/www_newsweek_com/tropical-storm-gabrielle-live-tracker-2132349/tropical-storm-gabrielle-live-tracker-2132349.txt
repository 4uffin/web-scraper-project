NewsTropical StormExtreme weatherNews ArticleTropical Storm Gabrielle Live Tracker Maps: Latest Path UpdatePublishedSep 19, 2025 at 07:02 AM EDTBy Theo BurmanLive News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberTropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is gathering strength and could reach hurricane status within days.The storm is currently hundreds of miles from land over the Atlantic Ocean, but forecasters are closely monitoring its path as it moves northwestward across open water.Newsweek contacted the National Hurricane Center for more information via email.Why It MattersGabrielle is the latest in a series of storms to form during what is forecast to be a hyperactive Atlantic hurricane season. The NHC has already issued multiple advisories and forecasts for the storm, which could affect travel, supply chains and emergency preparedness in the Caribbean and southeastern U.S. regions if its trajectory shifts.What To KnowAs of Wednesday morning, Gabrielle was moving northwest at 14 mph and is expected to gradually turn north by the weekend.The latest forecast graphics from the NHC show Gabrielle's projected path staying over open waters for at least the next three days. However, the storm's track is subject to change based on evolving weather patterns in the Atlantic basin.Gabrielle had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph as of Wednesday afternoon and was located roughly 1,000 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands. If Gabrielle reaches hurricane status, it would be the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic season. Emergency management agencies across the Caribbean are beginning preliminary coordination, though no alerts have been issued as of Thursday morning.What People Are SayingAccuWeather lead hurricane expert Alex DaSilva previously told Newsweek: "While there will be a relative lull in tropical activity during the first few days of September, atmospheric conditions will become a lot more conducive for development later this week. As a result, we expect a greater uptick in activity starting around the end of the first week in September."Meteorologist Dylan Federico wrote on X on Sunday: "Conditions look favorable and I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes the next hurricane. The faster it develops the more likely it turns out to sea. Either way we have plenty of time to watch, as it's over 10 days away from the United States, if it ever even gets here. This is your friendly reminder that it's the peak of the hurricane season, and now is a good time to check your supplies and plan."What Happens NextThe hurricane center is deploying additional satellite monitoring to improve short-term forecast accuracy as Gabrielle progresses.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
