PoliticsZohran MamdaniNew YorkNew York CityElectionAndrew CuomoEric AdamsNews ArticleNew Poll Shows Zohran Mamdani’s Chances of Winning NYC Mayoral RacePublishedSep 24, 2025 at 11:31 PM EDTBy Anna CommanderDeputy News EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA new poll from Suffolk University shows Democratic mayoral nominee and New York State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani up 20 points over former Governor Andrew Cuomo.Why It MattersWith just weeks until New York City's mayoral election on November 4, several reputable polls show Mamdani, a Democratic socialist and first-time citywide candidate, holding a sizable lead over his rivals.His commanding position could mark a significant shift in city politics, especially considering the primary defeat of Cuomo and the presence of high-profile opponents such as incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.The race's outcome will likely influence policy priorities on critical issues for New Yorkers, from affordability and crime to the city's relationship with President Donald Trump and the national Democratic Party.What To Know In the poll, Mamdani has 45 percent of the vote compared to Cuomo's 25 percent, Sliwa's 9 percent and Adams' 8 percent.The University's CityView poll surveyed 500 likely election voters in The Big Apple and was taken from September 16 to September 18. The poll has a margin of error of 4.4. percent. The survey shows that the top issue for New Yorkers is affordability at 21 percent, followed by crime at 20 percent, economy and jobs at 14 percent and housing at 9 percent.Similar margins appear in other recent surveys, such as a Quinnipiac University Poll showing Mamdani at 45 percent, Cuomo at 23 percent, Sliwa at 15 percent and Adams at 12 percent among likely voters.Polls suggest Mamdani has built on his unexpected victory over Cuomo in June's Democratic primary, and recent market-based odds put his chance of winning as high as 88 percent, according to Polymarket. However, when major rivals are removed from hypothetical matchups, Mamdani’s lead narrows, especially against Cuomo, indicating anti-Mamdani voters could consolidate if the race dynamics shift....What People Are Saying Columbia University professor Robert Y. Shapiro, to Newsweek via email Wednesday: "Mamdani has a solid lead and Cuomo has only two hopes. One is that Mamdani will perform badly in the debates in October -- something close to a disaster. The other is that barring a poor performance by Cuomo in the debates, he will have a chance of winning if both Sliwa and Adams drop out. There is nothing Cuomo can do himself alone."What Happens NextThe New York City mayoral election is set for November 4. While Mamdani leads by double digits in most major polls, potential shifts could arise if key foes withdraw or endorsements change the election's landscape.Mamdani has still yet to receive endorsements from key Democratic leaders like U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, but did land New York Governor Kathy Hochul's backing.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
