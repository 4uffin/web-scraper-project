Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory panel voted Thursday to recommend limits on a combination vaccine that protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella/chickenpox (MMRV). The group advised that the MMRV vaccine not be given before the age of 4, and that younger children should instead receive separate MMR and varicella shots.The vote was 8-3, with one abstention.The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also delayed a vote on hepatitis B shots for newborns, a policy in place for two decades. On Friday, the panel is expected to decide whether some babies should be allowed to wait a month before receiving those shots, while also taking up guidance for COVID-19 vaccines.Why It MattersThe CDC's vaccine advisory panel shapes recommendations that influence state policies, insurance coverage and doctors' guidance to patients. CDC directors have historically adopted the panel's recommendations, which are closely followed nationwide.Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic before his appointment as health secretary, dismissed the panel's 17 previous members earlier this year and replaced them with a mix that includes anti-vaccine voices. That has fueled concern among public health experts that the new votes could heighten confusion among parents and undermine trust in vaccines....What to KnowThe MMRV debate focused on rare febrile seizures that can occur after the first dose, typically given to children between ages 1 and 2. Medical experts say such seizures are alarming but do not cause long-term problems. The panel previously considered the issue in 2009, when it said either the combined shot or separate doses were acceptable, though separate doses were generally preferred. Roughly 85 percent of children today receive the vaccines separately.On Thursday, the panel also voted 8-1, with three abstentions, to keep MMRV available under the federally funded Vaccines for Children program for kids as young as 12 months. Members expressed confusion about how that decision aligned with the new restrictions, and federal officials said other programs, including Medicaid, may need to adjust coverage. Merck, the vaccine's manufacturer, warned that restricting the combination shot could lower completion rates at a time when vaccination coverage is already slipping.The panel also debated whether all newborns should continue to receive hepatitis B shots within 24 hours of birth. The CDC estimates 2.4 million Americans have hepatitis B, half without knowing it, and that infected mothers can pass the virus to infants. Studies show the infant shots are up to 95% effective at preventing chronic infection. Some panel members questioned whether only infants of infected mothers should be vaccinated immediately, while others defended the long-standing policy as safe and effective.The panel meetings follow the Senate testimony of Dr. Susan Monarez, a fired former CDC chief, who told lawmakers that mixed messages from federal agencies and upheaval at the CDC were fueling confusion about vaccines and other public health guidance.What People Are SayingRepublican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician, invited Kennedy to speak to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee about recent upheaval at the CDC: "Because President Trump has called for radical transparency, I am inviting Secretary Kennedy to speak with the Committee to share his side of the story. This is how we fulfill the President's mandate — giving Americans the full picture so they can judge for themselves."Committee chair Martin Kulldorff defended the panel's work, saying its goal is to strengthen public confidence: "The members of this ACIP Committee are committed to reassuring the public and restoring public confidence by removing unnecessary risks and harms whenever possible. That is a pro-vaccine agenda."Committee member Dr. Cody Meissner expressed bewilderment at some of the MMRV discussion: "This an absolutely safe vaccine. I'm not sure what we're gaining by avoiding that first dose within 12 to 24 hours after birth."We will be creating new doubts in the mind of the public that are not justified."Dr. Flor Munoz-Rivas, of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said during public comment: "Why? Why are we addressing this hepatitis B vaccine recommendation? Is there really a reason that the committee can provide for making a change?Committee member Dr. Robert Malone responded to that question: "The signal that is prompting this is not one of safety. It's one of trust. And it's one of parents uncomfortable with this medical procedure being performed at birth in a rather unilateral fashion without significant informed consent."What Happens NextThe panel's recommendations typically go to the CDC director for approval, but the agency currently lacks a permanent leader. That means Kennedy himself, or acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill, may need to sign off. The committee is scheduled to continue its meeting on Friday with votes on COVID-19 vaccines for all age groups and on hepatitis B timing.Updates: 9/18/25, 7 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
