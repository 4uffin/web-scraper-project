Republican Jack Ciattarelli held a single-point lead over Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill in new internal poll of the New Jersey gubernatorial race.Newsweek reached out to the Ciattarelli and Sherrill campaigns for comment via email.Why It MattersThe New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial elections in November are viewed as key bellwethers for the mood of the American electorate ahead of the midterm elections, when Democrats are hoping to flip control of the House of Representatives, Senate and governor offices across the country.Democrats are optimistic about the chances of Sherrill, who has led independent polling. But Republicans believe polling has undercounted support for Ciattarelli, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump and garnered name recognition from his 2021 governor run‚Äîwhen he nearly unseated incumbent Democratic Governor Phil Murphy.What to KnowWith election day less than two months out, The New Jersey Globe reported on a new internal Ciattarelli poll, conducted by National Research, showing him lead Sherrill by a 46 percent to 45 percent margin.It surveyed 600 likely voters from September 16 to September 18. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.The internal GOP poll is the first to show Ciattarelli with a lead. Internal polls are often viewed as less reliable than independent polls, as they are released. But it underscores the competitive nature of the race. Read more

Other polls have shown Sherrill with a lead.A Quinnipiac poll, conducted among 1,238 likely voters from September 11 to September 15, showed Sherrill leading by about nine points (51 percent to 42 percent). It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. A Rutgers University poll, which surveyed 1,650 likely voters from July 31 to August 11, showed Sherrill up 10 points (47 percent to 37 percent). It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.New Jersey is a traditionally Democratic-leaning state, but Republicans have made inroads with the state's voters over the past few years. It voted for former President Joe Biden by nearly 16 points in 2020 and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 14 points in 2016. In 2024, it backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by nearly 6 points.Sherrill has represented a Morris County-based Congressional district since 2019 and has sought to establish a more moderate voting record. Ciattarelli is a former member of the New Jersey General Assembly and lost by only 3 points in his 2021 gubernatorial run.What People Are SayingCNN data analyst Harry Enten said earlier in September: "Why am I saying it's a flashing red siren for Republicans? If the same party has won in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races dating back to 1989, guess who won the U.S. House the following year? Six out of seven times, the same party wins nationally, and they win the U.S. House of Representatives if in fact win in both Virginia and New Jersey."Sherrill said during a debate Sunday evening: "I'm the only one that has a plan to actually take on the tough problems of New Jersey. In fact, Jack's been in office before, and a lot of the things he complains about, he was the architect of."Ciattarelli said during the debate: "I'm a two-time successful businessowner here in the state of New Jersey, having created jobs. I've also had the privilege of serving at every level of government‚Äîmunicipal, county and legislature, term-limiting myself each time, not taking the salary and benefits at the municipal, county level. I'm an MBA CPA. No candidate has ever come before you with that resume, so I'm committed to fixing our state."What Happens NextEarly voting will begin in New Jersey on October 25, according to the New Jersey Secretary of State office. Forecasters give Sherrill an advantage‚Äîboth the Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball classify the race as Leans Democrat.
