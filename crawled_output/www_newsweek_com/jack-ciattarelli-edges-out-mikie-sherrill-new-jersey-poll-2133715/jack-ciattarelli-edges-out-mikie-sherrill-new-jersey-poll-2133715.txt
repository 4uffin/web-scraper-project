NewsNew JerseyGovernorElectionPollDemocratsRepublicansNews ArticleGOP’s Jack Ciattarelli Edges Out Democrat Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey PollPublishedSep 22, 2025 at 11:44 AM EDTupdatedSep 23, 2025 at 06:14 PM EDTBy Andrew StantonWeekend Staff WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberRepublican Jack Ciattarelli held a single-point lead over Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill in a new internal poll of the New Jersey gubernatorial race.Newsweek reached out to the Ciattarelli and Sherrill campaigns for comment via email.Why It MattersThe New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial elections in November are viewed as key bellwethers for the mood of the American electorate ahead of the midterm elections, when Democrats are hoping to flip control of the House of Representatives, Senate and gubernatorial offices across the country.Democrats are optimistic about the chances of Sherrill, who has led independent polling. But Republicans believe polling has undercounted support for Ciattarelli, who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump and garnered name recognition from his 2021 governor run—when he nearly unseated incumbent Democratic Governor Phil Murphy.What To KnowWith Election Day less than two months out, The New Jersey Globe reported on a new internal Ciattarelli poll, conducted by National Research, showing him leading Sherrill by a 46 percent to 45 percent margin.It surveyed 600 likely voters from September 16 to September 18. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.The internal GOP poll is the first to show Ciattarelli with a lead. Internal polls are often viewed as less reliable than independent polls, as they are typically selectively released by campaigns. But the poll underscores the competitive nature of the race.Related StoriesMap Shows Health Care H-1B Visas by State as Trump Floats Fee Exemption6 min. readElena Kagan Warns Supreme Court ‘Overriding’ Congress to Give Trump a Win5 min. readFull List of Celebrities Rebuking Jimmy Kimmel Suspension in Open Letter6 min. readA National Research poll from earlier in September showed Sherrill up 2 points (47 percent to 45 percent). It polled 600 likely voters from September 8 to 10 and also had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points....Other polls have shown Sherrill holding a substantial lead.A Quinnipiac poll, conducted among 1,238 likely voters from September 11 to September 15, showed Sherrill leading by about nine points (51 percent to 42 percent). It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. A Rutgers University poll, which surveyed 1,650 likely voters from July 31 to August 11, showed Sherrill up 10 points (47 percent to 37 percent). It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.New Jersey is a traditionally Democratic-leaning state, but Republicans have made inroads with the state's voters over the last few years. It voted for former President Joe Biden by nearly 16 points in 2020 and ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 14 points in 2016. In 2024, it backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by nearly 6 points.Sherrill has represented a Morris County-based congressional district since 2019 and has sought to establish a more moderate voting record. Ciattarelli is a former member of the New Jersey General Assembly and lost by only 3 points in his 2021 gubernatorial run.What People Are SayingCNN data analyst Harry Enten said earlier in September: "Why am I saying it's a flashing red siren for Republicans? If the same party has won in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races dating back to 1989, guess who won the U.S. House the following year? Six out of seven times, the same party wins nationally, and they win the U.S. House of Representatives if in fact win in both Virginia and New Jersey."Sherrill, during a debate Sunday evening: "I'm the only one that has a plan to actually take on the tough problems of New Jersey. In fact, Jack's been in office before, and a lot of the things he complains about, he was the architect of."Ciattarelli said during the debate: "I'm a two-time successful business owner here in the state of New Jersey, having created jobs. I've also had the privilege of serving at every level of government—municipal, county and legislature, term-limiting myself each time, not taking the salary and benefits at the municipal, county level. I'm an MBA CPA. No candidate has ever come before you with that resume, so I'm committed to fixing our state."What Happens NextEarly voting will begin in New Jersey on October 25, according to the New Jersey secretary of state office. Forecasters give Sherrill an advantage—both the Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball classify the race as "Leans Democrat."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
