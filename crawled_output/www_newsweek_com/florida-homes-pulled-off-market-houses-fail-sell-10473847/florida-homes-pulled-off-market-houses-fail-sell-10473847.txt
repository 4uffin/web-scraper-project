NewsFloridaHousingHousing MarketNews ArticleFlorida Homes Pulled Off the Market as Houses Fail to SellPublishedSep 23, 2025 at 08:23 AM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 02:49 AM EDTBy Giulia CarbonaroUS News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA growing number of sellers in Southwest Florida are pulling their homes off the market, as the inventory glut that has built up in the state in recent months would force them to otherwise drastically lower their asking prices.According to a recent report by Realtor.com which refers to June data, Miami led the nation with the highest ratio of delistings to new listings that month, as sales dwindled all across the state and properties for sale spent longer on the market before going under contract. There were 59 homes delisted per 100 new homes listed in June in the Magic City, up from 27 a month earlier.Marliss Brockington, a full-time teacher and part-time realtor, told local news website ABC Gulf Coast, that she has delisted two properties “in just the last month, for two clients.” Less inventory, she said, helps her make “better sales.”What Do the Numbers Tell Us?Recent data shows us that Florida has tipped into a buyer’s market in recent months—which means that buyers have the upper hand over sellers. In these markets, there is typically plenty of inventory for buyers to choose from, homes take longer to sell, and when they do they usually have price cuts.Inventory has definitely grown in Florida, which has experienced a construction boom over the past couple of years as a response to the surge in demand during the pandemic home-buying frenzy. According to the latest Redfin data, there were 213,321 active listings in Florida in August, up 5.1 percent from a year earlier. While this number was down from this year’s April peak of 241,134, it was higher than any time since 2017, when Redfin and Realtor.com started collecting data. But demand for housing in the state has slowed down significantly in recent years as a result of the post-pandemic slowdown in domestic migration, sky-high home prices, and elevated borrowing costs. Sales were down 7.7 percent in August, according to Redfin, for a total of 29,816 homes sold statewide after an average of 79 days on the market—17 more than last year.Are you a Florida homeowner who has recently delisted their properties to avoid accepting a significant price cut? Contact g.carbonaro@newsweek.com to share your experience....As a result of this growth in inventory and cooldown in demand, sellers are increasingly being forced to lower prices to attract the few cautious buyers on the market.Based on the latest Florida Realtors data, the median sale price of an existing single-family home in the state was $410,000 in July, down 1.7 percent from a year earlier. A condo-townhouse unit went for a median price of $295,000 the same month, down 6.3 percent from July 2024. According to Redfin, the median sale price of a home—including all homes—in Florida was $403,000 in August, down 0.17 percent from a year earlier.Why Are So Many Florida Sellers Taking  Their Properties Off the Market?According to a recent report by Realtor.com, four of the seven U.S. metropolitan areas which officially turned into buyer’s markets over the past month are in the Sunshine State. These are Miami, Orlando, Jacksonville, and Tampa.In all of these cities, inventory has surged by double-digits over the past year, homes for sale are spending longer on the market before going under contract, and prices are trending down. Miami, for example, had 9.7 months of supply—meaning that it would take nearly 10 months for buyers to go through the current inventory levels in the city at the current pace. The city’s inventory had surged 35 percent compared to the previous year, and homes were taking 15 days longer to sell. As a result, the median list price in the city was $510,000 that same month, down 4.7 percent from a year earlier.For sellers who may have bought their homes at the height of the pandemic and were wishing to now fetch the same prices for them, Florida’s recent shift in favor of buyers is a tough pill to swallow.Those who are not willing to take a price cut are instead choosing to delist their properties—especially in Southwest Florida, which is experiencing supply headwinds at the same time as other rising costs, including home insurance premiums and homeowners association (HOA) fees, challenge buyers.“The reason they’re pulling their houses is they’ve got a lot of equity,” Mike Pappas, CEO of real estate firm The Keyes Company told the South Florida Sun Sentinel, “and there’s no need to sell necessarily.”What Does This Mean for the Market?Experts said that delistings will eventually help create a more balanced housing market in Florida.“That’s actually what supports the pricing better,” Pappas said, “because sellers say, ‘I won’t sell for a lower price,’ and it actually props up the price for the rest of them. We’re right at that balancing act on who’s going to win between the sellers or the buyers.”According to a recent Realtor.com report, Florida’s economy remains a “bright spot,” propping up its struggling housing market. In Miami, Orlando, Jacksonville, and Tampa, unemployment rates are below the national average of 4.3 percent. “Strong job growth, steady in-migration, and diverse local economies mean demand fundamentals remain intact,” the report said.“Florida’s transition from a pandemic-era seller’s market to a more balanced landscape underscores a maturing cycle, one where buyers can finally regain some leverage. At the same time, the state’s solid employment base continues to support long-term housing demand.”Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
