Newsweek reached out to the company via phone Tuesday for comment but did not get an answer. Why It Matters Numerous public health alerts and recalls have been initiated this year because of the potential for damaged products, foodborne illness, contamination and undeclared food allergens.Millions of Americans experience food sensitivities or allergies every year. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the nine "major" food allergens in the United States are eggs, milk, fish, wheat, soybeans, crustacean shellfish, sesame, tree nuts and peanuts.People who have an allergy to shrimp and milk "run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products," the alert says. What To Know In the alert, the product, “Stewed Aged Kimchi W/ Mackerel”, was distributed to supermarkets in New York and New Jersey. The product is packaged in 57-ounce, black bottomed plastic containers, with an expiration date prior to September 16, 2025. The product's UPC number is 27300700000, the alert notes.
...What People Are Saying The alert in part: "The recall was initiated after New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets Food Inspectors have found out the label for 'Stewed Aged Kimchi w/ Mackerel' does not display the allergen milk and shrimp."In an email to Newsweek in January, the FDA said: "Most recalls in the U.S. are carried out voluntarily by the product manufacturer and when a company issues a public warning, typically via news release, to inform the public of a voluntary product recall, the FDA shares that release on our website as a public service."The FDA's role during a voluntary, firm-initiated, recall is to review the recall strategy, evaluate the health hazard presented by the product, monitor the recall, and as appropriate alert the public and other companies in the supply chain about the recall."The FDA provides public access to information on recalls by posting a listing of recalls according to their classification in the FDA Enforcement Report, including the specific action taken by the recalling company. The FDA Enforcement Report is designed to provide a public listing of products in the marketplace that are being recalled."Additional information on recalls can be found via the FDA's Recalls, Market Withdrawals, & Safety Alerts.What Happens NextCustomers who have purchased the recalled kimchi are urged to return it to the original place of purchase for a refund, the alert says.
