He busts out some more moves, only this time, his dad, 34-year-old Brandon, walks into the room behind him....When Noah finally turns around, the two lock eyes, burst into laughter, and Brandon can be heard saying: "What are you doing, dude? I love you so much. You're so funny."Storm wrote on the text overlay: "Waiting for dad to come home not realizing he's already home."Speaking about the video, Storm, who is also mom to 10-year-old Korra, told Newsweek that there was nothing unusual about the scene—this is just Noah being himself when he thinks no one is watching."He does this every day for both me and my husband," Storm said. What made the moment extra-special, though, was seeing Noah's silly side shine through.The mom of two captioned the clip: "It's rare for him to be weird so I absolutely love catching these moments.""My son is a very shy child so, when we see him open up and be weird and silly, we just love to see it," Storm said. "We try to raise our children not to be shy and to be their true authentic [selves] no matter what anyone tells them."Noah's initial embarrassment quickly gave way to laughter. "You can tell he was a little embarrassed, but thought it was funny, and my husband loved seeing him being silly," Storm said.The footage of Noah has gone viral on TikTok, clocking up more than 2.3 million views and over 510,000 likes.User couldn't get enough of the boy's dancing in the comments."The way he looks, dances, looks, dances is killing me," one user posted."So he was doing that without music?" another user asked. "Not a single sound," Storm confirmed.A third user wrote: "The way dad stopped, stared letting him do his thing."Storm said the sweetest part has been the warmth of the comments section. "[It's] my first viral video," she added. "My first one was of my daughter, but I just like how positive everyone is in the comments."Do you have any funny or adorable videos or pictures that you want to share? We want to see the best ones!
