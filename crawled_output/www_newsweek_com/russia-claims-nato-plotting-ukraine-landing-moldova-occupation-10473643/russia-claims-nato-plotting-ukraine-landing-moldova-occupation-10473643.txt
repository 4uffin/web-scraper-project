News ArticleRussia Claims NATO Plotting Ukraine ‘Landing’, Moldova ‘Occupation’PublishedSep 23, 2025 at 04:57 AM EDTupdatedSep 23, 2025 at 10:35 AM EDTBy Barney HendersonContent DirectorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberRussia has said it believes NATO is plotting a "landing" in Ukraine as part of a bid by the European Union to "occupy" Moldova.The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) claimed NATO military units were massing in Romania close to the Moldovan border and were also planning a "landing" in Ukraine's Odesa region, according to TASS, Moscow's state news agency.Why It MattersMoldova goes to the polls on Sunday in a critical parliamentary election. The vote is seen as a stark choice for the country between a path to EU membership or closer ties with Moscow.Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moldova applied to join the EU. It was given candidate status later that year and, in 2024, the EU agreed to open accession negotiations, further increasing tensions with Russia....What to KnowThe Russian intelligence report said that the EU was "determined to keep Moldova within the framework of their Russophobic policies.""This is planned to be done at any cost, including the deployment of troops and the de facto occupation of the country. At this stage, NATO military units are concentrating in Romania near the Moldovan border," the report stated."A NATO 'landing' is being prepared in Ukraine's Odesa region to intimidate Transnistria. According to available information, the first group of career military personnel from France and Great Britain has already arrived."Newsweek contacted the EU and NATO for comment on the Russian claims. Moldova Detains Dozens over Alleged Russia-Backed Unrest PlotMoldovan authorities carried out 250 raids and over 70 people Monday as part of an investigation into an alleged Russia-backed plan to incite unrest ahead of the election.Moldova’s police force said the plan to incite "mass riots" was "coordinated from the Russian Federation, through criminal elements."Moscow has consistently denied it is interfering in Moldova's election.
What People Are SayingMoldova's pro-Western President Maia Sandu said the Kremlin is spending "hundreds of millions of euros" to influence the election."People are intoxicated daily with lies," she said. "Hundreds of individuals are paid to provoke disorder, violence, and spread fear. … I appeal to all citizens: we must not allow our country to be handed over to foreign interests."Igor Dodon, the joint leader of the pro-Russian Patriotic bloc, said on the Telegram messaging app that members of his party had been targeted in Monday's raid. He said the Moldovan government "is trying to intimidate us, frighten the people and silence us."What Happens NextMoldovans will vote to choose a new 101-seat legislature on Sunday.This article includes reporting from The Associated Press.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
