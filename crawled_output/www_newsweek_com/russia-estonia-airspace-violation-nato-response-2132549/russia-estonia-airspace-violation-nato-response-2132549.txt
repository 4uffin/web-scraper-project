WorldRussiaNATOEstoniaBreaking NewsNews ArticleNATO Reacts After ‘Unprecedented’ Russian Airspace ViolationPublishedSep 19, 2025 at 10:14 AM EDTupdatedSep 19, 2025 at 11:41 AM EDTBy Dan Gooding and Amanda CastroShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberNATO has reacted after Russian military jets breached Estonian airspace on Friday, marking a fresh provocation near the bloc's eastern flank.Three Russian fighter jets entered Estonian airspace for several minutes earlier in the day, before leaving again, according to the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs."Russia has already violated Estonia's airspace four times this year, which in itself is unacceptable. But today's incursion, involving three fighter aircraft entering our airspace, is unprecedentedly brazen," Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said in a statement.NATO's Spokesperson Allison Hart told Newsweek that the organization had responded."Earlier today, Russian jets violated Estonian airspace. NATO responded immediately and intercepted the Russian aircraft," Hart said. This is yet another example of reckless Russian behaviour and NATO's ability to respond."Newsweek reached out to the Russian Embassy in Estonia for comment via email on Friday morning ET.Why It MattersTensions have risen in the region in recent weeks, with Russia seen to be threatening neighboring Finland and being accused of sending drones into nearby Poland, all while the war with Ukraine rages on.What To KnowEstonia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the alleged incursion took place over the Gulf of Finland.Three Russian MIG-31 fighter jets entered Estonian airspace for a total of 12 minutes without permission, with the country's Defense Ministry also reporting an incursion.Estonia's Defense Forces told Newsweek that the jets did not have flight plans and their transponders were switched off, with no two-way radio communication with Estonian air traffic control.Italian Air Force fighter jets responded, as they were taking part in the NATO Baltic Air Policing Mission and are currently stationed in Ämari Airbase, Estonia.Estonia is situated on the southern side of the Gulf of Finland, with Russia and its key city, St. Petersburg, nearby to the east.NATO's leaders have shown strong opposition in recent weeks to Russia's moves, in particular the incursion into Poland on September 10 involving drones from Belarus....Is Estonia in NATO?Estonia has been a member of NATO since 2004.As a member of the political and military alliance, which comprises 32 countries as of September 2025, Estonia can call on other partners to assist in diplomatic discussions and provide military support if necessary.Earlier this week, NATO scrambled its first jets to defend what it calls its eastern flank, following the incursion into Poland. Multiple countries are involved in the program, including the United Kingdom, Finland, and Germany.What People Are SayingEstonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna, in a statement: "Russia's increasingly extensive testing of boundaries and growing aggressiveness must be met with a swift increase in political and economic pressure."Kaja Kallas, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, on X: "Today's violation of Estonia's airspace by Russian military aircraft is an extremely dangerous provocation. This marks the third such violation of EU airspace in days and further escalates tensions in the region. The EU stands in full solidarity with Estonia."U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on U.K. Typhoon fighters patrolling Polish skies earlier this week: "Russia's reckless behavior is a direct threat to European security and a violation of international law. These aircraft are not just a show of force—they are vital for deterring aggression."What Happens NextEU and NATO officials have suggested a strong response to Russia's actions, with the latter yet to officially acknowledge the incident.
