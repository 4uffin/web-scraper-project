Family & ParentingTeenagersGun ViolenceSleepSleep deprivationNews ArticleTeens Exposed to Violence in Their Community Suffer With Insufficient SleepPublishedSep 23, 2025 at 10:08 AM EDTBy Daniella GrayFamily and Parenting ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberTeenagers growing up in violent neighborhoods may be losing more than just their sense of safety—they’re also losing sleep.A new study from Mass General Brigham, published in the journal SLEEP, has revealed a troubling link between community violence, insufficient rest and teen involvement in violent behaviors. Drawing from nationwide survey data on more than 44,000 teenagers, researchers found that adolescents who slept fewer than the recommended eight to 10 hours per night were significantly more likely to have witnessed violence in their neighborhoods and to engage in violent behaviors themselves, such as fighting or carrying a weapon.  “This is one of the first studies to connect community violence with how much teenagers actually sleep,” said lead author Cornelia Griggs, MD, a pediatric surgeon and critical care specialist in the Mass General Brigham Department of Surgery. “It’s a reminder that sleep isn’t just an individual health habit, it’s also shaped by the safety and stability of the communities our kids live in.” The researchers analyzed responses from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey for 2019, 2021 and 2023.  Teenagers aged 14 to 19 were asked about their nightly sleep, whether they had witnessed violence such as stabbings or shootings, and if they had carried weapons or been in a fight in the past month. The results found 77 percent of adolescents reported insufficient sleep on school nights, while 10 percent said they slept four hours or less.  The less sleep a teen got, the more likely they were to report having witnessed neighborhood violence.  For those averaging four hours or fewer, the odds of having been exposed to violence were nearly three times higher. That same pattern held true for violent behavior. Teens who got too little sleep were more likely to report carrying a weapon, fighting, skipping school out of fear, or being threatened or injured at school. “This study sheds light on how insufficient sleep can contribute to cycles of violence,” said senior author Rebecca Robbins, PhD, a sleep researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders. “Future efforts should include advocacy around noise reduction and reducing nighttime violence, which could promote healthier sleep habits in communities that are disproportionately impacted by violence.” Interestingly, the study also found that the small minority of teens (1.6 percent) who reported sleeping more than 10 hours per night also had higher odds of both witnessing violence and engaging in it. “One possible explanation for this association is that adolescents with longer sleep duration may be experiencing underlying conditions such as depression, anxiety, or sleep disorders,” Robbins explained. “More sleep isn’t always better.” The team plans to further examine how gun violence directly affects teen sleep and the pathways by which poor sleep may encourage violent behavior.  They are also collaborating with communities to develop initiatives that support healthy sleep and help young people cope with the trauma of living amid violence. Do you have a tip on a health story that Newsweek should be covering?
