PoliticsDmitry MedvedevVladimir PutinDonald TrumpRussia-Ukraine WarBreaking NewsNews ArticlePutin Ally Ridicules Donald Trump—’Slipped Into an Alternate Reality’PublishedSep 24, 2025 at 11:24 AM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 12:51 PM EDTBy Jenna Sundel and Gabe WhisnantShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberVladimir Putin's ally, Dmitry Medvedev, issued a harsh rebuke of Donald Trump on Wednesday, saying on Telegram that the U.S. president has "slipped into an alternate reality" after Trump stated on Tuesday that Ukraine can reclaim all territory lost to Russia, marking a sharp shift from his earlier calls for Kyiv to make concessions.Medvedev, Russia's former president and current deputy chairman of the country's Security Council, posted on Telegram, "And Trump? Once again he's slipped into an alternate reality and delivered another round of political incantations on the subject of 'How weak Russia is.' After meeting with the Kiev and Paris clowns, he posted a dazzling update. There you’ve got Ukraine’s ultimate victory, a return to its old borders, Russia’s collapsing war economy, gas lines, and of course—the 'paper tiger.'"Why It MattersTrump said in a Truth Social post on Tuesday that he thinks Ukraine, with the European Union's support, "is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.""Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like 'a paper tiger,'" Trump wrote.The post came after months of pressuring Ukraine for concessions and floating the idea of territorial swaps with Russia....What To KnowMedvedev's post continued, "In this reality everything looks different. Kiev is winning, Russia is torn to shreds, and the economy of Banderite Ukraine is booming on its own resources. Trump’s predecessors Obama and Biden have long been living happily in that reality."Medvedev said Trump "isn't like that." "I have no doubt that he'll make another U-turn. He always does. He'll probably ask the green pianist sign the capitulation in a couple of days. Or maybe fly to Mars with Musk, freshly forgiven. Or do something else very important—something that just might earn him a Nobel Prize."Medvedev's post closed by seeming to mock how Trump often concludes many of his Truth Social posts by saying, "Thank you for your attention to this subject."Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told world leaders on Wednesday that the world is in “the most destructive arms race in history” and said Putin wants to expand the war in Europe."We are now living through the most destructive arms race in history," Zelensky said at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. “Ukraine is only the first, and now Russian drones are already flying across Europe, and Russian operations are already spreading across countries, and Putin wants to continue this war by expanding it.”What People Are SayingFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, on Telegram: "The main thing is to keep flipping his position 180 degrees on every possible issue. And everything will be alright. That's how you successfully run a state through social media. And, as the saying goes, thank you for your attention to this subject!"U.S. President Donald Trump, on Truth Social: "When the people living in Moscow, and all of the Great Cities, Towns, and Districts all throughout Russia, find out what is really going on with this War, the fact that it’s almost impossible for them to get Gasoline through the long lines that are being formed, and all of the other things that are taking place in their War Economy, where most of their money is being spent on fighting Ukraine, which has Great Spirit, and only getting better, Ukraine would be able to take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that! Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act. In any event, I wish both Countries well."What Happens NextThe war between Russia and Ukraine continues. Both sides reported more drone and missile attacks on Wednesday.Do you have a story that Newsweek should be covering? Do you have any questions about this story?
