Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers smashed Edgar Hernan Elias Escobar's truck window in an immigration arrest attempt after he "refused to comply with officer commands," the agency told Newsweek.Maggie Morgan, managing attorney of the immigration unit at Greater Boston Legal Services, the office representing Elias Escobar, told Newsweek in a Friday email that his wife, Leslie Perlera Gonzalez has "sponsored him through an I-130 relative petition so that he can regularize his status."According to ICE's detainee locator, Elias Escobar, of El Salvador, is being held at Plymouth County Correctional Facility.Newsweek also filled out a contact form on a GoFundMe set up on his behalf.Why It Matters Elias Escobar's detention comes amid an immigration crackdown under the Trump administration, with the president having pledged to launch the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.Immigrants residing in the country illegally and legally, with valid documentation, including green cards and visas, as well as those in the process of obtaining legal status have been detained.ICE has faced increasing criticism in recent months over agents' conduct and their use of force at times.

What To Know Perlera Gonzalez, a U.S. citizen and an attorney with Greater Boston Legal Services, said her husband was driving to work on Wednesday morning when immigration agents pulled him over. Local outlets WCVB and GBH reported that she was on the phone with him when she heard the glass shatter, and her husband saying shortly after "Ow, you are hurting me.""After they shattered the window, they tried to yank him out of the car. They grabbed him by his left arm, and his head snapped back," Perlera Gonzalez told WCVB.A senior DHS official told Newsweek in a Friday email: "On September 17, 2025, ICE conducted an immigration enforcement operation in Malden, Massachusetts to arrest Edgar Hernan Elias-Escobar, an illegal alien from El Salvador."The statement continued: "During the arrest, the illegal alien refused to comply with officer commands to roll down his window. The officers took appropriate action and followed their training to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve the situation in a manner that ensured the success of the operation and prioritized the safety of the public and our officers."Meanwhile, Morgan provided additional details to Newsweek, writing: "According to his wife Leslie, who was on the scene when he was being detained, he suffered bleeding from cuts to his arm when the window was smashed.She saw them put a taser to his face and they tried to discharge electricity multiple times and it failed. When they tried to yank him from his seat, his head snapped backwards from the force and he suffered arm and neck strain."The senior DHS official noted to Newsweek that "out of an abundance of caution, ICE law enforcement escorted Elias-Escobar to the hospital for evaluations. Medical staff found he had no injuries and discharged him. He was then escorted to the Boston Filed office for processing and will be placed in removal proceedings."Elias Escobar has a pending immigration petition, his wife said, telling GBH "the process for him to stay was underway."The couple has been married for more than a year. Morgan said Perlera Gonzalez filed an I-130 Petition for Alien Relative on his behalf to establish their legal relationship. After that petition is approved, applicants typically move on to the green card process.What People Are SayingA senior DHS official told Newsweek: "Illegal aliens can take control of their departure with the CBP Home App. The United States is offering illegal aliens $1,000 and a free flight to self-deport now. We encourage every person here illegally to take advantage of this offer and reserve the chance to come back to the U.S. the right, legal way to live the American dream. If not, you will be arrested and deported without a chance to return."Perlera Gonzalez told WGBH: "It's incredibly jarring because I see the worst of the worst on a daily basis‚ÄîI can't make sense of why this would happen to him. I'm now scared for anyone who looks like him, and I'm telling my family members who are citizens to carry their ID with them everywhere they go."Margaret Morgan of Greater Boston Legal Services said: "ICE targeting long-term residents, including those married to U.S. citizens like Hernan...In normal times, these cases, people do not get violently seized in their car when they have a pending petition like this."A GoFundMe set up by a friend of Perlera Gonzalez said: "Hernan has no criminal record, is a caretaker for his elderly mother, and has been living here for almost a decade."What Happens Next?Executive director of Greater Boston Legal Services, Jacquelynne Bowman, told WGBH that the firm "will pursue justice in this case."An online fundraiser set up to help him and his family has raised around $15,000 as of Friday.Update 9/20/25, 11:17 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with a senior DHS official's statement.
