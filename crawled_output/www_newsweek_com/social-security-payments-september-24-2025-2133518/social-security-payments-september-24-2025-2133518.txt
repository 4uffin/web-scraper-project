Millions of Americans who rely on Social Security are set to receive their next payment this week.The Social Security Administration (SSA) issues monthly benefits to more than 70 million people nationwide, a group that includes retirees, disabled workers, and the dependents of deceased wage earners. Because of the size of the program and various different payment types, the agency spreads payments across the month.On Wednesday, September 24, individuals receiving retirement, spousal, or survivor benefits whose birthdays fall between the 21st and 30th of any month will see their September checks deposited.Upcoming Payment SchedulePayments will continue in October on the following dates:Wednesday, October 1: Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.Friday, October 3: Social Security checks for those who also receive SSI.Wednesday, October 8: Retirement, spousal, and survivor benefits for people with birthdays from the 1st through the 10th.Wednesday, October 15: Payments for those born between the 11th and 20th.Wednesday, October 27: Benefits for those with birthdays from the 21st through the 31st.SSI is a federal program that provides monthly assistance to low-income seniors over 65, along with individuals who are blind or disabled.If you do not receive your payment on the expected date, the SSA recommends waiting three working days until contacting them to inquire about your payment.

How Much Is Social Security?In May 2025, the average monthly Social Security benefit reached $2,000 for the first time. As of August 2025, the average benefit level for retired workers is $2,008.31."The average Social Security benefit amount changes monthly," an SSA spokesperson told Newsweek. "Benefits are based on a worker's highest 35 years of earnings. As wages generally rise over time, each new wave of retirees tends to receive higher benefits."However, actual amounts differ from person to person. A worker who begins collecting at the earliest possible age of 62 can receive up to $2,831 a month. Claiming at full retirement age, currently 67, raises the maximum to $4,018. For those who delay until 70, the monthly benefit can reach $5,108‚Äîthe highest available.2026 Benefit BoostBenefit recipients will soon learn how much their benefits will increase next year through the annual Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA).The SSA determines this using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, which measures inflation. Since 1975, data from July through September has been used to decide whether benefits need to rise to offset costs such as groceries, housing, and medical care.The 2026 COLA will apply to all SSA programs, including retirement, spousal, survivor, and SSI benefits. Any increase will take effect with payments beginning in January 2026, with the SSA expected to announce the percentage increase in early to mid-October.Advocacy group The Senior Citizens League currently projects a 2.7 percent adjustment.
