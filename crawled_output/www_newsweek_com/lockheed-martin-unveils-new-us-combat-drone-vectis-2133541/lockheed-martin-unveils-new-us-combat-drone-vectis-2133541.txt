Lockheed Martin has unveiled its plans for the Vectis, a stealthy combat drone designed to operate either independently or in concert with crewed fighter jets such as the F-35.The drone, overseen by the defense giant's Advanced Development Programs, also known as Skunk Works, will "seamlessly integrate with 5th and next-gen aircraft to advance the Family of Systems vision for next-gen air dominance," the company announced Sunday.Why It MattersThe U.S. Air Force has shrunk to its smallest size in history, fielding less than half as many fighters in 2024 as it did in 1987. The fleet is also aging, with aircraft retiring faster than they're being replaced.Collaborative combat aircraft (CCAs), dubbed "loyal wingmen," are seen as a lower-cost, more expendable way to strengthen the air force fleets. Using artificial intelligence software, these drones will serve as force multipliers by augmenting the firepower of human pilots to potentially overwhelm enemy air defenses in conflict zones where an adversary would enjoy a firepower advantageNewsweek reached out to Lockheed Martin and the Pentagon, renamed the Department of War, via email for comment outside of office hours.

What To KnowThe drone's design supports a variety of roles‚Äîincluding electronic warfare, precision strikes, offensive and defensive counter-air missions, and intelligence gathering to help commanders make more informed targeting decisions.Vectis is also said to offer extended range, making it suitable for missions in the Indo-Pacific, European, and Central Command theaters (the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia).The news follows the U.S. Air Force's announcement in May that ground tests had begun for two CCAs‚Äîthe YF-44A and YFQ-42A‚Äîdeveloped by U.S. defense contractors Anduril and General Atomics, respectively.China, the U.S.'s near-peer military rival in the Indo-Pacific, also has a CCA program, with several said to have been on display during the "Victory Day" parade in Beijing earlier this month, according to state broadcaster CCTV, without naming the models.What People Are SayingOJ Sanchez, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, was quoted in the press release: "Vectis is the culmination of our expertise in complex systems integration, advanced fighter development and autonomy. We're not simply building a new platform‚Äîwe're creating a new paradigm for air power based on a highly capable, customizable and affordable agile drone framework."General David Allvin, the U.S. Air Force chief of staff, said in May: "CCA is about delivering decisive advantage in highly contested environments. The program is accelerating fielding through innovative design and acquisition strategies‚Äîand both vendors are meeting or exceeding key milestones. These aircraft will help us turn readiness into operational dominance."What's NextThe Vectis is projected to be operational and flying by 2028, Lockheed Martin said.
