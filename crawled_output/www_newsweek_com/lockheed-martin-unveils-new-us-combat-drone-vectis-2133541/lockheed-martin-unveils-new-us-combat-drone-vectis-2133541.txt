WorldDroneAircraftLockheed MartinU.S. militaryNews ArticleLockheed Martin Unveils New US Combat Drone ‘Vectis’: What To KnowPublishedSep 22, 2025 at 08:15 AM EDTBy Micah McCartneyChina News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberLockheed Martin has unveiled its plans for the Vectis, a stealthy combat drone designed to operate either independently or in concert with crewed fighter jets such as the F-35.The drone, overseen by the defense giant's Advanced Development Programs, also known as Skunk Works, will "seamlessly integrate with 5th and next-gen aircraft to advance the Family of Systems vision for next-gen air dominance," the company announced Sunday.Why It MattersThe U.S. Air Force has shrunk to its smallest size in history, fielding less than half as many fighters in 2024 as it did in 1987. The fleet is also aging, with aircraft retiring faster than they're being replaced.Collaborative combat aircraft (CCAs), dubbed "loyal wingmen," are seen as a lower-cost, more expendable way to strengthen the air force fleets. Using artificial intelligence software, these drones will serve as force multipliers by augmenting the firepower of human pilots to potentially overwhelm enemy air defenses in conflict zones where an adversary would enjoy a firepower advantageNewsweek reached out to Lockheed Martin and the Pentagon, renamed the Department of War, via email for comment outside of office hours....What To KnowThe drone's design supports a variety of roles—including electronic warfare, precision strikes, offensive and defensive counter-air missions, and intelligence gathering to help commanders make more informed targeting decisions.Vectis is also said to offer extended range, making it suitable for missions in the Indo-Pacific, European, and Central Command theaters (the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia).The news follows the U.S. Air Force's announcement in May that ground tests had begun for two CCAs—the YF-44A and YFQ-42A—developed by U.S. defense contractors Anduril and General Atomics, respectively.China, the U.S.'s near-peer military rival in the Indo-Pacific, also has a CCA program, with several said to have been on display during the "Victory Day" parade in Beijing earlier this month, according to state broadcaster CCTV, without naming the models.What People Are SayingOJ Sanchez, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, was quoted in the press release: "Vectis is the culmination of our expertise in complex systems integration, advanced fighter development and autonomy. We're not simply building a new platform—we're creating a new paradigm for air power based on a highly capable, customizable and affordable agile drone framework."General David Allvin, the U.S. Air Force chief of staff, said in May: "CCA is about delivering decisive advantage in highly contested environments. The program is accelerating fielding through innovative design and acquisition strategies—and both vendors are meeting or exceeding key milestones. These aircraft will help us turn readiness into operational dominance."What's NextThe Vectis is projected to be operational and flying by 2028, Lockheed Martin said.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
