U.S.ICEIllegal ImmigrationImmigrationNew YorkTrump administrationGreen CardMoreNews ArticleGreen Card-Holding Boyfriend of New York Official Detained by ICEPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 06:31 AM EDTBy Martha McHardyUS News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe boyfriend of a New York City official was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents last month—despite having legal status.Nathaniel Rojas, a Dominican Republic native who federal officials say has a green card, was detained by ICE agents on August 28, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Newsweek."On August 28, ICE arrested Nathaniel Rojas, a criminal alien from the Dominican Republic. His criminal history includes convictions for felony grand larceny, felony aggravated DUI with a child passenger less than 16 years old, identify theft, and retail theft. This criminal alien is in ICE custody pending removal proceedings," McLaughlin said."A green card is a privilege, not a right, and under our nation's laws, our government has the authority to revoke a green card if our laws are broken and abused."He was allegedly arrested at a Bronx apartment he shares with Wendy Garcia, the New York Department of Correction's deputy commissioner for development and advancement, according to The New York Daily News.Newsweek has contacted Garcia for comment via email.Why It MattersThe Trump administration has pledged to carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history and has conducted numerous ICE raids.ICE reported more than 66,000 arrests and 65,000 removals in the administration's first 100 days, with the daily detention population swelling to 55,000 people, well above pre-inauguration levels.While officials have stressed that dangerous criminals are being targeted, federal data show that many detainees have no criminal record at all.Trump's aggressive stance on immigration has resulted in widespread protests, especially in Los Angeles, where Trump authorized the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops to the city after reported violence against law enforcement, specifically ICE agents carrying out deportation raids.What To KnowRojas was first taken to 26 Federal Plaza, before being transferred to a jail in Orange County where he has been held for the past two weeks, according to records and law enforcement sources cited by The Daily News.Newsweek could not independently verify the reports....A sealed federal court filing shows that on the day of his arrest, Rojas' lawyer filed a habeas corpus petition against ICE, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, according to The Daily News.On September 2, Manhattan Federal Judge Lewis Liman ordered that Rojas not be deported until the case is resolved.Kayla Mamelak, Mayor Eric Adams' spokeswoman, told The Daily News that the administration is "in touch with the family," but emphasized she was not offering a position on the case. Immigration advocates and Councilwoman Alexa Avilés, however, blasted the silence, with Avilés accusing the administration of being "nonresponsive" in the face of Trump's crackdown.Rojas' daughter told The Daily News she was devastated, saying her father had lived in the U.S. since age 19, raised several children, and was "a big contributor to society." Friends described him as a father figure.Court records, not seen by Newsweek, reportedly say Rojas has convictions for felony grand larceny, aggravated DUI with a child in the car, identity theft, and retail theft.A pending civil lawsuit filed by his brother accuses him of fraud and forging signatures in a car sale, while also naming Rojas' partner, city official Deanna Garcia, as a defendant.Rojas and Garcia deny those allegations.What Happens NextIt remains unclear whether the civil case or any past convictions are tied to his detention. Rojas remains in the U.S. until the case against him is resolved.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
