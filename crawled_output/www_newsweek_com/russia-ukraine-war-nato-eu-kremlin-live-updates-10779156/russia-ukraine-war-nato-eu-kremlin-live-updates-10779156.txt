WorldRussiaUkraineRussia-Ukraine WarNATOKremlinSergey LavrovMoreLIVENATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in EuropePublishedSep 25, 2025 at 12:38 PM EDTBy Amanda Castro and Hannah ParryShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Thursday, per a Public Telegram Board, that NATO and the European Union are waging war against Russia “using Ukraine as a proxy” and are “directly participating” in the conflict. Lavrov’s comments follow repeated Kremlin claims that Western military and financial support for Ukraine amounts to direct hostility toward Russia.The announcement also comes amid repeated drone incursions into NATO allies' air space. NATO warned Russia on Tuesday that it was prepared to defend "every inch of allied territory" after Estonia said that Russian fighter jets had violated its airspace last week. The incursion followed a similar incident in Poland earlier this month, where around 20 drones from Moscow entered Polish airspace. Just this week, Denmark reported multiple drone incidents at critical infrastructure points, as a Russian landing ship was discovered lurking off the Danish coast.What to Know:NATO and EU members have not formally entered the warLavrov accused NATO and the EU of declaring war on Russia via UkraineHe claimed both alliances are “directly participating” in the conflictThe statement was made on Thursday on a Telegram boardRussia has previously framed Western support for Ukraine as aggressionNewsweek's live blog is closed.4 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 08:08 PM EDTZelensky surprised by Trump’s comments that Ukraine could win back its territoryUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said he had been surprised by President Donald Trump's comments earlier this week, where he said that he believed Ukraine could win back its territory and potentially more from Russia.“It was a surprise for me, you’re right,” Zelensky told Fox News on Tuesday. [It] was very positive signals from the side that Trump and America will be with us to the end of the war."In a Truth Social post, Trump had backed Ukraine and its ability to “fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form."

The directive did not include a reason for the meeting. The people, who described the move as extraordinary, were not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity.Vice President JD Vance said Thursday the gathering is “not particularly unusual.” Asked about it during an Oval Office appearance, President Donald Trump appeared unaware of the details and said, “I’ll be there if they want me but why is that such a big deal?”It was unclear whether the White House was involved in the decision or if the president would attend. Those within the U.S. military overseas have reportedly expressed concerns about the sudden call back home, with some having to travel thousands of miles on short notice without explanation, rather than using secure video or phone lines to meet.Across the services, roughly 800 generals and admirals hold positions of authority, commanding troops around the globe in multiple time zones.6 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 06:06 PM EDTEuropean diplomats privately tell Kremlin they are ready to shoot down aircraft: ReportEuropean diplomats warned the Kremlin, during a tense meeting in Moscow this week, that NATO allies are ready to shoot down Russian aircraft if there are any further violations of their airspace, Bloomberg reports.Following the meeting, the British, French and German diplomats concluded that the violations had been deliberate.The envoys gave Russian officials a forceful warning that they will meet future incursions with full force. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Thursday that he’s coordinating with France, Poland and the U.K. and supports “all measures necessary.”7 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 05:46 PM EDTDenmark may trigger NATO Article 4 over drones chaos: ‘Hybrid attack’Danish defense minister Troels Lund Poulsen said a recent wave of disruptive drone flights near the NATO ally's airports and military installations are a "hybrid attack" and Denmark was considering activating NATO's Article 4 in response.Article 4 calls for consultations between NATO members if, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened.The appearance of drones over Denmark comes days after Poland, Romania and Estonia complained of airspace violations by Russian forces, raising tension between the NATO alliance members and the Russian military operating in Ukraine.Russia denied responsibility for those incursions by drones and aircraft and Danish officials said they did not know who was flying drones over Denmark this week.Police in Denmark said drones were sighted over the course of approximately five hours overnight from Wednesday into Thursday at Aalborg airport, causing its closure, and at smaller airports at Sønderborg and Esbjerg. Drones were also seen at the Skrydstrup Air Station of the Danish Air Force and the barracks of the Jydske Dragoon Regiment in Holstebro.It followed a drone incident on Tuesday night at Copenhagen airport, which caused major disruption to flights. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she could not rule out the possibility that Russia was behind the drone attack, an accusation Moscow said was unfounded.Read in full from Shane Croucher on Newsweek.7 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 05:36 PM EDTWATCH: Trump says NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft violating their airspace7 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 05:26 PM EDTAlaska air defense identification zone where NORAD intercepted Russian planes today

Fortunately, last night’s incident did not result in any damage to the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant itself. Next time we may not be so lucky. I continue to urge both sides to show maximum military restraint around all important nuclear facilities,” he said.The IAEA team reported hearing explosions at around 1 a.m. local time, which was when they discovered the downed drone in a one meter-deep crater. Surrounding vehicles and a regional power line had been damaged but there was no impact on nuclear safety, the agency said.“For more than three and a half years, the IAEA has been doing everything in its power to help prevent a nuclear accident during this devastating war. We will only be able to say that our mission was successful if the war ends without a serious nuclear accident. Our indispensable work is far from finished,” Grossi said.  7 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 05:03 PM EDT‘There would be war,’ warns Moscow ambassador if NATO shoots down Russian planesRussia’s ambassador to France Alexey Meshkov warned that there would be war if NATO shoots down Russian planes violating alliance member's air spaces."There would be war. What else could there be?" Meshkov said on RTL radio, according to Russia's state-owned media Tass. "Quite a few planes violate our airspace, accidentally and not accidentally. No one shoots them down," the ambassador added.Moscow has denied deliberately invading European air space, while Meshkov says that NATO has not provided "any material evidence" that Russia was involved with the repeated drone incursions."We're not playing games with anyone," he warned, adding that "the West has deceived us so many times, we believe only the hard facts."President Donald Trump recently showed support for NATO shooting down Russian aircraft if they invaded their air space, although he did not confirm if the United States would assist its allies, telling reporters, it "depends on the circumstances."8 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 04:44 PM EDTRussian bombers, fighter jets intercepted near Alaska The United States and Canada scrambled multiple aircraft to track Russian military planes flying near Alaska on Wednesday.The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said that its aircraft tracked two Tupolev Tu-95 four-engine strategic bombers and two Sukhoi Su-35 air defense fighters in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). NORAD, a joint U.S.-Canadian command, said it dispatched an E-3 Sentry surveillance plane, four F-16 Fighting Falcons and four KC-135 aerial tankers to intercept the Russian aircraft, which remained in international airspace. It comes days after Estonia said that Russian aircraft had breached the NATO member’s airspace. Read in full from Brendan Cole on Newsweek.8 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 04:29 PM EDTU.S. Energy chief calls Russian gas cutoff key to ending warU.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Thursday that halting Russia’s natural gas exports to Europe is the most effective immediate tool Washington can use to pressure Moscow over its war in Ukraine. In an interview cited by Reuters, Wright explained that gas is more difficult to smuggle than oil due to the infrastructure required for transport, such as pipelines and LNG terminals.“Natural gas is one that’s easier,” Wright said, pointing to Russia’s five major pipelines into Europe. “You stop the gas sales going out of those five pipelines coming into Europe to zero, [Russia is] not going to get that revenue.”His comments align with President Donald Trump’s recent UN address, where Trump criticized NATO countries for continuing to buy Russian energy while opposing Russia militarily. Wright said his recent trip to Europe aimed to reassure allies that U.S. LNG exports could replace Russian supply: “We can supply all the gas that currently comes from Russia.”Wright also addressed concerns about India and China’s continued purchases of Russian oil. He acknowledged the difficulty of curbing India’s imports, despite U.S. tariffs imposed in August, and said dialogue with China on the issue is ongoing.8 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 04:17 PM EDTLavrov accuses Nato and EU of waging war through Ukraine; UK dismisses claimRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused NATO and the European Union of using Ukraine to wage war against Russia during a speech at a G20 foreign ministers meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations on Thursday. Lavrov claimed the West had provoked the conflict and was now “directly involved” in a “real war” against his country.The remarks, consistent with past Russian rhetoric, were delivered in front of global diplomats, underscoring Moscow’s hardened stance more than three years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper sharply rebuked Lavrov’s comments, calling them “false fantasy world distortions” and condemning Russia’s “unprovoked war of aggression.” European foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas also urged international pressure on Moscow, warning that Russia’s aim to subjugate Ukraine remains unchanged.Lavrov did not address recent comments by U.S. President Donald Trump, who earlier this week mocked Russia’s battlefield performance and said Ukraine could reclaim all occupied territory. Russian forces currently control roughly 20% of Ukraine, with fighting ongoing in the east.8 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 04:09 PM EDTTrump expresses deep frustration with Putin over Ukraine warPresident Donald Trump voiced criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he is “very disappointed” by Moscow’s continued refusal to end its war against Ukraine. In recent remarks, Trump highlighted the staggering human and financial toll of the conflict, noting that despite intense bombardment, Russia has made virtually no territorial gains.“They lost like a million soldiers,” Trump said, emphasizing the futility of recent offensives. He stopped short of labeling Russia a “paper tiger,” but underscored the waste of resources and lives. “I think it’s time to stop. I really do,” he added.8 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 04:00 PM EDTZelensky signals he may step down after war endsUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday he is prepared to leave office once Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is over, telling Axios that elections are not his goal. “My goal is to finish the war,” he said, adding that he wanted to serve during a time of crisis to help his country.Zelensky, elected in 2019, has seen Ukraine’s scheduled 2024 election postponed under martial law. Critics, including U.S. President Donald Trump, previously accused him of consolidating power, but Zelensky now says Ukrainians may want “a leader with a new mandate” after the war.He also suggested elections could be held during a cease-fire, even without a complete peace agreement. Zelensky met with Trump this week at the United Nations, where both leaders expressed a desire for improved relations. Trump later called Russia a “paper tiger” and predicted Ukraine could reclaim all occupied territory.Currently, about 20% of Ukraine remains under Russian control.9 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 03:51 PM EDTKremlin suggests Trump’s rhetoric aims to influence foreign leadersKremlin aide Yuri Ushakov has suggested that U.S. President Donald Trump’s sharp remarks toward Russia may be intended to appeal to foreign leaders, particularly during high-level meetings at the United Nations General Assembly.“There are public statements, and there are contacts through closed channels,” Ushakov said, noting that Moscow monitors all signals from Washington regarding the war in Ukraine.Ushakov speculated that Trump’s tough stance could be strategic: “To some extent, maybe he is playing to them,” he said of Trump’s interactions with other world leaders.Trump recently told Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan that Russia must end its war against Ukraine, citing over 7,800 deaths in a single week and criticizing Russia’s costly military efforts with little territorial gain.The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected ceasefire proposals from the U.S. and Ukraine, including partial measures. In response, Trump said Putin had “let him down” and declared their past relationship irrelevant. He added that Ukraine could reclaim all lost territory with European support, pointing to Russia’s economic strain.9 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 03:37 PM EDTRussia and China push UN vote to delay Iran sanctionsRussia and China have requested a United Nations Security Council vote to postpone the reimposition of sanctions on Iran by six months, diplomats confirmed Thursday.

He emphasized the importance of international dialogue in developing defensive space capabilities as a deterrent.Pistorius specifically referenced Russia’s Luch Olymp satellites, which have been observed tracking Intelsat assets, calling the behavior a growing concern for national and allied security.9 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 03:21 PM EDTRep. Mike Turner pushes for immediate vote on Russia sanctions billHouse Republican Mike Turner is urging congressional leaders to swiftly bring bipartisan sanctions legislation targeting Russia and its trading partners to a vote. The push follows Turner’s recent visit to Kyiv, where he met with Ukrainian defense officials and assessed the country’s battlefield resilience.Turner, a former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, echoed President Donald Trump’s view that Ukraine could reclaim lost territory—with sufficient international support. He emphasized that Russia’s industrial capacity, fueled by foreign trade, remains Ukraine’s biggest obstacle.The proposed bill, led by Sens. Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, would impose steep tariffs on nations purchasing Russian energy and uranium. Turner called the measure essential to weakening Russia’s war economy: “The only way to impact that is to turn the spigot off.”Turner sent a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday, urging immediate action. While Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune have expressed support for new sanctions, neither has committed to a floor vote.

Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia.

Emergency crews are working to assess the damage and restore power to affected households.11 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 01:06 PM EDTWhen did Russia invade Ukraine?Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, marking the largest military attack in Europe since World War II.In the early hours of that day, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a "special military operation," and soon after, Russian forces crossed the border from multiple directions, including from Russia, Belarus, and occupied Crimea. Major Ukrainian cities — including Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Mariupol — came under missile and artillery strikes, while armored columns pushed deep into Ukrainian territory.This escalation followed months of military buildup along Ukraine’s borders and years of rising tension between Moscow and Kyiv. In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea after a disputed referendum and backed separatist movements in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions. That sparked an eight-year conflict in the Donbas, which killed more than 14,000 people before the 2022 invasion.11 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 01:04 PM EDTWhat countries are part of NATO? What to know about the allianceThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is a military alliance formed in 1949 to promote collective defense and security among member states. As of 2025, NATO includes 32 countries across North America and Europe.The founding members were the United States, Canada, and ten European nations: Belgium, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. Over the decades, NATO has expanded to include countries from Eastern Europe and the Balkans, with Finland and Sweden being the most recent additions.Membership in NATO means a commitment to mutual defense under Article 5 of the alliance’s charter—an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. The alliance also engages in crisis management, cooperative security, and political consultation among its members.Here’s the full list of NATO member countries as of 2025, in alphabetical order:AlbaniaBelgiumBulgariaCanadaCroatiaCzech RepublicDenmarkEstoniaFinlandFranceGermanyGreeceHungaryIcelandItalyLatviaLithuaniaLuxembourgMontenegroNetherlandsNorth MacedoniaNorwayPolandPortugalRomaniaSlovakiaSloveniaSpainSwedenTurkeyUnited KingdomUnited States11 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 01:03 PM EDTIs Ukraine part of NATO? Ukraine is not a member of NATO, despite long-standing aspirations to join the Western military alliance.Since the 1990s, Kyiv has deepened cooperation with NATO through joint exercises, training programs and political dialogue, but full membership has remained out of reach.At the heart of the issue is the war with Russia. Admitting Ukraine now would trigger NATO’s Article 5 collective defense clause, potentially drawing all member states into direct conflict with Moscow. This reality has made allies cautious, even as they ramp up military and financial support for Ukraine’s defense.NATO leaders have repeatedly stressed that Ukraine’s future lies within the alliance. At the July 2023 summit in Vilnius, officials reaffirmed their commitment to eventual membership but stopped short of setting a timetable. Instead, they created a NATO-Ukraine Council to bolster political ties and pledged long-term security assistance.Another hurdle has been reform. NATO expects prospective members to strengthen democratic institutions, tackle corruption and modernize their armed forces. While Ukraine has made progress, particularly since Russia’s first invasion in 2014, alliance leaders say more work is needed before accession can happen.Consensus among the 31 member states is also required for any new admission. Some capitals remain wary of moving too quickly, fearing escalation with Russia and questioning how Ukraine’s ongoing conflict could be squared with NATO’s collective defense obligations.Despite these obstacles, NATO’s position is clear: Ukraine will one day become a member. For now, however, the timeline remains uncertain — hinging on the outcome of the war and Kyiv’s ability to complete the reforms demanded by the alliance.11 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 12:59 PM EDTMark Rutte says NATO and US ‘working together every day’ to help boost eastern flank security, and defend UkraineNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said he'd had a "great catch up" with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday as NATO and the U.S. continue to work closely to achieve their shared goals."Whether ensuring the security of our eastern flank, driving investment & innovation in our capabilities, or getting Ukraine the essential support they need to defend their freedom, #NATO and the US

The vote is seen as a stark choice for the country between a path to EU membership or closer ties with Moscow. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moldova applied to join the EU. It was given candidate status later that year and, in 2024, the EU agreed to open accession negotiations, further increasing tensions with Russia.The Russian intelligence report said that the EU was "determined to keep Moldova within the framework of their Russophobic policies.""This is planned to be done at any cost, including the deployment of troops and the de facto occupation of the country.

Speaking to reporters, Trump emphasized Erdogan’s standing with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him “very respected” and “very neutral.”Erdogan has repeatedly offered to host direct talks in Istanbul, a venue previously used for negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow in 2022 and again earlier this year, though those efforts failed to produce a lasting agreement.While acknowledging Erdogan’s diplomatic potential, Trump added that the most impactful move Turkey could make would be to halt purchases of Russian oil and gas.Trump also revealed his own efforts to broker dialogue, including a proposed summit between Zelenskyy and Putin following his hosting of the Russian leader in Alaska. However, during a recent visit to the UK, Trump expressed disappointment in Putin’s actions, saying the Russian president had “let him down.”In a notable shift at the United Nations this week, Trump stated for the first time that he believes Ukraine could reclaim all territory lost to Russia since the start of the war.12 hours agoSep 25, 2025 at 12:41 PM EDTRussian MFA claims NATO, not Ukraine, seeks control of disputed territoriesRussia’s Foreign Ministry has accused NATO members of pursuing strategic interests in Ukrainian territories referenced by President Vladimir Zelensky, alleging that Western powers—not Ukrainians—are driving the conflict.In a statement posted to Telegram on September 25, ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed Zelensky’s insistence on reclaiming lost regions is less about national sovereignty and more about satisfying NATO ambitions. She singled out Britain and other alliance members as actively undermining peace efforts, echoing tactics seen in 2022.Zakharova criticized Zelensky for allegedly disregarding the people living in these contested areas, suggesting his rhetoric treats them as expendable. She questioned the true value of the territories, arguing that widespread emigration and reluctance to fight indicate a lack of public support for continued military engagement.“The real desire of those left in Ukraine,” she wrote, “is not to defend these lands, but to see the war’s architects held accountable.”Her remarks reflect Russia’s broader narrative that Western influence is prolonging the war, while Kyiv’s leadership remains disconnected from its citizens’ priorities.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRelated PodcastsTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readTop StoriesNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readPoliticsElon Musk’s Grok AI Inks Deal With Trump Admin to Integrate With Government3 min. readsectionsNationWorldLifestyleHealthOpinionRankingscompanyAbout UsMastheadCareersDiversity & InclusionMission StatementLeadershipeditionsU.S. Edition日本PolskaRomâniacontactAdvertiseCorrectionsAnnouncementsPress CenterContact Usterms of useCookie PolicyCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsTerms of SalePrivacy SettingssectionsNationWorldLifestyleHealthOpinionRankingscompanyAbout UsMastheadCareersDiversity & InclusionMission StatementLeadershipeditionsU.S. Edition日本PolskaRomâniacontactAdvertiseCorrectionsAnnouncementsPress CenterContact Usterms of useCookie PolicyCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsTerms of SalePrivacy Settings© 2025 Newsweek Digital LLC
