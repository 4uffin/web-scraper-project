Homicide detectives and forensic investigators are gathering evidence as part of IMPD's investigation."My heart is heavy after the violence the Indianapolis community experienced over the last 24 hours. Our thoughts are with the victims, their loved ones, and all who are impacted by the violence," IMPD Chief Chris Bailey said in a statement....Colorado School ShootingA 16-year-old student identified as Desmond Holly opened fire at Evergreen High School in Evergreen, Colorado, on September 10, wounding two classmates before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.Law enforcement says the shooting began just before or around 12:24-12:30 p.m. local time. Officers arrived within minutes and found multiple crime scenes inside and outside the three-story school. Three students were taken to hospitals, including the suspect, who later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Two students were critically injured.Jefferson County law enforcement has said early indications point to Holly having been "radicalized by some extremist network," and investigators have obtained warrants for his phone, home and locker.

Locked classroom doors likely limited further casualties.Updated, 9/23/25, 4:10 a.m. ET: This article was updated with more information.
