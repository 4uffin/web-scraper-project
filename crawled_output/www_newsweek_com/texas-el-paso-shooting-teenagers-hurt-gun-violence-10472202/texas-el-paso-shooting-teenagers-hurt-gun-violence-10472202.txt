Gun violence remains an endemic problem across the U.S. and it is the leading cause of deaths for children and teens, research by the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions shows. According to the Gun Violence Archive, which tracks crime data, more than 30,000 people of all ages have been killed or injured in U.S. shootings during 2025 so far.Fatal Indianapolis ShootingOn Sunday, two people were killed and five others were injured in an early morning shooting in Indianapolis, according to the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD). Officers found five people suffering from gunshot wounds when they responded to a report of gunfire at the 6800 block of Shore Terrace after 2 a.m. local time.Two people were pronounced dead on the scene and three others were transported to the hospital, according to a press release from the IMPD. Two more victims self-transported themselves to a hospital and to a fire station, the release said.Three victims are in critical condition while the other two are in serious condition, local news station WTHR reported.A preliminary investigation revealed a disturbance preceded the shooting that took place in a parking lot, but no further information has been given about the suspect or suspects. Homicide detectives and forensic investigators are gathering evidence as part of IMPD's investigation."My heart is heavy after the violence the Indianapolis community experienced over the last 24 hours. Our thoughts are with the victims, their loved ones, and all who are impacted by the violence," IMPD Chief Chris Bailey said in a statement....Colorado School ShootingA 16-year-old student identified as Desmond Holly opened fire at Evergreen High School in Evergreen, Colorado, on September 10, wounding two classmates before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.Law enforcement says the shooting began just before or around 12:24-12:30 p.m. local time. Officers arrived within minutes and found multiple crime scenes inside and outside the three-story school. Three students were taken to hospitals, including the suspect, who later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Two students were critically injured.Jefferson County law enforcement has said early indications point to Holly having been "radicalized by some extremist network," and investigators have obtained warrants for his phone, home and locker. The FBI has deployed an evidence response team to assist.Officials said Holly used a revolver, brought a substantial amount of ammunition, fired repeatedly and reloaded multiple times while roaming campus. Locked classroom doors likely limited further casualties.Updated, 9/23/25, 4:10 a.m. ET: This article was updated with more information.
