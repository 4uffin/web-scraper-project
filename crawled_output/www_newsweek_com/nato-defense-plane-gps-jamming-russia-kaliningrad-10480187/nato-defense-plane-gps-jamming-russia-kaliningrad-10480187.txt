WorldNATOGPSSpainKaliningradRussiaLithuaniaMoreNews ArticleNATO Defense Minister’s Plane Hit by GPS Attack Over Russia’s KaliningradPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 07:45 AM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 10:33 AM EDTBy Shane CroucherBreaking News EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe Spanish Defense Ministry said one of its military planes carrying Margarita Robles to Lithuania was hit by an attempted attack on its GPS navigation as it flew near the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad."There has been an attempt to disrupt the GPS signal, but as our aircraft has an encrypted system, it was not affected," a defense ministry spokesperson said, Reuters reported. But they added that this was not targeted directly at the NATO ally's aircraft: "It must be common on this route and also with commercial flights. It is not because it is our aircraft."Newsweek has contacted the Russian Embassy in Spain for comment.Robles had flown to Lithuania for a meeting with her counterpart there, Dovilė Šakalienė, and to visit the Spanish Vilkas Tactical Air Detachment, part of the forces defending NATO's eastern flank, at the Siauliai Air Base....NATO-Russia Tensions HeightenThe GPS incident comes as NATO allies accuse Russia of multiple serious airspace violations. Moscow has called the accusations unfounded. It also denied jamming the GPS of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's plane as it tried to land in Bulgaria in August.Escalating tensions between NATO and Russia bring closer the prospect of a direct clash between the two nuclear-armed sides. They are engaged in indirect conflict over Ukraine, whose defense against the ongoing Russian invasion NATO is supporting with materiel and training.
The Kremlin has described NATO as at war with Russia, though neither side has formally declared war on the other.Trump Agrees With Shooting Down Russian PlanesPresident Donald Trump said on Tuesday "yes I do" in response to a reporter asking if he thinks NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft when they violate NATO airspace.Trump's comments come after Estonia invoked NATO's Article 4 and accused Russia of violating its airspace on Friday with three MiG-31 fighter jets.On September 10, Poland also said Russia violated its airspace with drones during its attack on western Ukraine, and some of those had to be shot down by NATO air defenses.But Russia said NATO allies have not provided enough evidence to support the accusations.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had not received credible information about the claims, saying that "such rhetoric only serves to heighten hostility."NATO on Tuesday warned Russia that it bears "full responsibility" for the incursions, which it described as "escalatory." NATO's response will "continue to be robust," according to the statement.Several European officials have expressed openness to shooting down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace, including Polish Prime Minister Donlad Tusk.Updated, 9/24/2025, 9:45 a.m. ET: This article has been updated with more information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
