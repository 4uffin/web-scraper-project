U.S.DallasTexasICEDepartment of Homeland SecurityImmigrationBreaking NewsNews ArticleWho Was Joshua Jahn? Dallas ICE Facility Shooting Suspect IdentifiedPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 02:22 PM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 06:01 PM EDTBy Joshua Rhett Miller and Gabe WhisnantShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe gunman who fatally shot an ICE detainee and wounded two others at a Dallas facility early Wednesday has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, law enforcement sources told multiple outlets, including NBC News.The suspect turned the gun on himself, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said earlier Wednesday morning. No law enforcement officers were injured, authorities said. At a press conference, FBI officials revealed that ammunition recovered near the suspected shooter contained anti-ICE messages, intensifying concerns about escalating threats against immigration enforcement.Public records obtained by Newsweek list Jahn’s most recent address in Fairview, Texas, where his parents live. But he may have been living in Durant, Oklahoma, Dallas Police Chief David Comeaux told KDFW.“That’s what we are looking into,” Comeaux told the station.Jahn’s parents are cooperating with investigators, Comeaux said.A Facebook profile belonging to Jahn’s mother, Sharon Jahn, indicated she previously worked as a chief operating officer/administrator at Ke Kino Massage Clinic + School in Texas.Sharon Jahn posted a photo of her three children at a wedding reception in 2009, her profile shows.Jahn also previously criticized lawmakers following the 2022 shooting in Uvalde, Texas, that left 21 people dead....“Governor Abbott, Senator Cornyn and Senator Cruz how does it make you feel that your action to open up gun laws is responsible for the killing of 21 more people?” Sharon Jahn posted in May 2022. “Do you secretly sit in front of a tv and smile a demented smile? You must be proud of all the money that sits in your bank accounts from gun lobby support. Was it worth it, Governor Abbott? How about you senators? When you prioritize money over people this is what you get.”Joshua Jahn attended Collin College in Texas at various times between spring 2013 and 2018, school officials confirmed to Newsweek late Wednesday.Jahn also previously attended the University of Texas at Dallas, school officials said.“A person, whose name and birthdate matches the individual, briefly attended UT Dallas over a decade ago,” a university spokesperson told Newsweek in a statement.In 2016, Jahn pleaded guilty to delivery of marijuana in Collin County, public records show. He paid a $500 fine and received five years of probation.Jahn's brother, Noah Jahn, said his older sibling wasn't especially interested in politics and had not recently shared negative opinions about federal immigration policy."He didn't have strong feelings about ICE as far as I knew,” Noah Jahn told NBC News. "I didn't think he was politically interested. He wasn’t interested in politics on either side as far as I knew.”Noah said he and his brother, two former Boy Scouts, were raised in Allen, Texas. Joshua Jahn had previously done coding work, but was recently unemployed and planned to move into their parents' property in Oklahoma.Jahn's parents owned a rifle, which Joshua knew how to use, but he wasn't a "marksman," Noah Jahn said."He would not be able to make any shots like that," he told NBC News.This is a breaking news article.
