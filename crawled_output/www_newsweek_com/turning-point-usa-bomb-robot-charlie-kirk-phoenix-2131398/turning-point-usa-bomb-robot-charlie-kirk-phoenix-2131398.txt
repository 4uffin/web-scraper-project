Beverly Road, Phoenix. Founded in 2012 by Charlie Kirk and Bill Montgomery, TPUSA aims to identify, educate, train and organize students to promote free markets, individual liberty and limited government.In 2018, the group opened its national headquarters in Phoenix, a move intended to position itself closer to one of its largest campus chapter networks — including Arizona State University — and to benefit from a more politically friendly environment than some other states of origin.As of the latest reports, TPUSA has campus presence on thousands of high schools and colleges across all 50 states and operates with several hundred full- and part-time staff members.The organization "received over 32,000 inquiries in the last 48-hours to start new campus chapters," Turning Point spokesperson Andrew Kolvet, who is also executive producer of "The Charlie Kirk Show," said in a post on X on Sunday."To put that in perspective, TPUSA currently has 900 official college chapters and around 1,200 high school chapters, with a presence of 3,500 total."A spokesperson for Turning Point USA told Newsweek that requests for new high school and college chapters have since topped 60,000. "These requests are coming from students all over the country," the spokesperson said.Update: 9/17/25, 1:04 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Update: 9/17/25, 1:21 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information.Update: 9/17/25, 5:33 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
