WorldDmitry MedvedevDonald TrumpVladimir PutinNuclearRussia-Ukraine WarNews ArticlePutin Ally Issues Warning to Trump Admin on ‘High’ Risk of Direct ConflictPublishedSep 23, 2025 at 04:10 PM EDTupdatedSep 23, 2025 at 05:41 PM EDTBy Andrew Stanton and Jason LemonShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberFormer Russian President Dmitry Medvedev warned the Trump administration that "the risk of direct conflict remains high" between the United States and Russia."Russia's ready to comply with the START Treaty, which I signed in 2010. Now the Trump admin must decide. But adhering to the letter of the treaty isn't enough. The US must give up on weakening Russia with sanctions and tariffs. Otherwise, the risk of direct conflict remains high," Medvedev, who currently serves as the deputy chairman of Russian President Vladimir Putin's Security Council.Why It MattersThe Russia-Ukraine war, which has been ongoing since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion in February 2022, has fueled concerns about the potential of nuclear war. Russia has the largest nuclear stockpile in the world, and Russian media personalities have frequently made threats about the potential use of nuclear weapons amid the conflict. The U.S. has been supportive of Ukraine and has issued sanctions against the Russian economy in an effort to apply pressure to end the conflict.What To KnowThe START treaty, an agreement between the U.S. and Russia establishing limits on nuclear weapons, dates back to 1991. The updated New START treaty went into effect in 2011 and has been extended through February 4, 2026, according to the U.S. State Department.The treaty places verifiable limits on all Russian deployed intercontinental-range nuclear weapons. It limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.Putin said on Monday that Russia would adhere to the treaty for one more year...."To avoid provoking a further strategic arms race and to ensure an acceptable level of predictability and restraint, we believe it is justified to try to maintain the status quo established by the New START Treaty during the current, rather turbulent period," Putin said.He added that this would "only be viable if the United States acts in a similar manner and does not take steps that undermine or disrupt the existing balance of deterrence potentials," NBC News reported.The New START treaty was signed by former U.S. President Barack Obama and Medvedev. At the time, Obama said the agreement signaled the U.S. and Russia's willingness to "pursue responsible global leadership."Russia suspended the New START Treaty in February 2023 after the U.S. accused Moscow of violating it due to its failure to uphold mutual monitoring elements related to inspections.Tensions remained high between Russia and the U.S., as well as its European allies. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said he believes NATO member states should shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace after both Poland and Estonia reported Russian incursions earlier in September.What People Are SayingNATO, in a statement Tuesday: "Russia should be in no doubt: NATO and Allies will employ, in accordance with international law, all necessary military and non-military tools to defend ourselves and deter all threats from all directions. We will continue to respond in the manner, timing, and domain of our choosing. Our commitment to Article 5 is ironclad."Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, per NBC News: "Based on our analysis of the situation, we will subsequently make a decision on maintaining these voluntary self-restraints.”What Happens NextEfforts to bring an end to the Russia-Ukraine war have stalled. Nuclear tensions remain heightened as the conflict continues.Update 9/23/25, 5:40 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
