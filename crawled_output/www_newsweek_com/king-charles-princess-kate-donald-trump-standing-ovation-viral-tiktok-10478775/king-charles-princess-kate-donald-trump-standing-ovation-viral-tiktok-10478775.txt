NewsRoyal FamilyKing Charles IIIKate MiddletonDonald TrumpState VisitNews ArticleKing Charles and Kate Sitting During Trump’s Standing Ovation Goes ViralPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 05:42 AM EDTBy Jack RoystonChief Royal CorrespondentShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberKing Charles III and the Princess of Wales were seen sitting as state banquet guests stood and clapped at the beginning of U.S. President Donald Trump's speech at Windsor Castle.Last week, Charles and Trump both spoke at the dinner, which followed a day of pomp and pageantry at Windsor Castle that included a carriage procession.Between Charles' speech and Trump's, there was a toast followed by a seemingly impromptu standing ovation by guests.A clip of the king and Kate sitting down while the guests clapped was posted on TikTok, where it received 225,000 views and 26,900 likes. The video's on-screen caption said, "Everyone stands and claps after Trump's speech," before showing Kate taking her seat amid the applause.Why It MattersProtocol can be a tricky subject at royal events, in no small part because it is often misunderstood. While it would have been polite to stand and clap, the standing ovation was likely not in the program, and Charles and Kate may have simply followed protocol for how the banquet was supposed to unfold. Still, some social media users have interpreted the sitting as a snub....What To KnowWhile some may be tempted to read the moment as Kate and the king showing the royal family's true feelings toward the U.S. president, other moments from the state visit suggest otherwise.For example, at one point, Queen Camilla appeared to usher Kate away from a conversation with Melania Trump, with some speculating that she wanted to have the first lady to herself. The princess was also photographed smiling with the president during the banquet.A palace source previously told Newsweek that the state visit passed flawlessly: "There was genuine warmth at all tiers of everyone involved in the state visit from the principals (the royals). You could see the general warmth in the relationship there, right the way down the whole operational cascade."We are very focused operationally on making it go as smoothly as possible and it went very well with the support of U.S. colleagues with the result that the program went flawlessly."What People Are SayingOne TikTok user commented: "Look, even King Charles sat down during the applause, maybe there's some protocol that makes them sit down at that moment."Another user wrote: "Catherine actually was very friendly and smiley with trump no hate to your edit btw."U.S. President Donald Trump said in his speech: "His Majesty has also raised a remarkable son in His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales. Really amazing. I've gotten to know you and you will have unbelievable success in the future."Melania and I are delighted to visit again with Prince William and to see Her Royal Highness, Princess Catherine. So radiant, so healthy and so beautiful."Loading tiktok content...What Happens NextThe Independent reported that Trump was considering whether to invite the royal family to the U.S. next year to mark the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.There has been no official confirmation of the report and no suggestion that an invite has gone out. Americans and Brits will have to wait and see whether one materializes.Do you have a question about King Charles III and Queen Camilla, Prince William and Princess Kate, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, or their family that you would like our experienced royal correspondents to answer?
