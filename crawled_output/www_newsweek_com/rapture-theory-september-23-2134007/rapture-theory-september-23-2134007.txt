A South African pastor's apocalyptic prophecy has sparked widespread panic‚Äîand ridicule‚Äîacross social media, as some Christian believers brace for the Rapture to take place today.The viral claim by Joshua Mhlakela, who says Jesus personally revealed the date of his return in a divine vision, has led some followers to sell possessions and prepare for what they believe is the end of days.Why It MattersThe Rapture is a belief held by many evangelical Christians in which Jesus returns to take true believers to Heaven before a period of tribulation on Earth.The term "rapture" does not appear in the Bible, but the concept is largely based on interpretations of passages such as 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 and 1 Corinthians 15:51-52.Some Christians believe the Rapture will occur before a period of global tribulation (pre-tribulationists), while others expect it to follow that period (post-tribulationists).What To KnowThe phenomenon, which has gained momentum through TikTok under the hashtag #RaptureTok, centers around Mhlakela's assertion that the Rapture, when faithful Christians will be taken up to heaven, will align with the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah, which falls on September 23 and 24 this year.The prediction has prompted a wide range of reactions, from genuine spiritual anticipation to open skepticism from religious scholars and mainstream pastors.Mhlakela first shared his prophecy in an interview with Centtwinz TV and on YouTube, claiming that Jesus appeared to him and declared he would "come to take my church" on September 23 or 24, 2025, aligning with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.

This assertion, though not grounded in any definitive scriptural timeline, resonated widely, particularly among evangelical TikTok users.Some pointed to signs in Revelation 12 and various astrological alignments involving the constellations Virgo and Leo as evidence that prophecy was being fulfilled.The viral spread of Mhlakela's prediction has been met with both belief and backlash. TikTok creator Sonja (@sonj779) posted "Rapture Trip Tips," encouraging viewers to buy new underwear so their "last impression" isn't an old pair.What People Are SayingJoshua Mhlakela, the pastor who popularized the September 23 theory, said: "The Rapture is upon us. Whether you are ready or you are not ready, the rapture in 14 days from now is going to take place."There's a storm brewing right now, and it's dark. No human being on this earth is ready for what is coming. I'm a billion percent sure. I began to hear literally in my ear the sound of the trumpet."What's NextWhile the Rapture has not materialized despite numerous historical predictions, its allure remains potent for some believers, especially when bolstered by perceived celestial and scriptural signs.
