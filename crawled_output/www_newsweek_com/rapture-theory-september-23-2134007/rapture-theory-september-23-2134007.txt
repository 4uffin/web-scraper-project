NewsBibleApocalypseSouth AfricaChristianityNews ArticleRapture Theory Explained: Why Some People Think the World Will End TodayPublishedSep 23, 2025 at 07:04 AM EDTupdatedSep 23, 2025 at 08:24 AM EDTBy Theo BurmanLive News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA South African pastor's apocalyptic prophecy has sparked widespread panic—and ridicule—across social media, as some Christians brace for the Rapture to take place today.The viral claim by Joshua Mhlakela, who says Jesus personally revealed the date of his return in a divine vision, has led some followers to sell possessions and prepare for what they believe is the end of days.Why It MattersDuring the Rapture, as many evangelical Christians believe, Jesus will return to take true believers to heaven before a period of tribulation on earth.The term "rapture" does not appear in the Bible, but the concept is largely based on interpretations of passages such as 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 and 1 Corinthians 15:51-52.Pre-tribulationists believe the Rapture will occur before a period of global tribulation, while post-tribulationists expect it to follow that period....What To KnowThe phenomenon, which has gained momentum through TikTok under the hashtag #RaptureTok, centers around Mhlakela's assertion that the Rapture, when faithful Christians will be taken up to heaven, will align with the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah, which falls on September 23 and 24 this year.The prediction has prompted a wide range of reactions, from genuine spiritual anticipation to open skepticism from religious scholars and mainstream pastors.Mhlakela first shared his prophecy in an interview with Centtwinz TV that was posted on YouTube, saying Jesus had appeared to him and declared that he would "come to take my church" on September 23 or 24, 2025. The dates align with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.This assertion, though not grounded in any definitive scriptural timeline, resonated widely—particularly among evangelical TikTok users.Some pointed to signs in Revelation 12 and various astrological alignments involving the constellations Virgo and Leo as evidence that prophecy was being fulfilled.The viral spread of Mhlakela's prediction has been met with both belief and backlash. TikTok creator @sonj779 has posted "Rapture Trip Tips," encouraging viewers to buy new underwear so their "last impression" isn't an old pair.What People Are SayingJoshua Mhlakela, the pastor who popularized the September 23 theory, said: "The Rapture is upon us. Whether you are ready or you are not ready, the rapture in 14 days from now is going to take place."He added: "There's a storm brewing right now. It's brewing, and it's dark. And I'll tell you this: No human being on this earth is ready for what is coming. … I'm a billion percent sure."What Happens NextWhile the Rapture has not materialized despite numerous historical predictions, its allure remains potent for some believers, especially when bolstered by perceived celestial and scriptural signs.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
