Chair Jerome Powell and other officials had held rates steady earlier this year while assessing the impact of tariffs, immigration policies and other Trump administration measures on inflation and growth.On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said that Federal Reserve officials "have to make their own choice," but added that they "should listen to smart people like me." He has argued the Fed should slash rates by 3 percentage points.Why it MattersThe Fed's quarter‑point cut is intended to support job growth and lower borrowing costs for households and businesses at a time when monthly payroll gains have weakened sharply and unemployment has ticked up to roughly 4.3 percent.Monetary policy affects mortgage, student loans as well as auto and business lending rates and therefore consumer spending and investment. Fed forecasts released with the decision show officials expect a modest path of additional reductions rather than an aggressive easing campaign, a calculation that will shape borrowing costs into 2026.What To KnowThe FOMC reduced the federal funds target range by 25 basis points to 4.0–4.25 percent. The change will bring the effective rate to approximately 4.1 percent, down from roughly 4.3 percent.The vote was 11 in favor and 1 dissent, with Fed Governor Stephen Miran, a recent appointee of President Donald Trump, favoring a larger half‑point cut.Related StoriesPam Bondi’s ‘Free Speech’ Remarks Spell ‘Disaster’ for Her—Polling Analyst5 min. readSome Private Student Loans May Be About To Get Cheaper3 min. readBorder Patrol Failed to Catch and Report Fake ID Documents: Inspectors5 min. read...Economic data driving the decision include an August payrolls gain of roughly 22,000 jobs and a 4.3 percent unemployment rate, alongside year-over-year consumer price inflation of nearly 2.9 percent.The decision marks a policy shift by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) toward reducing borrowing costs, following data that showed hiring nearly stalled and unemployment rising. Policymakers signaled expectations for additional quarter‑point cuts later in 2025What People Are SayingPushpin Singh, managing economist for the Centre for Economics and Business Research, told Newsweek: "The Federal Reserve opted to cut interest rates today, marking a clear shift following months on hold. Pressure on the Fed has increased in recent months, following signs of a weakening labour market. Indeed, the Fed's decision to not cut by a larger increment also reflects caution, with the Fed mindful that pass-through effects of tariffs have yet to fully materialise."Further cuts are on the cards, with the latest Fed projections showing a slim majority backing 50 basis points worth of cuts over the last two meetings this year. Ultimately, the trajectory for monetary policy will hinge on the inflation and labour market dynamics moving forward."Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at BNY Investments, told PBS: "We're not at a break-glass moment. This is a recalibration."Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said in a statement emailed to Newsweek: "The Federal Reserve is late no more. It seems the Fed has not just pivoted, but made a complete U-turn. Markets seem to like what they see, but the dollar is another story entirely."What Happens NextPolicymakers projected additional quarter‑point reductions — two more in 2025 and one in 2026 in median forecasts — but the Fed's path will hinge on incoming payroll and inflation reports, and officials warned that tariffs and other supply shocks could keep price growth above target.Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference to explain the Committee's reasoning and outlook that could provide further guidance for investors and economists.Markets will watch upcoming employment reports and the consumer price index for signs the Fed can ease further without reigniting inflation. If job losses deepen or inflation eases, the Fed signaled a willingness to cut more; if inflation accelerates or tariff pressures persist, officials signaled they may slow the pace of reductions.Update 9/17/25, 2:43 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.Update 9/17/25, 3:18 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
