Meanwhile, 29 percent now say they would be unable to afford an expense of over $400 dollars, down from 37 percent.Why It MattersData continues to underscore the financial pressure facing Americans in 2025, with persistent inflation, significant cracks emerging in the labor market, and policymakers warning that tariffs have begun to push prices higher. Surveys of consumers are reflecting growing pessimism, and stress among lower-income shoppers has become evident in America’s spending patterns.What To KnowAccording to Empower’s nationally representative survey—which gathered responses from 2,202 adults in early June—50 percent of Americans feel stressed about their current level of savings. This is despite broad recognition of the importance of a safety net, with 75 percent considering emergency savings critical for financial security, and 64 percent describing it as a top financial priority.While 23 percent say they will continue to put money into emergency savings regardless of external economic factors, these are proving a significant obstacle for others. Inflation and rising prices are the main barrier, mentioned by 39 percent, followed by high monthly expenses at 35 percent. Some 32 percent said their income was too low or inconsistent and 22 percent listed paying down their debts was a more pressing priority.A majority (63 percent) report that the rising cost of living has made it tougher to grow or maintain emergency savings, while 35 percent said economic pressures and tariffs have motivated them to increase their contributions. More than half (58 percent) described saving as “almost impossible” amid rising everyday expenses....The median savings balance among Americans is currently $500, down from $600 last year. The figure drops to $400 for those in the Gen Z age bracket and $300 for Millennials, but rises to $2,000 among America’s Baby Boomers.Meanwhile, 42 percent said that their savings would do little to soften the blow if they became unemployed, a significant vulnerability given growing signs of weakness in the U.S. job market.American companies have pulled back on hiring, with the economy adding only 22,000 jobs in August, according to Department of Labor figure. For the first time since April 2021, the 7.2 million total job openings are now lower than the total number of unemployed workers—7.4 million—which Moody’s Chief Economist Mark Zandi told Newsweek was “a strong tell that the job market is struggling.”Layoffs, meanwhile, surged to 85,979 in August from 62,075 in July, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Outside of 2020, this marked the highest August total since the Great Recession. Thanks in part to the 275,000 in March, a total 892,362 job cuts have been announced so far in 2025, up 66 percent compared with the first eight months of last year.What People Are SayingAndrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said: “After the impact of DOGE on the Federal Government, employers are citing economic and market factors as the driver of layoffs. We’ve also seen a spike in cuts due to operation or store closings and bankruptcies this year compared to last.”Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi told Newsweek in late August: “I think in the second half of this year, it's going to become obvious that the tariffs are resulting in higher prices for a broad array of goods, and I think the American people will see that.”“Prices are already rising, you can see it in the data, but it's going to rise to a degree that it will be impossible for people to ignore,” he added.What Happens Next?Labor market conditions are expected to remain challenging in the near term, with forecasts of slow job growth along with an increase in layoffs.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
