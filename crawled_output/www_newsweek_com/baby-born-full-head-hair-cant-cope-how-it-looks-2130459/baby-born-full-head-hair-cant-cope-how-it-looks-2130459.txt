Family & ParentingFamilyParentingBabiesHairViralNews ArticleBaby Born With Full Head of Hair, Mom Can’t Cope With How It Looks NowPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 07:17 AM EDTBy Daniella GrayFamily and Parenting ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA toddler from Oregon is going viral for his unusually fluffy hair—and internet users can't get enough.Liliana Yanez (@lilyyanezp) shared a clip on TikTok of her 5-month-old son, Noah, with an impressive head of thick, black hair.Yanez, who is also mom to 3-year-old Liam, captioned the clip: "I can't imagine what it'll look like at one year."...The 23-year-old told Newsweek that Noah was already born with plenty of hair. "He had a full head of slick hair at birth, it was a lot but definitely not as much as it is now," she said.By the time Noah was three months old, his hair was getting hard to manage. "I noticed his hair getting longer and fuller around three months, and the top of his head would stick up no matter how much gel or hair oil I'd use," Yanez said.As for where Noah gets his striking locks, the mom of two pointed to her own genes. "I remember seeing one baby photo of myself and I definitely had a lot of hair," Yanez explained.While Yanez's hair was straight when she was a baby, it began to curl, which made her wonder if Noah's will do the same.As for Noah's father? "[He] also had a lot of hair but he's slowly losing his," Yanez laughed. "Meanwhile, I still have a lot of thick hair even postpartum so I can safely say he got my head of hair!"While many babies are born bald or with fine fuzz, others—like Noah—arrive with a surprising amount of hair.A baby's hair thickness and texture are largely determined by genetics. If one or both parents have thick hair, it's more likely their child will, too.Hormonal factors during pregnancy also play a role, as maternal hormones can stimulate faster hair growth in the womb.Noah's rapidly growing hair has Yanez imagining all the possibilities for his first birthday. "He already has so much full hair at five months, I'm sure he'll be rocking a little man bun by one at the rate it's growing!" she said.Yanez's clip has been viewed more than 597,000 times and TikTok users are obsessed with the toddler's hair in the comments."Oh please let the universe bring me back at 1 year to see what it looks like. Her hair is so dense. Wow!!" one user wrote."I thought it was a wig. I wish I had that much hair!" another added.Many other users were convinced Noah was wearing a wig."The reactions have been hilarious," Yanez said. "I think my favorite has been people comparing him to the cutest characters like a Monchhichi, Terk from Tarzan and a cabbage patch doll. And very sweet for the most part, he's gained quite some followers who want to stay for the one year update."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting2 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
