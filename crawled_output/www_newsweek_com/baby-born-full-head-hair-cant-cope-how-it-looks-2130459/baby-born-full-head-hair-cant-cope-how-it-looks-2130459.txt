Family & ParentingFamilyParentingBabiesHairViralNews ArticleBaby Born With Full Head of Hair, Mom Can’t Cope With How It Looks NowPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 07:17 AM EDTBy Daniella GrayFamily and Parenting ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA toddler from Oregon is going viral for his unusually fluffy hair—and internet users can't get enough.Liliana Yanez (@lilyyanezp) shared a clip on TikTok of her 5-month-old son, Noah, with an impressive head of thick, black hair.Yanez, who is also mom to 3-year-old Liam, captioned the clip: "I can't imagine what it'll look like at one year."...The 23-year-old told Newsweek that Noah was already born with plenty of hair. "He had a full head of slick hair at birth, it was a lot but definitely not as much as it is now," she said.By the time Noah was three months old, his hair was getting hard to manage. "I noticed his hair getting longer and fuller around three months, and the top of his head would stick up no matter how much gel or hair oil I'd use," Yanez said.As for where Noah gets his striking locks, the mom of two pointed to her own genes. "I remember seeing one baby photo of myself and I definitely had a lot of hair," Yanez explained.While Yanez's hair was straight when she was a baby, it began to curl, which made her wonder if Noah's will do the same.As for Noah's father? "[He] also had a lot of hair but he's slowly losing his," Yanez laughed. "Meanwhile, I still have a lot of thick hair even postpartum so I can safely say he got my head of hair!"While many babies are born bald or with fine fuzz, others—like Noah—arrive with a surprising amount of hair.A baby's hair thickness and texture are largely determined by genetics. If one or both parents have thick hair, it's more likely their child will, too.Hormonal factors during pregnancy also play a role, as maternal hormones can stimulate faster hair growth in the womb.Noah's rapidly growing hair has Yanez imagining all the possibilities for his first birthday. "He already has so much full hair at five months, I'm sure he'll be rocking a little man bun by one at the rate it's growing!" she said.Yanez's clip has been viewed more than 597,000 times and TikTok users are obsessed with the toddler's hair in the comments."Oh please let the universe bring me back at 1 year to see what it looks like. Her hair is so dense. Wow!!" one user wrote."I thought it was a wig. I wish I had that much hair!" another added.Many other users were convinced Noah was wearing a wig."The reactions have been hilarious," Yanez said. "I think my favorite has been people comparing him to the cutest characters like a Monchhichi, Terk from Tarzan and a cabbage patch doll. And very sweet for the most part, he's gained quite some followers who want to stay for the one year update."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsErika Kirk on Husband Charlie’s Killer: ‘I Forgive Him’3 min. readNewsMusk and Trump Chat Warmly in First Meeting Since Summer Fallout3 min. readNewsTwo Killed, Five Injured in Indiana Shooting—Police3 min. readNewsUK, Canada, Australia Recognize Palestinian State7 min. readU.S.Exclusive: James Talarico on Texas, ‘Nonbinary’ God and Joe Rogan’s Support27 min. readU.S.Students Return to Books as Schools Ban Phones9 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
