WorldChinaSouth China SeaPhilippinesMilitaryTaiwanU.S. militaryMoreNews ArticleSatellite Photo Shows US Ally’s New Front-Line Base Amid China TensionsPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 03:54 PM EDTBy Micah McCartneyChina News ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberRecent satellite imagery provides a high-definition look at a newly established forward-operating base in Batanes, Philippines.The facility sits at a strategic choke point—Mahatao, in northern Batanes—that would likely come into play in the event of a conflict involving China-claimed Taiwan.Why It MattersThe Philippines and China are increasingly at odds over Beijing's growing presence within maritime areas claimed by its neighbors. As with much of the South China Sea, Beijing asserts sovereignty over wide swaths of territory that overlap with claims by other governments—including the Philippines.Batanes has emerged as another point of friction. Situated in the Luzon Strait, a key waterway the Pentagon views as vital for containing China's naval movements, the island group would be a strategic node in any potential conflict involving Taiwan.China has vowed to unify with Taiwan, by force if necessary, and in recent years has stepped up its military activities around the island democracy.Newsweek reached out to the Philippine armed forces and Chinese Foreign Ministry via emailed requests for comment....What To KnowThe Philippines formally inaugurated the Mahatao Forward Operating Base on August 28 on Batan Island—the main island in Batanes province.A new satellite photo released by Chinese private aerospace intelligence firm MizarVision provides a glimpse of infrastructure added since imagery from late 2023.The September 2 photo shows new helipads, a small dock and a launch slipway for moving boats in and out of the water. Several vessels can also be seen docked near or behind the base's three main buildings.In its public statement marking the opening, the Philippine Navy's Northern Luzon Command said the outpost would "serve as a hub for territorial defense, maritime domain awareness, and humanitarian assistance and disaster response."...The province has also become a focal point of deepening U.S.-Philippine security ties. In April, the U.S. deployed a NMESIS anti-ship missile system to Batanes during joint exercises with Philippine forces.This uptick in military activity has drawn China's attention. The country has repeatedly demanded the removal of U.S. missile assets from Philippine territory, and last month, ship-tracking data showed three large Chinese coast guard vessels encircling Batanes.What People Have SaidRoy Vincent Trinidad, spokesperson for the Philippine Navy, told reporters last month: "Our maritime entitlements are our future. This base in Batanes gives us a foothold to project our presence and safeguard the northern frontier."Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. told Indian news agency Firstpost: "If there is a confrontation over Taiwan between China and the United States, there is no way that the Philippines can stay out of it, simply because of our physical geographic location."A China foreign ministry spokesperson said in an August 8 statement: "[The Philippines has kept making wrong and provocative remarks and actions, kept fudging and hollowing out the one-China principle, and kept harming the China-Philippines relations. China firmly opposes this."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
