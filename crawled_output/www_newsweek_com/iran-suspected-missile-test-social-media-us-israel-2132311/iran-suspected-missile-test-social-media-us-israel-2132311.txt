The activity, visible across several provinces, was captured in photographs and videos posted on social media showing luminous trails arcing across the night sky.Newsweek has reached out to the U.S. State Department and Iran's Foreign Ministry for comment.Why It MattersThe missile tests come months after the 12-day war in June, when Israel and the United States carried out coordinated strikes on sites linked to Iran's nuclear program. Israel claimed to have destroyed portions of Iran's missile and nuclear capabilities, while U.S. forces targeted additional nuclear facilities.Thursday's launches demonstrate Iran's intent to project strength and protect its nuclear ambitions, while highlighting regional stakes as Europe and the U.S. push for renewed sanctions over alleged violations to the 2015 nuclear agreement....What to KnowResidents in Tehran and the northeastern cities of Gorgan, Sari and Semnan reported seeing glowing objects streaking across the night sky, while social media users shared clips showing trails of smoke from the launches.Sepah Pasdaran News, an official IRGC-affiliated Telegram channel, also posted images of the luminous arcs. One widely circulated clip came from the X account Iran Observer, which shared the footage with the caption: "Numerous new missiles are being prepared for a possible new round of war with Israel."Newsweek could not independently verify the videos.Loading twitter content...Iran's Missile and Nuclear ProgramsIran's missile arsenal has long been a focal point of its confrontation with Israel and Western powers, with Tehran insisting the weapons are defensive.Its nuclear program, meanwhile, has drawn intensified scrutiny after U.S. and Israeli strikes earlier this year. France, Germany and the U.K. are moving to reimpose sanctions, accusing Tehran of breaching the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally abandoned in 2018.On Wednesday, just a day before the missile tests, Tehran rejected any talks with the U.S. on missile restrictions, framing such demands as an obstacle to diplomacy....What People Are SayingIran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei: "The United States is in no position to make decisions about Iran's national defence capabilities."U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio: "A nuclear Iran governed by a radical [Shia] cleric that possesses not just nuclear weapons potentially but the missiles that could deliver those weapons far away is an unacceptable risk, not just for Israel, not just for the United States, but for the world."What Happens NextThursday's suspected missile tests reinforce Tehran's posture of defiance following coordinated U.S. and Israeli strikes on its nuclear and missile infrastructure.The U.N. Security Council is set to vote Friday on a draft resolution to snapback sanctions, part of the European-led effort over Tehran's alleged JCPOA violations. With negotiations stalled and Iran continuing to develop its arsenal, regional tensions are expected to remain high.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
