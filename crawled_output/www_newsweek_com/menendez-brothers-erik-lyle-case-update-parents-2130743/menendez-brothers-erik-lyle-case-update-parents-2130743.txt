U.S.Menendez BrothersBreaking NewsLos AngelesCaliforniaCourtsJudgesMoreNews ArticleMenendez Brothers Case Update: Erik and Lyle Denied New TrialPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 01:10 PM EDTupdatedSep 17, 2025 at 08:19 AM EDTBy Dan Gooding and Gabe WhisnantShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberA Los Angeles judge rejected a final legal bid by Erik and Lyle Menendez to overturn their murder convictions, ruling the brothers failed to present evidence strong enough to warrant a new trial. Superior Court Judge William Ryan denied their habeas corpus petition in a 17-page decision on Monday, finding that two pieces of alleged new evidence did not meet the legal threshold.Newsweek reached out to attorneys for the Menendez brothers via contact form Tuesday afternoon.Why It MattersThe decision is the latest blow to the brothers, who have challenged their sentences for years and were denied parole during lengthy hearings as recently as August. Both have insisted that they were suffering abuse at the hands of their father.The brothers became household names in the early 1990s as their trials were televised and replayed endlessly on cable news. Their case has returned to the spotlight in recent years, thanks in part to a popular Netflix documentary that drew millions of viewers worldwide....What To KnowJudge Ryan's decision, handed down on Monday, said that the brothers had failed to present enough evidence to make a difference to their murder convictions and subsequent sentences of life in prison without parole.The judge was ruling on a 2023-filed habeas corpus case calling for a new trial. As part of that, the brothers submitted two items of alleged new evidence. It was these that did not meet the threshold, Ryan said."The evidence alleged here is not so compelling that it would have produced a reasonable doubt in the mind of at least one juror or supportive of an imperfect self-defense instruction," Ryan wrote.The brothers have long argued that they killed their parents with a shotgun in 1989 out of fear they would be killed by their parents instead, in an effort to cover up the alleged abuse.Prosecutors argued that they carried out the murders to access their massive inheritance, citing a spending spree in the weeks after the killings.Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hockman had argued against granting a new trial, because the abuse evidence would not change that the brothers had planned and carried out the fatal shootings at the family's home in Beverly Hills.The case decided on this week was one of three pathways the Menendez brothers have tried to secure their freedom, including a clemency application.Earlier this year, a judge resentenced them to more than 50 years to life. This made them eligible for parole, but they were denied release at their first hearings in August. They could face the state panel again in as little as 18 months.What People Are SayingJudge Ryan, in his ruling: "The court finds that these two pieces of evidence presented here would not have resulted in a hung jury, nor in the conviction of a lesser instructed offense."Los Angeles Prosecutor Habib Balian, speaking to a parole panel in August: "When one continues to diminish their responsibility for a crime and continues to make the same false excuses that they've made for 30-plus years, one is still that same dangerous person that they were when they shotgunned their parents."What's NextThe brothers are yet to hear on a clemency petition filed with California Governor Gavin Newsom. They may also face a parole panel again in around 18 months.Update: 9/16/25, 1:32 p.m. ET: This article was updated with new information and remarks.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
