PoliticsCharlie kirkPodcastsRepublicansDemocratsDonald TrumpViolenceMoreNews ArticleCharlie Kirk Is Assassinated, as America Blisters With Hate and ViolencePublishedSep 10, 2025 at 09:46 PM EDTupdatedSep 17, 2025 at 10:04 AM EDTBy Jesus MesaPolitics ReporterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe assassination of the influential conservative commentator Charlie Kirk on the campus of Utah Valley University Wednesday afternoon has ignited alarm nationwide, joining a string of recent high-profile acts of horrific public violence that signal a dangerous spike in America's political and ideological tensions.Kirk, 31, the charismatic founder of the right-leaning youth organization Turning Point USA and a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, was delivering a speech under a campus tent in Orem, Utah, when a single gunshot struck him in the neck. He collapsed, was rushed to a local hospital and later pronounced dead.As of Wednesday night, a manhunt remained in effect for the shooter after two prior persons of interest were briefly detained for questioning. FBI Director Kash Patel had earlier called one of those people "the subject" in the shooting, but the person was later released without charges.Kirk, who had become nearly as influential in the president's orbit as he had been with young conservatives on campus, warned earlier this year about what he called an emerging "assassination culture" on the left. In April, he cited polling by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) showing that a significant percentage of self-identified liberals viewed violence against public figures like Donald Trump and Elon Musk as at least "somewhat justified."..."The political left is normalizing violence — and even political assassination — as a legitimate means of achieving its goals," Kirk posted on X. He accused Democratic leaders of remaining silent while inflammatory rhetoric escalated on social media and college campuses, where he often came to debate ideas and policies with other young people of all political stripes.Speaking to Newsweek shortly after his assassination, Alex Goldenberg, senior advisor to the NCRI whom had recently spoken with Newsweek for a story about the rising threat of political violence from the left, said Kirk's death reflected the exact warning signs outlined in the group's research."While we don't yet know enough about the motive, the online celebrations we're seeing are consistent with our research into an emerging assassination culture and a rising appetite for political violence," Goldenberg said, referencing viral posts from users on the social platform BlueSky celebrating the death of Kirk, a father of two young children.Those concerns are now being revisited in the wake of his killing, which has drawn widespread condemnation from all corners of the political spectrum—but also sharp finger-pointing from pundits and public figures on the right who see the brazen murder of one of their most influential young stars as nothing short of a seminal moment in a long history of American political violence....Political leaders across the ideological divide were united in condemning the killing. From Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson to former Vice President Kamala Harris and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, top officials on both the right and left issued swift statements denouncing the attack and calling for de-escalation.But amid those calls for calm, signs of an explosive level of outrage bubbled over among those on the right.Elon Musk wrote on X: "The Left is the party of murder," a post that was shared widely within hours and sparked its own backlash from some Democratic-aligned users and media figures.Political data analyst Lakshya Jain called the shooting "absolutely horrifying" and criticized those downplaying it. "If someone can get shot for right-wing views, they can get shot for left-wing views too," Jain wrote. "Normalizing violence helps absolutely nobody."Jain also pointed to systemic gaps that extend beyond ideology. "We make it too easy for mentally ill people in this country to get and wield a gun," he said, calling for urgent reform to the nation's mental health and gun access systems.It is still unknown what the motive was behind Wednesday's attack, the state of mind of the perpetrator, or where and how the gun was purchased.'Corridors to Violence'Kirk's assassination is the most high-profile example yet of what extremism researchers at the NCRI see as an increasingly dangerous normalization of political violence—often masked as satire, rebellion, or dark humor online.The NCRI points to the case of Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old accused of assassinating a healthcare executive on a Manhattan street last December, who has since been reimagined in fringe activist circles as a hero or vigilante. Mangione's image has been merged into memes with Nintendo's Luigi, portraying him as a vigilante avenger of systemic injustice...."It looks like a joke," said NCRI advisor Max Horder. "But it's not. It's a method of radicalization wrapped in humor."According to the NCRI, digital subcultures are building what they call "permission structures" for violence—spaces where political assassination is no longer taboo, but suggested, memed, or even outright cheered."It's not just about who pulls the trigger," said NCRI co-founder Dr. Joel Finkelstein. "It's about who reposts the meme, who laughs, who stays silent. That's how the corridor to violence gets built."...The group's analysis of online behavior showed increasing celebration of violence against political figures presented as acts of resistance. Even before Wednesday's campus debate erupted in bloodshed, those concerns had already materialized in real life. In July 2024, Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt by a rooftop sniper during a rally in Pennsylvania, in an eerily similar set-up. Two months later, another man was arrested after allegedly lying in wait at Trump's Florida golf club with plans to kill him.Kirk's assassination, NCRI officials told Newsweek, has already prompted celebratory reactions in some online spaces—evidence, they argue, of a dangerous shift in how political violence is being normalized.While the NCRI has recently highlighted rising violent rhetoric on the far left, the broader pattern spans the ideological spectrum. A 2022 study in PNAS found that although political violence exists on both sides, right-wing extremists in the U.S. are far more likely to carry out lethal attacks. Also, in 2024, all extremist-related murders were linked to the far right—eight of the 13 committed by white supremacists and the remaining five tied to anti-government extremists according to the Anti-Defamation League, an anti-hate watchdog group.American CarnageKirk's killing comes on the heels of two other spams of high-profile public violence that have deepened partisan divides over crime and ideology.In Charlotte, North Carolina, 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee, was stabbed to death aboard a light-rail train. The attack, captured on video, showed an assailant, identified by police as Decarlos Brown, repeatedly stabbing her in the neck before she bled out on the train. Brown had been released weeks earlier under a pretrial diversion program after a nonviolent offense, one of 14 known arrests....The grisly murder stayed a local story until horrifying CCTV footage of the incident started making the rounds on social media last weekend. By the time of Kirk's killing, the story of Zarutska had erupted into a full-blown national debate over the intersection of crime, race, mental health and even media bias.Republicans, as well as some Democrats, blamed the killing on soft-on-crime criminal justice reforms. Trump wrote on Truth Social, "North Carolina, and every State, needs LAW AND ORDER." Charlotte's Democratic Mayor Vi Lyles initially emphasized the suspect's mental health over the victim, drawing fierce criticism. She later called for bipartisan solutions on repeat offenders while defending investments in social services....That same week in Minneapolis, 23-year-old Robin Westman opened fire during a Catholic school Mass, killing two children and injuring 18 others. Westman, who identified as transgender and died by suicide at the scene, had a history of increasingly extremist writings.Authorities found weapons defaced with slurs and anti-Israel graffiti. A notebook included a pride sticker next to a drawing of an assault rifle. Westman's motive remains unclear, but Trump adviser Alex Bruesewitz captured the feeling of many on the right by referring to the shooter as "another deranged trans terrorist."As in the immediate aftermath of Kirk's assassination, many Democrats called for stricter gun control and better mental-health services.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
