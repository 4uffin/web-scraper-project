Polish and NATO aircraft were scrambled during a Russian bombardment of western Ukraine, a day after alliance member Estonia had accused Moscow of breaching its airspace.Newsweek has contacted the Russian and Polish Defense Ministries via email for comment.Why It MattersThe action by Poland follows a sharp escalation in tensions between Moscow and NATO after Estonia said that three Russian MiG aircraft had entered its airspace the previous day in an action it described as "brazen."Article 4 of NATO's charter has now been invoked twice this month and Poland's latest scrambling of aircraft will add to concerns about the threat Moscow poses to the alliance's eastern flank.

What To KnowPoland's armed forces said that fighter aircraft were deployed while their ground-based air-defense systems and radars were put on "maximum readiness" overnight into Saturday morning.NATO is on heightened alert after Estonia invoked its charter's Article 4 for talks with members following Russia's actions which one expert told Newsweek was a "stress test" by Moscow toward the alliance.Warsaw's military said in a statement at 3.30 a.m. local time on Saturday that during long-range Russian strikes on Ukraine overnight, Polish and allied aircraft were deployed in Polish airspace.Ukraine's Air Force reported it had downed 552 drones, two ballistic missiles, and 29 cruise missiles, across the county.The X post by Poland's armed forces said that ground-based air-defense systems and radiolocation reconnaissance "reached a state of maximum readiness."The military said the measures aimed to ensure safety in areas bordering the threatened regions and that it was monitoring the current situation with its forces in full readiness for immediate response.In a later X post at 5.a.m., the armed forces said that its operations had ended and that ground-based air-defense and radar reconnaissance systems returned to standard operational activities.It follows Estonia's request for a consultation with other NATO members under Article 4 after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets entered the skies of the Baltic state over the Gulf of Finland for 12 minutes.Russia's Defense Ministry said its aircraft had never entered Estonian airspace and that three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets completed a scheduled flight from Karelia to an airfield in the Kaliningrad Region "in strict compliance with international airspace regulations."Poland invoked Article 4 after it said over 20 Russian drones entered its airspace on September 10 and later Romania scrambled jets in response to a Russian drone encroaching its territory.After Estonia's accusations against Moscow, President Donald Trump said Friday, "I don't like when that happens," and that there "could be big trouble," without specifying further.Sanctions expert Brett Erickson told Newsweek that unless the West imposed a tough coordinated sanctions regime, Moscow's encroachments into NATO airspace would increase.A response required Trump drawing a "hard line" because President Vladimir Putin had made it clear he will not negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine until the pressure became unbearable, Erickson added.What People Are SayingPoland's armed forces on X said it had: "Activated all available forces and means at his disposal. Duty fighter pairs have been scrambled, and ground-based air-defense systems as well as radiolocation reconnaissance have reached a state of maximum readiness."Brett Erickson, adviser to Seton Hall's School of Diplomacy and International Relations: "Each incursion is a stress test. Russia is mapping our response‚Äîtiming, unity, and willpower. If we delay or fragment, we are teaching the Kremlin exactly how to push further with minimal risk."What Happens NextNATO consultations over Russia's breaches will take place amid a diplomatic fallout in which Estonia has summoned Moscow's envoy to the country and European nations push for increased political and economic pressure on Russia.
