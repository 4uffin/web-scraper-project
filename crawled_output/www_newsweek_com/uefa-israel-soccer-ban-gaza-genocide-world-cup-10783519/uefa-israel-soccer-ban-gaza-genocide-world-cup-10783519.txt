NewsIsraelUefaBreaking NewsSoccerFIFANews ArticleIsrael Could Be Banned From 2026 World Cup: What to KnowPublishedSep 25, 2025 at 04:17 PM EDTupdatedSep 25, 2025 at 09:03 PM EDTBy Jesus Mesa and Gabe WhisnantShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThe future of Israel’s place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup is uncertain as UEFA prepares to vote on a possible suspension from international football.UEFA, Europe’s governing body for the sport, is set to decide whether to ban Israel from its competitions, including World Cup qualifying, over the war in Gaza, according to people familiar with the proposal who spoke to the Associated Press. A majority of the 20-member executive committee is expected to back the move.A State Department spokesperson told Newsweek via email Thursday, "We will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel’s national soccer team from the World Cup."Why It MattersCalls to exclude Israel from soccer and other sports have grown in recent weeks amid outrage over the humanitarian toll of its military campaign in Gaza. Earlier this month, a United Nations Commission of Inquiry concluded that Israel’s actions amounted to genocide, a claim Israel strongly rejects.Following the report, a panel of U.N. advisers urged FIFA and UEFA to suspend Israel from competition.What To KnowIsrael’s men’s national team, currently third in its World Cup qualifying group, is scheduled to play Norway and Italy in two weeks, though its participation could now be in doubt, as the U.N. Commission of Inquiry’s report described Israel’s military actions as an “unfolding genocide.”“National teams representing states that commit massive human rights violations can, and should, be suspended,” unappointed experts said in a joint statement published this week. “Sporting bodies must not turn a blind eye to grave human rights violations, especially when their platforms are used to normalize injustices,” the panel added.A spokesperson for Israel's Foreign Ministry said the report was "fake," and claimed the report "relies entirely on Hamas falsehoods, laundered and repeated by others."...Israeli teams have already been barred from playing home matches due to security concerns. Since October 2024, UEFA has mandated that all matches involving Israeli clubs and national teams be played in neutral countries. Venues have included stadiums in Hungary, Cyprus, and Poland, reflecting the instability surrounding the staging of international football on Israeli soil.It is unclear whether the world soccer body FIFA will support excluding Israel, given the close relations between FIFA’s leader, Gianni Infantino, and U.S. President Donald Trump.An Unprecedented SituationWhile FIFA and UEFA have previously acted jointly to suspend nations for political and human rights reasons, including Russia in 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine, Yugoslavia during the Balkan wars of the 1990s, and apartheid-era South Africa, the current case marks a rare departure from precedent.What makes Israel’s situation unprecedented is that UEFA, rather than FIFA, is leading the push for a suspension. A UEFA ban alone could effectively block Israel from World Cup qualification, since UEFA organizes and administers the European qualifying rounds for FIFA tournaments. While FIFA is responsible for the World Cup itself, it delegates the continental qualification duties to regional bodies, such as UEFA.“This is an unprecedented situation,” one source told The Times, “because although the qualifying competition is a FIFA event, UEFA staff run the tournament.”...In Russia’s case, both UEFA and FIFA moved in unison just four days after the country invaded Ukraine, suspending all Russian teams from international competition. Similar decisions were made decades ago when South Africa was banned due to apartheid and Yugoslavia was excluded amid regional conflict.However, unlike those scenarios, the pressure is now coming primarily from within UEFA, rather than from FIFA. Gianni Infantino, FIFA’s president, has cultivated strong ties with both Arab nations and U.S. leadership, placing the organization in a politically sensitive position ahead of a World Cup hosted on American soil.What the Trump Administration Has SaidThe White House has made clear it will oppose any move to ban Israel from the 2026 World Cup. With the United States set to co-host the tournament alongside Mexico and Canada, officials in Washington have warned against what they view as the politicization of sport.The Times reported that both Qatar and the U.S. were rumored in Israeli media to be exerting pressure on UEFA behind the scenes. However, the outlet clarified that no such efforts could be confirmed. Newsweek reached out to the White House and the State Department for comment on Thursday.What People Are Saying A State Department spokesperson told Newsweek: “We will absolutely work to fully stop any effort to attempt to ban Israel’s national soccer team from the World Cup.”Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, during a cabinet meeting on September 15: “Sports organizations must consider whether it is ethical for Israel to continue participating in international competitions. Why was Russia expelled after the invasion of Ukraine, but Israel has not been expelled after the invasion of Gaza?”Lise Klaveness, the Norwegian soccer federation’s president, said last month: “Neither we, nor other organizations can remain indifferent to the humanitarian suffering and disproportionate attacks that the civilian population in Gaza has been subjected to for a long time.”What Happens NextIsrael’s sports minister, Miki Zohar, said he, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and FA chief Moshe Zuares have worked “intensively behind the scenes” to prevent Israel’s suspension from UEFA.This article includes reporting by the Associated Press.
