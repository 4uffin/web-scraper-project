U.S.Product recallAmazonNews ArticleAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items ImpactedPublishedSep 20, 2025 at 06:00 AM EDTBy Daniel OrtonEditor, Live NewsShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberAround half a million consumer products sold on Amazon and other online retailers have been recalled by manufacturers in recent weeks due to serious safety concerns ranging from fire hazards to risks of suffocation and injury.According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), five different items sold largely through online marketplaces have been withdrawn from circulation following internal reports and regulatory noncompliance.Among the items recalled are baby loungers, portable power banks, and misting fans.Why It MattersThe latest wave of recalls underscores ongoing concerns around the safety of imported goods sold through major online retailers. Several of the recalled products pose threats that could result in death or serious injury, particularly to infants and children....What To KnowThe following products were affected by the recalls:LXDHSTRA Baby Loungers and Crib BumpersLXDHSTRA-branded baby loungers and crib bumpers, sold on Amazon between May and August 2025, have been recalled due to serious safety violations.The CPSC announced the recall on September 18, citing risks of suffocation, falls, and entrapment. The loungers fail to meet federal standards for infant sleep products, with dangerously low sides, overly thick sleeping pads, and wide foot openings. Additionally, the included crib bumpers violate the Federal Safe Sleep for Babies Act, posing suffocation risks.Approximately 360 units were sold by a Chinese retailer operating under the name LXDHSTRA. No injuries have been reported; however, consumers are advised to discontinue use of the products immediately.Refunds are available upon proof of destruction. Buyers must cut the loungers and bumpers in half and email photos to lxdhstrarecall@gmail.com.Anker Power BanksAnker Innovations has recalled over 480,000 power banks due to overheating lithium-ion batteries that have caused fires. The recall includes models A1647, A1652, A1257, A1681, and A1689, sold between January and July 2024.The CPSC received 33 reports of fire and explosion incidents, including four burn injuries and property damage.Consumers are urged to stop using the devices immediately and visit Anker's recall page for instructions on how to obtain a refund. Disposal must follow hazardous waste protocols due to the fire risk posed by lithium-ion batteries....YooxArmor Kids' HelmetsYooxArmor has recalled nearly 1,800 multi-purpose kids' helmets sold on Amazon due to failure to meet federal bicycle helmet safety standards.The helmets lack proper impact protection, stability, labeling, and certification, posing a serious risk of head injury or death in a crash. No injuries have been reported.Consumers should cut the straps and submit photos to YooxArmor for a refund.Youbeien Crib Mobiles Recalled Over Battery Ingestion HazardYoubeien crib mobiles, sold on Amazon by GKKBSJ, have been recalled due to unsafe battery compartments in their remote controls. The design violates federal toy standards, as it allows children to access button batteries, which can cause internal burns or death if swallowed.About 3,000 units are affected. Consumers should stop using the product and submit disposal photos to GKKBSJ for a refund.IcyBreeze Misting Fans Recalled for Fire RiskIcyBreeze Cooling has recalled 22,600 Buddy Portable Misting Fans after reports of overheating and fire during charging. The fans, sold online from November 2023 to August 2024, use lithium-ion batteries and feature a misting function for outdoor use.Seven overheating incidents were reported, including two fires. Consumers should stop using the fans and visit IcyBreeze's recall page to receive a $150 credit after submitting proof of disposal.What People Are SayingAmazon, in a statement on its recall webpage, said: "Our Product Safety Team proactively investigates and addresses reported safety complaints and incidents to ensure customer protection from potential product-related safety risks. We closely monitor public recall alert websites and receive notifications from vendors and sellers. Upon discovering a product recall, we immediately halt affected product offerings, and promptly inform both customers and sellers involved about the recall."Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
