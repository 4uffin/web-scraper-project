Republican U.S. Representative Nancy Mace holds a slight edge over her GOP opponents in the South Carolina gubernatorial primary race, a new poll shows.Why It MattersMace announced her bid to run for governor last month, telling Fox News, "We can continue doing the things we've always done...Or we can chart a new course‚Äîone filled with common sense and bold policies to hold the line for South Carolina."Mace, a staunch ally of President Donald Trump and the MAGA movement, has recently made headlines for initiating a censure vote against Democratic U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota for alleged remarks made after conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing.The dispute escalated on social media and in the House amid heightened tensions on Capitol Hill and the broader politicized debate on political rhetoric and violence.What To KnowIn the poll, Mace received 19 percent of the vote compared to South Carolina Lieutenant Governor Pamela Evette's 18 percent. State Attorney General Alan Wilson garnered 16 percent, U.S. Representative Ralph Norman collected 10 percent and state Senator Josh Kimbrell won 2 percent.The survey shows that 35 percent of the likely Republican primary voters say they are still undecided.The poll by co/efficient was taken on September 18 and September 19 among 1,094 likely GOP primary voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.17 percent.The poll also shows that the most important issue facing South Carolinians is taxes and spending, followed by inflation and government corruption.Mace's favorability rating in the poll is 36 percent compared to a 26 percent unfavorable rating.

What People Are SayingD. Stephen Voss, political science professor at the University of Kentucky, told Newsweek via email on Monday: "These poll results show a nomination race that's wide open, not only because three possible choices are essentially tied, but also because voters still need to get to know most names on the list. It's a crowded field, though, and we don't know who the second and third choices of these voters would be. If a winnowing process takes place, and some of the declared candidates withdraw, voters could sort out in a way that makes the race more lopsided."Evette, on X this month: "Nancy Mace is a fraud. While in Congress, she's supported:üö© Abortion on demand
üö© Gun control
üö© Black Lives Matter movement
üö© Far-left's trans agendaDon't take my word for it - hear Nancy Mace in her own words."Mace, on X this month: "Maybe Ilhan Omar's committee seats aren't the only thing that should be taken ... üëÄ Is her citizenship next?"Omar, on X this month: "Fun fact: Nancy Mace is trying to censure me over comments I never said. Her res does not contain a single quote from me because she couldn't find any. Unlike her, I have routinely condemned political violence, no matter the political ideology. This is all an attempt to push a false story so she can fundraise and boost her run for Governor."What Happens NextTrump has yet to endorse a candidate in the race.The general election for South Carolina governor is scheduled for November 3, 2026.Update 9/22/25 5:57 p.m. ET: The article was updated with comment from D. Stephen Voss.
