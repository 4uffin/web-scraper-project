Food & DrinkIkeaFoodvegetarianFurnitureNews ArticleIKEA Announces Major Menu Change Coming Next YearPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 04:27 PM EDTBy Suzanne BlakeReporter, Consumer & Social TrendsShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberIKEA has announced a significant addition coming to its store restaurants across the country by early next year.The furniture giant has been serving its Swedish meatballs for 40 years as a signature dish, but is now launching a new food ball: the falafel.Why It MattersIKEA joins many restaurants in launching brand-new menu options this year. This includes Panera Bread with its fall menu lineup, Starbucks’ new protein beverages and additions from Arby's, Chipotle and Popeyes.Retail and restaurant operators have unveiled new items as a way to boost revenue as competition remains fierce and a majority of consumers reel in spending. ...What To KnowThe falafel joins IKEA’s food offerings as a crispy ball filled with chickpeas, zucchini, onions and spices. The new dish will be served with couscous, aioli and a slice of lemon at U.S. stores nationwide as IKEA looks to expand into more plant-based menu options.Since chickpeas are the main ingredient in the new menu choice, more Americans will likely be able to enjoy the meal over its meat-based alternative. The new offering will go live in IKEA stores beginning in early 2026.This announcement follows Panera Bread’s new fall menu launch featuring the Black Bean Soup, a beloved classic making its comeback by guest demand after a 7-year hiatus, as well as Autumn Squash Soup and Hearty Fireside Chili.Additionally, Starbucks has unveiled new Protein Cold Foam and Protein Lattes, soon available at all U.S. and Canadian stores, in an attempt to please fitness- and diet-focused customers.What People Are SayingDaniel Yngvesson, global food designer at IKEA, in a statement: “We sell flatpack furniture and round shaped food. Following the many different meatball variations introduced over the years, once we started testing recipes, we felt the falafel would be the perfect addition to the menu. The falafel has become a staple in Swedish food culture over the years, and the aromatic and nutty flavor is a beloved favorite all over the world. It’s also an exciting new flavor profile for IKEA.”   Alex Beene, financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: “Now more than ever, retailers are trying new menu options to get customers back through their doors. IKEA may not be the first name many associate with the word ‘restaurant,’ but the reality is their dining area attracts many of their customer base to stay and eat throughout the year.”What Happens NextThe shift to add falafel to IKEA’s food ball menu could usher in new customers interested in both browsing furniture and eating new or vegetarian-based foods.“For those that may have been going to IKEA for home goods recently and opted to save money by skipping their dining options, the introduction of the Falafel Ball is one the company hopes will establish more interest and lead to more revenue,” Beene added.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readUnited StatesUS Nuclear-Powered Submarine Surfaces in South China Sea4 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
