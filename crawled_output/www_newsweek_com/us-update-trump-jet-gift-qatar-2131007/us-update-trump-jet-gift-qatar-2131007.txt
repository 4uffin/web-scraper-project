The report noted that the official referred to the jet as "executive airlift" and not "presidential transport," suggesting requirements may differ.This may mean fewer security, communications or defensive systems.Trump has repeatedly made the case for accepting the jet amid delays to Boeing's Air Force One program."I see it as a normal thing that happens between allies," Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, Qatar's prime minister, said in May.Amid bipartisan debates over the gifted jet, U.S. officials are also navigating broader strategic and diplomatic considerations with Qatar in the region.The American base at Al Udeid in Doha was the target of a barrage of retaliatory missiles fired by Iran in June, before Israel's strike last week, which Trump has condemned, despite supporting efforts to eliminate Hamas.Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with the Qatari emir and prime minister in Doha on Tuesday, emphasizing Washington's desire for Qatar to remain engaged in mediation efforts aimed at securing the release of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas on October 7, 2023, and ultimately disarming the group....What People Are SayingA U.S. Air Force spokesperson told Air and Space Forces Magazine website on Monday: "As directed by the Secretary of War, the Air Force is modifying a Boeing 747 aircraft for Executive Airlift support. Details related to the contract are classified."U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday, commenting on conflict in Gaza: "Look, I think ultimately we would all prefer to see a negotiated end that leads to all the hostages being released, that leads to Hamas being disarmed and eliminated as a threat, and we think Qatar can play a very key role in that. So we're going there."What Happens NextWhen Trump leaves office, reports say the plane will transfer to his presidential library foundation, but it's unclear if he could continue using it personally.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
