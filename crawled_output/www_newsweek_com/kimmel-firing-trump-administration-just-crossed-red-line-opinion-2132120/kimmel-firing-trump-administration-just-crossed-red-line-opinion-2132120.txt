The dark genius of President Donald Trump's attack on our most fundamental freedom‚Äîspeech and expression‚Äîis its steady ratcheting. He could have issued a day-one executive order clamping down on criticism. His congressional pawns could have passed a law outlawing ridicule of the president.But why bash with a club when you can slice deeper with a stiletto? So much quieter. So much more doubt and confusion. And just as deadly.With hindsight, it's clear that Trump's actions for shutting down dissent were chosen because they're so narrow, so risible, and such easy fodder for gaslighting about "overreaction." But each laid a foundation for the next. They piled atop one another, ever upward.Some of the blame for how far things have gotten rests on us. If there's an original sin in this slow strangulation of our most basic freedom, it's our willing complicity at the beginning. We enabled it through greed, fear, and selfishness. That led to the penny-wise, pound-foolish path of appeasement. And as is true in all fights against cowardly, bullying, thin-skinned autocrats, our weakness was provocative. It only invited the next escalation.

When Trump came for the law firms, they could have banded together in collective defense, but instead disintegrated into go-it-alone self-protection that they reckoned would be financially cheaper. It wasn't: the ones that refused to cut deals seem to be doing modestly better on average. When he came for the universities, some fought, but others folded. That not only made them easy prey; it made it easy for their fellow institutions to cut them loose.And of course, Trump came for the media, cut by cut by cut. He sued the Des Moines Register and parent company Gannett. He sued ABC, CBS, Simon & Schuster, the Wall Street Journal, and CNN (and just this week, the New York Times). No matter how meritless the lawsuit (for example, the Times suit boils down to simply not liking the coverage), several companies settled in order to curry favor. Some are still rendering unto Caesar to this day: Paramount just installed the former head of a right-wing think tank as "ombudsman" (read: political commissar) at CBS News.Or take the hapless, venal behavior of ABC News. In December, ABC settled a Trump defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' statement that Trump had been found civilly liable for "raping" (rather than "sexually abusing") E. Jean Carroll. They didn't have to. They were in a defensible position. But according to legal experts, corporate leadership most likely decided that it would be better business to avoid getting into a protracted case against the president... or worse yet, winning. So they agreed to pay $15 million‚Äîone-tenth of one percent of the amount Trump was suing them for‚Äîin order to make nice. Read more

Fat lot of good that did them. Mere months later, Trump's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr targeted ABC with an investigation into their "DEI practices" in an obvious shakedown.And now comes the next ratchet notch.On Monday, ABC late night comedian Jimmy Kimmel dared criticize the administration's all-out press to declare that the alleged murderer of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk was a leftist activist. Kimmel said the administration was leveraging the tragedy as a pretext to "score political points."Trump's capo Carr immediately jumped onto a right-wing podcast to threaten "We can do this the easy way or the hard way.... These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead."Not since Trump's "I would like you to do us a favor" squeeze on Volodymyr Zelensky earned him his first impeachment has there been such an overt case of corrupt government extortion. In broad daylight, a presidential henchman openly threatened to inflict financial pain in retribution for speech the leader doesn't like.But we're so inured to it all now, so awash in lawsuits and settlements and threats and power grabs, that even as we pass this threshold we seem to be no closer to escape.On Thursday, no less an authority than Russian opposition leader and former chess champion Garry Kasparov wrote that this pattern of interfering in media businesses, pressuring mergers, instigating firings, and filing endless libel and defamation lawsuits was the core of Putin's march to a police state.Kasparov is screaming at us that, with this latest escalation, it is happening here. The question is: will we even notice?Matt Robison is a writer, podcast host, and former congressional staffer.The views in this article are the writer's own.
