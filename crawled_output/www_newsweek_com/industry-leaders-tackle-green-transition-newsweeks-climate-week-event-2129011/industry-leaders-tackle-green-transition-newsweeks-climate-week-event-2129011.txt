"It's a chance to bring together industry leaders, investors, policymakers and innovators to sharpen the roadmap for climate tech, ESG reporting, clean energy and green supply chains."This event comes as the United Nations General Assembly meets to discuss the status of the goals outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement, an international agreement aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions to curb increasing global temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.This year's Climate Week feels especially relevant, as President Donald Trump has moved to undo many of the climate actions implemented by the Biden administration....During the Pillars of the Green Transition event, attendees will hear conversations with climate experts, hosted by Newsweek Environmental and Sustainability Editor Jeffery Young.The sessions will start with opening remarks from Newsweek Editor in Chief, Jennifer Cunningham, at 2:15 p.m. and will conclude with a networking reception from 5:15 to 6 p.m.Related StoriesJoin Newsweek for ‘Powering Ahead’ During Climate Week NYC3 min. readWhy Trump’s Move to Undo Climate Regulations Could Put Businesses at Risk5 min. readHow PG&E Plans to Power Ahead on Climate Goals7 min. readPanels will explore how bioenergy has become essential for decarbonization across transport, heating and industry, ways to cut emissions along food systems and the latest advances in grid-scale batteries and energy storage.Young discusses how technology, innovation and corporate responsibility are driving decarbonization in a fireside chat with a senior executive at Daikin, the world's largest refrigerator and air conditioner manufacturer and one of the event's sponsors.Other speakers include leaders from Climate Group, LF Bioenergy, Viridi, Arva and Elopak.
