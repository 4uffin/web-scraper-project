MoviesFilmFilmsStreamingNews ArticleINTERVIEW: Chris Cooper, Oliver Hermanus, and Ben Shattuck Reveal the Magic Behind The History of SoundPublishedSep 22, 2025 at 12:00 PM EDTBy Billie MelissaContributing Entertainment WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project member"We're nothing without the poignancy and the importance of writing," Oliver Hermanus says of directors as we sit down to discuss his new film, The History of Sound, which follows Paul Mescal as Lionel and Josh O'Connor as David during World War I, as they set out across the country to record the lives, voices and music of their fellow Americans.In this instance, Hermanus directs the words of Ben Shattuck, whose debut screenplay is an adaptation of his 2016 short story of the same name."I was on a plane when I read it, and I could see it," Hermanus says. "I could imagine it. I felt it."For anyone heading into the film having read Shattuck's story, it's easy to understand how Hermanus found himself engrossed in the world so artfully created by Shattuck.We not only see the story through Lionel's lens, but taste it, smell it, feel it. It's a sensory experience, now beautifully translated to screen in this stunning 128-minute movie that first captured hearts earlier this year in Cannes, where it was nominated for the Palme d'Or....The seed of a movie was first planted when Shattuck's short story won the prestigious Pushcart Prize, landing in the lap of a producer in Los Angeles who asked Shattuck if he'd be open to optioning the story."I was just, I think, very naive," Shattuck tells me. "I thought, 'Sure,' but of course, I would know these characters best. I'm happy to have it made into a film, but I didn't think it would ever get made."Shattuck boldly suggested he should be the one to adapt it."The important process when you go from a short story or a novel to a script is trying to retain the atmosphere of that piece of work, or to harness it in some way," Hermanus acknowledges. "Ben Shattuck also wrote the screenplay. So it's imbued in him.""One of the great beauties, I would say, of the film world is that my screenplay is like architectural plans for a hallucination," Shattuck says. "It's just renderings of an idea that I offer to Oliver [Hermanus], who then offers it to the actors, and then there's the cinematographer, there's producers, everybody gathers around this shared dream."Two of those dreaming the shared dream alongside Shattuck are Paul Mescal and Josh O'Connor, the beating heart of the tale. For the story to succeed, we have to believe in and root for them."I would have separate meetings with Paul and Josh before we started shooting," Hermanus tells me. "When we were setting up the film, I'd spend some afternoons with Paul and some afternoons with Josh, and we would talk about the separate characters."...As much as there's a deep understanding of one another, David somewhat remains an enigma to the audience, disappearing at different points in the story, leaving Lionel to wonder about the man he first fell in love with around a piano."Josh and I would just talk about what David is really thinking or how David's relationship to or perspective on Lionel changing," says Hermanus. "Then, knowing all of that, going and talking to Paul, who's like 'I'm just madly in love with David, and David must love me too,' I would know the difference between the perspectives. I think that's the importance of the director relationship, is keeping something separate and keeping some things known as a way of combusting when they actually do the scenes in front of the camera."It makes for an all-encompassing dynamic, particularly in a film that is unafraid to linger."I liked the idea of luxuriating in this world," Hermanus says. "I like the idea of active listening, and of posing to the audience the desire to be still. It's not for everyone, it's an acquired taste perhaps, but I think people can also be surprised by the opportunity to just ruminate."The History of Sound requires you to lean in, a concoction of the dreamlike world Shattuck crafted on the page, and Hermanus' directorial sensibilities...."It really does feel like that when you write or create something in your mind, and the story lives in whatever that space is, like the electricity inside the gray matter of your brain," Shattuck says, "then all of a sudden it's out in the world being spoken by one of the greatest actors of our time."Here, Shattuck is referencing Chris Cooper, who appears in the film's final act as an older Lionel."I jumped at the chance when this suggestion of playing the older Lionel came about," Cooper says.His own connection to Shattuck's book – a story worthy of its own movie – comes through a mutual friend, Jamie Clark, who runs a bookstore in Newton, Massachusetts."[Clark] organized a reading for Ben Shattuck," Cooper says. "It included a luncheon, and my wife and I came along. It wasn't around the table or anything, so [Ben and I] never got to meet. But down the road, there was a reading scheduled for Ben at the Newton bookstore, and I wanted to go. Then we had dinner together. Didn't talk about the book at all."Later, he was approached to play the older Lionel, a proposition which resulted in one of the most emotional moments to grace the screen in 2025....The scene, which wanders slightly from Shattuck's short story, sees Cooper as Lionel listening to David's voice on a phonograph wax cylinder."How you see [Cooper's] face and body slacken, and be hit by the sound of Josh O'Connor's voice from the past... it feels like the greatest gift," Shattuck says. "I wrote and rewrote that snippet of dialogue on the cylinder that David records a couple times, because it had to feel right."Shattuck dives into the magic he witnessed seeing Cooper act alone without having met Mescal before filming to discuss the character."They're playing the same person across spanning decades, and they act the same, like when Paul's character is in Bell's house, he collapses at the waist when he realizes what has happened, and he takes letters," Shattuck says. "Chris does almost the exact same thing at the side of the piano when he hears Josh's voice, and it's just astounding to see two actors reacting with almost the exact same body language to the same set of facts. That was a really wonderful, chilling thing to see. It is a testament to how intelligent they are as actors."With the story spanning decades, it possesses an essence of timelessness, something Shattuck is conscious of."My first book was about Henry David Thoreau," he says. "I would get the question a lot, like... 'Why are you writing about somebody from the 19th century?' The answer that came back to my mind over and over is that every once in a while, you realize in your life that there are things that you love, that seem old-fashioned, but they're not old-fashioned, they're just timeless."Hermanus also acknowledges the story's ability to exist at any moment in time."I think what's romantic, and what's attractive about a film that explores that aspect of how life was 100 years ago," he says, "is that there is such commonality between people."Shattuck expands on this, saying, "Listening to live music, hearing somebody tell their story in person, sitting side by side with somebody and feeling the warmth of their body, all these things are timeless elements of humanity that will never go away and will bring us closer together. I think the more we can see that, the more we are reminded of the candlelight and the live music and the hugging, and the timeless elements of life, the happier we will be."The History of Sound – How To WatchThe History of Sound is now in theaters.
