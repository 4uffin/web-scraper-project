MoviesBatmanDc comicsComicsNews ArticleMatt Reeves Confirms Biggest Theory About Robert Pattinson’s BatmanPublishedSep 18, 2025 at 10:13 AM EDTupdatedSep 19, 2025 at 03:37 PM EDTBy James BrizuelaContributing WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThere has been a lot of talk regarding the DCU and how that translates to what Matt Reeves is currently doing with his own Batman universe.More news: 'Anaconda' Trailer Gives First Look at Jack Black and Paul Rudd RebootJames Gunn confirmed long ago that there would be an actual Batman in the DCU, but that Reeves' version is not part of that. Considering the confusion, fans began to speculate whether this would be true.Even David Corenswet stated that he would love for his Superman to meet Robert Pattinson's Batman at some point. The issue is that Pattinson's version of the character does not exist in the same timeline as Corenswet's Superman.Though Gunn has been adamant about stating that Reeves' Batman is in his own world, the star director has finally confirmed the biggest theory himself.Reeves spoke to the "Happy Sad Confused" podcast on the red carpet of the Emmys, and confirmed what fans have been speculating on for months.When asked whether Reeves would make the jump to the DCU following his story with "The Batman," he stated that he hasn't talked to Gunn about directing anything in the grand universe, though he is flattered. He did confirm, however, that "The Batman" is an Elseworlds story and will not ever exist in the DCU."I'm very flattered. That's really kind of James [Gunn] to say and it would be really exciting to work with them on this, I mean, it's [Batman] DC, but its Elseworlds, so it's theirs as well," Reeves stated....More news: Matt Reeves Drops Major Update on 'The Penguin' Season 2Reeves is alluding to the fact that Gunn and his partner Peter Safran are the co-leads for the grand DCU, so they have creative control over everything under that banner. However, "The Batman" and what Reeves has built is still of his own creation.Elseworlds stories are a way for comics to allow breakoff stories featuring mainline characters, without those characters' stories impacting the main story. The same principle is being used in the comic movies, and with Reeves' Batman universe.Though fans might have loved to see Corenswet's Superman and Pattinson's Batman meet, this is nearly a guarantee that won't happen.Gunn is still set to release "The Brave and the Bold," which will be the DCU Batman film that will feature a reported older Bruce Wayne and his son, Damien Wayne. The actor for said movie has yet to be discussed, or rather, has not yet been revealed.For Reeves, he is continuing his own Caped Crusader universe with "The Batman: Part II." He also revealed that conversations are ongoing for "The Penguin" Season 2, and there could be more spinoffs set in this world.There is a lot of exciting news on the horizon for Batman fans, especially when it comes to the universe that Reeves has already built.For more on movies, head to Newsweek Movies.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesPoliticsDemocrats React to Jimmy Kimmel’s Return from Suspension3 min. readPoliticsDonald Trump Tells Pregnant Women to ‘Tough it Out,’ Avoid Tylenol4 min. readPoliticsWhat We Know and Don’t Know About Trump’s H-1B Crackdown7 min. readPoliticsMap Shows Health Care H-1B Visas by State as Trump Floats Fee Exemption6 min. readPoliticsWhite House Shares Update on Antifa Crackdown as Trump Order Nears4 min. readPoliticsTrump Admin Vows to ‘Defend Every Inch of NATO’ After Russian Violations3 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
