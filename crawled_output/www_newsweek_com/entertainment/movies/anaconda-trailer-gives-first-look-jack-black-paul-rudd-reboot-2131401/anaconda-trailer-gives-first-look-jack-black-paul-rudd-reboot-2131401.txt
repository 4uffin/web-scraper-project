However, this reboot is more so a parody that starts as a reboot, but is definitely not a reboot.The trailer gives a first look at Black and Rudd in the film that boasts a big time comedic angle, as well as jumping into the horror of the trying to escape a really big snake.Initially, Doug (Jack Black) and Griff (Paul Rudd) hatch a plan to reboot the 1997 film "Anaconda," which originally starred Jeniffer Lopez, Ice Cube, and Jon Voight.But Doug and Griff are deadset on remaking the film from the 1990s, and put together a hilarious premise of not only dressing like characters from the original film, but also renting a steamboat similar to the one in the film....More news: Tony Todd's Widow Calls Out Emmys After 'In Memoriam' SnubWhat is Anaconda About?The trailer showcases their reboot film getting off to a great start, until Doug accidentally kills their presumably trained snake. While they are attempting to figure out their next steps, a real giant-sized anaconda appears, wreaking havoc on their reboot.The film appears to go off the rails past this point, as Doug, Griff, and Claire (Thandie Newton) must now escape the clutches of a river monster.According to the official synopsis of the film:A midlife crisis inspires Doug (Jack Black) and Griff (Paul Rudd) to head into the Amazon rainforest to remake their favorite film from their youth, but everything changes when a real giant anaconda shows up, turning the comically chaotic set into a deadly situation. The movie they're dying to make? It might just kill them.Black and Rudd also spoke to PEOPLE about the film, and working with one another as the main reason for this "Anaconda" reboot."The Jumanji actor adds that it was 'so fun' to team up with Rudd. 'It was the main reason I wanted to do the movie,' says Black. 'I'm a huge fan of Paul's work. Dude is f---ing hilarious. And a sweet pea to boot!'"Likewise, for Rudd: 'I love Jack and was thrilled to get to do this with him. We've done a few little things in the past, and to get to really work together for months like this was fantastic.'"When does Anaconda Come Out?The "Anaconda" reboot also stars Daniela Melchior, Selton Mello, and Steve Zahn, and the film will release in Christmas 2025.For more movie news, head to Newsweek Movies.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting3 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
