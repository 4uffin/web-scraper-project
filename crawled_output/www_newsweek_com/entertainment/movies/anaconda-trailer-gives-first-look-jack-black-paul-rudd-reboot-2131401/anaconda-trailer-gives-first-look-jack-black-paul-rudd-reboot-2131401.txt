However, this reboot is more so a parody that starts as a reboot, but is definitely not a reboot.The trailer gives a first look at Black and Rudd in the film that boasts a big time comedic angle, as well as jumping into the horror of the trying to escape a really big snake.Initially, Doug (Jack Black) and Griff (Paul Rudd) hatch a plan to reboot the 1997 film "Anaconda," which originally starred Jeniffer Lopez, Ice Cube, and Jon Voight.But Doug and Griff are deadset on remaking the film from the 1990s, and put together a hilarious premise of not only dressing like characters from the original film, but also renting a steamboat similar to the one in the film....More news: Tony Todd's Widow Calls Out Emmys After 'In Memoriam' SnubWhat is Anaconda About?The trailer showcases their reboot film getting off to a great start, until Doug accidentally kills their presumably trained snake. While they are attempting to figure out their next steps, a real giant-sized anaconda appears, wreaking havoc on their reboot.The film appears to go off the rails past this point, as Doug, Griff, and Claire (Thandie Newton) must now escape the clutches of a river monster.According to the official synopsis of the film:A midlife crisis inspires Doug (Jack Black) and Griff (Paul Rudd) to head into the Amazon rainforest to remake their favorite film from their youth, but everything changes when a real giant anaconda shows up, turning the comically chaotic set into a deadly situation. The movie they're dying to make? It might just kill them.Black and Rudd also spoke to PEOPLE about the film, and working with one another as the main reason for this "Anaconda" reboot."The Jumanji actor adds that it was 'so fun' to team up with Rudd. 'It was the main reason I wanted to do the movie,' says Black. 'I'm a huge fan of Paul's work. Dude is f---ing hilarious. And a sweet pea to boot!'"Likewise, for Rudd: 'I love Jack and was thrilled to get to do this with him. We've done a few little things in the past, and to get to really work together for months like this was fantastic.'"When does Anaconda Come Out?The "Anaconda" reboot also stars Daniela Melchior, Selton Mello, and Steve Zahn, and the film will release in Christmas 2025.For more movie news, head to Newsweek Movies.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesU.S.Exclusive: James Talarico on Texas, ‘Nonbinary’ God and Joe Rogan’s Support27 min. readNewsArmed Man Released on Bond Ahead of Charlie Kirk Memorial: Officials3 min. readNewsTrump Demands Venezuela Accept ‘Worst in the World’ Criminals4 min. readNewsThousands Protest on NYC Streets Ahead of Climate Week3 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Leaves Disney Facing ‘Existential Crisis’5 min. readHealthRecall for Kirkland Brand Tuna Poke Sold at Costco3 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
