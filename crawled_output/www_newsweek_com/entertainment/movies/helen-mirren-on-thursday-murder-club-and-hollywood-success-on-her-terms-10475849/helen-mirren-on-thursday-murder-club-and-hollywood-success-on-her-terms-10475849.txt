News ArticleHelen Mirren on Thursday Murder Club and Hollywood Success on Her TermsPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 05:00 AM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 01:30 PM EDTBy H. Alan ScottSenior EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberIn the 1970s, as a rising star at the Royal Shakespeare Company, a young Helen Mirren was the subject of a documentary titled Doing Her Own Thing. While she describes the film as “mortifyingly embarrassing” at the time, looking back on her five-decade career, it’s clear Mirren has achieved success on her own terms. From shunning early fame in order to focus on experimental theater, to achieving Oscar-, Emmy- and Tony-awarded glory for projects like The Queen and Prime Suspect—all after the age of 50—Mirren has defied every Hollywood convention. This early documentary film title wasn’t just a simple observation of a young actress with a gift, it was a prophecy. “People think that you plan things,” Mirren told Newsweek while promoting her latest film, Netflix’s The Thursday Murder Club. “You don’t plan things. Your choices, the choices that you make are your choices, and you have to stand by them.” ...At the height of her critical success with the Royal Shakespeare Company, Mirren could have pivoted to more mainstream work in film and TV. Instead, she chose avant-garde theater with British director Peter Brook, following him and a troupe of actors across Africa. “I basically kind of stepped away from it,” she recalls, and “went and did experimental, very experimental theater for a year because I wanted to. I wanted to expand my horizons.” This trust in her own instincts ultimately proved to be the very key to her career longevity, especially if you believe what a hand reader told her at age 23. In her 2008 illustrated memoir, In the Frame: My Life in Words and Pictures, Mirren writes about her visit. The reader said to her, “You will be successful in life, but you will see your greatest success later, after the age of 45.” This prediction proved true. “It totally manifested,” she says. Both her Emmy-winning role as Jane Tennison in the limited series Prime Suspect, which ran between 1991 and 2006, and her career-defining and Oscar-winning turn as Queen Elizabeth II in The Queen in 2006, came after this predicted benchmark, a rarity in an industry often linked to dismissing women after a certain age.  ...“To think that Greta Garbo retired at the age of 35,” Mirren wonders, reflecting on the changes that led to her success. “A lot of women’s careers don’t start until 35 nowadays.... So, there is a huge change, and it will continue to change.” Part of that change is through telling diverse stories of older people, which Mirren has continuously done, often going against conventional expectations for an older actress as well. She appeared in action films like RED and multiple Fast & Furious movies, added superhero to her resume with Shazam! Fury of the Gods and has made time to appear as a regular on popular TV series like 1923, a Yellowstone prequel, and most recently as Maeve in MobLand. “It’s just a question really of familiarizing the audience with an older face. This is what we look like.” “It’s so hard to recognize when you’re a young person looking at an older person that this person has lived the life that you have lived. They’ve fallen in love, they’ve had sex, they’ve got drunk, they have been bad, they’ve been good, they’ve been confused, they’ve be emotional, they’ve been achieving, they’ve been everything and they are continuing to be. It doesn’t actually stop.” ...It’s that lived experience that has made her portrayals of towering real-life figures like Queen Elizabeth I and II, Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, Catherine the Great and Sofya Tolstoy so successful. Mirren used to say, “I will never play a real-life person, because you can’t win. You’re only ever going to be, at the most, 65 percent as good as the real person is at being themselves.” But it was in her role as Queen Elizabeth II that she found her knack for making these performances realistic.  It was by studying how artists depicted them in portraits, “studying them like a detective trying to find a character,” because “artists see through the outward presentation into something within.”  “I’m not doing an impersonation, I am an artist, and this is my portrait. It’s only my portrait, so it’s my perception of what this person is. And that liberated me, absolutely liberated me.” Today, Mirren continues to choose projects that defy expectations, like her recent role as the amateur sleuth Elizabeth in the adaptation of Richard Osman’s The Thursday Murder Club. If the fanbase for the book series is any indication, Mirren has a popular new franchise on her hands. (And how many 80-year-olds do you know leading franchises? Yep, only Helen Mirren.) Fortunately for fans, she dismisses the idea of retirement. “My business retires you.” “I think the point of my work, an actor’s work, is to reflect the world around them,” she says. “If there’s a way that what I contribute does that, whatever age that is, then fine, I’m up for it.” As you’ll read over the course of our conversation below, lightly edited and condensed for publication, for Mirren, it all comes back to that simple, profound prophecy at the beginning of her career. She just continues to do things her own way. ...The Thursday Murder Club is about amateur sleuths. Would you be a good crime solver in real life? Yes, I think I would. The psychology of crime is absolutely fascinating. I’m sort of mesmerized and fascinated by Dateline. These extraordinary moments when ordinary people become demonic. I say extraordinary, but I don’t mean in a fabulous way, I mean in a disastrous way. I just played Patricia Highsmith [author of The Talented Mr. Ripley] and she, likewise, was absolutely fascinated by what makes ordinary people do these extraordinarily bad things. What did you love about The Thursday Murder Club specifically? I absolutely loved the books and it’s extraordinary, when you think of all the murder mystery books that have been written, to find a new way of looking at an old tradition and to reinvent it. That’s what Richard Osman did. Partly by placing it in a retirement home was a sort of a genius idea. Then to have the understanding that people in retirement homes actually haven’t mentally or physically retired. They’re still exactly as active and have as much agency as they did 10 or 15, 20 years ago. He created a new form of a very old tradition. ...The idea of thriving later in life seems central to your own story as well. Do you think things are changing for women regarding aging in Hollywood? Well, I think things have changed exponentially in the last 15 years, maybe. To think that Greta Garbo retired at the age of 35—a lot of women’s careers don’t start until 35 nowadays. So, there is a huge change and it will continue to change. And incidentally, it’s just as tough for guys. If your career when you’re young is based upon your beauty, then you’re gonna have a tough time later on. Yes, undoubtedly it’s very, very different, and I think it will continue to change. It’s just a question really of familiarizing the audience with an older face. This is what we look like. Does the industry understand that yet? It’s the industry, and it’s there to make money basically. Films are very expensive things to make. It used to be that the mantra was, the audience is between the ages of 18 and 25. So all movies were basically, that was the audience. And I think that’s changed now with the advent of streaming, but also cinemas. I think it’s older people who go to the cinema, and you see a reflection of that in the kinds of movies that are made. ...Your career never followed a set plan. A 1970s documentary about you was even called Doing Her Own Thing. People think that you plan things. You don’t plan things. The choices that you make are your choices, and you have to stand by them. When I went off to work with Peter Brook [English theater and film director], just as my theater and film TV career was just taking off, I basically kind of stepped away from it, went and did very experimental theater for a year because I wanted to. Otherwise, it’s just a crap shoot, quite honestly. A complete crap shoot. You’re very lucky when it’s the luck of things like Prime Suspect coming along at the time that it did come along. It was perfect for me. The luck of The Thursday Murder Club appearing at this point in my life. It’s fabulous. How did the American success of Prime Suspect impact your career? I think probably quite substantial, but in fact, before I did Prime Suspect, I had done my husband’s [director Taylor Hackford] film, White Nights. I’d won Best Actress at Cannes by then with a film called Cal. So it wasn’t like I was a total unknown in America. Prime Suspect came along and because it was such a major leading role—and also at the time, believe it or not—they weren’t at all sure that it would be successful, that a woman could lead a show. Everything’s changed now, for the better. You’ve become famous for playing real-life figures, from Queen Elizabeth I and II to Golda Meir. How do you approach those roles? I always used to say, I will never play a real-life person, because you can’t win. You’re only ever going to be, at the most, 65 percent as good as the real person is at being themselves. I found this on Elizabeth II [in The Queen] when I was kind of in bits about preparing her and just angsting about whether I was going to be good enough. The only way to find out what Elizabeth I looked like was to look at portraits. So, I’d been looking at all the portraits and studying them like a sort of detective trying to find a character. And then I thought, that’s what I’d do with Elizabeth II. I’ll look at paintings of her and try and see what an artist’s impression [is]. And then I thought, ah, that’s what it is. I’m not doing an impersonation, I am an artist, and this is my portrait. And that liberated me, absolutely liberated me. And then I found in my research that I didn’t look at endless film and video of the queen. I looked at everything I could see of her before her 20s, before the war, basically. When she didn’t know she was going to be queen. And then you see the real person. ...Your voice has also become iconic. Are you concerned about how AI could be used to replicate your voice or likeness? Of course, absolutely. It’s a terrifying proposition. I feel quite lucky that I’m as old as I am, because it’s not particularly going to be in my future. I have to say, I’m also incredibly excited and interested by what’s coming. That’s one of the reasons I sort of like living long. I just can’t wait to see what happens next. But no, no, absolutely. It’s very, very worrying. We’re all slightly at sea on a raft, hoping that we won’t drown. You became a dual U.S. citizen in 2017. What led to that? Well, my husband. I had my green card and was here legally, but when the penny dropped that I could actually have dual citizenship, because I didn’t want to lose my British citizenship…if ultimately I’d have to have made a choice, then I probably think I would have chosen British citizenship. But when I realized I could authentically have dual citizenship, then it was a no-brainer. And I cried when I became a citizen and then the most beautiful thing happened. With my brand-new U.S. passport, I presented it for the first time in immigration. And the guy looked up and said, “Welcome home.” It was such a lovely thing. It feels like you’ll never retire. Until they stop me. My business retires you. I think the point of my work, an actor’s work, is to reflect the world around them. If there’s a way that what I contribute does that, whatever age that is, then fine, I’m up for it.  Photograph by Sam Norval for NewsweekRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readsectionsNationWorldLifestyleHealthOpinionRankingscompanyAbout UsMastheadCareersDiversity & InclusionMission StatementLeadershipeditionsU.S. Edition日本PolskaRomâniacontactAdvertiseCorrectionsAnnouncementsPress CenterContact Usterms of useCookie PolicyCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsTerms of SalePrivacy SettingssectionsNationWorldLifestyleHealthOpinionRankingscompanyAbout UsMastheadCareersDiversity & InclusionMission StatementLeadershipeditionsU.S. Edition日本PolskaRomâniacontactAdvertiseCorrectionsAnnouncementsPress CenterContact Usterms of useCookie PolicyCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsTerms of SalePrivacy Settings© 2025 Newsweek Digital LLC
