EntertainmentNews Article‘Still Bobbi’: Inside Bobbi Brown’s Impatient Yet Inevitable Second ActPublishedSep 24, 2025 at 05:00 AM EDTupdatedSep 24, 2025 at 05:01 AM EDTBy H. Alan ScottSenior EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberFor Bobbi Brown, patience isn’t a virtue; it’s an obstacle. The makeup artist and entrepreneur operates on a timeline dictated by instinct, not corporate calendars.  “I have no patience,” Brown tells Newsweek in a wide-ranging conversation about her new memoir, Still Bobbi. “Like I go in and I say, ‘Oh, I love this new product, when are we getting it? February?’ I’m like, ‘Hell no, bring it out in November. I don’t care it’s not in a package.’”  This drive is the engine behind her entire career. Still Bobbi chronicles the story of a woman who built a billion-dollar beauty empire in her own name, Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, only to walk away from it in order to start over (again), this time on her own terms with a new makeup brand, Jones Road Beauty.  “I do hope and I do think that my story is empowering to people,” Brown says. “And they’re like, ‘Well, look, if she did this and she went through this, then I could do this.’”  In order to understand Brown’s second act, you need to grasp the sheer gutsiness of her beginning.  “My husband and I started Bobbi Brown Cosmetics before it even had a name, out of our home in Montclair, New Jersey, when we were 32 years old,” she says. “I made a lipstick and I sold it to people. We were indie beauty people before there was a name saying indie beauty people.”  ...A Revolution of Common Sense Eventually, Bobbi Brown Cosmetics exploded into department stores, becoming an in-demand commodity before ultimately being purchased by Estée Lauder in 1995 for a reported $74.5 million. Estée Lauder retained Brown as the one in creative control of the brand, effectively making her an employee. Brown’s philosophy toward makeup has remained the same ever since.   “The no makeup makeup, looking like yourself but better, has just always been how I’ve done my makeup,” she explains.   This simple idea made Brown a household name. But after a few years, the corporate side of the industry started to take its toll.   “I remember being in the corporate world and we hired all these brilliant women who graduated from Harvard and Stanford Business School,” she shares.  “And I would sit there and have these meetings. And by the time they could figure out the strategy for it, I didn’t want to do it anymore. I was bored. And honestly, it’s like half of the things just didn’t happen.”  This and her refusal to bend to trends she didn’t believe in, like the social media-fueled contouring craze, became a point of friction. “I still do. I hate contour,” she says.   In 2016, Brown parted ways with Estée Lauder. “And I do believe that when I left the brand, they came out with a contour palette. Because I wouldn’t do it,” she says.  She describes Bobbi Brown Cosmetics as her “first baby,” her entire identity. The departure was sudden and emotional.  “The actual pulling off the Band-Aid came when I wasn’t expecting it,” she says. “The first two days I had tequila with my neighbors, and we laughed, I cried, I laughed.”   Her new reality was bittersweet. While she was proud of her decision—“It was the most incredible thing because it just was like, I don’t have to do this anymore”—she then had to grieve.  “The next feeling might be sadness or being scared,” she says.  ...A significant part of the pain was losing her team. “I don’t have my posse anymore… all of a sudden, I didn’t have them in my life. So it was not easy.”  But writing about this moment in her memoir, which came out in September, was important for Brown, because she knew others would be able to relate to it.   “The reason I wrote about it is because everyone goes through things in their lives,” she says.  “People do get fired, they quit, they break up. You go through these things, it’s called life. But it’s what you do with it after it happens to you that makes the difference.”  For a woman like Brown, the legally mandated stillness was almost worse than the emotional turmoil of her departure. You see, as part of her deal with Estée Lauder, she had a 25-year non-compete clause from the start of the Bobbi Brown Cosmetics acquisition. Which meant, after her departure in 2016, she still had to wait four years before she could legally do anything in the makeup space.  An Impatient Woman’s Ultimate Test For a woman defined by motion, this was a unique form of torment.  “I don’t do well when people tell me I can’t do something, I never did. I just don’t feel well. I’m like, yeah, I can’t do that, uh-huh, OK. Next time I’m not gonna ask and I’m just gonna do it.”  Being unable to do the thing she does best required Brown to tap into a part of her creativity she rarely used: She had to start planning for the future instead of acting in the moment.   “I bought a necklace from Helen Ficalora and it was an ampersand sign, and on the back, I wrote the date the non-compete was up,” she says.   Looking to the future allowed Brown the opportunity to reevaluate what was important to her, particularly in beauty. Going back to the “common sense” approach of her natural makeup beauty philosophy, she figured out why so many people connected with her message in the first place.  “Being normal, being real, being authentic, like that’s all I know. And when I kind of discovered that’s my special sauce, it’s easier for me and people to feel more comfortable,” she adds.  That realization led her to take her years of experience and distill it into what would become her “second possible billion-dollar beauty brand.” Enter Jones Road Beauty.   ...A Delayed Second Act  On October 26, 2020, the second the clock ran out on her non-compete with Estée Lauder, Brown was able to put her pent-up energy into the launch of Jones Road Beauty.   From the very beginning, Brown wanted to do things differently, right down to naming the brand. In a blog post on the brand’s website, Valentina Di Donato wrote, “Jones Road was not ideated with a team of experts at a round table. Instead, it happened one day when Bobbi and her husband took a drive, she held the phone to guide them and Waze showed her ‘Jones Road’ was the street ahead.  “It wasn’t where they were supposed to turn, but the name would be the direction where Bobbi was about to bring her new brand.”  From there, Brown decided to pivot how she would sell her products. Turning down major makeup retailers like Sephora and Ulta Beauty, instead she chose control and speed over mass distribution.  “I’m sorry. I did that. It was great. I don’t need to do that now,” she says.   “You could imagine the presidents of each of those stores called me after Jones Road,” Brown admits. “They’re like, ‘All right, we’ll take it.’ And I’m like, ‘No, you can’t have it.’”  Besides a small number of Jones Road stores across the United States, the brand primarily sells online and through the unfiltered speed of social media, a tool perfectly suited to her personality. “I had to show up in department stores and greet a hundred people,” she recalls of the old days of marketing. “With social media, you do one thing and then you’ve got thousands and thousands of people... it definitely has helped Jones Road grow faster.”  That early growth was primarily with older consumers. “In the beginning, because of my age, I was 62 or 63 at the time, people my age [were] paying attention,” she says about the launch. “It really did start very strongly in the Baby Boomers.”  Now the brand has expanded to millennials. “My son,” Cody Plofker, the CEO of Jones Road Beauty, “will say we have the older millennials, which I don’t know what that means. Now we got older and younger millennials, so I’m just gonna say millennials.”  With a new book tour underway—which she describes as “me on steroids”—Brown is channeling her energy into her next chapter. She’s already looking years ahead on product development and, characteristically, wants to speed it up.  “Now when I like something, when are we doing this? ‘I don’t know. Maybe, 2027?’ ‘I have to wait to 2027 for this tinted eye cream? No, let’s look at the calendar,’” she says.   For Bobbi Brown, the old saying is true: The future isn’t something you wait for—it’s something you decide to start today.  ...Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
