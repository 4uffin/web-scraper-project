TVTV ShowMovies & TVNews Article‘Futurama’ Season 13: Early Reviews Are Very TellingPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 02:16 PM EDTBy Evan BellContributing Sports WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberOn Monday night, Season 13 of "Futurama" was released in its entirety on Hulu.While previous seasons of the show on Hulu followed a traditional weekly release schedule since its return in 2023, Hulu dropped all 10 episodes from Season 13 at once.From the looks of things, Season 13 appears to be a hit with fans.Per IMDb's user ratings, this season has three episodes (Ep. 4, 8, and 9) which all have ratings of 8.2 or higher. Prior to this season, across the 20 previous episodes released through Hulu in Seasons 11 and 12, only one episode (S11 E10) featured a rating of 8.0 or higher.Additionally, while Season 11 averaged a 6.8 user rating on IMDb, and Season 12 averaged a 6.77 user rating, the latest season currently has an average rating of 7.6, a figure on par with the show's "final" season in 2013, which averaged a viewer rating of 7.62 per episode.Read More: 50 Cent Drops Epic Training Video as 'Street Fighter' Character Balrog... Read More: Everything Announced in the September 2025 Nintendo DirectCritic reviews seemed to echo a similar sentiment, suggesting that the season was a return to form for the show.As ScreenRant writes:"The majority of Futurama season 13's episodes are welcome additions, and the few weaker entries are quickly forgotten as you roll into the next. This makes for a good, if not great, season overall, and one that will seamlessly slot in amid your umpteenth rewatch of the whole series."Nick Valdez of ComicBook.com wrote:"It's clear that Futurama is more future-proof ready than ever before with the release of Season 13, and fans are going to love being along for the ride."Callie Hanna of FandomWire, who rated the season 9/10 on Rotten Tomatoes, added:"The deft mix of top-notch character writing, creative sci-fi weirdness, and sitcom-style relatability that has defined Futurama throughout its storied history is very much on display here."Since its return in 2023, Futurama has followed a yearly release of 10 episodes, and considering Matt Groening still has one more season left on his Nov. 2023 deal with Hulu, the expectation is that Fry, Bender, Leela, and the rest of the gang will be back for Season 14 sometime in 2026.As Groening explained in an interview with Cracked last summer following the release of Season 12, the decade-long hiatus between seasons has given him and his team plenty to work with going forward."Because we were off the air for about 10 years, a lot of things happened in the culture and in science fiction."With a new cast of young writers, many of whom grew up watching the show, according to Groening, hitting their stride, Hulu may wind up locking Futurama down for several more seasons before we see a Season 14 trailer.Read More: Gen V Season 2 Episode 1 – Release Date, Schedule, How To WatchRequest Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsDallas ICE Facility Shooting: Detainee Killed, Suspect Joshua Jahn Fired ‘Indiscriminately’2 min. readU.S.Donald Trump Reacts to Fatal Dallas ICE Facility Shooting2 min. readNewsIs James Comey Getting Indicted?
