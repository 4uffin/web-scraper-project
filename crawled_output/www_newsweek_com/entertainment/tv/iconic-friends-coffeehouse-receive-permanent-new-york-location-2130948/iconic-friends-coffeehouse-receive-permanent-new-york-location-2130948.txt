TVFriendsStreamingNews ArticleIconic ‘Friends’ Coffeehouse to Receive Permanent New York LocationPublishedSep 16, 2025 at 07:55 PM EDTupdatedSep 16, 2025 at 09:48 PM EDTBy James BrizuelaContributing WriterShareNewsweek is a Trust Project memberThere might not be a more recognizable and iconic sitcom than "Friends." The series debuted on September 22, 1994, on NBC, and sent shockwaves through the TV world.More news: Matt Reeves Drops Major Update on 'The Penguin' Season 2Starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the series followed six friends who are in their early 20s and 30s, as they navigate life in New York City.The sitcom helped launch the careers of all six stars, who have gone on to become TV and film stars....More news: 'Harry Potter' Day Celebrated With Reveal of Original Cast Member ReturnOne of the most beloved aspects of the sitcom is the iconic "Central Perk" coffeehouse, which sat below the apartment building that Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Monica (Courteney Cox), Joey (Matt LeBlanc), and Chandler (Matthew Perry) lived in.A lot of the scenes were shot on the famous orange couch, where the friends shared some of their best one-liners and stories.As part of the show's longstanding fandom, "Central Perk" pop-ups were showcased in New York City and at The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf in Los Angeles over the years.Now, New York will get the first official and permanent "Central Perk" location.According to Variety, "Launching in fall 2025, the café promises artisanal coffee drinks and 'Friends'-inspired food items guided by 'Top Chef' judge and James Beard Award winner Tom Colicchio. Central Perk will include a replica of the orange sofa, merchandise and take-home coffee blends available for purchase."The new location for "Central Perk" in New York will be at Times Square, on the northeast corner of 7th Avenue and 47th Street. This is the second permanent location, with the first opening in Boston in 2023.Peter van Roden, the EVP of Warner Bros. Discovery Global Experiences, stated to Variety about the location opening:"Central Perk is one of the most iconic landmarks in television history. After the incredible response in Boston, bringing Central Perk to Times Square isn't just the next step — it's a homecoming. This is about delivering an experience in the heart of Manhattan, where the story began, and letting fans from around the world step into a space that's both nostalgic yet freshly reimagined. There's no better place than New York City to celebrate the legacy of 'Friends' and to continue building on the connection fans feel with Central Perk."It is a bit strange that New York wasn't the first place where a permanent location opened, given that the sitcom mostly took place in the city. However, fans will be able to sit on the orange couch and drink specialty coffee starting this fall.For more TV news, head to Newsweek TV.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesNewsSecret Service Takes Down Imminent Threat as UN Leaders Meet in New York3 min. readNewsDonald Trump’s Tylenol Autism Remarks Spark Alarm From Doctors7 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Back on ABC: When, Where and How to Watch3 min. readPoliticsTrump Torches ‘Ridiculous’ Democratic Leaders, Cancels Shutdown Meeting2 min. readNewsKamala Harris Says Maybe She Was ‘Too Cautious’ Not Picking Buttigieg as VP4 min. readNewsTrump Designates Antifa a Major Terrorist Organization: What We Know3 min. readTrendingSocial SecuritySocial Security Issues Reminder About Major Change Coming Next Week4 min. readPollsDonald Trump’s Approval Rating Suddenly Shifts with Richest Americans4 min. readCharlie kirkCharlie Kirk Funeral: Full List of Performers at Today’s Memorial2 min. readProduct recallAmazon Recalls Products Nationwide: Full List of Items Impacted4 min. readEarthquakeCalifornia Earthquake Shakes San Francisco, Berkeley Today3 min. readOpinionOpinionWhy America Medicates Sadness | Opinion5 min. readOpinionCharlie Kirk’s Christianity Was the Christianity of the American Founding6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
