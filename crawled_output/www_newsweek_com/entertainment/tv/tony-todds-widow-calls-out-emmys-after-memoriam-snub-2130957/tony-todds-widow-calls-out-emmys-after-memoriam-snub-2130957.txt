Such was the case at the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards, when the audience was reminded that we had lost Malcolm-Jamal Warner, David Lynch, Quincy Jones, Michelle Trachtenberg, Maggie Smith, and many more.Despite including multiple iconic names in this segment, many notable names were left out, including Hulk Hogan, Danielle Spencer, and Jerry Adler.Another name horror fans noticed missing was Tony Todd, who had passed away at 69 years old on Nov. 6, 2024.More Entertainment: Matt Reeves Drops Major Update on 'The Penguin' Season 2Most well-known for the "Candyman" and "Final Destination" franchises, Todd had also been featured in a plethora of television programs, including "Star Trek: The Next Generation," "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine," "The Flash," and "Scream."This marked the second awards show that had snubbed Todd after the 97th Academy Awards also didn't include him in their "In Memoriam" segment. And his wife is not happy about it....According to an article from Ryan Coleman of Entertainment Weekly, Todd's wife, Fatima Cortez Todd, was "disappointed but not surprised" that he was not included in the segment."Tony had a long list of TV credits, but he was not respected as much by the industry he gave his artistic life," Fatima said. "He was classically trained and always given great support by his fans."Loading twitter content..."Ultimately, he gave his all because he loved his work. Many times he was told that he should have had a role he didn't get. He still maintained his generosity of spirit. The award shows look over many who should be honored. That's on them."More Entertainment: 'The Conjuring' Series Greenlit Following Final Film's Box Office RecordFatima Cortez Todd also noted that a memorial service will be held for Tony Todd at the Fine Arts Theatre in Beverly Hills on Nov. 8."His funeral was private and I respect the fans enough to have closure on his passing," she said.More Entertainment: 'Weapons' Gets Official Digital and At-Home Release Date – How to WatchOriginal 'Harry Potter' Director Has Strong Words For New Hagrid Set PhotosFor more entertainment news, head on over to Newsweek Entertainment.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesU.S.Exclusive: James Talarico on Texas, ‘Nonbinary’ God and Joe Rogan’s Support27 min. readNewsArmed Man Released on Bond Ahead of Charlie Kirk Memorial: Officials3 min. readNewsTrump Demands Venezuela Accept ‘Worst in the World’ Criminals4 min. readNewsThousands Protest on NYC Streets Ahead of Climate Week3 min. readNewsJimmy Kimmel Leaves Disney Facing ‘Existential Crisis’5 min. readHealthRecall for Kirkland Brand Tuna Poke Sold at Costco3 min. readTrendingGreen CardGreen Card Update: Applicants Receive Major Boost3 min. readCharlie kirkWhat Lance Twiggs’ Social Media Reveals About Tyler Robinson’s Trans Partner4 min. readImmigrationICE Detains Green Card Holder Dad with Tumor After 30 Years in US—Attorney4 min. readBreaking NewsTyler Robinson’s Full Text Exchange with Roommate Lance Twiggs Revealed8 min. readMississippiWho Is Demartravion ‘Trey’ Reed?
