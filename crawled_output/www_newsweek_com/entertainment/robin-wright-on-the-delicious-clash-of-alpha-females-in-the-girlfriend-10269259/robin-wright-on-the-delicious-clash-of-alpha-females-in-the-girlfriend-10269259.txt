Alan ScottSenior EditorShareNewsweek is a Trust Project member..."Everyone you play, as venal as they can be, they believe that they're doing the right thing."Robin Wright knew that in her new Prime Video show The Girlfriend—which she developed and is starring in—she would have to fight the potential for melodrama, because “it could easily go there.” “This was so much of our discussion in the writer’s room. How do we keep it plausible?” Wright plays Laura, whose adult son Daniel (Laurie Davidson) starts dating Cherry (Olivia Cooke), triggering Laura to spiral out of control. “She does not want to lose him to anything.” Despite sharing few similarities with her character—“I’m not that possessive with my son”—Wright still feels a kinship with her. “Everyone you play, as venal as they can be, they believe that they’re doing the right thing. So you have to believe that within them.” Wearing many hats, Wright doubled as costar and director for many episodes. “I could be in the scene with Olivia or Laurie and I’m watching them as a director, like split brain, you know?” And while she’s directed a number of projects, she says she still has room to grow. “I’m still learning and trying to learn how to get my style.”Loading generic content...SUBSCRIBE TO THE PARTING SHOT WITH H. ALAN SCOTTON APPLE PODCASTS OR SPOTIFY AND WATCH ON YOUTUBEEditor's Note: This conversation has been edited and condensed for publication.When you were in the prep period for this, what about this really excited you?  The dual perspectives, because we all do it all the time. We presume, we assume, we make an ass out of you and me. You know what I mean? All those things that we were told as a kid. And I just thought people can relate to this because the things that occur, what Cherry does, what Laura does, you as an individual living in this society, like all of us kind of go, “I could see myself doing that.” So I wanted to kind of put it in reality and get out of the melodrama. And that's what I loved about the story. And that was what the book was about. Because it's a subjective perspective. How did you see it, feel it, hear it, you know? It's up to the individual.  ...How do you find that balance between the heightened drama and the melodrama? Because it could easily go there.  It could easily go there. You're so spot-on with that. This was so much of our discussion in the writer's room. And we had a lot of writers, there was a writer per episode, basically. There was one that wrote two, but that was the discussion. How do we keep it plausible? As actors also, we worked a lot with the dialog once we got printed pages, and we'd be like, “Let’s massage it.” But I like to work that way. I've always worked that way. Because once you get in a room and you put it on its feet and you've already discussed with Olivia Cooke and Laurie Davidson and Waleed [Zuaiter], we talked about the dynamics for hours prior to, but once you put it on the feet, it becomes a different beast.  Like when you're in the room? When we're in the room and we didn't have the location when we were doing our hours of rehearsal. And it was a total of four hours over the course of two weeks. Very rare to get that kind of rehearsal time and do a therapy session together. And everybody comes up with new ideas, new ideas about their character. “Oh, having had this conversation now for two days, it's pricked up my ears that maybe Cherry would do blah blah blah versus blah blah.” And then we would find our little nuggets, like, “Oh, I think, can I change this line and work with the writers?” And we were working as we were going, sort of developing at the same time.  There’s also this dance of the role of mother, you know, the “mother knows best” of it all. When does that go too far? What was it about that that stood out to you? I mean, I can't even fathom what that must feel like to survive your child. It's unfathomable to me. But putting yourself in those shoes, that is the crux of her. She does not want to lose him to anything. What she's only had to deal with thus far before Cherry comes into his world is he's a high-octane sports fanatic. And that's why he keeps those things from “mummy.” And she is very overprotective and ends up becoming possessive of it. But it's because the two women are both so righteous. They believe that each of them is right. And they're never gonna give up. And I also loved that deliciousness because when you get two alpha females in a room, it's a lot.  And it's beautiful television, because you see a bit of each of them in each other. They're so similar. In a perfect world, they would have been BFFs. Class is also part of this, because Cherry comes from a different world to Laura’s privileged world. What element of class was a part of the motivation for the mother?  There was a line in episode three. Laura states, “How can no one see what I see?” She's a gold digger. She's she's a social climber. It's so evident. Why would she do these white lies? It's like, just be yourself. That is intrinsic in a mother. I'm sorry, it's like, I don't care how old your kids are. Mine are in [their] early thirties, and I'm still just like, “Hmm, I dunno about this one.” Cherry's motivation is so beautifully clear. She just wants a better life. And she just happened to fall in love with a young man, her true love, who has all those perks. So it's a win-win, it's a two-fer. So her motivation is very clear as well. It’s just a tug-of-war, obviously. And she's just trying to wrench him away from the clutches of mom. I'm sure that happens a lot in families.  Also that relationship between mother and son is just, it’s different.  Yeah, and I do feel that you see that in the show, that natural dynamic between mothers and sons versus mother and daughter. And that being, boys are so much easier. They're so much easier because they can hate you for a second, yell at you, “You're smothering me, you're driving me crazy.” And then five minutes later, they come back and go, “I love you, you are the best mom ever.” And girls hold a grudge or don't talk to you for three days or 16 months. And you're like, “Why are you being so b***** to me?” “Well, you said something last April.” And it's like, “What?”  I do need to say that I love the direction you’re going with your projects, particularly you as a director. You just exude this coolness, like you’re a force. What is it about you that you think makes you a good director?  I'm not claiming to be a good director. I'm still learning. I'm learning and trying to learn how to get my style. And those styles shift project to project. You look at David Fincher, he's a perfect example. He has such a distinct style. I wanna have that. Not necessarily that I want to do sociopath movies all the time or axe murderers or whatever, and that's his forte, he's great and it's his background that brought all that stuff. I like the variety, but I would love to find a way to feel really proud, like, okay, that's my vision. Episode one, starting with the show. I've never had the opportunity until this show to develop from the ground up. Everything else I directed was already established. The tone, what camera lenses you could use, couldn't use, all that kind of stuff. I got to choose, with my DP, and that's the most important relationship, as you know. He first walked in and we met each other. I said, “Do you want to show your mood board first or mine?” He goes, "Let's show them together.” And we both have the same picture of The Graduate. You know, where things come into the camera and you're seeing the environments and we wanted to make it like a film. And I feel like we accomplished that. So is that a style? You’ve been such a part of our cultural conversation for a while. From A Princess Bride to Forrest Gump to House of Cards, these projects became defining moments of their eras. How does it feel to have had or been part of these culturally impactful moments? I'm turning 60 next year, and I think it's just taken time. And none of it was intentional, deliberate. I love telling stories, sharing stories, and that's what we do. We share stories as actors, right? And I love being moved as a viewer. So I wanna give that back. Because that's why we go to the cinema. And that's what we can't wait to sit down and watch, a show or that great movie that we've been wanting to watch for two years, you know? It's a heart thing. So delving into characters that have nothing to do with you. Like, I'm not that possessive with my son. I never have been. I've never been that overprotective. And he was—talk about a risk-taker. Oh my God, oh my God.  I never was that. I'm crossing the street looking both ways. Yeah. And again, it’s delving into these people that A, you're curious about, you gonna play them, so you better be curious, and you have to like them. Everyone you play, as venal as they can be, they believe that they're doing the right thing. They believe they're on the right path. So you have to believe that within them. And that is the fun as an actor, but also as a director. It is the best. To be able to watch these beautiful magical beings and you throw a note or you throw little piece of a novella, like imagine yourself, you’re 20 years old and you walk into blah blah blah and you set up a story and you just see them sucking it up like a sponge. And then you go, “Okay, roll camera and action.” And they do something completely different. So great for the editing room too because I had so much to choose from. Because they were all such pros, just pros. And we all were this one big happy family together, all of us, we had so many laughs together. And that's rare too, when everybody really gets along. We had a hoot of a time and it was a really, it was grinding shoot.  That brings up an interesting point. Often filmmakers say performances are made in the editing room. How do you feel editing a project is different considering your acting background?  I would love to ask some of my favorite directors that very question, who are not actors. It's exactly what you said. I can watch, I could be in the scene with Olivia or Laurie, and I'm watching them as a director, like split brain, you know? But I'm still feeding them the character, Laura. And if I'm not getting exactly what I want, we gotta move on because we had no time. I will perform. To get them to respond differently.  Interesting.  And they loved that feeling. And I was like, how great. There was no other way we were going to achieve it. You know what I mean? We just didn't have time to do three and four and five takes. We didn't have the time. So working together like that, that's a collaboration to me. That's craftsmen doing it together. We're building this architectural thing together. And it's a thrill. Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouSouth Park Abruptly Cancels Wednesday’s Episode2 min. read‘Anaconda’ Trailer Gives First Look at Jack Black and Paul Rudd Reboot3 min. readDonald Trump’s Royal Carriage Procession Comes Under Scrutiny3 min. readDid Donald Trump Break Royal Protocol in Front of King Charles?
