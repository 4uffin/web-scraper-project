But one of the most personal misfires came from inside her own hotel room.In her new memoir, 107 Days, Harris recounts the disappointment of her 60th birthday—a day she said was supposed to be a brief emotional respite during a brutally demanding campaign schedule. Instead, she says she found herself alone in a bathtub, disappointed and eventually arguing with her husband, Doug Emhoff, over a night that, by her own account, he hadn’t planned at all.“I was looking forward to a special evening with Doug,” Harris writes. “Though we were apart a lot those days, campaigning in different cities, for my birthday our staff conspired so that we’d meet up in Philadelphia. I was wondering what he’d planned for our evening. The simple answer: Nothing. Not a thing.”A were arranged not by Emhoff, but by Harris’s aide Storm, who reportedly chose the menu, ordered a cake and even set candles on the table.“Storm, knowing how much I love good food, had picked two possible restaurants,” Harris writes. “She knocked on Doug’s door to ask him to choose the menu. He’d shrugged and told her to ask me.”Even the gift—a necklace from a favorite designer—carried the wrong date. “When I turned it over, I saw that the pearls’ backing had been engraved with the date. But the date was not my birthday. It was the date of our wedding anniversary,” she notes.“He’d obviously intended to give me both pieces on our anniversary, until it occurred to him that by repurposing one piece, he could kill two birds with one stone. He could practice thrift and also save himself the bother of shopping for a birthday gift.”Newsweek has reached out to Harris through her publisher....The breaking point, according to Harris, was when she was taking a bath to unwind from the day, and realized the towels were all out of reach. She called out to Emhoff for help and got no answer. He was in the other room, watching the Dodgers eliminate the Mets in the playoffs. She called his phone. His response was a flat “What’s up?” That, she says, “was a bridge too far.”She says they argued—not for long, and not with much resolution. “The stress had finally gotten to both of us,” she writes. But rather than explore the conflict, Harris contains it with a line Emhoff said to her: “We can’t turn on each other.” It ends there.The scene painted by the former vice president is raw and intimate. But it also serves as a microcosm of 107 Days itself—a book pitched as a high-stakes political memoir that some critics say was written like a diary entry.Campaign in Fast ForwardThe book serves as Harris’s account of the 15-week sprint that followed President Joe Biden’s abrupt exit from the 2024 race. It is also a return to center stage for the former vice president—and a bid to explain the campaign and its defeat in her own words.The premise is clear from the title: there simply wasn’t enough time. Not enough time to build a message that could break through with Latino and young male voters. Not enough time, she suggests, to undo the damage of Biden’s decision to remain in the race as long as he did.Some of the book’s most notable material comes early, in the frantic days after Biden dropped out. Harris recounts the calls she received—and those she didn’t.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged to join her “war council.” Former President Barack Obama, she writes, stayed neutral. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was supportive. California Governor Gavin Newsom replied with a text: “Hiking. Will call back.” He never did.Yet, even here, critics have said that the book is limited. While there is tension, frustration, and what might have been, Harris is clear on what happened and less clear on why, appearing to blame time as the main reason for her loss.“There were many factors that I believe contributed to the outcome of the election,” Harris said during a Tuesday interview with ABC’s The View. “But in my mind, the biggest was that we simply didn’t have enough time.”...That gap has fueled backlash inside her own party. Michael Hardaway, a Democratic strategist and former adviser to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, told Politico: “This book seems to be unhelpful and divisive in a way that makes it hard for her to be the face of the party as we look to the future.”An adviser to a potential 2028 candidate was more blunt, saying of the book, “It’s embarrassing for her, and for all Democrats, considering she was the leader of the party less than a year ago.”David Axelrod, a longtime Obama adviser, added, "If this was intended as a campaign launch, I don’t think it got off the pad. If it was intended as a catharsis, only she can know if it was successful.”The book offers a glimpse at the inner workings of the campaign through these moments. Harris weighs potential running mates and writes about the calculus behind rejecting Buttigieg—not because of his qualifications, but because she didn’t believe voters would support a ticket with both a Black woman and a gay man.Harris also documents several episodes that strained her relationship with Biden. Trump is a central figure in the memoir—and in two sharply described phone calls he takes the spotlight.One followed a near-assassination attempt against the then-former president; the other was Harris’s concession. On both, she says Trump was affable. He praised her. Said he couldn’t stay angry. Asked her to say hello to Emhoff. Pronounced her name correctly. Harris didn’t take the flattery seriously. “He’s a con man,” she writes. “He’s really good at it.”The book ultimately closes where the campaign did—with the loss—and a line that serves as its own quiet summary: “We’d planned for everything, it seemed, except the actual result.”For some critics, that conclusion highlights the book’s biggest weakness—and the defining flaw of her failed campaign.Request Reprint & LicensingSubmit CorrectionView Editorial & AI GuidelinesRecommended For YouRelated PodcastsTop StoriesWorldNATO Is At War with Russia Says Kremlin, As Drone Incursions Continue in Europe—Live Updates2 min. readNewsDonald Trump Lays Down Red Line for Israel4 min. readPoliticsTrump Warns ‘It’s Going to Get Worse’ After Dallas ICE Facility Shooting5 min. readNewsChuck Schumer Responds as Trump Admin Plans Mass Firings: What to Know4 min. readU.S.Pete Hegseth Summons Hundreds of US Military Officials to Quantico4 min. readPoliticsSupreme Court Gets New Warning Over Donald Trump Move6 min. readTrendingViralMan Finds Collectable in Thrift Store for $75, Then Learns Its True Value3 min. readSocial SecurityMap Shows States Where Retirees Can Live On Social Security Alone3 min. readHomelessnessVA Announces $84 Million Boost for Veterans3 min. readNATORussian Bombers, Fighter Jets Intercepted Near Alaska1 min. readNational Weather ServiceWinter Weather Warning Issued As 8 Inches of Snow To Hit3 min. readOpinionOpinionGrifters Desecrating Charlie Kirk’s Memory Could Implode MAGA | Opinion6 min. readOpinionIt’s OK To Feel Nothing On Charlie Kirk’s Killing.
