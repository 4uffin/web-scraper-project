President Donald Trump announced at Charlie Kirk's memorial service that his administration will reveal what he called one of the "biggest announcements" in American history regarding autism on September 22.Newsweek reached out to the White House via email on Sunday for comment.Why It MattersThe upcoming announcement represents a potentially significant shift in federal autism policy and research direction.According to The Washington Post, citing four sources familiar with the administration's plans, officials are expected to tie autism to acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and promote leucovorin as a potential treatment. This approach could fundamentally alter medical guidance for pregnant women and autism treatment protocols, affecting millions of families.The initiative has drawn involvement from top health officials including Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Marty Makary and National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Jay Bhattacharya.What To KnowSpeaking at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, Trump declared "I think we found an answer to autism" during his closing remarks honoring Kirk, who was assassinated September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Trump said that Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz will join him in the Oval Office for the announcement.The president characterized the Monday news conference as one of the most important of his presidency, stating the administration would reveal how autism "happens, so we won't let it happen anymore, and how to get at least somewhat better when you have it."According to The Post, federal officials have been reviewing research, including an August study by Mount Sinai and Harvard researchers, suggesting possible links between early pregnancy Tylenol use and increased autism risk.The administration also plans to highlight leucovorin, typically used to treat vitamin B9 deficiency, as a potential autism treatment based on early clinical trials showing communication improvements in children.Kennedy has made autism a central focus of his "Make America Healthy Again" agenda, promising in April that "by September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic."What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump: "And tomorrow, we're gonna have one of the biggest announcement, really, medically, I think, in the history of our country, we're gonna be doing it with Bobby and Oz, and all of the professionals. I think you're gonna find it... to be amazing. I think we found an answer to autism."White House Spokesman Kush Desai: "President Trump pledged to address America's rising rate of autism, and to do so with Gold Standard Science. Tomorrow's announcement will make historic progress on both commitments."HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in an April Cabinet Meeting: "We've launched a massive testing and research effort that's going to involve hundreds of scientists from around the world. By September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we'll be able to eliminate those exposures."
