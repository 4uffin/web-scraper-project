The mean retirement savings among Americans is significantly higher than the median savings, indicating some large outliers. High earners have more than $1 million more in retirement savings than lower earners, which pulls up the average retirement savings number.
Savings by ageMost retirement savings are accrued after the age of 35 (a trend that parallels the average net worth by age). Median retirement savings grow significantly every 10 years for Americans older than 35 years of age until they reach 75.A few factors may be at play in this sharp increase -- the power of compounding interest leading to snowballing returns in 401(k)s and similar retirement investing accounts, employer matching plans kicking in, higher incomes resulting in more savings, or a combination of all three.Average retirement savings by age (median)

Most Americans don’t feel prepared for retirement. In 2024, 35% felt on track for retirement, up from 34% in 2023 but down from 40% in 2021, per the Federal Reserve.
Definition Icon
Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve, often referred to as “the Fed,” is the central bank of the United States.
The older the age group, the more likely they are to have retirement savings and feel as though their savings are on track. Despite that, just 42% of those aged 45 to 59 and only 50% of those 60 and over felt prepared.The Motley Fool recommends putting aside 15% of your annual income for retirement over the course of your career. That may sound like a lot at first, but it’s a goal to work towards. At a minimum, if you participate in a company-sponsored retirement plan, you should try to take full advantage of the company’s matching contributions.36% of non-retirees don’t have a retirement accountThat only 64% of non-retirees have a retirement account, like a 401(k), IRA, or defined benefit pension through an employer, and 36% don't have any retirement savings at all is troublesome.While Social Security is an important social program, it's designed to replace only 40% of the average salary after retirement. Unfortunately, one in five married retired couples and 45% of single retirees depend on Social Security benefits for more than 90% of their income in retirement.To continue living a lifestyle consistent with the one they had before retirement, retirees need to rely on their own savings as well as Social Security benefits.The most common form of retirement savings are tax preferred retirement account, like a 401(k) or IRA, which 60% of Americans have.

By percentile of net worthAverage retirement savings by net worthIt’s no surprise that higher-net-worth-individuals have more retirement savings. What is notable is that the growth in retirement savings for the highest-net-worth individuals has significantly outpaced growth among lower-net-worth individuals over the past 30 years.Median retirement savings among the top 10% of net worth individuals has grown by more than 700% since 1989.Meanwhile, individuals who fall into the bottom 25% in terms of net worth have seen just a 160% increase in their net worth, showing that growing income inequality has long-term effects even after Americans are done working.That gap is even more striking when you consider that the individuals in the bottom 25% of net worth had a median retirement account value of $2,306 in 1989, while those in the top 10% of net worth had a median retirement account value of $110,668.For the bottom 25%, a 160% change resulted in an increase of just $3,694 in retirement savings. For the top 10%, median retirement savings grew by $789,332.Average retirement savings by percentile of net worth (median)

56% of all retirees use a pension or retirement plan as a source of incomeInvestment accounts can be a powerful tool in planning for retirement, especially if consumers start investing early and make use of employer matches, if available.57% of retirees use some sort of pension plan (which, in this dataset, includes defined benefit pensions, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and similar accounts) for retirement income.

Pension
A pension is a type of retirement plan that promises workers a specific monthly benefit when they retire.
It was not surprising that 77% of retirees used Social Security as a source of retirement income, and 92% of those over 65 did so. Social Security benefits are meant to replace 40% of your annual salary in retirement, which is why preparing for retirement through saving and investing is so important.

Make a retirement plan and stay the courseAttaining a comfortable retirement is generally a matter of planning ahead -- deciding how much to save and invest in a retirement fund each month -- and then sticking to that plan. The data reveals that the majority of American households follow that path and have a retirement fund available to them once they’ve hung up the boots and retired. But there’s room for improvement in retirement planning and saving. A quarter of non-retirees have no retirement savings. Thankfully, it’s never too late to start saving for retirement, and there are ways to catch up if you feel like you’ve fallen behind. Preparing for retirement is full of questions that don’t have simple answers. The Motley Fool has resources (including multiple retirement calculators) to help you take your first steps towards a comfortable retirement, but it’s always a good idea to consult a financial advisor to get personalized advice that fits your financial situation and goals.
