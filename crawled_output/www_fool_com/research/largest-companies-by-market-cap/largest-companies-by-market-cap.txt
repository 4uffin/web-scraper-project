Market cap: $4.25 trillion (as of September 2)Revenue (TTM): $165.2 billionGross profit (TTM): $115.4 billionFive-year annualized return: 67.68%Year founded: 1993Tech company Nvidia designs and develops graphics processing units (GPUs) originally used for PC graphics and video games. Its GPUs are in high demand because they play a key role in training and operating artificial intelligence (AI) applications. They've also been used for mining cryptocurrency (using computer processing power to validate crypto transactions and earn rewards)Thanks to the AI boom, Nvidia is currently the most valuable company in the world and was the first to reach a market cap of $4 trillion. Over the last two years, it has also recorded the largest one-day gains and losses in Wall Street history.2. Microsoft
Market cap: $3.77 trillion (as of September 2)Revenue (TTM): $281.7 billionGross profit (TTM): $193.9 billionFive-year annualized return: 18.19%Year founded: 1975Considering the popularity of the Windows operating system, itâ€™s no surprise that Microsoft has consistently ranked as one of the largest companies in the world. About 70% of computers use Windows, according to Statcounter. While it's most famous for Windows, Microsoft also has a diverse selection of products and services that has helped to build on its success, including:Office Suite softwareAzure cloud platformXbox video game consolesSurface computer and tabletsMicrosoft has been making a big push into AI technology. It launched an AI-powered digital assistant, Microsoft Copilot, and it invested $88 billion in AI-enabled data centers during its 2025 fiscal year (which ended on June 30, 2025). It's also partnered with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, although there have been recent reports of tension between the two companies.3. Apple
Market cap: $3.45 trillion (as of September 2)Revenue (TTM): $408.6 billionGross profit (TTM): $190.7 billionFive-year annualized return: 13.83%Year founded: 1976Tech giant Apple is proof of how far high-quality products and strong brand loyalty can go. It first became the world's most valuable company on Aug. 9, 2011, 15 days before Steve Jobs resigned as CEO, and has spent quite a bit of time at the top since then. It also holds the distinction of being the first company to hit market caps of $1 trillion, $2 trillion, and $3 trillion.Apple built its success off sales of its wildly popular products, including the iPhone, MacBook, and AirPods. It has branched out into services, including its Apple TV+ streaming service. And it's developing Apple Intelligence, an AI technology, although the rollout of new features has been slower than anticipated.On a negative note, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in March 2024. It alleges that Apple illegally maintains a monopoly over smartphones through contractual restrictions on developers.4. Alphabet (Google)
Market cap: $2.58 trillion (as of September 2)Revenue (TTM): $371.4 billionGross profit (TTM): $218.9 billionFive-year annualized return: 21.15%Year founded: 1998 (Google), 2015 (Alphabet)Alphabet is the holding company created through a restructuring of Google in 2015. Of course, Google is most well-known as a search engine, becoming so famous that the name is synonymous with online searches. That's just one of Alphabetâ€™s many widely used products, which also include:Email service GmailVideo site YouTubeNavigation apps Waze and MapsPixel smartphonesGoogle's dominance over online searches hasn't been without controversy, as Alphabet has been embroiled in antitrust lawsuits. In August 2024, a judge found that Google acted illegally to monopolize online search and advertising. While prosecutors wanted the court to force Google to sell its Chrome browser, a judge rejected that option and instead ruled that Google must share search data with competitors. Alphabet plans to appeal the ruling.5. Amazon
E-commerce leader Amazon started out as an online bookstore, which goes to show just how much its reach has expanded. It's now the site where you can buy practically anything, and itâ€™s the largest online retailer in the world.The companyâ€™s Amazon Prime service has more than 200 million users worldwide. It's also the largest cloud provider in the world with Amazon Web Services (AWS). And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Amazon also has its Amazon Prime Video streaming service and video game streaming through Twitch, plus it owns the Whole Foods Market grocery chain.Yet it isn't all good news. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 17 states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon in September 2023 alleging that Amazon is a monopoly that uses anti-competitive practices to maintain its position. Amazon is also facing a class action lawsuit over fees charged to third-party sellers that were passed onto consumers.

Market cap: $1.53 trillion* (as of September 2)Revenue (TTM): $461.0 billion*Gross profit (TTM): $219.4 billion*Five-year annualized return: -4.40%Year founded: 1933*Converted from Saudi riyals.Saudi Arabian Oil, also known as Saudi Aramco, is an energy and chemicals company. Owned by the Saudi Arabian government, it has the largest daily oil production and the second-largest proven crude oil reserves of all oil companies.Since Saudi Aramco is largely dependent on oil prices, it can go through significant ups and downs. Heavy oil demand helped it claim the top spot in terms of market cap early in May of 2022, but when demand fell, it was surpassed again. This year, a decrease in crude oil prices and demand has negatively impacted Saudi Aramco's business, and the oil company has cut its dividend as a result.To diversify its portfolio, Saudi Aramco invested $500 million in a liquified natural gas (LNG) company, MidOcean Energy, in September 2023. It also signed a joint development agreement with China's BYD Company, the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, in April 2025.8. Broadcom

It significantly increased the size of its software division with the acquisition of VMware in November 2023.9. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Market cap: $1.20 trillion (as of September 2)Revenue (TTM): $102.1 billion*Gross profit (TTM): $58.6 billion*Five-year annualized return: 25.60%Year founded: 1987*Converted from New Taiwan dollars.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, also known as TSMC, is a leader in semiconductor production and is Taiwan's most valuable company. As such, it works with many of the leading global technology companies, including Apple and Nvidia. It's another of the tech companies benefiting from the growth of AI. It's the largest contract chip manufacturer in the world, and demand for AI chips has led to increased sales for TSMC.TSMC is in the process of expanding its semiconductor manufacturing operations in the U.S. It has announced plans to invest $165 billion in U.S. fabrication plants, advanced packaging facilities, and an R&D team center. However, it has also warned that further import tariffs on Taiwanese semiconductors could reduce demand and damage its U.S. investment plans.
10. Berkshire Hathaway
Market cap: $1.09 trillion (as of September 2)Revenue (TTM): $397.1 billionFive-year annualized return: 18.07%Year founded: 1839Berkshire Hathaway is the first U.S. company outside of the tech sector to have a $1 trillion market cap. It started out as a textile company and remained in that business for more than a century, but it's now known for its ties to legendary investor Warren Buffett. He began investing in Berkshire in 1962, took majority control in 1965, and converted it into a holding company in 1970.After nearly 60 years as Berkshire's CEO, Buffett announced he'll be stepping down from that role in January 2026. Greg Abel will be his successor. While Berkshire's main business is insurance (it owns one of the largest insurance companies, GEICO), it has also invested in companies across a range of industries.Companies 11-1511. Tesla

Its most popular vehicle, the Tesla Model Y, was also the best-selling car worldwide in 2023 and 2024.Tesla is most famous for its vehicles, and it's second only to BYD Company in terms of manufacturing. That's not all it has to offer, though. In addition to EVs, Tesla also manufactures solar roofs, solar panels, and Powerwall, an integrated battery system that stores solar energy.Tesla has had a turbulent 2025 so far. Co-founder and CEO Elon Musk's entry into politics at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led to backlash against the automaker in the form of boycotts and even vandalism of Tesla vehicles. Musk has since left his role as a special government employee in May, but Tesla sales have still suffered.12. JPMorgan Chase

TakeawaysTakeaways for investorsLarge-cap stocks like these are an important part of every investor's portfolio. They generally provide more safety and stability than smaller stocks since most of them are established companies with strong brands.They can be highly profitable as well; 15 of the stocks on this list outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years. Tech companies, in particular, can often be profitable investments. They make up the top five -- and eight of the top 10 -- largest companies by market cap.Yet even with the biggest companies in the world, no investment is a sure thing. A diversified portfolio is still a must so that you're not overly reliant on any single company or market sector.
