Retirement factors rankedHow we ranked the best states in which to retireThe Motley Fool surveyed 1,500 Americans 55 and older to find out retirement factors that were most important to them. Those preferences informed an index to rank the best states to retire in. The index used the following factors and weights:Quality of life: 15.2%Housing cost: 14.9%Healthcare quality and cost: 14.8%Crime: 14.8%Taxes: 13.7%Cost of living: 13.6%Weather: 13.1%See the complete methodology at the end of the article.Here's the full list of factors Americans consider when choosing a state to retire to:
Top 10 best states to retire to in 2025Here's the ranking of the best states for retirees based on our study and data analysis:FloridaNebraskaMarylandMinnesotaWisconsinNew HampshireUtahIowaNew JerseySouth DakotaBest state to retireThe best state to retire to: FloridaFlorida is the best state to retire in, according to The Motley Fool’s methodology. It has warm weather with an average temperature of 72.8ºF, an above-average crime score, a relatively low tax burden, and a strong quality-of-life ranking. That, paired with roughly average scores for housing costs, healthcare, and cost of living, makes it a state with few faults for retirees.Overall score out of 100: 100Quality-of-life score: 52 (ranked 21st)Housing score: 67 (ranked 31st, October 2024 ZHVI*: $392,176 )Healthcare score: 61 (ranked 28th)Crime score: 83 (ranked 13th)Tax score: 60 (ranked 11th)Weather score: 89 (ranked 2nd, 5-year average 72.8ºF)Cost-of-living score: 83 (ranked 30th)* ZHVI = Zillow Home Value IndexThe view from the state: “Florida’s ranking as the best state to retire in is reflected in an exceptional blend of factors. With its favorable low-tax environment, world-class healthcare institutions, robust transportation infrastructure, America’s number one rated higher education system, convenient airports and cruise ports, and access to stunning beaches, Florida offers retirees the perfect setting to enjoy their golden years,” said Mark Wilson, President & CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce. “Additionally, Florida is home to top-rated cities for retirement such as Naples and Sarasota. Paired with a thriving economy and top-rated retirement communities Florida consistently sets the standard for retirees seeking both comfort and opportunity.”Top 10 best states to retire in: 2-102. NebraskaNebraska comes in as the second-best state to retire in overall driven by relatively affordable housing and a low cost of living, alongside a strong crime score. Its quality-of-life and public health rankings are also above average. But low scores in weather and taxes can be dampeners, particularly for retirees looking for warm temperatures year-round.Overall score out of 100: 92Quality-of-life score: 56 (ranked 18th)Housing score: 87 (ranked 14th, October 2024 ZHVI: $259,443)Healthcare score: 79 (ranked 14th)Crime score: 82 (ranked 14th)Tax score: 39 (ranked 37th)Weather score: 45 (ranked 32nd, 5-year average 50.6ºF)Cost-of-living score: 89 (ranked 22nd)The view from the state: “Nebraskans are known for taking care of their neighbors, and we’re an exceptionally safe and affordable state,” said K.C. Belitz, director of the Nebraska Department of Economic Development. “This mix of qualities makes us a highly desirable destination for retirees.”3. MarylandMaryland has the third-best quality-of-life score along with the tenth-best public health score, making it one of the top states to retire in. However, it is among the most expensive states in terms of housing costs, cost of living, and taxes.Overall score out of 100: 89Quality-of-life score: 96 (ranked 3rd)Housing score: 63 (ranked 35th, October 2024 ZHVI: $418,438)Healthcare score: 81 (ranked 10th)Crime score: 60 (ranked 29th)Tax score: 41 (ranked 35th)Weather score: 57 (ranked 18th, 5-year average 56.8ºF)Cost-of-living score: 72 (ranked 40th)The view from the state: “Maryland is proud to be among the best states to retire in the nation,” said Governor Wes Moore. “From our beautiful natural sceneries, to bustling metropolitan areas and historic small towns, world-class healthcare, arts and entertainment, and affordability, our state boasts tremendous assets and amenities that make our state an attractive place to retire."4. MinnesotaExceptional scores for public health, crime, and the cost of living make up for Minnesota’s lackluster tax and weather scores. The state might be a top choice for retirees who don’t mind longer, colder winters.Overall score out of 100: 87Quality-of-life score: 64 (ranked 15th)Housing score: 76 (ranked 26th, October 2024 ZHVI: $334,119)Healthcare score: 94 (ranked 5th)Crime score: 87 (ranked 12th)Tax score: 34 (ranked 39th)Weather score: 30 (ranked 47th, 5-year average 43ºF)Cost-of-living score: 82 (ranked 32nd)The view from the state: “Minnesotans deserve to retire with support and security,” said Governor Tim Walz. “By eliminating social security taxes for nearly all seniors, funding services that keep Minnesotans in their homes as they age, and investing in safe communities across the state, we’ve made Minnesota one of the best places to retire. I’m proud to see this accomplishment reflected in data.”5. WisconsinWisconsin makes the top five best states to retire in thanks in large part to relatively affordable housing, the low cost of living, one of the lowest crime rates in the country, and a strong public health score. Like other Midwestern states, Wisconsin’s weather score is weak. Its quality-of-life and tax scores are also middling.Overall score out of 100: 87Quality-of-life score: 48 (ranked 25th)Housing score: 80 (ranked 21st, October 2024 ZHVI: $306,566)Healthcare score: 80 (ranked 11th)Crime score: 95 (ranked 5th)Tax score: 44 (ranked 32nd)Weather score: 34 (ranked 42nd, 5-year average 45.3ºF)Cost-of-living score: 85 (ranked 28th)The view from the state: “Wisconsin offers an exceptional quality of life, blending diverse urban and rural housing options with a strong sense of safety and community,” said Melissa Hunt, Wisconsin Economic Development Association Board Chair. “At the Wisconsin Economic Development Association, we understand the evolving trends of aging populations and take pride in how our state’s vibrant communities and commitment to fostering healthy economic ecosystems make Wisconsin an ideal place to enjoy retirement.”6. New HampshireThe only state from New England to make the top 10 states to retire in, New Hampshire has top-tier public health and the seventh-best crime score along with a top-20 quality-of-life score. But it's an expensive state to live in and among the coldest on our list.Overall score out of 100: 82Quality-of-life score: 60 (ranked 16th)Housing score: 54 (ranked 41st, October 2024 ZHVI: $478,955)Healthcare score: 96 (ranked 4th)Crime score: 93 (ranked 7th)Tax score: 56 (ranked 16th)Weather score: 36 (ranked 41st, 5-year average 46.1ºF)Cost-of-living score: 63 (ranked 45th)7. UtahUtah, the lone state in the West in the top 10 places to retire, has the best public health score in the country. Also above average are its scores for quality of life, cost of living, and crime. However, the cost of housing there is among the most expensive in the country, and its tax burden is high as well. Its weather score is below average, although it has something to offer every season for retirees who enjoy outdoor recreation year-round.Overall score out of 100: 79Quality-of-life score: 76 (ranked 8th)Housing score: 49 (ranked 44th, October 2024 ZHVI: $517,020)Healthcare score: 100 (ranked 1st)Crime score: 72 (ranked 18th)Tax score: 34 (ranked 39th)Weather score: 44 (ranked 33th, 5-year average 50ºF)Cost-of-living score: 81 (ranked 35th)The view from the state: “Utah is truly the best place to call home, offering unmatched quality of life, a thriving economy, and vibrant communities,” said Ryan Starks, executive director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity. “With a strong sense of community, world-class outdoor recreation, five iconic national parks, and endless opportunities to start and grow a business, Utah delivers an unparalleled living experience that continues to inspire and attract people from all over."8. IowaIowa’s combination of affordable real estate and relatively cheap cost of living along with a strong crime score pushes it to eighth on the list of best states to retire in. The state does come with below-average scores for quality of life, taxes, and weather. But for retirees looking for less financial worry, Iowa could be a top prospect.Overall score out of 100: 78Quality-of-life score: 40 (ranked 31st)Housing score: 92 (ranked 7th, October 2024 ZHVI: $220,277)Healthcare score: 66 (ranked 23rd)Crime score: 80 (ranked 17th)Tax score: 42 (ranked 33rd)Weather score: 43 (ranked 34th, 5-year average 49.6ºF)Cost-of-living score: 92 (ranked 11th)The view from the state: “Iowa has the key ingredients that give people the freedom to build the lives they want, whether they’re retiring or just starting out,” said Debi Durham, director of the Iowa Economic Development Authority and Iowa Finance Authority. “We offer beautiful landscapes, vibrant and friendly communities, and a low cost of living that empowers people to live bigger here. And thanks to our leadership and responsible budgeting practices, Iowans pay no taxes on retirement income and will enjoy a 3.8% flat income tax rate starting next year.”9. New JerseyNew Jersey has among the best quality-of-life and crime scores and a solid public health rating but struggles in other areas. The cost of housing is the sixth most expensive in the nation, and its tax burden is sixth highest. That could put the state out of reach for many retirees.Overall score out of 100: 77Quality-of-life score: 96 (ranked 3rd)Housing score: 46 (ranked 45th, October 2024 ZHVI: $534,773)Healthcare score: 67 (ranked 22nd)Crime score: 91(ranked 8th)Tax score: 24 (ranked 45th)Weather score: 54 (ranked 22nd, 5-year average 55.1ºF)Cost-of-living score: 72 (ranked 41st)10. South DakotaSouth Dakota is one of the least expensive states to retire in. Decent public health, crime, and tax scores place it 10th among the best states to retire in. South Dakota does struggle with quality of life and has a low weather score but could hold big appeal for budget-conscious retirees.Overall score out of 100: 77Quality-of-life score: 44 (ranked 28th)Housing score: 80 (ranked 22nd, October 2024 ZHVI: $306,944)Healthcare score: 72 (ranked 19th)Crime score: 56 (ranked 32nd)Tax score: 66 (ranked 4th)Weather score: 37 (ranked 38th, 5-year average 46.9ºF)Cost-of-living score: 99 (ranked 5th)The best states to retire in for high quality of life
Our respondents said that quality of life is the most important factor to them. We measured quality of life using the Sharecare Community Well-Being Index, which combines a wide range of factors that they call "social determinants of health." This includes factors that cover physical and financial health, food access, and a variety of social and community elements.
The most affordable states to retire in
We looked at two different factors that make a state affordable: housing cost, via the Zillow Home Value Index, and nonhousing cost of living, represented by the C2ER Cost of Living Index. With the recent drop in average financial well-being among Americans over 61, this is more important than ever.
States with the most affordable homes for retirees
States with the lowest cost of living for retirees
Best states to retire in for healthcare
Our respondents value both the quality and affordability of healthcare when looking at states to retire to. We used a single value to represent both: the America's Health Rankings Senior Report. The score in that report is calculated using a number of factors that represent quality, availability, and cost of healthcare, in addition to outcomes.
Safest states to retire in
To determine the level of safety of each state, we used the number of violent crimes committed per 100,000 population from the America's Health Rankings Crime Report.
Best states to retire in for taxes
We ranked states for taxes by looking at the Tax Foundation's State and Local Tax Burden tables. The five states above have the lowest state and local tax burden in the country. It's important to remember that different states tax your retirement income differently.
Best states to retire to for warm weather
Identifying the state with the best weather for retirees is complicated, if not impossible. Many people prioritize mild winters, but others prefer dryness over heat. Others want to be close to the beach, and still others are fine with cold winters as long as summers aren't too oppressive. In the end, because warm winters are a common theme, we went with a five-year average temperature for our ranking.
Worst states to retire inThe worst states to retire to in 2025The worst states to retire in are New Mexico, California, New York, Arkansas, and Nevada.50. New MexicoDespite strong cost-of-housing and cost-of-living scores, New Mexico fared much more poorly in other areas. It has the worst crime rate out of all 50 states and the second-lowest quality-of-life score. Those two factors, which retirees highly value, are enough to drag it to the bottom of the list.Overall score out of 100: 0Quality-of-life score: 12 (ranked 48th)Housing score: 80 (ranked 20th, October 2024 ZHVI: $303,910)Healthcare score: 42 (ranked 40th)Crime score: 0 (ranked 50th)Tax score: 50 (ranked 25th)Weather score: 54 (ranked 21st, 5-year average 55.5ºF)Cost-of-living score: 93 (ranked 10th)49. CaliforniaAmong the most expensive states to retire in, California has the second-highest cost of housing, third-highest cost of living, and fifth-highest tax burden. But for retirees who can afford it, California has a lot to offer. The state has the sixth-highest quality-of-life score and strong weather and crime rankings.Overall score out of 100: 16Quality-of-life score: 84 (ranked 6th)Housing score: 11 (ranked 49th, October 2024 ZHVI: $771,057)Healthcare score: 59 (ranked 29th)Crime score: 71 (ranked 20th)Tax score: 21 (ranked 46th)Weather score: 63 (ranked 13th, 5-year average 59.9ºF)Cost-of-living score: 41 (ranked 48th)48. New YorkThe worst tax score in the country, a low crime rating, and expensive housing drive New York toward the bottom of the list of best states to retire in. New York does boast the fifth-best quality-of-life score, but that’s not enough to push it higher up the field.Overall score out of 100: 17Quality-of-life score: 92 (ranked 5th)Housing score: 54 (ranked 42nd, October 2024 ZHVI: $482,742)Healthcare score: 62 (ranked 27th)Crime score: 30 (ranked 46th)Tax score: 0 (ranked 50th)Weather score: 39 (ranked 37th, 5-year average 47.7ºF)Cost-of-living score: 73 (ranked 39th)47. ArkansasLow scores in quality of life, public health, and crime offset Arkansas being among the most affordable places to live and own a home.Overall score out of 100: 18Quality-of-life score: 12 (ranked 48th)Housing score: 94 (ranked 5th, October 2024 ZHVI: $208,078)Healthcare score: 18 (ranked 45th)Crime score: 25 (ranked 48th)Tax score: 50 (ranked 25th)Weather score: 67 (ranked 10th, 5-year average 61.8ºF)Cost-of-living score: 96 (ranked 8th)46. NevadaThe state’s middling scores for quality of life, cost of housing, taxes, and weather alongside low public health and crime scores leave Nevada at 46th on our list.Overall score out of 100: 19Quality-of-life score: 52 (ranked 21st)Housing score: 60 (ranked 37th, October 2024 ZHVI: $442,185)Healthcare score: 32 (ranked 42nd)Crime score: 24 (ranked 49th)Tax score: 56 (ranked 16th)Weather score: 47 (ranked 28th, 5-year average 51.8ºF)Cost-of-living score: 90 (ranked 18th)Related retirement topics
