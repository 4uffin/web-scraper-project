Stock
A stock represents an ownership interest in a business. When a business wants to raise money, its board of directors determines the number of shares to issue.
In this article, we'll discuss the basics of how to buy your first stocks in an easy-to-understand way. Follow these simple steps, and you'll be ready to start building a stock portfolio of your own.

How to buyHow do you actually buy shares of stock?Fortunately, the process of buying stock online is relatively quick and easy.First, you'll need to open a brokerage account.Next, you must decide which stocks you'd like to buy.Determine how many shares of each you want to buy.Decide which type of stock order is best. Typically, this means either a market order or a limit order.Enter your order, hit the buy button, and become a shareholder.Build your portfolio over time by repeating the process.Here's a more detailed, step-by-step guide to start your stock investing journey.
The first three steps1. Open a brokerage accountFirst, you'll need an investing account, known as a brokerage account, to buy stock. Think of a brokerage account as a bank account that is designed to hold investments.It's important to consider two main factors when selecting an online stock brokerage:What does the brokerage offer?Some brokerages provide excellent educational resources for new investors. Others provide access to stock research and analytical tools. Some brokerages even maintain branches where you can receive in-person guidance.Perhaps other features, such as the ability to trade international stocks or buy fractional shares, are important to you. Of course, many investors simply want an easy-to-use app for buying and selling stocks, and some platforms certainly offer that.Is the brokerage platform user-friendly?Is the brokerage platform easy to navigate? If you want to trade using your mobile device, the brokerage's mobile trading app must be easy to use.Most brokerages allow you to use play money to experience their trading platforms before you invest your own money, so try a few to decide which platform you like most.
One very important thing to know is that brokers typically publish a fee schedule that breaks down all the potential costs of being their customer. It should be fairly easy to find by searching for "[broker name] fee schedule."Once you've chosen a brokerage, you must complete a new investment account application. This process is typically quick, but you'll need to have certain information handy, such as a driver's license and Social Security number.
Definition Icon
Social Security Number (SSN)
A nine-digit identification number issued to United States citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents originally meant to be used exclusively to track earnings and benefits.
You can choose to open a standard brokerage account or establish an individual retirement account (IRA) if you're planning to invest for retirement.2. Decide which stocks you want to buyIn this article, we won't go too deep into the many possible methods of researching and selecting individual stocks to buy. However, the next step is to determine which stocks you'd like to own. Here are a couple of pointers:
Follow a buy-and-hold strategyBuy stocks because you believe their underlying businesses will be worth more in a few years. Don't buy a stock just because you think it will perform well over the next few weeks or months.It's worth specifically stating that day trading -- buying and selling a stock on the same day or even within a few weeks -- is best left to the professionals.Diversify your holdingsDon't put all your money into just one or two stocks. Even if you're investing only a relatively small amount of money to start, diversify your portfolio by buying a few shares of several different stocks. With fractional share investing available through many brokers, you can create a diversified stock portfolio, even with a small amount of money.Learn more about how to choose which stocks to buy by checking out our comprehensive guide to investing in the stock market. Or check out some of the top stocks to buy right now if you need some inspiration.
3. Decide how many shares to buyTo determine how many shares you should buy, first decide how much money you want to invest in each stock that interests you and then divide this amount by the stock's current share price. You can find stock prices on your brokerage's platform by searching for either the stock's ticker symbol or the company's name.Some brokerages allow you to buy or sell fractional shares. This is especially common with app-focused brokers.
For example, let's say you want to invest $800 in Microsoft (MSFT
-0.64%). You use Microsoft's stock ticker symbol (MSFT) to check its share price and find that it was about $495 in September 2025. Dividing $800 by this share price indicates you can buy as many as 1.61 shares.
Definition Icon
Stock Ticker
A shorthand code of letters representing a company's stock for trading purposes, displayed on financial platforms.
If your broker doesn't trade fractional shares, you would purchase one share of Microsoft stock and have $305 left over. With fractional shares, you can invest your entire $800.The last three steps4. Choose an order typeDifferent order types exist for stock purchases. For our purposes, there are two types of orders you should know about.
A market order -- which instructs your broker to buy the stock immediately and at the best available price -- is typically the best order type for buy-and-hold investors.On the other hand, you may want to place a limit order, which indicates to your broker the maximum price you're willing to pay for a stock.For example, let's say a stock is currently trading for $20.50 per share. You want to buy it only when the price is less than $20, so you place a limit order. Your broker then buys shares on your behalf only if the stock's price dips below $20.
Types of stock-purchasing orders.
Order Type
What It Is
When to Use It
Market order
Instructs the broker to immediately buy stock at the best available price.
For most buy-and-hold investments, especially stocks with high trading volumes.
Limit order
Instructs the broker to execute the order only if a stock is trading at or below a certain price.
If you want to wait for a pullback to buy a stock or the stock is thinly traded.
Stop-loss order
Instructs the broker to execute the order if a stock reaches a certain price.
If you have a specific exit point in mind for a stock investment, either to the upside or downside.
5. Place the stock order with your brokerageTo place a stock order, go to the appropriate section of your online broker's platform and enter the required information. You will enter the company name or stock ticker, and whether you want to buy or sell shares (the exact process varies slightly). You'll also enter either the dollar amount you want to spend or the number of shares you want to buy.After you tap the button to place your order, your stock purchase should be executed in seconds (if you've made a market order).
6. Build your portfolioThe final step in this process is to build out your investment portfolio. The best way to build wealth is by adding money to your brokerage account and investing in stocks you'd like to own.As a final thought, it can be tempting to monitor your stocks' performance every day, especially at first. But it's important not to get too caught up in the short-term market noise and maintain a long-term mindset.
Why buy stocks?Why buy stocks?There are some good reasons to buy stocks, but the No. 1 reason is to build wealth over long periods of time. Stocks can be rather volatile over the short term, but have historically been the best-performing major asset class over periods of decades.Stocks can also be valuable tools for retirees or anyone looking to generate a stream of passive income. Many stocks pay dividends, which are distributions of a company's profits made to shareholders. There are some with incredibly consistent track records of not only paying dividends but also increasing them over time.
Key risksKey risks of investing in stocksLet's be perfectly clear. Regardless of how safe a stock may seem, or how well its business is doing, when you invest in stocks there is a chance you will lose money. Period.There are too many things that could cause any or all of your stocks to go down than I can reasonably list here, but just to name a few:Economic weakness or recessionCompetitors taking market shareRising or falling interest rates (depending on the nature of the business)Political headwinds, such as legislation that negatively affects an industryInflationGeopolitical tensions, including wars and trade tensionsNegative company news, which can take many forms (like key executives leaving, lawsuits, or weaker-than-expected earnings guidance)Related investing topics

How to Invest in ETFs for Beginners
Exchange-traded funds let an investor buy many stocks and bonds at once in a single transaction.
Common types of stocks to invest inThere are far too many categories and subcategories of stocks to discuss all of them here, but here are some of the common categories:Growth stocks: Companies that are growing sales (or are expected to) faster than their peers or the overall stock market average.Value stocks: Companies whose stocks are trading for a discount to the intrinsic value of the business.Dividend stocks: Stocks that distribute some of the company's profits to investors in the form of dividends.Blue chip stocks: Stocks of long-established businesses with consistent profitability and financial strength.Large-cap stocks: A term used to refer to the largest companies in the stock market. The traditional definition is a $10 billion market capitalization or higher.Mid-cap stocks: Traditionally defined as a company with a market cap ranging from $2 billion to $10 billion.Small-cap stocks: Stocks of smaller companies, usually defined as less than $2 billion in market cap.Again, this is not an exhaustive list of stock categories. And it's worth noting that stocks can (and usually do) fit into more than one of these categories. For example, you can have a large-cap stock that's also a dividend stock.
Is now a good time to buy stocks?There's no perfect answer to this question, especially from a short-term perspective. There is absolutely no way to know what any individual stocks, or the overall stock market, could do over any period of days, weeks, or even months.Having said that, it is almost always a good time to buy stocks if you're planning on holding for the long term. Think of some of the worst possible times to invest in the stock market in recent decades -- just before the dot-com crash in 2000, just before the 2008 financial crisis, and right before the COVID-19 pandemic virtually shut down the world in 2020.Investors who bought stocks before these events and held on to them throughout the turbulent times did just fine in the long run.The bottom line is that while nobody can tell you what the stock market will do in the near future, it's almost a certainty that a well-constructed portfolio of stocks or stock-based investment funds will be worth considerably more in 10, 20, 30, or more years from now.
FAQ
How to buy stocks FAQ
Can I buy stocks on my own without a broker?
angle-down
angle-up
You don't need a full-service broker to buy stocks in the modern era, and you don't necessarily need to interact at all with a human to buy stocks. You do need a brokerage account to buy and sell stocks, but this can be as simple as downloading a stock-trading app to your smartphone.
How should a beginner invest in stocks?
angle-down
angle-up
It is easier than ever for beginners to buy stocks, thanks to the emergence of several user-friendly trading platforms, many of which allow them to do so quickly and easily through an app. If you don't want to pick your own stocks, however, another good option for beginners is to use a robo-advisor service, which can invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on your behalf.
Can I buy stocks with $100?
angle-down
angle-up
Even if a stock is trading for more than $100 per share, you still may be able to invest with just $100. Many brokers offer fractional share investing, which can allow you to buy less than a full share of stock -- as little as a dollar's worth in many cases.
How much should I invest?
angle-down
angle-up
It's tough to give an exact number since everyone's financial circumstances are different. However, some good guidelines include not investing any money you'll need within the next several years and not investing if you aren't willing to watch the value of your investments rise and fall regularly.
How much should a beginner invest in stocks?
angle-down
angle-up
There's no perfect amount for a beginner to invest in stocks since every investor has a different income and a different financial situation. However, it's a good idea to invest in stocks with money you know you won't need for at least the next few years.
