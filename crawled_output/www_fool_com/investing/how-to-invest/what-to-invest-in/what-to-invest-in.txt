It's common knowledge that investing is a smart idea. However, there's also the important question of what you should invest in. In this article, we're going to take a closer look at some of the most popular investment vehicles.To be clear, we aren't going to discuss specific investment ideas here. If that's what you're looking for, we have tons of great content, such as our list of some top stocks to buy right now.
Even though we aren't getting into specifics, the type of investments to choose from is still a very important discussion. We'll also look at some things you probably shouldn't invest in. Avoiding mistakes can be just as important as finding great investments.
Why investing mattersWhy investing mattersInvesting is important for a few key reasons:Investing can help you build a retirement nest egg.Investing can help you beat inflation over time.Investing can help plan for major life goals, like sending your kids to college.Investing can have tax advantages, especially for long-term investments.Investing can allow you to create an income stream from your money.This is not an exhaustive list. But the point is that there are plenty of good reasons to start investing money today.
High-potential investment optionsHigh-potential investment options in ##YEAROne of the biggest reasons is that many people don't know what they can invest in or how to get started. So, here are some of the most common ways to invest money.1. StocksLet's be perfectly clear. Almost everyone should own stocks or stock-based investments like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds (more on those in a bit).
If you have a 401(k) or similar retirement plan at work, you probably already have money in the stock market. There's a good reason for this. Stocks have consistently proven to be the best way for the average person to build wealth over the long term.
Definition Icon
Stock
A stock represents an ownership interest in a business. When a business wants to raise money, its board of directors determines the number of shares to issue.
Stocks have outperformed most investment classes over almost every 10-year period in the past century.The S&P 500 benchmark index has averaged annual returns of 9% to 10% historically, depending on the exact time interval you're viewing. To put returns like this into perspective, a $10,000 investment compounded at 10% for 30 years would grow to almost $175,000.
As legendary investor Warren Buffett puts it, investing in U.S. stocks is a bet on American business. This has been an excellent bet for more than two centuries.
Definition Icon
Dividend Income
Dividend income is defined by the IRS as any distribution of an entity's property to its shareholders.
2. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)If researching and selecting individual stocks doesn't sound like your thing, that's perfectly fine.An alternative is to invest (either exclusively or partially) in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. The basic idea is that ETFs trade on major exchanges just like stocks, and your money will be invested to achieve a stated objective.
For example, if you invest in an S&P 500 index fund, your money will be spread out among the 500 companies that make up the index. The value of your investment should track the performance of the index over time.3. Mutual fundsMutual funds are similar to ETFs. They pool investors' money and use it to accumulate a portfolio of stocks or other investments.The biggest difference is that ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, and you can buy shares whenever the stock market is open. Mutual funds price their shares only once a day and aren't nearly as liquid.
4. BondsOver the long term, growing wealth is the most important focus. But once you've built that wealth and gotten closer to retirement age, bonds -- which are loans to a company or government -- can help you stay wealthy. There are three main kinds of bonds:Corporate bonds issued by companiesMunicipal bonds issued by state and local governmentsTreasury notes, bonds, and bills issued by the U.S. governmentFor most investors, the best way to go is to buy ETFs and mutual funds that invest in bonds on your behalf.
The main goals of investing in bonds, as opposed to stocks, are capital preservation (preventing yourself from losing money) and income generation.5. High-yield savings accountsSavings accounts offered by branch-based banks are notorious for paying minuscule interest rates.On the other hand, some excellent banks, primarily based online, offer very competitive rates -- to the point that they can be considered investment-worthy in many cases. In September 2025, savings account interest rates in the 4% ballpark were still readily available if you did a little research.6. Certificates of deposit (CDs)Many reputable banks offer excellent high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs). These pay guaranteed yields for anywhere from a few months to five years or more.Unlike savings accounts, CDs allow you to lock in a specific yield for a set period. This can be an especially valuable feature when interest rates are relatively high, and you want predictable returns.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) insures CDs and savings accounts up to $250,000 per person per bank to protect you against bank failure.7. Real estateLike owning great companies, owning real estate can be a wonderful way to build wealth. In most recessionary periods throughout history, commercial real estate has performed rather well. It's often viewed as a safer, more stable investment than stocks.There are ways for people at almost every financial level to invest in and make money from real estate. The most obvious is to buy a rental property, which can be a great way to build wealth and create an income stream. However, this isn't the best fit for everyone.Fortunately, there are alternative ways to invest in real estate. Many, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs), are much more passive than actually becoming a landlord.

Passive Income
There are many ways to build wealth, and passive income is a simple one. Learn all about passive income and how you can start building wealth today.
Publicly traded REITs are the most accessible way to invest in real estate. REITs trade on stock exchanges just like other public companies. REITs can be especially great for income since they are required to pay out at least 90% of taxable income as dividends.8. CryptocurrenciesCryptocurrencies are a relatively new form of investment vehicle. Popular examples include Bitcoin (BTC
-0.02%) and Ethereum (ETH
0.32%).
If you have knowledge about cryptocurrencies, you can incorporate them into a diversified investment portfolio.
ConsiderationsFactors to considerNo investment approach works for everyone. So, to figure out the best way for you to invest your hard-earned money, here are some things to think about:Your risk toleranceStocks are not risk-free investments by any definition. Even the most stable companies' stocks can fluctuate dramatically over short periods of time. Over the past 50 years, the S&P 500 has declined by as much as 37% in a single year and has risen by as much as 38%.
On the other hand, bonds and other fixed-income investments don't have as much long-term return potential as stocks. But they make up for it with steady income generation and a lack of volatility.
Definition Icon
Stock Market Volatility
Stock market volatility is a measure of how much the stock market's overall value fluctuates up and down.
Time horizonIf you have a kid heading off to college in a year or two, or if you're retiring in a few years, your goal should no longer be maximizing growth. It should be protecting your capital.It's a good idea to shift the money you'll need in the next several years out of stocks and into bonds and cash. This concept is known as asset allocation, and finding the appropriate mix is an important part of investing.
Investment amountIf you have $100 to invest, you can certainly still get started. However, your approach will likely be significantly different and your options somewhat limited compared to an investor with $100,000 available.For example, if you want to buy a rental property, you'll probably need enough money to make a down payment. If you want to put money in a high-yield CD, some of the best choices have minimum deposit requirements.Knowledge levelInvesting in individual stocks can be a great way to build wealth -- if you have the time and knowledge to do it right. If you don't, there's absolutely nothing wrong with investing in ETFs or mutual funds to get hands-off exposure to the stock market.Account typesWhat type of investment account should you use?Owning the right investments will help you reach your financial goals. But where you invest can be just as important. Many people, especially newer investors, don't consider the tax consequences of their investments, which can leave them short of their financial goals.Simply put, a little tax planning can go a long way. Here are some examples of different kinds of accounts you may want to use on your investing journey:
Types of investment accounts. IRA = individual retirement account. SEP = simplified employee pension.
Investing Account Type

So, what should I invest in?To be perfectly clear, every investor is different, and no one pathway works for everyone. However, the best answer for most people is a portfolio that combines stocks (or stock-based ETFs and mutual funds) and fixed-income investments like bonds and CDs.One popular asset allocation guideline financial planners use, known as the Rule of 110, is to subtract your age from 110 to determine the approximate percentage of your portfolio that should be in stocks. For example, according to this rule, a 40-year-old should have roughly 70% of their money invested in stocks and stock-based funds.

Where should I invest my money?

There are several different types of investments that will help you get started. You can open a standard brokerage account to invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs. Or you can open a retirement account, like an individual retirement account (IRA), to invest in those same choices. Doing so could give you some big tax advantages.If you prefer a hands-off approach, you can open an account with a robo-advisor that automatically creates an appropriate portfolio for you. Or you could choose alternative investments, such as real estate.
What should I do with $500 to invest?
angle-down
angle-up
You have some good choices if you're starting with $500 or a similar amount. You could use a robo-advisor to start an automated investment account and add to it periodically. With more brokers offering fractional share investing, you can even create a diverse portfolio of individual stocks with a $500 initial investment.
What should I really invest in?

angle-up
This depends on your particular goals, risk tolerance, and available capital. For example, there's a solid argument to be made that buying simple S&P 500 index funds is the best investment for most people. Yet there's also an argument to be made in favor of individual stocks for investors with the time and desire to research their investment choices.
