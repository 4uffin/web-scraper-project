Breakfast News: FedEx Delivers Beyond Tariffs
September 19, 2025
Thursday's Markets
S&P 5006,632 (+0.48%)
Nasdaq22,471 (+0.94%)
Dow46,142 (+0.27%)
Bitcoin117,491 (+1.38%)
1) FedEx Jumps 5% on Domestic Growth
Longtime Stock Advisor recommendation FedEx (NYSE:FDX) rose by over 5% after the market closed, thanks to results showing domestic delivery volume growing enough to offset the tariff-induced hit of international exports."Tariffs are a little bit of noise but they're real": The company outlined an expected $1 billion hit from tariffs this year, but as Chris Ballard, managing director at Check Capital Management, pointed out, it's a short-term factor investors can look past.A dividend yield now more than double the S&P 500's: Back in June, Fool analyst Loren Horst said, "You'd be forgiven if you didn't even know FedEx was a rec; it's no longer the growing company David Gardner picked in 2003, but it remains a buy and might be for investors drawn to its bargain-bin valuation and dividend yield nearly twice that of the S&P."
2) Google-PayPal Partnership Raises Brows
By Jason MoserGoogle [via parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)] and PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) have just announced a multiyear partnership "focused on advancing several commerce solutions." Based on PayPal's press release, together the companies will focus on a number of initiatives, including:Agentic commerce experiencesEmbedding of PayPal solutions across Google's platformsExpanded payment processingGoogle Cloud expansionI don't think this is bad news in the slightest. In fact, it could indeed have a material impact on the dollars flowing through PayPal's networks as well as its user base, and those are very good things.But as is often the case with investing, we are going to have to wait to see how this plays out. The broader impacts of agentic commerce aren't necessarily a slam dunk, and how this ultimately impacts PayPal's business will take some time to materialize.
3) Nvidia-Intel Deal Adds in TSMC
The chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is making with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will have foundry support from Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), with the new custom products having an addressable market size worth more than $50 billion a year."There is an entire segment of the market that ties in CPU and GPU that Nvidia has largely not addressed": Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang outlined how the data centers' and PCs' utilization of the new chips could be revolutionary in nature."You can't overstate the magic that is TSMC": Huang mentioned both Nvidia and Intel are already successful customers of TSMC, with their leadership in the foundry space and ability to service complex custom needs setting them apart.
4) Trade Talks Loom as China Halts Soy
China, the world's largest soybean buyer, hasn't bought any from the U.S. this season for the first time since at least the 1990s, a sign that agriculture is being used as leverage in trade talks.China made up over half of total U.S. soy export value last year: The U.S. Department of Agriculture released data showing zero Chinese cargo bookings almost two weeks into the new marketing season, something unheard of in the sector.Current Chinese import duties are set at 30%, with some sectors higher: Expectations are high for the call between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping today, with the former describing a deal over TikTok as all but completed and being "pretty close" to an overall trade deal with China.
