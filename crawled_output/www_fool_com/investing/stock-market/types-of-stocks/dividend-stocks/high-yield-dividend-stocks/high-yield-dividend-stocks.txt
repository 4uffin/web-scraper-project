Key Points
High-yield dividend stocks typically offer yields above benchmarks like the S&P 500 or 10-year U.S. notes.
Investors should seek stocks with sustainable dividends backed by strong financial health and growth potential.
Listed companies like AbbVie and Chevron have robust track records of growing dividends, indicating reliable investments.
Investor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now â€º
Key findings are powered by ChatGPT and based solely off the content from this article. Findings are reviewed by our editorial team. The author and editors take ultimate responsibility for the content.
There's no official definition of a high-yield dividend stock. However, most investors would classify it as a stock with a dividend yield higher than a common benchmark such as the S&P 500 index or a 10-year U.S. Treasury note.In September 2025, the dividend yield on the S&P 500 averaged about 1.2%, almost its lowest level in more than 20 years. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year note was around 4%, a relatively high level compared to recent years due to the Federal Reserve maintaining elevated interest rates.

Many investors would consider a stock to have a high dividend yield if it were double the S&P 500; others would require a payout at or above the 10-year note level. Those baseline measurements aside, investors shouldn't buy a stock solely because of itsÂ dividend yield.They need to make sure theÂ dividend payments are sustainable. The company should be high-quality, with durable cash flow, a strong balance sheet, and visible growth potential. With all that in mind, here are 20 high-yield dividend stocks to consider buying for dividend income.20 stocks to buyTwenty high-yield dividend stocks to watch

Here's a brief look at what makes each of these high-yield dividend stocks look like attractive buys in 2025.Stocks 1 - 51. AbbVie
Drugmaker AbbVieÂ has had an excellent dividend track record since its 2013 spinoff fromÂ Abbott Labs (ABT
-0.43%). From its inception through mid-2025, AbbVie has increased its payout by a whopping 310%. The company has also carried on the dividend growth legacy it inherited from Abbott by boosting its payout every year.AbbVie has invested heavily in developing new therapies. It has also made several blockbuster acquisitions, including closing its $2.1 billion deal for Capstan Therapeutics in mid-2025 to refill its pipeline and drive future growth. That puts it in excellent shape to keep the dividend income flowing and growing.2. Mid-America Apartment Communities
As one of the largest apartment owners in the country, Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) benefits from collecting steady rental income to support its high-yielding payout. The real estate investment trust (REIT) also boasts a top-tier financial profile. The company's financial strength allows it to expand its apartment portfolio by developing and acquiring new communities.Since its 1994 initial public offering (IPO), MAA has never suspended or reduced its dividend. As of September 2025, it had raised its payment for 15 consecutive years. With demand for apartments continuing to grow, the REIT should be able to keep increasing its dividend in the coming years. The landlord had almost $1 billion of apartment communities under construction to support its continued growth.3. Brookfield Infrastructure
Brookfield InfrastructureÂ operates a diversified portfolio of infrastructure businesses focused onÂ utilities, transportation,Â energy (midstream), and data. The businesses generate relatively stable cash flow to support its growing dividend. The infrastructure stock delivered its 16th straight yearly payout increase in 2025 and has grown its dividend at a 9% compound annual rate.Brookfield envisions increasing its dividend at an annual rate of 5% to 9% over the long term, powered by the organic growth of its existing businesses and acquisitions. The company's organic growth drivers of inflation-linked rate increases, volume growth as the global economy expands, and expansion projects should grow its funds from operations (FFO) by 6%-9% per share over the next few years.
Meanwhile, it sees future acquisitions boosting its FFO per share growth rate above 10% annually. The company routinely recycles capital by selling mature businesses and reinvesting the proceeds into higher-return new investments.3. Brookfield Renewable
Brookfield RenewableÂ is a sibling company of Brookfield Infrastructure. Brookfield CorporationÂ (BN
-1.79%) controls both companies.This Brookfield entity focuses onÂ renewable energy, including hydroelectric, wind, solar, and energy storage facilities. The assets generate steady cash flow backed by long-term power purchase agreements with utilities and other users, supporting Brookfield's high-yield dividend.
Brookfield has grown its payout at a 6% compound annual rate since 2001, while 2025 marked its 14th straight year of raising its payment by at least 5%. The company expects to increase its payout at an annual pace of 5% to 9% over the long term.Powering that forecast are its organic growth drivers -- including an extensive pipeline of new renewable energy projects -- and additional acquisitions. Brookfield Renewable expects to grow its FFO per share by more than 10% annually through at least 2029.5. Duke Energy
Duke Energy is a leading utility. The company's electric utilities serve 8.6 million customers across six states, while its natural gas utilities provide gas to 1.7 million customers across five states. Its businesses generate very stable cash flows backed by government-regulated rate structures, which have enabled Duke to pay dividends to its investors for 99 consecutive years as of mid-2025.Duke has a large-scale investment program underway to expand its transmission and distribution network. These investments should grow its earnings per share by 5% to 7% annually through 2029. Earnings growth should enable the utility to continue increasing its dividends.Stocks 6 - 106. Main Street Capital
Main Street Capital is a business development company (BDC) focused on providing capital solutions (private debt and private equity) to lower middle market companies (those with annual revenues between $10 million and $150 million). It also provides debt capital to middle-market companies ($150 million+ in annual revenue).The company's debt investments generate interest income, while most of its equity investments provide it with dividend income. As a BDC, Main Street Capital must pay out 90% of its taxable net income to shareholders. It does that through a sustainable and steadily rising monthly dividend (132% growth since its IPO in 2007). Main Street Capital also periodically pays a supplemental quarterly dividend.
7. Chevron
The big oil giant's top financial priority is to sustain and grow its dividend. In 2025, the company delivered its 38th consecutive annual dividend increase, one of the longest streaks among oil stocks. Chevron has delivered peer-leading dividend growth over the past decade.Its integrated operations, low-cost oil business, and lower-carbon energy investments position Chevron to sustain and grow its dividend. The oil giant has also been an active acquirer.
It closed its acquisition of Hess in mid-2025. The deal will enhance and extend its production and free cash flow growth outlook into the 2030s. As a result, Chevron should have plenty of fuel to continue increasing its high-yielding dividend.8. Enbridge
Canadian pipeline and utility giant Enbridge has been an outstanding dividend stock over the years. It has paid dividends for more than 70 years and has expanded its payout in each of the past 30 years.While the world is transitioning its fuel supply from oil to cleaner alternatives, Enbridge is adapting by investing in infrastructure to support natural gas projects and renewable energy. The investments have the company on track to increase its cash flow per share by a 3% to 5% annual rate for the next several years, which should support continued dividend growth.9. Enterprise Products Partners
Enterprise Products PartnersÂ ranks as one of the top players in theÂ midstream oil and gas market. The master limited partnership (MLP) has increased its payout at least once annually for 27 straight years.The company continues to invest heavily to expand its midstream operations. It's on track to place $6 billion of growth capital projects into commercial service by the end of 2025 and has more projects on the way in 2026. It also has a history of making accretive acquisitions. These and future investments should give Enterprise the fuel to continue increasing its dividend.10. Gilead Sciences
Gilead SciencesÂ pays one of the more attractive dividends in the biotechnology sector. The company has a solid dividend track record, having increased its payout every year since it initiated one in 2015. Its strong HIV franchise is the biotech's anchor.The biotechnology company also has innovative medicines to prevent and treat viral hepatitis, COVID-19, and cancer. In addition, it has several promising drugs in the pipeline that should drive sales growth in the future. Gilead also routinely acquires earlier-stage drug companies to enhance its ability to continue growing, including agreeing to acquire Interius BioTherapeutics for $350 million in August 2025.Stocks 11 - 1511. Healthpeak Properties
Leading healthcare REIT Healthpeak Properties owns a diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate, including medical office buildings, lab space, and retirement communities. These properties generate healthy rental income, giving the REGreat income now, more laterAll 20 of these dividend stocks offer an above-average yield, making them stand out in a time when many companies don't pay very high dividends. Even better, each one has a solid track record of steadily increasing its dividend and showing no signs of stopping. That makes them great income stocksÂ to buy and hold for the long haul. the cash flow to pay an attractive dividend.
Healthpeak Properties switched to paying monthly dividends in 2025. It also resumed dividend growth. With ample investment capacity to continue expanding its portfolio, the healthcare REIT should deliver a steadily rising dividend in the future.12. Regions Financial
Regions Financial is one of the country's largest banks, focusing on the South and Midwest. It has a long history of paying dividends. While the company reset its payment level during the 2008-09 financial crisis, it has increased the dividend 20-fold since that time.It gave investors another raise in 2025, albeit a relatively minor one at 6%. With its banking and financial services businesses growing, Regions should be able to continue increasing its high-yielding payout in the future.13. Extra Space Storage
Extra Space Storage is a REIT focused on owning, operating, and managing self-storage facilities. Over the past decade, it has been one of the best-performing stocks in the REIT sector.A big driver is its rapidly rising dividend. Extra Space Storage has increased its payout by 110.1% over the last 10 years, and more growth seems likely. The self-storage REIT has a strong balance sheet, giving it ample flexibility to continue making new investments as opportunities arise.
14. NNN REIT
NNN REIT is a REIT focused on single-tenant retail properties secured by triple-net (NNN) leases. That lease structure provides it with very stable rental income, supporting its high-yielding dividend.The company has one of the best dividend track records in the REIT sector. It extended its annual dividend growth streak to 36 straight years in 2025, the third-longest streak in the industry. Its strong financial profile should enable NNN REIT to continue expanding its portfolio and dividend payments.15. Pfizer
PfizerÂ has paid dividends for 347 consecutive quarters, increasing them for 16 straight years. The pharmaceutical giant's investments in research and development are paying off. The company developed one of the first vaccines against COVID-19 and followed that up with a successful oral treatment.The commercial successes have enabled Pfizer to continue making research and development investments and strategic acquisitions (it paid $1.3 billion to China's 3SBio in 2025 for an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize a new cancer drug). These investments should grow Pfizer's cash flow in the future, allowing it to continue increasing its dividend payments.Stocks 16 - 2016. VICI Properties
VICI Properties is a REIT focused on owning experiential real estate, such as casinos and bowling entertainment centers. The company leases those properties back to operating companies under long-term NNN leases. The agreements supply it with steadily rising rental income from annual rate increases.The company also steadily invests in new gaming and nongaming real estate. VICI Properties' growing income has enabled it to increase its dividend in each of the eight years since its formation. It has grown its dividend at a peer-leading 6.6% compound annual rate since 2018, much faster than the sector's 2.3% average.17. Realty Income
Realty Income lives up to its name. The REIT, which pays a monthly dividend, has made 662 consecutive payments. Even better, it has increased its payout more than 131 times since its IPO in 1994, expanding it at a 4.2% compound annual rate. That adds up to more than 30 consecutive years of steady dividend growth.A steady diet of acquisitions has driven its growth. Realty Income purchases single-tenant properties in sale-leaseback transactions, acquires larger property portfolios, and merges with other REITs to grow its portfolio, rental income, and dividend.Â It plans to invest $5 billion into new properties in 2025, which should increase its cash flow per share, allowing for continued dividend growth.

18. Verizon Communications
Telecommunications giant Verizon has been a great income stock over the years. In 2024, the company delivered its 18th consecutive annual dividend increase, the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom sector.Verizon should be able to continue increasing its dividend as it invests to transition its mobile network to 5G, bringing faster data speeds to its customers. The company also agreed to buy Frontier Communications (FYBR
0.07%) for $20 billion in 2024 in a deal that will increase the scale of its fiber operations and its earnings.19. T. Rowe Price
Mutual fund manager T. Rowe Price has a long history of paying dividends.The company raised its payment by 2.4% in early 2025, marking its 39th straight year of dividend growth. That steady dividend growth should continue as the company grows its assets under management (AUM) and its clients entrust it with more of their money.20. PepsiCo
PepsiCo has an illustrious record of paying dividends. The global snacking and beverage giant extended its dividend growth streak to 53 in a row in 2025. That put it in the elite group of Dividend Kings, a company with 50 or more years of annual dividend increases.The iconic company invests heavily in new product innovation, productivity enhancements, and other drivers to grow its revenue and profit margins. It also routinely buys snacking and drinks brands that consumers love (it paid almost $1.7 billion for Poppi in 2025). PepsiCo's continued investments should enable it to maintain its exceptional record of growing its high-yielding dividend.
