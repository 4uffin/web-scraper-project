Investor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now â€º
Key findings are powered by ChatGPT and based solely off the content from this article. Findings are reviewed by our editorial team. The author and editors take ultimate responsibility for the content.
Dividend Kings have a long history of delivering market-beating returns for investors and proving to be generally steady, safe holdings. A Dividend King is a company that's grown its dividend payment for at least 50 consecutive years.
Image source: The Motley Fool.
Companies that pay -- and then grow -- their dividends every year generally have the sort of characteristics investors should look for:Durable competitive moats that help them generate steady profits year after year.Some ability to grow earnings per share over the long term.Prudent board members and management who prioritize returning excess profits not needed for reinvestment back to shareholders.DefinitionWhat is a Dividend King?What's the most exclusive group of dividend stocks? It might not be what first comes to mind.
Many investors are familiar with the Dividend AristocratsÂ®. (The term Dividend AristocratsÂ® is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor's Financial Services, LLC.) These stocks are members of the S&P 500 that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.But there's an even more elite group of dividend stocks that doesn't receive as much attention. Dividend Kings don't have to be members of the S&P 500, but they must reach an ultramarathon-like dividend streak -- at least 50 consecutive years of payout growth.
Here's what you need to know about the Dividend Kings and how they can fit into your investment portfolio.2025 Dividend Kings2025 Dividend Kings listThese 56 stocks qualified as Dividend Kings as of Aug. 20, 2025, including two "unofficial" Dividend Kings that qualify depending on how you interpret dividend growth.
Data sources: Company press releases, presentations, and SEC filings. *Spinoff of Johnson & Johnson, retains dividend streak. **Pays a base $0.09 cash quarterly dividend plus a 3% stock dividend, so "growth" is open to interpretation. ***Dividends are paid in Canadian dollars and can vary for U.S. investors due to exchange rates. ****Spinoff of Abbott, retains dividend streak.

The industrial and consumer goods sectors make up more than half of the 2025 Dividend Kings list. This shouldn't be a surprise. Companies in these sectors tend to pay dividends and raise their prices with inflation, and many have also been in operation for a long time. The list breaks down as follows:16 industrial companies16 consumer goods10 utility stocks4 healthcare stocks6 financial stocks1 energy stock1 materials stock1 real estate stock1 tech stockThere aren't any exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus exclusively on Dividend Kings. However, the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL
0.22%) owns shares of all Dividend AristocratsÂ®.
Changes in 2025Dividend King changes in 2025Companies that make this list don't often lose their status; the things that make a company strong enough to make it 50 years with annual dividend increases are usually very durable. Plus, there's tremendous pressure on companies that have increased their dividends for 50-plus years to keep the streak going. No CEO wants to be known as the leader who messed up such an impressive dividend track record.
Definition Icon
Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
A chief executive officer, or CEO, is in charge of running the day-to-day operations of an organization.
We have recently seen several companies achieve Dividend King status. Automatic Data Processing joined the exclusive club in 2024. So far in 2025, we have added two new Dividend Kings -- RLI Corp., with its 50th-straight annual dividend increase in February, and MGE Energy, which joined the club with its 50th in August.These stocks lost Dividend King statusDespite management's efforts (or often because of them), not all companies stay on the list. In 2024, two then-Dividend Kings cut their payouts, losing their status.
Leggett & Platt (LEG
2.18%) was the first, slashing its dividend in April 2024 and ending a 52-year run of dividend growth. 3M (MMM
2.07%) cut its payout in May of 2024 and brought its six-decade dividend growth streak to an end. In the case of both companies, bloated expenses, weak growth, and a number of acquisitions that haven't gone well played a role in the weakening of financial results and eventually led to a need to cut the payout. 3M also faced billions in losses from product liability lawsuits that played a significant role.
Two "unofficial" Dividend KingsA note on two "unofficial" Dividend KingsCanadian Utilities and Tootsie Roll Industries are on this list, but for slightly different reasons. Both have characteristics that make them Dividend Kings, though some investors may argue they make the cut on a technicality or two.
Canadian Utilities is certainly a King if you're a Canadian investor; however, the changes in foreign exchange rates have made the effective dividend paid to U.S. investors fall at times in the past. We don't want to shortchange the company or our Canadian investors because of this. The dividends per share -- in Canadian dollars -- have indeed increased for 53 years in a row.Tootsie Roll is a little more complex. To start, the company has a long history of paying a dividend, but the $0.09 quarterly cash portion of the dividend has remained unchanged for years. Its payout has grown via the 3% stock dividend it also pays every year for the past six decades. So as long as the stock price increases in value, the total dividends paid grew. We thought this quirk was worth explaining in detail; it can be argued that maybe it isn't a King, but certainly worthy of consideration for dividend investors.
Likely Dividend King winners in 2025Likely Dividend King winners in 2025Three key factors could affect many stocks in 2025, including several of the Dividend Kings:Inflation.Interest rates.A possible recession tied to the two factors above.These factors could benefit some stocks but hurt others. Here are three Dividend Kings that could be winners in 2025:1. Target
Target has been on a seriously rough ride in recent years. Like many other big-box retailers, the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges left the company with too many of the wrong goods and rising costs, pressuring its cash flow following the coronavirus pandemic.More recently, it has continued to struggle with inventory mix and weak traffic as shoppers cut back on discretionary spending, something that affects Target more than competitors like Walmart (WMT
-1.39%), with its more discount-focused model and massive grocery business. And while Target hasn't delivered the growth many expected, it's in far better shape than the stock would have many investors believe and built to succeed when consumer confidence and appetite for increased spending returns.
Its e-commerce investments and large physical presence are a powerful combination that should serve Target well. Target is a major supplier of consumer staples, and even as consumers feel the pinch on their discretionary spending, Target is built to profit across economic environments.Trading for a cheap valuation and paying a safe dividend, Target looks like a great Dividend King to buy today and hold for the long term.
2. Altria
Some investors look at the tobacco giant with disdain; others simply won't buy a company whose products cause so much harm. But if that's not a concern for you, Altria should be on your list.The company has had a number of missteps around vaping products in recent years, and its ability to crack the cannabis market isn't clear (or the future of cannabis's legality in many of Altria's markets).
However, it continues to generate mountains of cash -- $8.7 billion in free cash flow over the past four quarters -- and returns much of that to shareholders in dividend income. It also sells a product that its customers buy across every economic condition, making its sizable dividend safe in every economic environment.
3. Johnson & Johnson
Another Dividend King that's gone through a tumultuous past several years is Johnson & Johnson (J&J). However, the healthcare giant could emerge as a winning stock this year. To start, today's J&J is a more streamlined business, having divested Kenvue, its consumer products business, in 2023. Now, the company is focused on pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and technology exclusively.Over the past few years, J&J stock hasn't made for a great investment, even with dividend growth, with less than 16% in total returns since the start of 2022. However, despite the paltry return in recent years, the five- and 10-year returns are better, at closer to 9% per year on average, even with the recent weakness. With the company now lean and focused on its core pharma and medical devices businesses, 2025 was proving to be a bounce-back year, with 25.5% in total returns this year through late August.
Future Dividend KingsFuture Dividend KingsResidential and commercial water management company Pentair (PNR
0.52%) is on the cusp of joining the Dividend Kings, having announced its 49th straight annual dividend increase in July of 2025. One more year to go!Several large, well-known companies are also primed to join the Dividend Kings list in the next half-decade. We'll update the list as they move closer.
Pros and cons of investingPros and cons of investing in Dividend KingsHere are some of the reasons why investors should consider Dividend Kings:Proven businesses across many economic cycles.History of adapting to disruption and new markets.Track record of earnings growth that funds higher dividends.Often lower volatility, making it easier to hold through market downturns.There are also reasons to be cautious:Like other dividend stocks, future dividend growth is not guaranteed.Many Dividend Kings have underperformed the stock market's total returns despite dividend growth.Sometimes management may ignore ongoing issues and keep raising the payout, resulting in future cuts and big losses (see 3M and Walgreens for recent examples).
