Investing in the stock market has historically been one of the most important pathways to financial success. As you dive into researching stocks, you'll often hear them discussed with reference to different categories of stocks and different classifications.

Common and preferred stockCommon stock and preferred stockMost stock that people invest in is common stock. Common stock represents partial ownership in a company, with shareholders getting the right to receive a proportional share of the value of any remaining assets if the company is dissolved. Common stock gives shareholders theoretically unlimited upside potential, but they also risk losing everything if the company fails without having any assets left over.Preferred stock works differently by giving shareholders a preference over common shareholders to get back a certain amount of money if the company dissolves. Preferred shareholders also have the right to receive dividend payments before common shareholders. The net result is that preferred stock as an investment often more closely resembles fixed-income bond investments than regular common stock. Often, a company will offer only common stock. This makes sense, since it's most often what shareholders want to buy.
Large-, mid-, and small-capLarge-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocksStocks also get categorized by the total worth of all their shares, which is called market capitalization. Companies with the biggest market capitalizations are called large-cap stocks, with mid-cap and small-cap stocks representing successively smaller companies.
There's no precise line that separates these categories from each other. However, one often-used rule is that stocks with market capitalizations of $10 billion or more are treated as large-caps, with stocks having market caps between $2 billion and $10 billion qualifying as mid-caps, and stocks with market caps less than $2 billion treated as small-cap stocks.Large-cap stocks are generally considered safer and more conservative as investments, while mid-cap and small-cap stocks have a greater capacity for future growth but are riskier. However, just because two companies fall into the same category here doesn't mean they have anything else in common as investments or that they'll perform in similar ways in the future.
Make your portfolio reflect your best vision for our future.
David Gardner, cofounder of The Motley Fool.
Domestic and international stocksDomestic stocks and international stocksYou can categorize stocks by where they're located. For purposes of distinguishing domestic U.S. stocks from international stocks, most investors look at the location of the company's official headquarters.However, it's important to understand that a stock's geographical category doesn't necessarily correspond to where the company gets its sales. Philip Morris International (PM
-2.73%) is a great example. Its headquarters are in the U.S., but it sells its tobacco and other products exclusively outside the country. Especially among large multinational corporations, it can be hard to tell from business operations and financial metrics whether a company is truly domestic or international.
Growth and value stocksGrowth stocks and value stocksAnother categorization method distinguishes between two popular investment methods. Growth investors tend to look for companies that are seeing their sales and profits rise quickly. Value investors look for companies whose shares are inexpensive, whether relative to their peers or to their own past stock price.Growth stocks tend to have higher risk levels, but the potential returns can be extremely attractive. Successful growth stocks have businesses that tap into strong and rising demand among customers, especially in connection with longer-term trends throughout society that support the use of their products and services. Competition can be fierce, though, and if rivals disrupt a growth stock's business, it can fall from favor quickly. Sometimes, even just a growth slowdown is enough to send prices sharply lower, as investors fear that long-term growth potential is waning.Value stocks, on the other hand, are seen as being more conservative investments. They're often mature, well-known companies that have already grown into industry leaders and don't have as much room left to expand further. Yet, with reliable business models that have stood the test of time, they can be good choices for those seeking more price stability while still getting some of the positives of exposure to stocks.IPO stocksIPO stocksIPO stocks are stocks of companies that have recently gone public through an initial public offering (IPO). They often generate a lot of excitement among investors looking to get in on the ground floor of a promising business concept. But they can also be volatile, especially when there's disagreement within the investment community about their prospects for growth and profit. A stock generally retains its status as an IPO stock for at least a year and for as long as two to four years after it becomes public.
Dividend and non-dividend stocksDividend stocks and non-dividend stocksMany stocks make dividend payments to their shareholders on a regular basis. Dividends provide valuable income for investors, which is why dividend stocks are highly sought after among certain investment circles. Technically, paying even $0.01 per share qualifies a company as a dividend stock.However, stocks don't have to pay dividends. Non-dividend stocks can still be strong investments if their prices rise over time. Some of the biggest companies in the world don't pay dividends, although the trend in recent years has been toward more stocks making dividend payouts to their shareholders.
Income stocksIncome stocksIncome stocks are another name for dividend stocks, as the income that most stocks pay out comes in the form of dividends. However, income stocks also refer to shares of companies that have more mature business models and have relatively fewer long-term opportunities for growth. Ideal for conservative investors who need to draw cash from their investment portfolios right now, income stocks are a favorite among those in or nearing retirement.
Cyclical and non-cyclical stocksCyclical stocks and non-cyclical stocksNational economies tend to follow cycles of expansion and contraction, with periods of prosperity and recession. Certain businesses have greater exposure to broad business cycles, so investors refer to them as cyclical stocks.Cyclical stocks include shares of companies in industries like manufacturing, travel, and luxury goods, because an economic downturn can take away customers' ability to make major purchases quickly. When economies are strong, however, a rush of demand can make these companies rebound sharply.
By contrast, non-cyclical stocks, also known as secular or defensive stocks, don't have those big swings in demand. An example of non-cyclical stocks would be grocery store chains because no matter how good or bad the economy is, people still have to eat. Non-cyclical stocks tend to perform better during market downturns, while cyclical stocks often outperform during strong bull markets.Safe stocksSafe stocksSafe stocks are stocks whose share prices make relatively small movements up and down compared with the overall stock market. Also known as low-volatility stocks, safe stocks typically operate in industries that aren't as sensitive to changing economic conditions. They often pay dividends as well, and that income can offset falling share prices during tough times.Stocks by sectorStocks categorized by sectorYou'll often see stocks broken down by the type of business they're in. The basic categories most often used include stock market sectors:Communication Services -- Telephone, internet, media, and entertainment companiesConsumer Discretionary -- Retailers, automakers, and hotel and restaurant companiesConsumer Staples -- Food, beverage, tobacco, and household and personal products companiesEnergy -- Oil and gas exploration and production companies, pipeline providers, and gas station operatorsFinancial -- Banks, mortgage finance specialists, and insurance and brokerage companiesHealthcare -- Health insurers, drug and biotech companies, and medical device makersIndustrial -- Airline, aerospace and defense, construction, logistics, machinery, and railroad companiesMaterials -- Mining, forest products, construction materials, packaging, and chemical companiesReal Estate -- Real estate investment trusts (REITs), and real estate management and development companiesTechnology -- Hardware, software, semiconductors, communications equipment, and IT services companiesUtilities -- Electric, natural gas, water, renewable energy, and multi-product utility companies
ESG stocksESG stocksESG investing refers to an investment philosophy that puts emphasis on environmental, social, and governance concerns. Rather than focusing entirely on whether a company generates profit and is growing its revenue over time, ESG principles consider other collateral effects on the environment, company employees, customers, and shareholder rights.Tied to ESG's governing rules is socially responsible investing, or SRI. Investors using SRI screen out stocks of companies that don't match up to their most important values. However, ESG investing has a more positive element; rather than just excluding companies that fail key tests, it actively encourages investment in specific companies. With evidence showing that a clear commitment to ESG principles can improve investing returns, there's a lot of interest in the area.
Blue chip stocksBlue chip stocksFinally, there are stock categories that make judgments based on perceived quality. Blue chip stocks tend to be the cream of the crop in the business world, featuring companies that lead their respective industries and have gained strong reputations. They typically don't provide the absolute highest returns, but their stability makes them favorites among investors with a lower tolerance for risk.
stock classesTypes of stock classesCompanies may issue different classes of stock with varying voting rights and access to dividends. The main purpose of creating different stock classes is to separate economic ownership from control and to tailor voting rights and other privileges to different investor groups.This allows companies to raise capital from public markets without necessarily giving up influence to outside investors. For instance, companies may create Class A shares with more voting rights than other classes (like Class B or Class C), which can allow founders, executives, or specific investors to retain dominance even after the company becomes publicly traded.
Choosing stocksChoosing stocks for your portfolioChoosing stocks for your investment portfolio is a critical step towards achieving your financial goals, whether it's long-term growth, wealth preservation, or generating income. However, it's important to carefully assess your investment interests, risk tolerance level, and portfolio objectives before you put cash to work in stocks.You should have a keen understanding of your long-term investment goals. Focus on quality companies with strong leadership teams and durable growth tailwinds based on a set of products and/or services that face prolonged demand.
Look for businesses with consistent revenue and earnings growth, or at least a defined path to profitability if a business you're evaluating isn't yet profitable. It's often best to diversify your cash into a wide range of stocks and sectors so that you can benefit from the growth profiles of different businesses in a variety of market environments.Whether that's investing in a combination of growth stocks, value stocks, dividend stocks, blue chip stocks, or otherwise, make sure you understand the business you are buying and ensure it fits with the preferred balance and construction of your portfolio. A long-term growth horizon of at least three to five years for any stocks you buy is key.

FAQ
Different types of stocks FAQ
What is common vs preferred stock?
angle-down
angle-up
Businesses looking to raise money by selling stock may offer one of two different kinds: common stock or preferred stock. Both can be worthwhile investments, and you can find both types of stock on major exchanges. The main difference between preferred and common stock is that preferred stock acts more like a bond with a set dividend and redemption price, while common stock dividends are less guaranteed and carry more risk of loss if a company fails -- but there's far more potential for stock price appreciation.
What are growth versus value stocks?

Value investing and growth investing are two different investing styles. Usually, value stocks present an opportunity to buy shares below their actual value, and growth stocks exhibit above-average revenue and earnings growth potential.

Investors of all ages, investment styles, and risk tolerance levels can find something to like about income stocks.

For beginners looking to buy stocks, it's less about the exact number of shares and more about investing a comfortable amount and focusing on building a diversified portfolio. Ultimately, if you're investing in individual stocks, working towards a portfolio of 25 or more quality stocks allocated across various industries and sectors can help you maximize your portfolio's potential with the passage of time.
