Best energy sector stocks to buy in 2025Best energy sector stocks to buy in 2025Hundreds of public companies focus on the production and distribution of energy. However, a few leaders stand out because of their size and financial strength. Here are five of the best energy stocks to consider buying in 2025:
COMPANY
TICKER
WHAT IT DOES
Brookfield Renewable
(NYSE:BEP)(NYSE:BEPC)
Globally diversified renewable energy producer.
ConocoPhillips
(NYSE:COP)
Globally diversified oil and natural gas producer.
Chevron
(NYSE:CVX)
Globally diversified and integrated energy company.
NextEra Energy
(NYSE:NEE)
Leading utility and renewable energy producer.
Enbridge
(NYSE:ENB)
Leading pipeline and utility company.
Hereâ€™s a closer look at some of the best energy stocks in the industry:1. Brookfield Renewable1. Brookfield Renewable
Brookfield Renewable (BEP
0.08%)(NYSE:BEPC)is a leading global renewable energy producer. It operates hydroelectric, solar, wind, and energy transition assets. The company sells the power produced by these assets under long-term fixed-rate power purchase agreements (PPAs) to electric utilities and other large power users.The contracts enable Brookfield to generate relatively steady cash flows. It pays out a large portion of that money to investors via an attractive dividend. The company retains the balance to acquire, develop, and expand its renewable energy operations.
Brookfield Renewable has an enormous backlog of renewable energy development projects. Combined with other growth drivers such as acquisitions and higher power prices, Brookfield expects to increase its funds from operation (FFO) per share by more than 10% annually through 2029. Meanwhile, it has increasingly visible and secured growth through 2034. That should support a 5% to 9% annual dividend growth, making Brookfield an excellent renewable energy dividend stock.2. ConocoPhillips2. ConocoPhillips
ConocoPhillips (COP
3.43%) is a diversified oil and natural gas producer. It has operations around the world and uses several methods to produce oil and natural gas.The oil company significantly enhanced its position by acquiring Marathon Oil in a $22.5 billion all-stock deal that closed in late 2024. The transaction will add 2 billion barrels of resources to its U.S. onshore portfolio with an average cost of supply below $30 a barrel. The acquisition will be accretive to its earnings, free cash flow, and return of capital, driven in part by the expectation it will capture more than $1 billion of cost and capital synergies within the first year of closing the deal.
ConocoPhillips anticipates returning a significant portion of its growing free cash flow to investors in the coming years. It plans to ramp its share repurchase rate from $5 billion annually to $7 billion, putting it on track to buy back more than $20 billion in shares in the first three years following the Marathon deal. It also pays a growing quarterly dividend. ConocoPhillips boosted its payment by 34% in late 2024. It aims to deliver dividend growth within the top 25% of companies in the S&P 500 in the future.

Commodities
Commodities are undifferentiated products. They are distinct from branded products like cars, watches, or smartphones, which are generally identified by the company that makes them.
3. Chevron3. Chevron
Chevron (NYSE:CHX) is a leading global energy company. It boasts a globally integrated oil and gas business that includes exploration and production assets, refining capabilities, and a chemicals business. The companyâ€™s large-scale and integrated operations help it weather the volatility in the energy sector.Chevron uses the cash flows generated from its legacy oil and gas operations to pay a growing dividend, repurchase shares, and invest in the future. Chevron increased its dividend for the 37th straight year in 2024. It also plans to buy back between $10 billion and $20 billion of its stock each year.
The company expects to grow its cash flow by more than 10% annually through 2027 (assuming oil averages $60 a barrel), fueled by its high-return capital program. It could significantly exceed that level if it's successful in closing its acquisition of Hess (NYSE:HES). The roughly $60 billion deal would enable Chevron to more than double its free cash flow by 2027 (if oil averages $70 a barrel) while extending its production growth outlook into the 2030s.Chevron is also investing in the lower-carbon fuels the world will require in the future. It's focusing on carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and renewable fuels. The balance makes it an ideal choice for investors seeking a way to invest in the energy transition from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives.4. NextEra Energy4. NextEra Energy
NextEra Energy (NEE
-0.59%) is one of the country's largest electric utility companies. It's also a global leader in producing power from the wind and sun through its energy resources segment, which sells clean energy to other utilities and end users around the country.These businesses generate relatively stable cash flow. It sells and distributes power backed by government-regulated rates and fixed-price PPAs with customers. The business model is very resilient because businesses and households need a steady supply of power.
NextEra Energy has one of the best financial profiles in the electric utility sector. It features one of the highest credit ratings in its peer group. NextEra also has a conservative dividend payout ratio for a utility, allowing it to pay a stable and growing dividend. The company expects to increase its payout at a 10% annual rate through 2026, making it an excellent renewable energy dividend stock. Its strong financial profile also allows it to make significant investments in new renewable energy capacity and related infrastructure.These investments help drive the company's expectation that it will grow its adjusted earnings per share at or near the top end of its 6% to 8% per share annual target range through 2027. It boasts strong growth prospects beyond that, powered by the accelerating demand for renewable energy for things like electric vehicles and data centers. These investments should boost its earnings while reducing its emissions, producing a win-win outcome for shareholders and the planet.

Capital
Capital is any type of asset that you can use to generate future value, including cash and tangible and intangible assets.
5. Enbridge5. Enbridge
Enbridge (ENB
0.43%) is one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America. It has four core operating segments:Liquids pipelines: It moves 30% of the oil produced in North America.Gas transmission & midstream: Enbridge transports almost 20% of all the gas consumed in the U.S.Gas distribution: It operates North America's largest natural gas utility by customer count.Renewable energy: Enbridge has a diversified renewable energy platform, including a growing European offshore wind business.Enbridge's leading energy infrastructure portfolio generates very stable cash flow backed by long-term contracts and government-regulated rate structures. It significantly enhanced the stability of its earnings profile in 2024 by acquiring three natural gas utilities from Dominion (D
0.48%) in a $14 billion transformational deal that meaningfully increased its gas distribution business. It now gets about half its earnings from liquids pipelines and the other 50% from lower carbon energy (e.g., gas and renewables).
The company distributes 60% to 70% of its steady cash flow to investors via a very attractive dividend. It retains the rest to help finance its continued expansion.The company has a multibillion-dollar backlog of commercially secured expansion projects under construction, giving it lots of visibility into future growth. Enbridge expects its cash flow per share to increase by about 3% per year through 2026 and at a roughly 5% annual rate over the medium term.Enbridge's growing cash flow should allow it to continue increasing its dividend. The company delivered its 30th consecutive annual dividend increase at the end of 2024.
Investing in the energy sectorHow to invest in the energy sectorThe energy sector is a challenging one for investors, especially when it comes to oil and natural gas companies. Energy prices can change in a heartbeat. Volatility can have a massive impact on the sector, as well as on the global economy.Because of the impact commodity price volatility can have on the energy sector, investors need to understand how to invest in energy stocks. That includes keeping risks in mind and not allocating too much of a portfolio to one energy stock or the entire industry. Investors should focus on oil and natural gas companies with the financial and operational strength to survive if industry conditions significantly deteriorate.
Factors that increase an energy company's durability include:A low-risk business model: For oil and natural gas producers, this means having diversified operations and low production costs. Meanwhile, energy infrastructure companies should have stable revenue with minimal exposure to fluctuations in volumes or pricing, such as operations supported by regulated rates or long-term fixed-fee contracts.A strong financial profile: Balance sheet factors to consider are a high investment-grade credit rating, lots of liquidity (cash on hand and borrowing capacity), and minimal near-term debt maturities. In addition, an energy company should have a conservative dividend payout ratio compared to its peers.Manageable capital spending programs primarily financed with post-dividend free cash flow and prudent use of debt.Energy companies with these characteristics will be in a better position to withstand the inevitable cyclical downturns. That means they will still be around when market conditions improve. They will also have more flexibility than their weaker peers to capture opportunities that can create value for their investors.
