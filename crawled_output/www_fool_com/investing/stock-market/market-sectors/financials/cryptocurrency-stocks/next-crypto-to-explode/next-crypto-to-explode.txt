Key Points
Bitcoin surged to more than $100,000, adding $1.2 trillion to its market cap.
Solana, known for high-speed transactions, competes strongly with Ethereum.
Chainlink partnered with the U.S. to integrate government data into blockchain.
Investor Alert: Our 10 best stocks to buy right now â€º
Key findings are powered by ChatGPT and based solely off the content from this article. Findings are reviewed by our editorial team. The author and editors take ultimate responsibility for the content.
The most exciting thing about cryptocurrency investments is how they can skyrocket in value. Last year, market leader Bitcoin (BTC
-2.65%) added $1.2 trillion to its market cap and surged past $100,000. Because of the massive potential returns, every investor wants to find the next cryptocurrency to explode.

Of course, the volatility of cryptocurrency can work for you or against you. Prices can fall just as quickly. It's also impossible to know which cryptocurrency will go on a hot streak next.However, we can pick out some possible candidates capitalizing on current trends, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and digital asset trading. Our list includes a mix of established and newer coins, depending on your risk appetite.
Definition Icon
Decentralized Application (dApp)
A software application that runs on a blockchain or peer-to-peer network, without a central authority.
Explosive cryptosFive cryptocurrencies to explode in 2025Here are the cryptocurrencies that could be due for a significant bull run:Curriences 1-21. Solana
Solana (SOL
-5.19%) is a blockchain platform with smart contract capabilities and one of the biggest competitors to Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH). It's famous for its blazing-fast speeds and transaction fees that cost a fraction of a cent.Since Solana can run smart contracts, it has a wide range of use cases, including decentralized finance (DeFi) services and, more recently, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). It's also a popular place to launch meme coins -- for example, Official Trump (TRUMP
-1.13%) is a Solana-based token.
Ethereum is stiff competition, but Solana's speed advantage makes it an excellent alternative. It processes thousands of transactions per second (tps) and is capable of up to 65,000, thanks to its unique proof-of-history validation method. Based on that, and Solana's low fees, it's the next big crypto that could deliver rapid growth.
2. Superintelligence Alliance
Superintelligence Alliance (ASI
-8.69%) is a merger of three popular AI cryptos: SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol. Its goal is to build an open-source blockchain platform for artificial intelligence (AI) research and development. Participants can lend computing power to support AI model training in exchange for crypto tokens.The AI boom has been one of cryptocurrency's most exciting recent technological developments. Superintelligence Alliance is a very high-risk investment, but it could capitalize on that development, especially as the number of companies using AI continues to grow. It plans to leverage:SingularityNET's AI development and integrationFetch.ai's advanced autonomous AI agents that handle real-world tasks for usersOcean Protocol's data sharing and monetization
Currencies 3-43. Chainlink
On their own, blockchains are disconnected from the world and don't have access to real-world data. Chainlink (LINK
-3.34%) bridges the gap, serving as an oracle platform that provides the infrastructure to let blockchains securely access external data.Tokenized RWAs are an example of why this matters. Several blockchains now have tokenized versions of stocks and other assets. For tokenized RWAs to work, the blockchain needs data from the outside world on the current values of those assets.
Chainlink scored a big win in August 2025 when it began working with the U.S. Department of Commerce to bring government economic data to public blockchains. It's a clear sign that Chainlink is the oracle platform of choice and will serve a crucial role in the future of the crypto market.4. TRON
TRON (TRX
-0.16%) is another smart contract blockchain, and it was founded by businessman Justin Sun. Sun previously worked at Ripple, the company behind XRP (XRP
-3.96%), another successful cryptocurrency.
Definition Icon
Smart Contracts
Programs written on the blockchain that self-execute when certain conditions are met.
One of the big selling points with TRON right now is its massive stablecoin supply. Stablecoins, which are crypto tokens pegged to the value of another asset, have been growing rapidly in popularity. TRON's stablecoin supply is second only to Ethereum, and in some regions, it has more stablecoin activity than Ethereum.TRON is also a top blockchain in terms of activity. It has more than 2.5 million daily active addresses, ranking third in that category, and it has processed over 11 billion transactions total. TRON's activity levels and role in the stablecoin market make it a dark horse candidate to take off.
Currency 55. Aave
Aave (AAVE
-1.52%) is a DeFi protocol and lending platform that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency. Everything is done with smart contracts, so no intermediary is required. Users can earn interest on the digital assets they lend.Aave has liquidity pools for many popular cryptocurrencies, such as Tether (USDT
0.04%) and Dai (DAI
0.36%). One reason Aave could be a long-term winner is that in addition to crypto lending, it has expanded into real-world assets by partnering with Centrifuge.
As part of that partnership, Aave has built an RWA market that allows companies to tokenize parts of their businesses. Investors can buy tokens offered by those businesses, and the issuers of the tokens can then borrow stablecoins against their assets.Related investing topics

Is Cryptocurrency a Good Investment?
Investing in virtual currency has produced jaw-dropping returns for some, but the field still presents risks.
What Gives Bitcoin Value?
Ever wonder why some crypto is more valuable than others? We break down some of the factors.
Should I invest?Should you consider investing in the next crypto that explodes?It's tempting to try finding that next big cryptocurrency. Even though you could see incredible returns this way, there are a few serious downsides:It's extremely risky. Most cryptocurrencies don't succeed. CoinGecko research found that more than 50% of cryptocurrencies have stopped trading, and even the ones that stick around often go through steep declines. Small cryptocurrencies have more growth potential, but they're also more likely to fail.It's time-consuming. You need to spend quite a bit of time reviewing cryptocurrencies to make educated investments. Otherwise, you're throwing darts at the wall.The crypto market is highly unpredictable. Your carefully researched investment could go nowhere, while a practically useless cryptocurrency goes to the moon just because it has Shiba Inu (CRYPTO:SHIB) or Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) in its name.Following cryptocurrency trends or trying to predict them isn't a good investment strategy. There's nothing wrong with giving it a shot, but keep your expectations -- and the amount you invest -- very low. You might also want to put some of your money into cryptocurrency stocks or large-cap coins to balance out the risk.
