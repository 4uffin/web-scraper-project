Behind every AI breakthrough are the companies making the chips, building the platforms, and monitoring the systems.
Artificial intelligence (AI) may be the story of the decade, but the smartest money isn't chasing chatbot stocks. It's backing the companies that make AI possible: the foundries producing the chips, the platforms deploying the models, and the software keeping it all running.
Think of AI as a huge construction project. You need the raw materials, the builders who know how to use them, and the inspectors making sure nothing collapses. The market has been so obsessed with the architects' drawings that it has overlooked the suppliers getting rich on every project. Here are three companies positioned to profit regardless of which AI applications ultimately dominate.

The chip monopoly
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -1.46%) sits at the center of the AI supply chain. In the second quarter, revenue climbed 39% year over year to $30.1 billion, while net income surged 61%.
Advanced process technologies below 7 nanometers now make up 60% of wafer revenue, up from 52% a year earlier -- a shift that expands margins as demand for cutting-edge chips accelerates.
What makes TSMC formidable isn't just scale but flawless execution. Intel is still racing to catch up, and Samsung is fighting for scraps, while TSMC fabricates the silicon that powers Nvidia's AI leadership.
Its Arizona expansion helps hedge geopolitical risk without sacrificing technical dominance. Taiwan tensions remain the wild card, but investors are paying for manufacturing supremacy, not a speculative story.
The platform play
Meta Platforms (META -1.46%) has turned AI from buzzword into bottom line. In the second quarter, revenue rose 22% year over year to $47.5 billion, powered by AI-driven ad targeting that squeezes more value from each impression. The company is channeling more than $17 billion per quarter into AI infrastructure, an investment made possible by its enormous free cash flow.
Meta's advantage is immediate monetization. While rivals tout AI potential, Meta is already delivering it through better ad matching, smarter content recommendations, and deeper user engagement.
Its billions of users across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp create a flywheel effect: More data improves AI, which improves results, which supports higher ad rates. Emerging bets like Ray-Ban smart glasses and augmented reality remain optional upside rather than core to the thesis.
The pick-and-shovel winner
Datadog (DDOG -0.04%) solves AI's hidden problem: complexity. As companies deploy dozens of AI models across hybrid clouds, someone needs to monitor performance, track costs, and prevent outages. Datadog's observability platform does exactly that, driving 28% revenue growth to $827 million last quarter with $165 million in free cash flow.
The beauty is recurring revenue from essential services. Companies can delay AI experiments, but can't stop monitoring production systems.
With 3,850 customers paying over $100,000 annually, Datadog has pricing power and expansion potential as AI workloads multiply. The stock's valuation is rich at 61 times forward earnings, but you're buying the tollbooth on the AI highway, not another speculative model maker.
The portfolio approach
For conservative investors, Taiwan Semiconductor offers the cleanest exposure to the AI theme: dominant market position, expanding margins, and everyone needs their chips. Meta provides the balanced play with immediate AI monetization, offsetting infrastructure investment. Datadog suits growth investors who are comfortable paying up for recurring software revenue tied to AI expansion.
The smartest approach might be owning all three. TSMC manufactures the foundation, Meta builds the platforms, and Datadog keeps everything running. Together, they capture AI's value chain without betting on which model or application wins.
Because in technology gold rushes, the biggest winners rarely dig for gold. They sell the picks, provide the maps, and control the infrastructure. These three companies have positioned themselves exactly there: profiting from AI's expansion regardless of who strikes it rich.
