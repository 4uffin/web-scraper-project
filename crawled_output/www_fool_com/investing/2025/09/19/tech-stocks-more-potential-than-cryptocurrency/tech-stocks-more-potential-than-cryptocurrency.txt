These companies are standouts in industries that should grow faster than the cryptocurrency market.
At first glance, the returns of the top cryptocurrencies have outperformed those of most stocks. Few investments have matched Bitcoin's 950% gain over the last five years, for example, and its growth over a longer time horizon has been even more remarkable.
Nonetheless, most seasoned investors know that past performance is no guarantee of similar results in the future. For the cryptocurrency space generally, the analysts at Grand View Research forecast a compound annual growth rate of 13% through 2030. Although that would amount to significant growth, it's not a prediction that digital currencies will outperform all other investment types over the next five years.
In my view, these three tech stocks are in strong positions to outperform their crypto counterparts over that time span.

1. Nvidia
Those in search of promising investments today should first look to the AI accelerator leader Nvidia (NVDA -1.92%). Grand View Research predicts a 29% compound annual growth rate for the artificial intelligence (AI) chip industry through 2030. That is significantly faster than the cryptocurrency market, and given Nvidia's dominance of the space, one cannot dismiss its growth potential.
In its fiscal 2026 second quarter, which ended July 27, 88% of the company's revenue came from its data center segment, which designs its AI accelerators. Even as more competing chips emerge to threaten its position, Nvidia continues to control 94% of this market, according to Jon Peddie Research.
In its fiscal Q2, Nvidia's revenue grew by 56% year over year, and it forecasts a 54% increase in fiscal Q3. Even if its top-line growth decelerates further in subsequent quarters, it will likely outpace Grand View's estimates for the overall industry for some time to come.
Additionally, despite the stock's growth of over 1,350% over the last five years, it trades today at a P/E ratio of 51, a low level for such a rapidly growing stock. Hence, even if one thinks the stock has risen too far too fast, the company's earnings and sales growth levels and its relatively low valuation make it highly likely the stock will outpace the average cryptocurrency.
2. Sea Limited
Sea Limited (SE -2.54%) is often described as Southeast Asia's equivalent of Amazon. The company operates e-commerce service Shopee and fintech giant Monee in its home region, and its gaming unit, Garena, is the designer behind Free Fire, the world's most popular mobile game as measured by average daily active users in 2024.
Again, the compound annual growth rates stand out for these segments. According to Grand View Research's forecast, e-commerce in the Asia-Pacific region will grow at a compound annual rate ofÂ  20% through 2030, and fintech's growth there will outpace the 18% annualized rate it predicts globally. Meanwhile, the 13% compound annual growth rate it predicts for the Asia-Pacific gaming market would keep pace with the expected growth rate for cryptocurrency.
In that context, investors shouldn't be surprised that Sea Limited grew its revenue by 38% in the second quarter. While its e-commerce and gaming segments have struggled in past quarters, its logistics investments have helped bolster Shopee's No. 1 market share in its home region. Plus, the revival of the Free Fire franchise -- and the lifting this year of India's 2022 ban on the game -- have become tailwinds for Garena.
Admittedly, Monee's enduring strength and the massive rise in Sea's stock price helped lift its P/E ratio to a lofty 99. Still, with a forward P/E ratio of 51, investors remain well-positioned to benefit from Sea Limited's recovery, increasing the odds it will produce stronger returns than the digital currency market.
3. Reddit
Grand View projects that the social media market will grow at a 26% compound annual rate through 2030. Those looking for even better results might want to consider a well-established company in the space that only went public relatively recently: Reddit (RDDT -4.24%).
Reddit stands out from sites like Meta Platforms' Facebook by helping its users form "communities" -- over 100,000 so far, catering to more than 110 million daily active users. That is more than enough to support a robust digital ad business.
Amid Reddit's still-rising popularity, its revenue grew 78% year over year in the second quarter. Although such growth rates are not sustainable, the company's revenue guidance for Q3 is for 55% growth at the midpoint of the range, so it's likely to outpace its industry's growth for the foreseeable future.
Because it only recently transitioned to profitability, its P/E ratio (215) is a poor choice for gauging its valuation. And even its forward P/E ratio of 64 indicates that it's not a cheap stock.
However, its rapid revenue and stock price growth may persuade investors to overlook those earnings metrics. So Reddit could still be in a position to deliver cryptocurrency-beating returns for the foreseeable future.
