Prediction: 3 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now
By Keithen Drury

Key Points
Alphabet already generates more net income than Apple.
Cloud computing demand will drive Amazon's stock higher.
Broadcom's rise in artificial intelligence (AI) computing makes it a must-own stock.

There are far better places to invest than in Apple stock.
Apple (AAPL 0.27%) is the world's third-largest company, valued at $3.4 trillion at the time of writing. Its dominant consumer tech brand has been a market leader for nearly two decades, but there hasn't been a ton of growth in this sector recently. This has led to slow growth from Apple alongside an expensive stock price.
There are far more attractive investment options available, and I believe there are three stocks that can surpass Apple's market cap by 2030. This trio is made up of Alphabet (GOOG -0.72%) (GOOGL -0.73%), Amazon (AMZN -1.20%), and Broadcom (AVGO -3.93%).
All three are worthy investments, and I think they can easily outperform Apple and the rest of the market along the way.

This trio has AI upside that Apple does not
To say that Apple has stumbled in its artificial intelligence (AI) rollout is an understatement. Apple is far behind its competitors in this sector, and it may lose some smartphone market share if it doesn't quickly correct its course. While there hasn't been a defining AI feature that separates Apple from others quite yet, it may be on the horizon and could cause significant headwinds for Apple.
This trio is openly embracing the AI arms race, unlike Apple.
Alphabet is the parent company of Google, which has already evolved its search engine to include AI search overviews: integrated generative AI alongside a traditional search experience. It also has a leading generative AI model Gemini, which continues to perform quite favorably compared to other generative AI models that outperformed it at the start of the AI arms race.
Alphabet is also profiting from massive AI build-out thanks to its cloud computing division, Google Cloud. Alphabet is renting its computing capacity out to many AI companies, including OpenAI and Meta Platforms, causing impressive growth for this division.
Amazon is in a similar boat to Alphabet, as its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is also experiencing massive demand for AI. AWS is a significant part of Amazon's business, accounting for 53% of total operating profits despite comprising just 18% of total sales. AWS grew revenue 17% year over year in Q2, and while that's not nearly as fast as Google Cloud's 32%, AWS is also a much larger business, so achieving rapid growth rates is challenging. Still, there are significant tailwinds blowing in favor of cloud computing, and Amazon is well positioned to benefit.
Lastly is Broadcom, which has a long way to go to overcome Apple's head start. Its $1.7 trillion market cap is about half of Apple's, but it has the biggest growth tailwind of these businesses. Broadcom is heavily involved in the computing side of the AI arms race, manufacturing networking switches (which are necessary to stitch together information across multiprocessor devices) and custom AI chips.
Broadcom is working with end users (like Alphabet's Google Cloud) to design purpose-built computing hardware. This eliminates the middleman and enables them to tailor the chips to specific workloads, rather than relying on a broad computing device like a GPU. Broadcom's revenue is rapidly accelerating, and it could easily overtake Apple over the next few years.
What is required to overtake Apple?
Each company has a different way to overtake Apple's valuation. For Alphabet, it's simple: Be on a level playing field. Alphabet generates more net income than Apple does already, so if these two had the exact same valuation, Alphabet would already be worth more.
AAPL Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts
Considering Alphabet is growing faster and Apple appears to be overvalued, I wouldn't be surprised to see Alphabet pass Apple much quicker than just five years.
Amazon needs to continue growing its profits rapidly, which it's doing thanks to outsized growth from its high-margin divisions (like AWS and advertising services). If Amazon can maintain its impressive operating profit growth rate, it will likely surpass the point where it generates greater profits than Apple.
AAPL Operating Income (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts
Lastly, Broadcom has a steep uphill climb to surpass Apple, but its rapidly growing AI division could do that. In Q3 FY 2025 (ended Aug. 3), Broadcom's AI-related revenue increased 63% year over year to $5.2 billion. That's about a third of Broadcom's total revenue, but if it maintains that growth trajectory, Broadcom can easily outgrow Apple over the next five years to become a larger business.
I think all three stocks can be worth more than Apple by 2030, and each will be a strong investment along the way.
