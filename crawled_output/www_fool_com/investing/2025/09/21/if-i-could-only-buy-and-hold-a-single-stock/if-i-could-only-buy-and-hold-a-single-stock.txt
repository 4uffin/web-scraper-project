If I Could Only Buy and Hold a Single Stock, This Would Be It
By Anders Bylund

Sep 21, 2025 at 7:19PM
Key Points
Amazon operates like multiple companies in one, spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising, AI services, and logistics.
AWS generates massive profits that fund expansion in other divisions.
While no single stock is risk-free, Amazon's multi-industry dominance makes it the closest thing to a one-stock portfolio.

What if you could only own one stock for the rest of your life? This tech giant's unique structure makes it the perfect desert island pick.
It's the classic deserted desert island scenario: I have to pick just one stock that I would buy today and then hold forever. I can't move the goalposts by picking an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and I'm not planning to build a portfolio around this name.
It's just one stock, and it will be my only investment for all time. All alone.
Mind you, I don't recommend actually doing this with real money. Diversification matters, and no stock is absolutely risk-free. This is just a fun little thought experiment.
That being said, I could imagine entrusting my life savings to Amazon (AMZN -0.84%) today. Here's how Jeff Bezos' empire earned this rare honor.
I'm almost cheating -- Amazon is like an ETF in disguise
If I can't diversify my single-stock holding with an ETF, I'll go with a leader across many different industries instead. Amazon fits the bill to perfection:
With $137 billion of second-quarter sales, Amazon is a world-leading e-commerce titan.
The Amazon Web Services (AWS) division didn't exactly invent cloud computing, but it was an early provider in that field and remains a top name today. In the second quarter of 2025, AWS sales landed at $30.9 billion.
Within the AWS envelope, you'll find Amazon in several distinct positions of leadership. AWS is a top choice for artificial intelligence (AI) services, both on the systems training and real-time AI operations sides. Amazon's digital advertising platform proved its worth on September 10 when it won the Netflix (NFLX 0.34%) ad-selling contract in 11 key markets.
The massive e-commerce business requires a world-class shipping infrastructure, and Amazon is reselling these services to other online retailers nowadays.
That's an online shopping portal, the world's largest cloud computing service, top-notch advertising and AI services, and a winning physical logistics business -- all wrapped in a single stock. That's a pretty respectable single-business impersonation of a truly diversified investment portfolio.
When corporate synergy actually works
Amazon's conglomerate structure comes with some unique benefits, too. Let's play some buzzword bingo! Here are a few examples of corporate synergy with material benefits:
AWS started as a little side gig, trying to make some money from the online infrastructure Amazon had installed and wasn't always using. Now, it's the other way around -- any time Amazon's retail business needs a digital tool (web server space, AI support, data analytics, ad-tech innovation...) AWS is the obvious in-house choice.
Profits collected in the incredibly lucrative AWS division can be deployed in other projects. The shipping infrastructure saw massive expansion in the 2020-2022 era, for example. This push would not have been possible without the AWS segment's booming profits.
Amazon's advertising platform benefits from the enormous bank of transaction data in the company's own retail operations.
The Prime customer loyalty program has become the digital glue that holds Amazon's growth drivers together. Come for the free one-day shipping, stay for the award-winning Prime Video shows or the Echo/Alexa smart home system. Or, you know, the other way around.
The Prime directive: Borrowing brilliance from Costco
Speaking of Prime, by the way, that's Amazon borrowing a page out of the Costco Wholesale (COST -0.27%) playbook. Costco's operations would lose money without its membership program. With it, you make Costco shoppers more likely to choose that store (because I'm paying for that precious card anyway) while generating a rich stream of nearly pure profit.
Amazon uses Prime in a similar fashion -- unlocking synergies and collecting profits as a direct result.

Wrapping up this trillion-dollar thought experiment
If you're skipping to the final chapter of my Amazon analysis, here's the short version.
I expect Amazon to remain a business leader for decades to come. It's among the 5 most valuable businesses today, measured by market cap, and I see no reason why that would change in the long run.
This little trillion-dollar stock should serve me well on that hypothetical desert island.
