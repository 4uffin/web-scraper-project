Is XRP a top long-term play in the crypto space?
XRP (XRP 2.57%) has rocketed to the upper valuation echelons of the cryptocurrency world. With a market capitalization of roughly $178 billion, it ranks as the third-largest cryptocurrency by valuation -- trailing behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum.
The cryptocurrency has seen big gains in conjunction with the apparent evaporation of legal and regulatory risk factors, other favorable political developments, and adoption of the token as part of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and cryptocurrency treasury strategies. If you're wondering what's next for XRP, you're in good company.

A half-decade later...
XRP's network offers infrastructure and services for cross-border payments that could help the token continue to gain adoption over the next five years. In addition to the cross-border use case, the cryptocurrency has demonstrated encouraging longevity as a speculative play in the broader crypto space.
While it's impossible to tell exactly what XRP's pricing trajectory over the next five years will look like, I believe there are good reasons to think that it will be one of the top performers among leading cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum have managed to maintain strong first-place and second-place positioning when it comes to valuations in the crypto market, and it wouldn't be surprising to see XRP to settle into a solidified third-place positioning -- or even challenge Ethereum in terms of market cap at some point within the next half-decade.
