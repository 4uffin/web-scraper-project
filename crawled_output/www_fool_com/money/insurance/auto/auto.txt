Why do you need auto insurance?Auto insurance is the only thing standing between many drivers and financial ruin. The average motor vehicle accident costs $7,500 in property damage. If someone is injured, that amount jumps to more than $61,000. And if someone is killed in a motor vehicle accident, you're looking at more than $1.1 million. It takes a split second to change your life, and if you're not adequately insured, you could spend years paying damages. Auto insurance is a relatively inexpensive way to guard against financial ruin due to an accident.Our best car insurance picksBefore you commit to an auto insurance policy, take a look at our lists of some of the best options out there:
