Expert insights on CD rates
The Federal Reserve reduced the target for the fed funds rate in September of 2025, and more cuts are expected.One way to lock in current rates is through a certificate of deposit (CD). They're particularly attractive for money you know you'll need at a certain time in the near future, such as a down payment for a home or retirement income a few months or years from now.Since a CD won't lose value, the money is protected from the ups and downs of the bond and stock markets. If the characteristics of a CD sound appropriate for your situation, don't wait; the Federal Reserve is expected to continue cutting rates.-Robert Brokamp, Certified Financial Planner® and Senior Advisor at The Motley Fool

How to choose the best CD for you
Not all CDs are created equal, and the best one for you depends on a few key factors. Here's what to keep in mind before you lock in your cash:APY (annual percentage yield): The golden number. The higher the APY, the more your money grows -- simple as that. But don't just chase the highest rate. Make sure the term length, deposit requirements, and the bank itself align with your needs.Term length: How long can you live without touching this money? CD terms range from a few months to several years, and once your cash is in, it's staying put. If you think you might need access sooner, opt for a shorter term or look into a high-yield savings account instead.Minimum deposit requirements: Some CDs let you start with just a few bucks, while others require a hefty upfront investment. Generally, higher deposits unlock better rates, but don't stretch yourself too thin. Find a sweet spot between a solid APY and what you can comfortably invest.Early withdrawal penalties: Life happens. If you suddenly need your money before your CD matures, you'll likely face a penalty -- sometimes a few months' worth of interest, sometimes more. If flexibility is a priority, a no-penalty CD might be a better fit.Bank reputation and FDIC insurance: All the banks on our list are FDIC insured, which means up to $250,000 of your money is protected in case of a bank failure. But remember, some of the highest CD rates come from online-only banks. Do a little homework to make sure you're comfortable with their reputation and customer service before committing.Bottom line? The best CD for you isn't just about the highest rate -- it's about balancing returns, accessibility, and security. Choose wisely, and let your money do the heavy lifting.Keep reading: How Does a CD Work? A Beginner's Guide
Are CDs better than high-yield savings accounts?
Deciding between a CD and a high-yield savings account depends on your financial goals. Both are solid options, but each offers unique benefits.What's the difference?A high-yield savings account offers flexibility -- you can deposit and withdraw funds at any time, with a higher interest rate than a regular savings account. A CD locks your money away for a set period, usually offering a better rate in return. The downside? You can't access your funds without penalties until the term ends.Which one's right for you?A high-yield savings account is best for flexibility, allowing easy access to your funds without penalties.A CD is ideal if you're okay with locking your money up for a fixed term to earn a higher interest rate.Both have their perks. If you want higher returns and can commit your cash for a while, a CD is the way to go. If you need flexibility and want to keep your options open, a high-yield savings account is a solid choice. It all comes down to how much access you need to your money.Decided you'd rather have a high-yield savings account? See our favorite HYSAs here.
How to open a CD account in five steps
Opening a CD is simple and can be done in just a few steps. Here's how.1. Compare CD rates and termsFirst things first, shop around to find the best APY. Look for a rate that matches your financial goals, whether you're in it for a short-term (6-12 months) or long-term (3-5 years) commitment. The longer the term, the higher the rate, generally.Make sure to check the minimum deposit requirements and any early withdrawal penalties -- you don't want to get stuck if life throws you a curveball.2. Choose a bank or credit unionNext, you'll need to decide where to open your CD. Online banks tend to offer better rates because they don't have the overhead costs of physical branches. If you're more comfortable with in-person service, a traditional bank or credit union might be your jam. Either way, make sure the bank you choose is reliable and gives you the customer support you need.3. Apply online or in-personWhen you've picked the bank, it's time to apply. If you're going the online route, the process is quick and easy -- no need to leave your couch. But if you prefer a little face-to-face interaction, visit a branch and get help with your application in person. You'll need to provide some personal details, like your ID and contact info, to get the ball rolling.4. Fund your CDOnce you're approved, it's time to fund your CD. You'll need to deposit the required amount -- either by transferring funds from an existing account or writing a check. Make sure you meet the minimum deposit to kick off your CD.5. Monitor maturity dates and renewal optionsAfter your CD is up and running, keep track of the maturity date. When your term ends, you'll need to decide whether you want to withdraw your cash, roll it over into a new CD, or transfer it to another account. Some banks will auto-renew your CD, so it's a good idea to check in before that happens to make sure you're still getting the best deal.

FAQs
Are CD rates expected to go up in 2025?
While it's hard to predict exact movements, CD rates generally follow the trends of the Federal Reserve. If rates continue to fall in 2025, you'll likely see CDs offer lower rates as well.
Can I withdraw money early from a CD?
You can withdraw money early from a CD, but most banks will charge an early withdrawal penalty -- usually a few months' worth of interest.
What happens when my CD matures?
When your CD matures, you can either withdraw the funds, roll them over into a new CD, or transfer them to another account. Some banks may auto-renew your CD at the current rate.
