Savings FAQs
Most Americans are still earning pennies in a typical savings account. But the best high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) today are paying 20x to 30x more -- with zero risk and no fees.I've personally earned thousands in interest over the past few years just by moving my money into an HYSA. And right now, rates are still near their peak, but that may not last much longer. With potential Fed rate cuts on the horizon, now's a great time to lock in a top-tier yield.Our expert team has spent over 100 hours researching, reviewing, and testing the best options available. Here are the top picks for high-yield savings accounts to help you make the most of your money.

Expert insights on savings rates
The Federal Reserve reduced the target for the fed funds rate in September, November, and December of 2024. While they've held rates steady so far in 2025, many expect cuts to resume later in the next few months, which could lead to lower yields on high-yield savings accounts.Even so, these accounts remain a smart place to keep money you want protected from the ups and downs of the stock and bond markets. Cash doesn't lose value, and most high-yield savings accounts are FDIC insured up to $250,000 per account type.They're called "high-yield" savings accounts for a reason. Regardless of what the Fed does next, these accounts typically offer higher returns than most standard checking or savings options.-Robert Brokamp, Certified Financial Planner® and Senior Advisor at The Motley Fool

Bottom Line
For those who plan to set up direct deposit with their new account, we think SoFi Checking and Savings (Member FDIC) is hard to beat. Not only does this savings account offer a strong APY, but the linked checking account earns an above-average rate, too -- which is a rare perk. Plus, new customers earn a bonus of up to $300 with eligible direct deposit. Frankly, it's the kind of combo that could make it worthwhile to switch banking relationships.

Why I like it: SoFi® has a way of winning people over. You might come for the high annual percentage yield (APY), but many end up switching their everyday banking here too. With no account fees, helpful savings tools, and a super clean app, it just makes managing money easy.And right now, there's a limited-time offer available: Earn up to $300 and +0.70% Boost on Savings APY with direct deposit. Terms apply.What you should know: To unlock the best perks and highest APY, you'll need to set up direct deposit. SoFi® automatically opens both a checking and savings account, so you can move money between spending and saving without skipping a beat.
First-hand review from one of our employees who uses SoFi Checking and Savings (Member FDIC) personally:
"I was interested in an online bank since I'd seen that a lot of them offered higher APYs than traditional banks. We chose to go with SoFi® because it offered some of the highest rates and had good reviews. Overall, it has been a good fit for us. Transfers are seamless, and the app is easy to navigate and keep track of activity with."-Liz Wilson, Software Developer

There are no monthly fees, no minimums, and the account is refreshingly easy to use.

Capital One 360 Performance Savings checks all the boxes we look for in a high-yield savings account. It even offers branch locations and Capital One Cafes where customers can seek in-person support (if you live near one). This makes it a great fit when you want to reap the rewards of online banking but aren't quite ready to cut ties with brick-and-mortar banks.
Read Full Review
Why I like it: What sets this bank apart is the availability of branch locations and full-service banking support. It just adds a nice layer of convenience rarely found with high-yield savings accounts.What you should know: While the account offers branch access, this perk is only useful if you live near a Capital One location -- otherwise, in-person banking isn't an option. Make sure to check that before deciding if this is right for you.
First-hand review from one of our employees who uses Capital One 360 Performance Savings personally:
"My family and I have enjoyed the convenience of banking with Capital One overall. The accounts are easy to use, the interface is simple, money moves quickly, and while savings rates aren't top of the market, they're much higher than mainline banks."-Matt Koppenheffer, Coverage Team Lead

Why I like it: If you've got a balance over $250,000, you'll be in the top tier earning the highest APY. But the good news is all other tiers still earn a solid 3.90% APY -- one of the highest on our list.Plus, there are no monthly fees or balance requirements to worry about. Everybody wins, no matter your balance.What you should know: There's no debit card or checking account available at Barclays. And since money transfers can take a couple days to process, it's better suited for money you're setting aside for longer-term goals.

Why I like it: This account has one of the highest APYs on the page, provided you can meet the $250 monthly deposit requirement. It's easy to open, easy to use, and there are no monthly fees.What you should know: LendingClub gives you a debit card connected to your savings account, which is quite rare. Also, it covers ATM fees! Outbound transfers are unlimited, but daily limits may apply depending on your banking status. This is a non-issue for most people, but something to note nonetheless.
First-hand review from one of our employees who uses LendingClub LevelUp Savings personally:
"I've had a LendingClub HYSA for three years. They do a great job of assuring me my money is safe despite being an online-only bank. Good communication about my APY, an easy-to-use app, and an ATM card that gives me the option to withdraw if I ever need to. Plus, I've been really pleased with the above-average APY."-Brooklyn Sprunger, Content Manager

EverBank Performance℠ Savings is unavailable on Motley Fool Money. All information was collected independently and not reviewed for accuracy or provided by the issuer. Some items may be out of date.
Why I like it: EverBank may not be a household name (unless you live in Florida, where it has some branch locations) but it offers one of the highest APYs available right now. This is a no-frills, high-yield account that's built for savers who want to maximize interest above all else.What you should know: There's no minimum deposit or monthly contribution needed to earn the top APY. Even though EverBank may not be a household name, it's FDIC insured and a trustworthy place to store and grow your money.
How to open a high-yield savings accountOpening an account is fast, easy, and can usually be done entirely online. Most applications take less than 10 minutes.What you'll need to apply:Government-issued ID (like a driver's license or passport)Social Security numberCurrent addressExternal bank account details (to fund your new account)If you're opening a joint savings account, both people will need to provide this info.Pro tip: Many banks offer a welcome bonus or top APY only when you set up direct deposit -- so that's worth doing immediately after sign-up. Just take note of your new account number and bank routing details and provide it when needed for direct deposit.What to know about savings accountsWith a savings account, your bank pays you interest on your money -- usually every month. How much interest you earn is determined by the account's annual percentage yield (APY). You'll earn more interest with an account that has a high APY, but what is a good APY? Understanding what qualifies as a competitive rate can help you maximize your earnings.The best online savings accounts offer both convenience and high interest rates. A larger balance or a higher savings account interest rate results in more interest.It's always good to compare savings account interest rates before opening an account. The best savings account interest rates can add a nice bump in your funds without much effort on your part.Pros and cons of savings accountsThere are advantages and disadvantages that come along with savings accounts. It's important to consider these factors when you're looking for the best savings account for your lifestyle.
ProsEarning interestSaving as much as you likePaying bills with automatic bill payKnowing your money is insured with the FDIC
ConsMonthly maintenance fees (sometimes)No ATM card or checks (usually)Fees for extra withdrawals after your first six withdrawals at some banks
Are high-yield savings accounts safe?Yes, high-yield savings accounts are safe -- as long as the bank is FDIC insured. This federal protection guarantees your deposits up to $250,000 per account type, even if the bank were to fail. Many online banks offer high-yield savings accounts with competitive rates, but you might be wondering: Are online banks safe? The good news is that reputable online banks follow the same security standards as traditional banks, including FDIC insurance and strong encryption protocols.If you're looking for extra peace of mind, you might also consider banking with one of the safest banks, which have strong financial stability and customer protections in place.
Compare types of savings accountsAs you compare savings accounts, think about what you'll use the account for.Do you want to be able to withdraw your money at any time to cover unexpected expenses?Are you saving up for a major goal over several years, and could use every dollar of interest you can earn?Answering these questions will help you compare and decide which savings account is best for you.Here's a look at the common types of savings accounts you'll run into.Traditional savings account: These accounts are usually easy to open and easy to access. But APYs tend to be pretty low, and most of these accounts carry maintenance fees if your balance falls below a certain amount.High-yield savings account: These are similar to traditional savings accounts, but they offer much higher APYs and most don't have monthly maintenance fees.Money market account: Money market accounts offer the APYs of a savings account with the easier access of a checking account. However, these accounts usually have higher minimum balance requirements than typical savings accounts.Certificate of deposit (CD) account: Certificates of deposit (CDs) can sometimes offer higher APYs than even the top high-yield savings accounts. If you're looking for the best APY on a savings account, CDs are definitely worth considering. But you have to agree not to withdraw your funds for the full CD term (which could be months or years).Specialty savings account: A specialty savings account is a savings account that's geared at a certain group of people or goals. Examples include kids' savings accounts, health saving accounts, and education savings accounts.

FAQs
What is a high-yield savings account?
A high-yield savings account (HYSA) is a savings account that offers a much higher annual percentage yield (APY) than average and is usually (but not always) offered by an online-based financial institution.
What should I look for in a high-yield savings account?
Here are a few things to look for in a HYSA:High APY: The top savings accounts should include a high APY in range with our picks.No monthly maintenance fee: Most of the best savings accounts won't charge a monthly maintenance fee.FDIC insurance: Whether you're putting money aside to build an emergency fund or wanting to earn more interest, security is important.
How much money should you keep in a high-yield savings account?
A high-yield savings account is a great place to keep your emergency fund, as well as funds for any short-term savings goals (like a vacation or a down payment to purchase a home).
