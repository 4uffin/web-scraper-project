Brokerage Reviews
Personally, I use two different brokers. One is where I keep my long-term accounts (like Roth IRA, traditional IRA, and brokerage) for a passive "set-and-forget" system. The other I use for more active trading and money moves, like dabbling in individual stocks or ETFs.Each broker has its strengths, and the best fit really depends on your investing style.At The Motley Fool, we've spent over 30 years helping investors make smarter financial decisions. And our brokerage picks are based on hundreds of hours of hands-on research, not affiliate deals.Here's our curated list of the best brokers and trading platforms for September 2025.

Why it made our list: Charles Schwab is one of the best platforms out there for low-cost investing -- especially if you're into ETFs and index funds. Its own lineup of Schwab-branded ETFs rivals big names like Vanguard and Fidelity on fees, making it a smart pick for cost-conscious investors.But Schwab's appeal goes beyond just trades. You can open checking accounts, CDs, credit cards, and even swing by one of 300+ physical branches if you ever want help in person. It's a great all-in-one option for anyone who wants to invest and manage their money under one roof.
First-hand review from one of our employees who uses Charles Schwab personally:
"I opened my Charles Schwab account as a brand-new investor who knew almost nothing about investing, and I've learned a lot through the educational resources available. While the website isn't the most modern, it's easy to use. I've spent a good amount of time using their customer service support as well as a Schwab Financial Consultant and both have been tremendously helpful."-Brooklyn Sprunger, Content Lead here at Motley Fool Money

Why it made our list: Vanguard is a retirement-focused broker that's beloved by investors with a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy. If you're looking for a platform that aligns with this philosophy, Vanguard's simple and user-friendly interface makes it an excellent choice.

Vanguard's own suite of mutual funds is known for offering some of the lowest expense ratios in the industry, and it also gives you access to thousands of no-transaction-fee funds from other firms.For investors who prefer a more passive investing approach and are focused on affordability and long-term growth, Vanguard is one of the best platforms to consider.

It combines powerful charts, a customizable interface, and $0 commissions -- all within a mobile app. For those who want to get fancy with their trades from their phone, Webull is tough to beat.One of its standout features is the lack of options contract fees -- a rarity in the industry, as most brokers charge per-contract fees for options.

If you're looking for a feature-rich platform that doesn't break the bank, Webull is definitely worth a look.
First-hand review from one of our employees who uses Webull personally:
"I've had my Webull trading account for three years and primarily did my trading using my mobile device. I love that the app allows you to check your individual account's risk level based on your investments. Trading isn't too complicated on it, but beyond the risk assessment component, it was pretty similar to other platforms I've used. It could be worthwhile for people seeking to buy OTC and fractional shares."-Sharice Wells, Editor here at The Motley Fool

What to consider when choosing a brokerageAs you read through and compare brokerage features, think about how you plan to invest and what tools you actually need.Some platforms are packed with features. But if you never use any of those advanced bells and whistles, maybe it's simpler to stick with a basic option with low fees.Here are a few things to consider:Starting small? Look for brokers with no minimum deposit and fractional shares so you can invest with just a few bucks.Just want to buy and hold? A basic discount broker will likely cover everything you need.Planning to invest in mutual funds, bonds, or options? Not all platforms support these -- and fees can vary -- so be sure to compare.Need human help or branch access? Some brokers offer phone support and in-person locations, but many don't.Most investors don't need super advanced features -- but if you do, it's worth choosing a broker that fits your style from day one.
Step-by-step: How to open a brokerage accountOpening a brokerage account is just like opening a regular bank account or applying for a credit card.It's a simple online form which usually takes five to 10 minutes to fill out. Super easy!Here's a quick overview:Compare brokers based on your goalsChoose your account type (individual, joint, IRA, etc.)Apply online -- you'll need your SSN and some basic info to get set upFund your account -- You can "link" your existing bank account so that you can transfer money back and forth. There are other funding options but bank transfers are the most common method.Start investing! Once the funds land in your new brokerage account, you're ready to put that money into investments.Most brokers let you open an account for free, and many don't require an initial deposit. If your broker offers fractional shares, you can start with just a few bucks.
What you can invest inThere are a ton of options when it comes to investing -- but not all platforms support everything.Here's what to look for:Stocks & ETFs: These are the go-to for most investors. Stocks offer ownership in companies, while ETFs bundle assets for instant diversification. Nearly all discount brokers offer commission-free trading on both.Mutual funds: If you want a hands-off approach, mutual funds can be a solid choice. Look for brokers that offer no-transaction-fee (NTF) funds to avoid extra costs.Bonds: Bonds offer steady income and lower risk, but not every broker has a strong bond marketplace -- so check if that's part of your strategy.Options: If you're interested in more advanced strategies, make sure your broker offers low-cost options trading and some solid educational support.Some platforms also let you access alternative investments -- like crypto, venture funds, or even music royalties. These are more niche, but growing in popularity.
Safety and protectionsYour brokerage account is generally safe. But it's important to understand the limits.SIPC protection: Covers up to $500,000 if the broker fails (including $250,000 for cash)Fraud protection: Most brokers offer account protection if your login gets compromised (as long as you report it quickly)That being said, you are 100% on the hook for investment losses. Take your time, study your investments wisely, and be patient. The market will have ups and downs, but a well-thought-out plan and long-term mindset can make all the difference.
Discount brokers vs. full-service platformsMany of the top platforms today are low-cost and self-directed (you're the one calling the shots on your investments). But they vary widely in how much support, service, and flexibility they offer.Old-school firms like Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard have been around for decades. They offer robust tools, strong customer service, and the option to manage everything -- from retirement accounts to checking and credit cards -- all under one roof.New-school platforms like Robinhood and SoFi® lean into simplicity. They're mobile-first, fee-light, and often include access to newer features like crypto trading, fractional shares, and slick app experiences. These are especially appealing if you're just starting out or want a more streamlined way to invest on the go.

FAQs
Which is the best trading platform with the lowest fees?
Most online brokers don't charge commissions for online stock trades. However, there may be commissions for other types of investments like mutual funds and options, and brokers have their own fee schedules for various other services. The best pick for you depends on what services and investments you anticipate using the most.
How can I diversify with little money?
Thanks to zero-commission online stock trading and many brokerage firms offering fractional shares, it's easier than ever to diversify your investments. If your goal is to create a diverse portfolio of individual stocks without a large upfront capital commitment, be sure the broker you choose has both of these features.
Is my money insured?
Yes. If your account is with a brokerage firm that is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), cash and securities in your account are protected from loss due to broker failure, up to $500,000 ($250,000 for cash). However, your money is not insured against losses that result from declines in value of the investments in your account.
What type of brokerage account should I choose?
This depends on your goals. If you simply want the best platform to buy and sell stocks, a standard (taxable) brokerage account could be the best choice for you. If you want to save for retirement and/or reduce your taxes, a retirement account like a traditional or Roth IRA might be better. There are other specialized brokerage account types as well, and you can usually find a list of the types offered on your broker's website.
What is the safest online broker?
There's no broker that is inherently safer than all the rest, but there are some important things to look for. First, make sure your broker is covered by SIPC protection, which insures the cash and securities in your account in the event of a broker's failure. Second, make sure your broker has a fraud protection guarantee, which will make you whole in the event that someone hacks into your account and makes unauthorized trades or withdrawals.
