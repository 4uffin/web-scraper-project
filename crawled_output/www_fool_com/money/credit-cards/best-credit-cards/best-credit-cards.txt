This no-frills card is a solid choice if your priority is to avoid credit card interest for as long as possible. It offers an incredible 0% intro APR for 21 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers (16.99%, 23.49%, or 28.74% Variable APR after). The balance transfer fee (5%; $5 min.) is higher than some cards, but if you want an equally long intro APR on purchases and balance transfers, this card is hard to beat.

We think this card has among the highest cash back potential for cards with no annual fee. The key is the Unlimited Cashback Match — Discover automatically matches all the cash back new cardholders have earned at the end of the first year. That cash back can seriously add up when you earn 5% cash back on rotating bonus categories each quarter (when you activate them, up to the quarterly maximum) and 1% on other purchases.

This is one of our favorite cards for balance transfers. It has 0% intro APR for 21 months on balance transfers and a discounted intro balance transfer fee for the first four months. That combo makes it one of the most generous balance transfer offers we’ve seen. But it doesn't have much ongoing value after the intro 0% APR period ends.

This is one of our favorite credit cards — period. The huge 75,000-mile bonus (worth $750 toward travel) is one of the highest we’ve seen for a card with just a $95 annual fee. We love the dead-simple yet lucrative rewards structure: unlimited 2X miles on every purchase you make, plus 5X on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel, and up to a $120 credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck®.Miles are easier to redeem than most travel cards with options like statement credits, travel bookings, or point transfers. Add it all up and it’s easy to see why this is one of the best (and most popular) travel cards available today.

This is one of our favorite cards for balance transfers. It has 0% intro APR for 21 months on balance transfers and a discounted intro balance transfer fee for the first four months. That combo makes it one of the most generous balance transfer offers we’ve seen. But it doesn't have much ongoing value after the intro 0% APR period ends.

Bottom

If you’re looking for a top travel card without an annual fee, this one is tough to beat. It offers a generous welcome bonus worth $250 after spending just $1,000 within 90 days of account opening, plus a simple yet valuable rewards structure: unlimited 1.5X points on all purchases and 3X points on travel booked through Bank of America.A 0% intro APR period of 15 billing cycles for both purchases and balance transfers allows you to avoid interest for over a year – a very rare perk for a travel card. And while many travel cards charge hundreds of dollars in annual fees, this one charges $0 – making it one of our top value picks.

We think this card has among the highest cash back potential for cards with no annual fee. The key is the Unlimited Cashback Match — Discover automatically matches all the cash back new cardholders have earned at the end of the first year. That cash back can seriously add up when you earn 5% cash back on rotating bonus categories each quarter (when you activate them, up to the quarterly maximum) and 1% on other purchases.

This is one of our favorite cards for balance transfers. It has 0% intro APR for 21 months on balance transfers and a discounted intro balance transfer fee for the first four months. That combo makes it one of the most generous balance transfer offers we’ve seen. But it doesn't have much ongoing value after the intro 0% APR period ends.

This is one of our favorite credit cards — period. The huge 75,000-mile bonus (worth $750 toward travel) is one of the highest we’ve seen for a card with just a $95 annual fee. We love the dead-simple yet lucrative rewards structure: unlimited 2X miles on every purchase you make, plus 5X on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel, and up to a $120 credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck®.Miles are easier to redeem than most travel cards with options like statement credits, travel bookings, or point transfers.

How to choose the best credit cardThe perfect credit card for Jack isn't the same one for Jill. Everyone's lifestyle, spending habits and priorities are a little different. So the best cards that match each person are different, too.Here are a few things to reflect on to find your best fit:Your overall goals -- Start here. If you need a balance transfer card, don't get distracted by travel rewards. If you're after simple cash back, focus on cards that actually deliver it.Rewards fit -- Once you know your goal, match it to the right type of rewards (cash back, travel points, or flat-rate for everything cards).Spending habits -- Look at where your money actually goes each month and make sure it aligns with the highest rewards that a card offers.Annual fee -- Higher-fee cards can be worth it, but only if you'll actually use the perks.Intro APR -- Are you planning a large purchase or transferring a balance? Look for a 0% intro APR period that will allow you to accomplish your goals within the intro period.Welcome offer -- Big bonuses can be very lucrative, giving you an immediate return in the first year of ownership.Extra perks -- This could be like purchase protection, airport lounge access, or cellphone insurance.You may find that you need two to three different credit cards to fully cover your goals. And that's totally normal!Credit cards come and go over time, and our lifestyles change constantly. Pick the right card that fits your true lifestyle today, and you can always change later if circumstances shift.Types of best credit cards explainedThere's a reason "best" can mean different things for different people. Here's a quick overview of the categories and general explanation of the cards within them:Best for travel rewards -- Perfect if you've got a vacation itch. You can earn miles or points that are then redeemed for flights, hotels, or even seat upgrades.Best for cash back -- These cards are built to be easy and flexible. Cash back is the easiest redemption method, and you always know the true value of rewards.Best for balance transfers -- If you're carrying debt, a balance transfer to a 0% intro APR card period gives you breathing room to pay it down faster.Best for building credit -- Designed for beginners or rebuilders, these cards help you establish a healthy credit history.Sometimes you'll find cards that shine bright in multiple categories. Like a travel rewards card that also offers a 0% intro APR period. When a card ticks multiple boxes, it can be a real win for your wallet.How many credit cards should you have?This is one of the most common questions we hear.Our research shows that most Americans (56%) have just one or two credit cards. About 13% or people have three cards, and another 13% have four or more cards.The right number for you -- is completely up to you!Some folks do great with just one reliable all-rounder card. Others (like me and my wife) like a "two-card combo." One strong travel rewards card, paired with a workhorse cash back card for everyday spending.What matters most is choosing cards you can manage responsibly. Pay them off in full each month, and you'll get the rewards without the headaches.Tips for getting approvedBefore you hit that "Apply" button, here are a few things to keep in mind. A little prep work can make all the difference:Check your credit score firstMost credit cards list a recommended credit range, so make sure your credit score aligns before applying. You can check your score for free through many banks or credit apps. Or you can get a free credit report at AnnualCreditReport.com, the only site authorized by federal law.While you're at it, it's also worthwhile checking your credit report for errors. Mistakes happen more often than you think, so fixing them can improve your creditworthiness.Don't apply for too many, too fastApplying for multiple credit lines in a short span can raise red flags for issuers. So it's best to space out new credit applications when possible. A good rule of thumb is to only apply for a new credit card every five to six months.Lower your credit utilizationCredit utilization is how much of your available credit you're using. And it's a major factor in how your credit score is made up.Experts recommend keeping your utilization under 30% across all cards. But honestly my recommendation is keeping it under 10% if you can.Paying down your balances before applying for a new card can give your score a noticeable lift which can signal responsible usage.Apply for the right cardChoose a card that truly matches your credit profile. If you're just starting out, a secured or student card may be a better fit than a premium travel card.There are times when "fake it till you make it" is great advice. Applying for a credit card is not one of them.Final thoughtsCredit cards can be powerful tools -- or costly traps. It all comes down to how you use them.If you manage your cards wisely, you'll reap the benefits of valuable rewards, protections, and flexibility that can improve your financial life.Take time to choose the right card, use it responsibly, and stay on top of payments. Rewards await!
FAQs
What's the best credit card overall?
There is no single "best" credit card. Because each card has individual strengths and serves a different purpose.I think a better question to ask is "What's the best credit card for _____?" If you break it down by categories (cash back, travel rewards, balance transfers), it's easier to find the shining stars.Here are our 2025 Award winners in each category!
Do credit cards hurt my credit score?
Not if you use them wisely. In fact, paying your balance in full and on time can actually help improve your credit over time.
Is it better to get cash back or travel rewards?
Cash back is flexible and great for everyday use. Travel rewards can deliver outsized value if you use them strategically. It really comes down to your lifestyle.My opinion is holding both types of card can give you the best of both worlds. If you can handle them wisely, why not get one of each?
