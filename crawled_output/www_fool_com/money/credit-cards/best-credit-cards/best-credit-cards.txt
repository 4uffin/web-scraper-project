Credit Card Reviews
Whether you're chasing cash back, travel rewards, or a 0% intro APR to manage debt, the right credit card can go a long way.Our team has sifted through hundreds of offers to highlight the top picks this month -- the ones that deliver real value where it counts. From generous welcome bonuses to everyday perks, these are the cards we'd recommend to friends, family -- and yes, we use many of them ourselves.
If you're short on time, here's a quick list of some of our favorite cards by category:0% intro APR: We have not come across a card with a longer interest-free period than the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card (see rates and fees), which offers an incredible 0% intro APR period of 21 months from account opening on both purchases and balance transfers. (After the intro period, the go-to 17.24%, 23.74%, or 28.99% Variable APR applies.) You won't get rewards with this card, but it's tough to beat for avoiding interest for the longest possible time – and there is no annual fee. Learn moreCash back: The Discover it® Cash Back offers one of the highest cash back rates that we've seen. And what makes this card especially lucrative is the Unlimited Cashback Match -- Discover automatically matches all of the cash back new cardholders have earned at the end of the first year. Plus, you'll get a solid 15 months of 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers, and all for no annual fee. (After the intro period, the go-to 18.24% - 27.24% Variable APR applies.) There's a 3% intro balance transfer fee, up to 5% fee on future balance transfers (see terms)*. Learn more

This no-frills card is a solid choice if your priority is to avoid credit card interest for as long as possible. It offers an incredible intro APR. The balance transfer fee (5%; $5 min.) is higher than some cards, but if you want an equally long intro APR on purchases, this card is hard to beat.

We think this card has among the highest cash back potential for cards with no annual fee. The key is the Unlimited Cashback Match — Discover automatically matches all the cash back new cardholders have earned at the end of the first year. That cash back can seriously add up when you earn 5% cash back on rotating bonus categories each quarter (when you activate them, up to the quarterly maximum) and 1% on other purchases.

This is one of our favorite cards for balance transfers. It has 0% intro APR for 21 months on balance transfers and a discounted intro balance transfer fee for the first four months. That combo makes it one of the most generous balance transfer offers we’ve seen. But it doesn't have much ongoing value after the intro 0% APR period ends.

This is one of our favorite credit cards — period. The huge 75,000-mile bonus (worth $750 toward travel) is one of the highest we’ve seen for a card with just a $95 annual fee. We love the dead-simple yet lucrative rewards structure: unlimited 2X miles on every purchase you make, plus 5X on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel, and up to a $120 credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck®.Miles are easier to redeem than most travel cards with options like statement credits, travel bookings, or point transfers.

This is one of our favorite cards for balance transfers. It has 0% intro APR for 21 months on balance transfers and a discounted intro balance transfer fee for the first four months. That combo makes it one of the most generous balance transfer offers we’ve seen. But it doesn't have much ongoing value after the intro 0% APR period ends.

Bottom

If you’re looking for a top travel card without an annual fee, this one is tough to beat. It offers a generous welcome bonus worth $250 after spending just $1,000 within 90 days of account opening, plus a simple yet valuable rewards structure: unlimited 1.5X points on all purchases and 3X points on travel booked through Bank of America.A 0% intro APR period of 15 billing cycles for both purchases and balance transfers allows you to avoid interest for over a year – a very rare perk for a travel card. And while many travel cards charge hundreds of dollars in annual fees, this one charges $0 – making it one of our top value picks.

We think this card has among the highest cash back potential for cards with no annual fee. The key is the Unlimited Cashback Match — Discover automatically matches all the cash back new cardholders have earned at the end of the first year. That cash back can seriously add up when you earn 5% cash back on rotating bonus categories each quarter (when you activate them, up to the quarterly maximum) and 1% on other purchases.

This is one of our favorite cards for balance transfers. It has 0% intro APR for 21 months on balance transfers and a discounted intro balance transfer fee for the first four months. That combo makes it one of the most generous balance transfer offers we’ve seen. But it doesn't have much ongoing value after the intro 0% APR period ends.

This is one of our favorite credit cards — period. The huge 75,000-mile bonus (worth $750 toward travel) is one of the highest we’ve seen for a card with just a $95 annual fee. We love the dead-simple yet lucrative rewards structure: unlimited 2X miles on every purchase you make, plus 5X on hotels and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel, and up to a $120 credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck®.Miles are easier to redeem than most travel cards with options like statement credits, travel bookings, or point transfers.

Why trust me
At The Motley Fool, we've spent 30 years demystifying investing and making it easier for people all over the world. At Motley Fool Money, we do the same for credit cards and your personal finances.I've been part of The Motley Fool since 2006, helping our readers make more and save more through investing and their personal finances. I get excited about what most others find dreadfully boring. Specifically, when a credit card says "terms apply," I'm actually reading those terms. All of them. I've been juggling multiple credit cards for decades to maximize rewards, and I've held credit cards on multiple continents.Of the cards we list on this page, I personally currently use or have in the past used some of them (many of my teammates at Motley Fool Money use the others we list).
How to compare credit cardsFigure out the features that are most important to you. This will depend on the type of card you're choosing. Let's say you need a balance transfer card. The features to look at would be the length of each card's balance transfer offer and its balance transfer fees.Check for any annual fees on the cards you're comparing. If you're stuck between two credit cards that work for you, one of them may have a cheaper annual fee.Use secondary features as your tiebreaker. These are the features that aren't quite as important but still have value. Secondary features could include sign-up bonuses or a FICO® Score for free.Read the fine print. All credit cards display common card features in a standardized format. Keep an eye out for the following fees and compare them to other cards: balance transfer, cash advance, late payment, and foreign transaction.Do you need a credit card?Although a credit card isn't a necessity, there are several ways it can help you financially. Our credit card guide could help you learn these important things:Improving credit: The best credit cards can help you build or rebuild your credit. When you use your credit card and pay the bill on time, your credit score will go up. This can help you qualify for financing, such as a car loan or mortgage, at a low interest rate.Earning rewards: With rewards credit cards, you can earn cash back or travel points on purchases.Fraud protection: Legally, you're only liable for up to $50 in losses if your credit card is used fraudulently. But most credit card companies go even further. Many credit cards offer zero-liability policies -- meaning you aren't responsible for any fraudulent charges. You also don't need to worry about a thief draining your bank account through your credit card (which could happen if your debit card was stolen).Extra perks and discounts: Credit cards can offer all kinds of benefits, such as extended warranty coverage on purchases or complimentary rental car insurance. Many of the best credit cards of 2024 have features that can be worth hundreds of dollars or more.When should I have one credit card?You should stick to one credit card if:You want to keep your finances as simple as possible.You've never had a credit card before, or you've been using credit cards for less than a year.You've had problems with missed credit card payments or overspending.You value simplicity in managing your finances and don't want to worry about tracking multiple bills.When should I have multiple credit cards?You should carry multiple credit cards if you want more card benefits and you're confident in your ability to manage everything. There are some big advantages to having multiple cards:You can carry cards that earn more in different areas, such as one flat-rate cash back card and another with bonus categories. This is a simple way to maximize your rewards.You can use features from each of your cards and get more value overall. Instead of choosing between two of the best credit card offers, you can have both.You'll have more available credit, which helps you maintain a lower credit utilization ratio. This can result in a higher credit score.How to improve your credit scoreYour credit score plays a large role in which credit cards you can get. If you have a low credit score and you work on raising it, that will open up more credit card options for you.Here's the best advice you can follow to improve your credit score.Review your credit reportYou're legally entitled to a free annual credit report from each credit bureau (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). Go to AnnualCreditReport.com to request it.Once you have your credit reports, review them for errors that could be damaging your credit score. If you find any errors, visit the website of the credit bureau that issued the report to file a dispute.Get a credit cardThe easiest way to improve your credit is by using a credit card and paying the bill on time. If you don't have a credit card, look for the top credit cards aimed at consumers in your position.If you don't have much credit history yet, the best credit cards for beginners would be ideal. If you're rebuilding credit from issues on your credit history, then secured credit cards are the most suitable option.Stay below 30% of your credit limitThe amount of your credit that you use impacts your credit score. Say you have a card with a $1,000 credit limit. If the balance is $500, that would put your credit utilization ratio at 50%.A lower credit utilization helps your credit score. As a rule of thumb, aim to stay under 30% credit utilization at all times. It's good for your credit, and as an added perk, it helps you stay out of credit card debt.Follow good payment habitsLearn your credit card's due date and always make your payment on time or early. Each on-time payment improves your payment history, which is the biggest factor in your credit score. You may want to set automatic payments so you don't miss any.It's also recommended that you pay off your credit card every month. While this isn't necessary for your credit score, it's a way to avoid interest charges on your credit card purchases.
Important card terms to knowAnnual percentage rate (APR): The annual percentage rate is charged for carrying a balance on a credit card, expressed as an annual percentage. With credit cards, the APR is the same as the interest rate.Balance: The amount owed on a credit card, including all unpaid transactions and fees. The balance at the end of a statement period is called the statement balance.Balance transfer: Moving a balance from one credit card to another. This is usually done when the new card offers a lower APR. Not every credit card offers balance transfers, and many of the cards with this feature charge a balance transfer fee.Cash advance: Withdrawing cash from a credit card, most often through cash advance checks, using the card at an ATM, or by wiring money with the card. Cash advances usually have a higher APR and start accruing interest immediately, so it's a poor way to use a credit card.Credit card: A credit card is a revolving line of credit issued by a bank and connected to a revolving line of credit. The cardholder can use their credit card for purchases and possibly other types of transactions, although this depends on the card.Credit limit: The credit card's spending limit. This can vary based on the type of transaction. On credit cards that offer cash advances, there is typically a lower credit limit for cash advances than for purchases. A transaction that would exceed a card's credit limit will be declined unless the cardholder has opted to allow over-the-limit transactions (and any potential fees that come with them).Credit score: A credit score is a rating of a consumer's creditworthiness. The score indicates how likely it is that they will make bill payments on time and repay what they borrow. Credit scores are calculated based on the consumer's financial history.Interest: A fee charged for borrowing money. The APR determines how much interest a credit card company can charge on balances. Use our interest rate calculator to get a sense of how much interest adds to your monthly bill.Minimum payment: The minimum amount a cardholder can pay by the due date to remain current on their credit card bill and avoid a late fee.
