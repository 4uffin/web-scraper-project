Disclaimers
*SoFi Personal Loan DisclaimerFixed rates from 8.99% APR to 35.49% APR. APR reflects the 0.25% autopay discount and a 0.25% direct deposit discount.SoFi Platform personal loans are made either by SoFi Bank, N.A. or , Cross River Bank, a New Jersey State Chartered Commercial Bank, Member FDIC, Equal Housing Lender. SoFi may receive compensation if you take out a loan originated by Cross River Bank. These rate ranges are current as of 04/24/25 and are subject to change without notice.Not all rates and amounts available in all states. See SoFi Personal Loan eligibility details at https://www.sofi.com/eligibility-criteria/#eligibility-personal. Not all applicants qualify for the lowest rate. Lowest rates reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers. Your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed above and will depend on a variety of factors, including evaluation of your credit worthiness, income, and other factors.Loan amounts range from $5,000–$100,000. The APR is the cost of credit as a yearly rate and reflects both your interest rate and an origination fee of 9.99% of your loan amount for Cross River Bank originated loans which will be deducted from any loan proceeds you receive and for SoFi Bank originated loans have an origination fee of 0%-7%, will be deducted from any loan proceeds you receive.Autopay: The SoFi 0.25% autopay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account. Autopay is not required to receive a loan from SoFi.Direct Deposit Discount: Direct Deposit Discount: To be eligible to receive an additional (0.25%) interest rate reduction on your Personal Loan (your “Loan”), you must set up Direct deposit with a SoFi Checking and Savings account offered by SoFi Bank, N.A., or enroll in SoFi Plus by paying the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee, all within 30 days of the funding of your Loan. Once eligible, you will receive this discount during periods in which you have enabled Direct Deposit to an eligible Direct Deposit Account in accordance with SoFi’s reasonable procedures and requirements to be determined at SoFi’s sole discretion, or during periods in which SoFi successfully receives payment of the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee. This discount will be lost during periods in which SoFi determines you have turned off Direct Deposit to your Checking and Savings account or in which you have not paid for the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee. You are not required to enroll in Direct Deposit or to pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee to receive a Loan.
*Upstart Loan Disclaimer¹ Your loan amount will be determined based on your credit, income, and certain other information provided in your loan application. Not all applicants will qualify for the full amount. Minimum loan amounts vary by state: GA ($3,100), HI ($2,100), MA ($7,000).³ The full range of available rates varies by state. A representative example of payment terms for an unsecured Personal Loan is as follows: a borrower receives a loan of $10,000 for a term of 60 months, with an interest rate of 18.60% and a 8.51% origination fee of $851, for an APR of 23.07%. In this example, the borrower will receive $9149 and will make 60 monthly payments of $258. APR is calculated based on 5-year rates offered in December 2024. There is no downpayment and no prepayment penalty. Your APR will be determined based on your credit, income, and certain other information provided in your loan application. Not all applicants will be approved.
Rates quoted are with AutoPay. Your loan terms are not guaranteed and may vary based on loan purpose, length of loan, loan amount, credit history and payment method (AutoPay or Invoice). AutoPay discount is only available when selected prior to loan funding. Rates without AutoPay are 0.50% points higher. To obtain a loan, you must complete an application on LightStream.com which may affect your credit score. You may be required to verify income, identity and other stated application information. Payment example: Monthly payments for a $10,000 loan at 8.49% APR with a term of 5 years would result in 60 monthly payments of $205.12.  Some additional conditions and limitations apply.

Expert insights on personal loans
The Federal Reserve reduced the target for the fed funds rate in September of 2025, and more cuts are expected. Personal loans have a few advantages, including a fixed interest rate, a fixed term, and fixed payment. Depending on the borrower's credit score, the interest rate on personal loans may also be lower than other forms of debt, especially credit card debt. They can be a good solution for borrowers looking for a lump sum to pay for an expense (such as a wedding or home repair) or to consolidate debt.-Robert Brokamp, Certified Financial Planner® and Senior Advisor at The Motley Fool

Bottom Line
We think Upstart is a great option for debt consolidation and credit building. Even though Upstart has a high upper-range interest rate, well-qualified applicants can snag lower rates for a wide range of loan amounts. Upstart does charge a high origination fee and late fees, but there are no prepayment penalties, giving you extra flexibility to pay off your loan early.

Discover offers highly competitive interest rates, and we find it incredibly borrower-friendly with no origination or prepayment fees. Although its maximum loan amount is average, Discover provides long repayment terms. And, Discover knows that financial decisions are complex, so if you change your mind and return your loan within 30 days, it won't cost you a thing.

We find that SoFi stands out in the personal loan landscape by offering competitive interest rates and a generous loan limit of up to $100,000. By setting up direct deposit in a SoFi checking or savings account (member FDIC) or subscribing to SoFi Plus, or by setting up auto-pay, you can enjoy a 0.25% rate reduction, which can be stacked for a total of 0.5% if you do both. Plus, there are no origination fees, late fees, or prepayment penalties, and you can benefit from same-day funding for added convenience.

What factors should I consider when choosing a personal loan?Key factors to consider when shopping for a personal loan include:Interest rate: The lower the rate, the less you'll pay in the long run.Loan term: Shorter terms mean higher monthly payments but less interest overall, while longer terms lower monthly payments but increase the total cost.Fees: Watch out for origination fees, prepayment penalties, and other charges.Repayment flexibility: Look for options like early repayment without penalties or the ability to defer payments if needed.How do I determine how much I can borrow?The amount you can borrow depends on your credit score, income, and debt-to-income ratio (DTI), which shows how much debt you already have compared to your income. Lenders look at these factors to decide how much you can handle.Before applying for a loan, consider how much you truly need and ensure you can comfortably afford the monthly payments.What is pre-approval, and why does it matter?Loan pre-approval gives you a preview of the loan terms you might qualify for, like interest rate, loan amount, and repayment term, without a hard credit check. Instead, lenders use a soft credit pull, which doesn’t affect your credit score.Getting preapproved can help you compare offers and choose the most affordable option before committing. It’s also a smart way to avoid surprises when you officially apply. Just keep in mind that preapproval isn’t a guarantee -- you’ll still need to submit a full application and undergo a hard credit check to finalize the loan.What fees should I watch out for?Be aware of fees like origination charges, which can range from 1% to 8% of the loan amount, and prepayment penalties if you pay off the loan early. Missing payments may result in late fees. Always check for any hidden fees to fully understand the cost of the loan.

FAQs
How long does it take to get approved for a personal loan?
Approval for a personal loan can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days, depending on the lender and the complexity of your application.
Can I use a personal loan for anything?
Yes, personal loans are typically unsecured and can be used for various purposes, including debt consolidation, medical expenses, or home improvements.

How quickly can I get funds?
Many lenders offer same-day or next-day funding, while others may take a few business days. The exact timing depends on the lender’s approval process and your bank’s transfer speed.
