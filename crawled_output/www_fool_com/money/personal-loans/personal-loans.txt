Expert insights on personal loans
Personal loans have a few advantages, including a fixed interest rate, a fixed term, and fixed payment. Depending on the borrower's credit score, the interest rate on personal loans may also be lower than other forms of debt, especially credit card debt. They can be a good solution for borrowers looking for a lump sum to pay for an expense (such as a wedding or home repair) or to consolidate debt.-Robert Brokamp, Certified Financial Planner® and Senior Advisor at The Motley Fool

Bottom Line
We think Upstart is a great option for debt consolidation and credit building. Even though Upstart has a high upper-range interest rate, well-qualified applicants can snag lower rates for a wide range of loan amounts. Upstart does charge a high origination fee and late fees, but there are no prepayment penalties, giving you extra flexibility to pay off your loan early.

Discover offers highly competitive interest rates, and we find it incredibly borrower-friendly with no origination or prepayment fees. Although its maximum loan amount is average, Discover provides long repayment terms. And, Discover knows that financial decisions are complex, so if you change your mind and return your loan within 30 days, it won't cost you a thing.

We find that SoFi stands out in the personal loan landscape by offering competitive interest rates and a generous loan limit of up to $100,000. By setting up direct deposit in a SoFi checking or savings account (member FDIC) or subscribing to SoFi Plus, or by setting up auto-pay, you can enjoy a 0.25% rate reduction, which can be stacked for a total of 0.5% if you do both. Plus, there are no origination fees, late fees, or prepayment penalties, and you can benefit from same-day funding for added convenience.

What factors should I consider when choosing a personal loan?Key factors to consider when shopping for a personal loan include:Interest rate: The lower the rate, the less you'll pay in the long run.Loan term: Shorter terms mean higher monthly payments but less interest overall, while longer terms lower monthly payments but increase the total cost.Fees: Watch out for origination fees, prepayment penalties, and other charges.Repayment flexibility: Look for options like early repayment without penalties or the ability to defer payments if needed.How do I determine how much I can borrow?The amount you can borrow depends on your credit score, income, and debt-to-income ratio (DTI), which shows how much debt you already have compared to your income. Lenders look at these factors to decide how much you can handle.Before applying for a loan, consider how much you truly need and ensure you can comfortably afford the monthly payments.What is pre-approval, and why does it matter?Loan pre-approval gives you a preview of the loan terms you might qualify for, like interest rate, loan amount, and repayment term, without a hard credit check. Instead, lenders use a soft credit pull, which doesn’t affect your credit score.Getting preapproved can help you compare offers and choose the most affordable option before committing. It’s also a smart way to avoid surprises when you officially apply. Just keep in mind that preapproval isn’t a guarantee -- you’ll still need to submit a full application and undergo a hard credit check to finalize the loan.What fees should I watch out for?Be aware of fees like origination charges, which can range from 1% to 8% of the loan amount, and prepayment penalties if you pay off the loan early. Missing payments may result in late fees. Always check for any hidden fees to fully understand the cost of the loan.
