‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in a Name?‚Äù
The Motley Fool‚Äôs name comes from William Shakespeare‚Äôs play ‚ÄúAs You Like It‚Äù. The court jester, known as the Fool, could speak the truth to the king and queen without having his head lopped off. The Fools of yore entertained the court with humor that instructed as it amused. More importantly, the Fool was never afraid to question conventional wisdom. In the same way, we aim to speak the truth about money and investing...and to make financial guidance accessible to people of all backgrounds and experience levels.

Careers
The Motley Fool is a ‚Äúvirtual first‚Äù workplace. Most Fools get the majority of their work done remotely. Our physical office spaces (in Alexandria, Denver, Sydney, and the Gold Coast) are collaboration hubs, providing a purposeful approach to office work rather than antiquated requirement that you show up to an office every day. At The Fool, we believe people should have the freedom to follow their passion in roles they love. We work hard to understand the needs of our employees and deliver for them. We are confident that this, in turn, makes a great business. Take care of your employees, and they will take care of your customers, who in turn take care of shareholders. We think every company should do the same.

Our Foolish History
The Motley Fool was founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner as a traditional print newsletter in a backyard shed in Alexandria, Virginia. In 1994, an April Fool‚Äôs joke designed to teach an investing lesson put The Motley Fool on the map. Since those humble beginnings, Tom and David, and the community of Fools they‚Äôve gathered, have been leading the charge for individual investors everywhere.
