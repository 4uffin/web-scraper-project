Choosing the right home for your retirement savings is as important as saving for retirement in the first place. Your retirement plan dictates how much you can contribute annually, how it's taxed, how withdrawals work, what you can invest in, and how much you pay in fees.
To help you decide which retirement plans work best for you, consider the following options:401(k)403(b)457IRARoth IRANondeductible IRASolo 401(k)SEP IRASIMPLE IRAKeogh planWeâ€™ll cover employer-sponsored plans, individual retirement accounts, and plans for self-employed individuals and small business owners.

401(k)401(k)A 401(k) is the most common type of employer-sponsored retirement plan. Your employer preselects a few investment choices and you defer a portion of each paycheck to the account. If you leave your job, you may take your 401(k) funds with you or leave them where they are.In 2025, you can contribute up to $23,500 to a 401(k) if you're under age 50. Adults aged 50 to 59 and 64 or older may contribute up to $31,000 and those aged 60 to 63 may contribute up to $34,750.
Some employers also match a portion of employee contributions. With few exceptions, you cannot withdraw funds from your 401(k) before age 59 1/2 without penalty.
Table by author.
401(k) pros
401(k) cons
High contribution limits
Limited investment options
Tax savings
Fees can be high
Employer matching
Early withdrawal penalties before 59 1/2
Loans available with some plans
Loans are taxed as early distribution if they arenâ€™t paid back on time
If you hope to get the most out of your 401(k), contribute as much as you are able to and choose your investments carefully to minimize fees. You should also claim any employer match that's available and watch out for your company's vesting schedule, which determines when you get to keep employer-matched funds.Tax benefits: Most 401(k)s are tax-deferred, which means your contributions reduce your taxable income this year but you pay taxes on your distributions. This is usually smart if you believe you'll be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than you are today. But Roth 401(k)s are also growing in popularity. Contributions to these accounts don't reduce your taxable income for the year, but distributions are tax-free. You'll save more in taxes with a Roth 401(k) if you're in the same or a lower tax bracket today than you'll be in once you retire. Employer-matched funds are still tax-deferred with these plans.401(k) loans: Some plans allow 401(k) loans. This enables you to borrow against your retirement savings and pay back that money with interest over time. But if you fail to pay back everything by the end of the loan term, the government taxes the outstanding balance as a distribution.
Other employer-sponsored retirement plansOther employer-sponsored retirement plans403(b) and 457 plans are other types of employer-sponsored retirement plans you may come across.
403(b) Retirement Plans for Teachers & Non-Profit Employees
Here's a brief overview of 403(b) retirement plans, including their pros, cons, and contribution limits.

IRAIRAAn IRA is a retirement account anyone may open and contribute to, as long as they are earning income during the year or are married to someone who is.
Did you know
IRAs offer a much greater variety of investment options than most employer-sponsored retirement plans.
The greater variety of options, coupled with the fact that you can open an IRA with any broker, means you may be able to keep your fees lower with an IRA than you could with the plans listed above.

No employer matching
Getting the most out of your IRA involves choosing your broker and investments carefully to minimize fees, while keeping your investments diverse and well-matched to your risk tolerance. You should also choose the right type of IRA -- traditional or Roth -- based on which you think will give you the greatest tax advantages, then contribute as much as you can each year.Tax savings: Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred -- your contributions are pre-tax, so they lower your taxable income for the year and you pay taxes on distributions. Roth IRAs use after-tax dollars, so your contributions have no effect on your taxes this year, but you can then withdraw your savings tax-free in retirement.Contribution limits: You can only contribute up to $7,000 to an IRA in 2025. If you're 50 or older, you can contribute an extra $1,000. You may contribute to an employer-sponsored retirement plan and an IRA in the same year, and you may contribute to tax-deferred and Roth accounts at the same time, but you may not make more than $7,000 (or $8,000 if 50 or older) in combined traditional and Roth IRA contributions for the same tax year.
Types of IRAsTypes of IRAsThere are several types of IRAs to consider. Here are a few key alternatives.
Roth IRAs
Want to get tax-free distributions in retirement? A Roth IRA may be right for you.
Nondeductible IRAs
Nondeductible IRAs are a type of traditional IRA, but they use after-tax contributions. Learn about the benefits and drawbacks.
Retirement plans for the self-employedRetirement plans for the self-employed and small business owners
Image source: Getty Images
Self-employed individuals and small business owners may contribute to an IRA, but there are also several special retirement plans available just for them that let them contribute more money per year, since they don't receive the benefit of an employer-sponsored retirement plan. Here's a look at some of the most common retirement plans for small business owners and the self-employed.
Solo 401(k)
The self-employed need to save for retirement, too, and hereâ€™s one way.
SEP IRA
A SEP IRA is a type of IRA available to self-employed individuals and small business owners. You may contribute up to the lesser of 25% of your compensation, or $66,000 (2023) or $69,000 (2024). If you have employees, you must contribute the same percentage of your employees' income to their SEP IRAs as you do to your own.
SIMPLE IRA
A SIMPLE IRA is a retirement account for small businesses and the self-employed.
Keogh plan
These retirement plans are for the self-employed and unincorporated businesses.
