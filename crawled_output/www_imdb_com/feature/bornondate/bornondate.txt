Chad StahelskiStuntsProducerActorJohn Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)He came from a kick-boxing background; he entered the film field as a
stunt performer at the age of 24. Before that, he worked as an
instructor at the Inosanto Martial Arts Academy in California, teaching
Jeet Kune Do/Jun Fan. After doing numerous roles in low budget martial
art movies like Mission of Justice (1992) and Bloodsport III (1996) his first start as a stunt double
came from the movie The Crow (1994) for doubling late Brandon Lee whom he trained
with at the Inosanto Academy. After Brandon Lee's lethal accident Chad was
picked for his stunt/photo double because he knew Lee, how he moved,
and looked more like him than any other stuntman.His greatest break as a stunt man came when he hooked up with Keanu
Reeves on The Matrix (1999). He worked as martial arts stunt coordinator in its
following sequels and doubled Keanu Reeves for extreme shots. He also formed
a company called Smashcut with his stunt colleagues which was
responsible for cool stunts in some of the greatest movies and series.After a ten year in the film world he continued to give his best as a
stunt coordinator and stunt performer.8. Sophia LorenActressSoundtrackArabesque (1966)Sophia Loren was born as Sofia Scicolone at the Clinica Regina Margherita in Rome on September 20, 1934. Her father Riccardo was married to another woman and refused to marry her mother Romilda Villani, despite the fact that she was the mother of his two children (Sophia and her younger sister Maria Scicolone). Growing up in the slums of Pozzuoli during the second World War without any support from her father, she experienced great sadness in her childhood. Her life took an unexpected turn for the best when, at age 14, she entered into a beauty contest and placed as one of the finalists. It was here that Sophia caught the attention of film producer Carlo Ponti, some 22 years her senior, whom she later married. Perhaps he was the father figure she never experienced as a child. Under his guidance, Sophia was put under contract and appeared as an extra in ten films beginning with Le sei mogli di Barbablù (1950), before working her way up to supporting roles. In these early films, she was credited as "Sofia Lazzaro" because people joked her beauty could raise Lazzarus from the dead.By her late teens, Sophia was playing lead roles in many Italian features such as La favorita (1952) and Aida (1953). In 1957, she embarked on a successful acting career in the United States, starring in Boy on a Dolphin (1957), Legend of the Lost (1957), and The Pride and the Passion (1957)
that year. She had a short-lived but much-publicized fling with co-star Cary Grant, who was nearly 31 years her senior. She was only 22 while he was 53, and she rejected a marriage proposal from him. They were paired together a second time in the family-friendly romantic comedy Houseboat (1958). While under contract to Paramount, Sophia starred in Desire Under the Elms (1958), The Key (1958), The Black Orchid (1958),
It Started in Naples (1960), Heller in Pink Tights (1960), A Breath of Scandal (1960), and The Millionairess (1960) before returning to Italy to star in Two Women (1960). The film was a period piece about a woman living in war-torn Italy who is raped while trying to protect her young daughter. Originally cast as the more glamorous child, Sophia fought against type and was re-cast as the mother, displaying a lack of vanity and proving herself as a genuine actress. This performance received international acclaim and was honored with an Academy Award for Best Actress.Sophia remained a bona fide international movie star throughout the sixties and seventies, making films on both sides of the Atlantic, and
starring opposite such leading men as Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Gregory Peck, and Charlton Heston. Her English-language films included El Cid (1961), The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964), Arabesque (1966), Man of La Mancha (1972), and The Cassandra Crossing (1976). She gained wider respect with her Italian films, especially Marriage Italian Style (1964) and A Special Day (1977), both of which co-starred Marcello Mastroianni. During these years she received a second Oscar nomination and won five Golden Globe Awards.From the eighties onward, Sophia's appearances on the big screen came few and far between. She preferred to spend the majority of her time raising sons Carlo Ponti Jr. (b. 1968) and Edoardo Ponti (b. 1973). Her only acting credits during the decade were five television films, beginning with Sophia Loren: Her Own Story (1980), a biopic in which she portrayed herself and her mother. She ventured into other areas of business and became the first actress to launch her own fragrance and design of eyewear. In 1982 she voluntarily spent nineteen days in jail for tax evasion.In 1991 Sophia received an Honorary Academy Award for her body of work, and was declared "one of world cinema's greatest treasures." That same year, she experienced a terrible loss when her mother died of cancer. Her return to mainstream films in Ready to Wear (1994) was well-received, although the film as a whole was not. She followed this up with her biggest U.S. hit in years, the comedy Grumpier Old Men (1995), in which she played a sexy divorcée who seduces Walter Matthau. Over the next decade Sophia had plum roles in a few independent films like Soleil (1997), Between Strangers (2002) (directed by Edoardo), and Lives of the Saints (2004). Still beautiful at 72, she posed scantily-clad for the 2007 Pirelli Calendar. Sadly, that same year she mourned the death of her 94-year-old spouse, Carlo Ponti. In 2009, after far too much time away from film, she appeared in the musical Nine (2009) opposite Daniel Day-Lewis. These days Sophia is based in Switzerland but frequently travels to the states to spend time with her sons and their families (Eduardo is married to actress Sasha Alexander). Sophia Loren remains one of the most beloved and recognizable figures in the international film world.9.

Karen SharpeActressProducerAdditional CrewThe High and the Mighty (1954)Svelte and stunning Texas-born Karen Sharpe was put into ballet shoes
as a youngster. Her initial excursion to California was, at age 12, with the interest of becoming a professional ice skater, but the lure of
being a movie star intervened. Her training as a teenager in the
theater paid off and, in 1952, she appeared in Stanley Kramer's production of
The Sniper (1952), directed by Edward Dmytryk. Her role consisted solely of three lines
delivered while sitting on a drugstore stool and ordering a cherry
phosphate. Although she did not personally meet Kramer at the time, it
would be a foreshadowing of a future lifelong relationship.In her salad days, she paid the rent and more as a billboard model and
also graced such popular magazine covers as "Cosmopolitan" and
"Pageant." On film, MGM featured her as Janice Rule's kid sister in Holiday for Sinners (1952),
opposite William Campbell. Campbell went on to appear with her in other films as
well, and they were paired as husband and wife in the Stagecoach West (1960) episode, Never Walk Alone (1961), in 1961. Producer Hal Roach gave her a break by featuring her in the
popular "White Rain" commercials, where she danced her way to fame across the tops of rows of shampoo bottles, and he also chose her to
represent his studio as Modern Screen Magazine's Golden Key Award winner as 1952's "Star of Tomorrow". Columbia Pictures picked up on
this recognition and placed her in the Hugo Haas melodrama, Strange Fascination (1952).
Monogram Pictures offered her a starring role in Army Bound (1952), which led to
her being cast in Walter Mirisch's cult programmer, Bomba and the Jungle Girl (1952), with Johnny Sheffield (who
played "Boy" in the Tarzan series) playing Bomba to Karen's lovely "Jungle Girl". The John Payne western The Vanquished (1953) followed, for Paramount Pictures. The film also starred Jan Sterling, who went on to appear with
Karen in a couple of other major films and become a close friend and mentor, as well.After filming the crime drama Mexican Manhunt (1953), starring George Brent, for Allied Artists, Karen received the biggest break of her young career. Director William A. Wellman cast her in the Wayne-Fellows-Warner Brothers epic airline
disaster film, The High and the Mighty (1954). An all-star ensemble, it featured Karen as "Nell Buck", an amorous bride who allays her fears of certain death with the ecstasies of passion for new husband "Milo" (played by John Smith). Karen's
standout performance garnered her the 1954 Golden Globe Award for "New Star of the Year". As a result, the film's star and producer, John Wayne, put her under contract to his new company, Batjac. Loaned out to Ida Lupino's company for Mad at the World (1955), Karen then co-starred in United Artists' Man with the Gun (1955) opposite Robert Mitchum. Cast in Batjac's Man in the Vault (1956), she went on loan again, this time for Columbia's war picture, Tarawa Beachhead (1958).In the 1950s, against the concerns of the studios but with the encouragement of John Wayne, who advised her to "do anything and
everything you can to grow as an artist", Karen made herself available for television. Taking Wayne's advice to heart, she found a creative
and demanding outlet performing in "live" drama, with roles on Hallmark Hall of Fame (1951), General Electric Theater (1953), Climax! (1954), Matinee Theatre (1955), Playhouse 90 (1956) and Lux Playhouse (1958),
among others. She also appeared in episodes of such classic TV shows as The Loretta Young Show (1953), Gunsmoke (1955), Perry Mason (1957), Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse (1958), 77 Sunset Strip (1958), Bonanza (1959), The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (1964) and The Wild Wild West (1965). Karen went on to co-star in Aaron Spelling's
very first television series, Johnny Ringo (1959).Following a hiatus from Hollywood, while straightening out family estate matters, Karen was cast in the pilot for I Dream of Jeannie (1965) as Larry Hagman's fiancé and Jeannie's attractive nemesis. While waiting for the pilot to be
sold (which, of course, it did), Jerry Lewis signed her to play opposite him in Paramount's The Disorderly Orderly (1964) as lovesick nurse "Julie Blair", who wins Jerry's affections in the end. It was during that filming that she met Stanley Kramer, who was directing Ship of Fools (1965) at the same time on the Paramount lot. Karen's focus was on her career, however, and a year went by
before they actually started dating in January of 1966. After a relatively brief courtship, they married on September 1, 1966,
following her completion of the Universal pilot, Valley of Mystery (1967).Choosing to close the chapter on her acting career, Karen opened a new
and rewarding one as full-time wife, mother (of two), and assistant to
her husband. With the creation of KNK Productions, Inc., Karen
established herself as a producer. Among her many successful projects
is a remake of her husband's western classic High Noon (2000), as well as the
prospective "Defiant One," a documentary examining Kramer's prolific
career, and "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World," a big-screen sequel
to his It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963). Kramer passed away on February 19, 2001. Since then,
the ever-busy and vivacious Karen has maintained the Stanley Kramer
Library. In addition, she also established the Stanley Kramer Award at
the Producer's Guild, and the Stanley Kramer Fellowship Award in
Directing at UCLA in 2001. Both of these awards honor socially
conscious young filmmakers.17.

In later years, Meara played reoccurring characters in Sex and the City (1998) and The King of Queens (1998).18.
