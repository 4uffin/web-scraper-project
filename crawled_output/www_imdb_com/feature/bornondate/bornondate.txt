He later obtained his American citizenship in the early 1990s. He often would visit his homeland of Canada throughout his career, and the City of Brantford even erected a plaque on the Walk of Fame in the town in honor of Phil's career and memory. The Humber College Comedy: Writing & Performance program in Toronto, Ontario, also has an award in Phil's memory that is given out to their Post-Graduate comedy students.Phil originally studied Graphic Design at California State University.

He was known to help out other writers who wanted to get their sketches read and onto the show. He held Saturday Night Live (1975) together during his 8-year reign, thus the nickname he garnered while on the show, "The Glue." Phil was also known for his voice work on commercials and cartoons.

Bilko (1996), and his last live action film, Small Soldiers (1998).

It was later discovered by the coroner that Brynn had alcohol, cocaine, and the antidepressant, Zoloft, in her system. They left behind two children, Sean Edward (b. 1988) and Birgen (b. 1992). Phil and Brynn's bodies were cremated and spread upon Catalina Island, just off the coast of California, on June 4, 1998. Phil had specifically stated in his will that he wanted the ashes spread on Catalina Island because it was his favorite holiday getaway as he was an avid boater, surfer and general lover of the sea.Phil was a very caring and sensitive person and was described as "very sweet and kind of quiet."9.

By age 14, barely in high school, Bird was mentored by the animator Milt Kahl, one of Disney's legendary Nine Old Men.

Jim HensonActorWriterProducerThe Muppet Show (1976–1981)Jim Henson never thought that he would make a name of himself in
puppetry; it was merely a way of getting himself on television. The
vehicle that achieved it was
Sam and Friends (1955), a
late-night puppet show that was on after the 11:00 news in Washington
DC. It proved to be very popular and inspired Jim to continue using
puppets for his work. He made many commercials, developing the
signature humor that Henson Productions is known for. A key reason for
the success of his puppets is that Jim realized he didn't need to hide
puppeteers behind a structure when they were in front of a camera. All
he had to do was instruct the camera operators to focus on the puppets
and keep the puppeteers out of the frame. This allowed the puppets to
dominate the image and make them more lifelike. This work on puppets
and television would lead to separate projects that had different
goals. The first one was his work on the
The Jimmy Dean Show (1963)
with the character Rowlf the Dog, the oldest clearly identified
character that Henson Productions still uses. This show provided an
income that allowed Jim to work on a pet project. That project was
Time Piece (1965), a surrealistic
short about time which was nominated for best live-action short Oscar.
Henson shot to prominence when he was approached to use his muppets for
the revolutionary educational show
Sesame Street (1969). The show
was a smash hit and his characters have become staples on public
television. Unforetunately, this also led to Henson being typecast as
only an entertainer for children. He sought to disprove that by being
part of the initial crew of
Saturday Night Live (1975),
but his style and that of the creative staff simply didn't jibe. It was
this circumstance that encouraged him to develop a variety show format
that had the kind of sophisticated humor that
"Sesame Street (1969)" didn't
work with. No American broadcaster was interested, but British producer
Lew Grade was. This led to
The Muppet Show (1976). It
initially struggled both in the ratings and in the search for guest
stars, but in the second season it became a smash hit and would
eventually become the most widely watched series in television history.
Hungry for a new challenge, Henson made
The Muppet Movie (1979), defying
the popular industry opinion that his characters would never work in a
movie. The film became a hit and spawned a series of features which
included the moody fantasy
The Dark Crystal (1982), which
was a drastic and bold departure from the amiable tone of his previous
work. The most successful TV work in the 1980s was
Fraggle Rock (1983), a fantasy
series specifically designed to appeal to as many cultural groups as
possible. During this time he also established the Creature Shop, a
puppet studio that became renowned for being as brilliant with puppetry
as ILM was at special effects. When he died all too soon in 1990, he
was indisputably one of the geniuses of puppetry. More importantly, he
was a man who achieved his phenomenal success while still retaining his
social conscience and artistic integrity as his work in promoting
environmentalism and his brilliant
The Storyteller (1987) series
respectively attest to.19. Ryan PaeveyActorProducerAdditional CrewGeneral Hospital (2013–2025)Ryan started modeling in high school and has, with a few breaks, been

His work included five seasons at Canada's National Arts Centre, a number of CBC movies, a regular on a sitcom called CHECK IT OUT with Don Adams and two John Sayles films, MATEWAN and EIGHT MEN OUT. He finally took the Hollywood plunge in 1989, and soon landed a starring role along side Farrah Fawcett in the mini-series SMALL SACRIFICES. From there, numerous guest roles in such favorites as CHEERS, NIGHT COURT, WINGS and WONDER YEARS led to an audition for a guest role on NYPD BLUE where an impulsive character choice landed him 12 seasons in the role of Detective Greg Medavoy. Awards include a 1998 Emmy Award for Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and the first SAG Award for Ensemble in a Drama Series. Since then, numerous film and television roles, including recurring roles on DAMAGES and CHICAGO FIRE notwithstanding, he has returned to his first love, theatre.

In the Fall of 2019 he portrayed J Edgar Hoover in the Lincoln Center production of THE GREAT SOCIETY. What has stayed with him through all this time is his love of the poet Robert Frost. In 2008, he stumbled across a script titled THIS VERSE BUSINESS. He and playwright A.M. Dolan have been developing it and "barding" around the country with it ever since. In 2010 Gus Kaikkonen directed the first full production of the play at Peterborough Players taking it to new heights.
