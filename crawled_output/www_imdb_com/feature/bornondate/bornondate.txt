Ethan CoenProducerWriterDirectorThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018)The younger brother of Joel, Ethan Coen is an Academy Award and Golden Globe winning writer, producer and director coming from small independent
films to big profile Hollywood films. He was born on September 21, 1957 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In some films of the brothers- Ethan & Joel wrote, Joel directed and Ethan produced - with both editing under
the name of Roderick Jaynes; but in 2004 they started to share the three main duties plus editing.
Each film bring its own quality, creativity, art and with one project more daring the other.His film debut was in 1984 dark humored thriller Blood Simple (1984) starring Frances McDormand (Joel's wife) and M. Emmet Walsh in a deep story revolving
a couple of romantic lovers followed by an insisting private eye. The film received critical acclaim, some award nominations to Ethan (best writing at the Film Independent Spirit Awards)
and became a cult following over the years. Their second work was the comedy Raising Arizona (1987) starring Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter as a unusual couple trying to create
their family by kidnapping babies from a rich family.Miller's Crossing (1990) was the third film of the brothers, a mob drama with heavy influences from several criminal dramas and with a stellar cast that included
Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, Albert Finney, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro and Jon Polito (the latter three would become regular actors in the Coen's films).Their views on the Hollywood era of the 1930's was the central theme is the great Barton Fink (1991), created from a writers block both brothers suffered during the making of their previous
film. John Turturro stars as a writer who suffers from a breakdown when he's commissioned to a big budget Hollywood project. The film was a breakthrough for the Coens marking their first
win at the Cannes Film Festival (Joel got the Palme d'Or) and the first time a film of their received Oscar nominations. The underrated comedy The Hudsucker Proxy (1994) was what followed; but no one
could predict their next big and boldest move that would definitely put Ethan and Joel on the spotlight once and for all.The comedy of errors Fargo (1996) was a huge critical and commercial success. With its crazed story of a man who hires two loonies to kidnap his own wife and a pregnant policewoman tracking
the leads to the crime, Ethan and Joel came at their greatest moment that couldn't be missed. The film received several awards during award season and the Coen's got their first Oscar in the Best Original
Screenplay category. What came next was the underrated yet hilariously good The Big Lebowski (1998) starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, John Turturro and Steve Buscemi.
Those masterpieces made their career in the late 1990's cementing the duo as one of the greatest writers and directors of their generation, if not, from all time.The Odyssey retold for the 1930's in O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000); the intelligent noir The Man Who Wasn't There (2001); the comedy Intolerable Cruelty (2003) and a remake The Ladykillers (2004) marked their way into the early 2000's.
Certaintly of period of minor hits and some downer moments.The big return was with the highly acclaimed No Country for Old Men (2007), where the brothers swooped at the Oscars with three wins: Best Picture, Screenplay and Writing, an adaptation from the Cormac
McCarthy's novel.A Serious Man (2009), Burn After Reading (2008), True Grit (2010), Inside Llewyn Davis (2013), Hail, Caesar! (2016) and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018) were the subsequent films, all well received by audiences or got awards recognition, mostly
nominations.A shift from tone and career move was writing with other writers and for another directors: for Angelina Jolie's Unbroken (2014), for Spielberg in Bridge of Spies (2015) and George Clooney in Suburbicon (2017).As for personal life, Ethan has been married to Tricia Cooke since 1990. Tricia works as an assistant editor in several of the Coen brothers films.2. Stephen KingWriterProducerActorMaximum Overdrive (1986)Stephen Edwin King was born on September 21, 1947, at the Maine General Hospital in Portland. His parents were Nellie Ruth (Pillsbury), who worked as a caregiver at a mental institute, and Donald Edwin King, a merchant seaman. His father was born under the surname "Pollock," but used the last name "King," under which Stephen was born. He has an older brother, David. The Kings were a typical family until one night, when Donald said he was stepping out for cigarettes and was never heard from again. Ruth took over raising the family with help from relatives. They traveled throughout many states over several years, finally moving back to Durham, Maine, in 1958.Stephen began his actual writing career in January of 1959, when David and Stephen decided to publish their own local newspaper named "Dave's Rag". David bought a mimeograph machine, and they put together a paper they sold for five cents an issue. Stephen attended Lisbon High School, in Lisbon, in 1962. Collaborating with his best friend Chris Chesley in 1963, they published a collection of 18 short stories called "People, Places, and Things--Volume I". King's stories included "Hotel at the End of the Road", "I've Got to Get Away!", "The Dimension Warp", "The Thing at the Bottom of the Well", "The Stranger", "I'm Falling", "The Cursed Expedition", and "The Other Side of the Fog." A year later, King's amateur press, Triad and Gaslight Books, published a two-part book titled "The Star Invaders".King made his first actual published appearance in 1965 in the magazine Comics Review with his story "I Was a Teenage Grave Robber." The story ran about 6,000 words in length. In 1966 he graduated from high school and took a scholarship to attend the University of Maine. Looking back on his high school days, King recalled that "my high school career was totally undistinguished. I was not at the top of my class, nor at the bottom." Later that summer King began working on a novel called "Getting It On", about some kids who take over a classroom and try unsuccessfully to ward off the National Guard. During his first year at college, King completed his first full-length novel, "The Long Walk." He submitted the novel to Bennett Cerf/Random House only to have it rejected. King took the rejection badly and filed the book away.He made his first small sale--$35--with the story "The Glass Floor". In June 1970 King graduated from the University of Maine with a Bachelor of Science degree in English and a certificate to teach high school. King's next idea came from the poem by Robert Browning, "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came." He found bright colored green paper in the library and began work on "The Dark Tower" saga, but his chronic shortage of money meant that he was unable to further pursue the novel, and it, too, was filed away. King took a job at a filling station pumping gas for the princely sum of $1.25 an hour. Soon he began to earn money for his writings by submitting his short stories to men's magazines such as Cavalier.On January 2, 1971, he married Tabitha King (born Tabitha Jane Spruce). In the fall of 1971 King took a teaching job at Hampden Academy, earning $6,400 a year. The Kings then moved to Hermon, a town west of Bangor. Stephen then began work on a short story about a teenage girl named Carietta White. After completing a few pages, he decided it was not a worthy story and crumpled the pages up and tossed them into the trash. Fortunately, Tabitha took the pages out and read them. She encouraged her husband to continue the story, which he did. In January 1973 he submitted "Carrie" to Doubleday. In March Doubleday bought the book. On May 12 the publisher sold the paperback rights for the novel to New American Library for $400,000. His contract called for his getting half of that sum, and he quit his teaching job to pursue writing full time. The rest, as they say, is history.Since then King has had numerous short stories and novels published and movies made from his work. He has been called the "Master of Horror". His books have been translated into 33 different languages, published in over 35 different countries. There are over 300 million copies of his novels in publication. He continues to live in Bangor, Maine, with his wife, and writes out of his home.In June 1999 King was severely injured in an accident, he was walking alongside a highway and was hit by a van, that left him in critical condition with injuries to his lung, broken ribs, a broken leg and a severely fractured hip. After three weeks of operations, he was released from the Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston.3.

The gleefully optimistic story of three Texans who aspire to become successful thieves Bottle Rocket (1993) premiered at the 1993 Sundance Festival where it attracted the attention of director James L. Brooks. With Brooks' help, the short became a full-length feature film released in 1996 under the same name, Bottle Rocket (1996). Afterwards, Wilson moved to Hollywood, setting up house with his two brothers and Anderson. The same year, Wilson also appeared in the coming-of-age drama Telling Lies in America (1997). After large roles in three 1998 comedies, Best Men (1997), Bongwater (1998), and Home Fries (1998) (the latter two co-starring Drew Barrymore), Wilson went on to star in another three comedies the following year.

Blue Streak (1999) starred the actor as the sidekick of robber-turned-policeman Martin Lawrence, while Kill the Man (1999) (which premiered at the 1999 Sundance Festival) cast him as the owner of a small copy center competing with a large chain store across the street. Though he would stick closely to comedy through 2001 with roles in Charlie's Angels (2000) and Legally Blonde (2001), Wilson took a turn for the sinister in the thrillers Bad Seed (2000) and Soul Survivors (2001) before teaming again with his brother Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson to give one of his most memorable performances as Richie in The Royal Tenenbaums (2001). In 2003, Wilson reprised two past roles, appearing in both Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle (2003) and Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde (2003).

Angus MacfadyenActorWriterDirectorEquilibrium (2002)Best known as Robert the Bruce in
Braveheart (1995), Angus McFadyen has
enjoyed a fine career in the film business. He has been in a variety of
different films and television shows over his life, playing such well
known roles as Edward
'Blackbeard' Teach, Robert the
Bruce, and Orson Welles.Born in Glasgow, Scotland on the twenty-first of September in 1963,
Angus lived a colourful childhood, being raised in such places as the
Philippines, Singapore, and France. Angus found himself back in
Britain, however, when it came to education. He enrolled in the
University of Edinburgh, and Central School of Speech and Drama in
London.Angus' first role was the role of Philip in the film made for
television,
The Lost Language of Cranes (1991).
The film centers on a young man (Angus) who must tell his parents that
he is gay. Playing the role of his father was fellow Scottish actor
Brian Cox. Angus then acted in the
television film
15: The Life and Death of Philip Knight (1993)
and also on the television show
Takin' Over the Asylum (1994)
which was about a salesman who runs a radio station in an institution.
This led to the biggest role of Angus's career.In 1995, Mel Gibson's epic classic,
Braveheart (1995) was released, with
Angus in the role of Robert the Bruce. Next to the flamboyantly hero of
William Wallace, Robert the Bruce was the human character, the man who
wanted to make the right choice, but was drawn to compromise. The
brilliant portrayal of the Bruce was sadly unnoticed by any awards, a
tragic insult to Angus's brilliant performance.After Braveheart (1995) won Best
Picture, Angus acted in the independent film
Nevada (1997), before giving the most
over-the-top performance of his career in the action/fantasy
Warriors of Virtue (1997).
While the movie was a disaster critically and commercially, Angus's
performance as the demented villain Komodo is fondly remembered by a
cult following to this day. Another role for Angus was in the romantic
comedy Still Breathing (1997).
Regrettably, none of these matched up to
Braveheart (1995)'s success. He moved
on to Joseph's Gift (1999) which
starred Freddy Rodríguez. Angus
also co-starred alongside such names as
Don Cheadle and
Ray Liotta when he played Peter Lawford in
the HBO film
The Rat Pack (1998).Angus also played the role of Orson Welles
in Tim Robbins's third directorial
film Cradle Will Rock (1999).
Although the film received a nomination for the Palme D'Or at Cannes,
it was a financial flop, but Angus rebounded with the Shakespearean film
Titus (1999) which also featured
Anthony Hopkins,
Jonathan Rhys Meyers,
Alan Cumming and
Jessica Lange. Angus played the
role of Lucius, eldest son of Titus Andronicus (played by Hopkins).
Directed by Julie Taymor, who would go on
to direct
Across the Universe (2007),
the film was a critical triumph and Angus delivered a solid
performance, but with mediocre box office results. With the new
millennium, Angus once again took up a very well-known character: the
Greek God Zeus in
Jason and the Argonauts (2000).After the noir film
Second Skin (2000), Angus acted
in a number of poorly received films. One such film was the action film
Styx (2001) which starred
Peter Weller. A year later, Angus
acted in the comedy film
Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (2002)
alongside a number of famous names as
Sandra Bullock,
Ellen Burstyn,
Maggie Smith, and
Ashley Judd. The film was a commercial hit,
albeit with mixed reviews. That same year, Angus took the role of
Vice-Counsel Dupont in
Equilibrium (2002). The film, also
starring Christian Bale,
Sean Bean,
Taye Diggs, and
Emily Watson, is about a world set
in the future, where a Fascist regime forbids all emotions from being
shown. The film, though clearly well-made and well-acted by all, did
not get a wide release. It had already made a profit through
international sales, and the studio chose to keep it a successful
profit rather than risk a big release.
Equilibrium (2002) has since gained a
cult following, but at the time of its initial release, Angus moved on
to act in the television series
Miracles (2003) which was about the
supernatural.After "Miracles", Angus acted as Marcus Crassus in a more historically
accurate version of
Stanley Kubrick's film
Spartacus (1960), the character of Bill
in "The Pleasure Drivers", and the lead in the dramatic film
The Virgin of Juarez (2006).
He then played the pirate warlord Blackbeard in a television film of
the same name. The film received mixed reviews.What then emerged was the second major role of MacFadyen's career: the role
of Jeff Denlon in Saw III (2006).
Denlon is a man obsessed with revenge, and he is led into a series of
traps that test his ability to forgive. The film was a smash hit for
its 10 million dollar budget, earning almost two hundred million
dollars worldwide. Angus co-starred in the box office bomb
Redline (2007) the same year as he
returned to the "Saw" franchise with the fourth film. It was also a
success at the box office, though reviews for this film were lower than
the previous films.Angus continues making films, starring as the outlaw Will Tunney in his
new western film
Shadowheart (2009), which may
be a reference to the film that made him famous. Angus has appeared on
television in the series "Californication" and "Killer Wave". He has
also acted in the upcoming mystery film "San Saba (2008)" and the
thriller film Unnatural Causes (2008). His
character of Jeff makes a reappearance in
Saw V (2008), and he acted in two
thrillers. One is the film
Pound of Flesh (2010) alongside
Malcolm McDowell which revolves around
a corrupt college professor, and the other is the crime thriller
Assassins Run (2013)
alongside Christian Slater. Angus
also acted in the second season of
Lie to Me (2009), to positive
acclaim, and the
Cameron Crowe comedy
We Bought a Zoo (2011), starring
Matt Damon.After a number of independent films, Angus found success playing two different historical figures on television in 2014. The first was detective and spy Allan Pinkerton in the Canadian series The Pinkertons (2014). Although it was short-lived, the second one was much more impactful; the British frontiersman and army officer Robert Rogers in the highly acclaimed AMC series TURN: Washington's Spies (2014). Angus appeared in 31 episodes across four seasons, even as he also made his directorial debut with the Shakespearean film Macbeth Unhinged (2016), which featured a number of collaborators from "Turn" and "Titus".Since then, Angus has continued to find steady work, including as a guest star in the historical series Strange Angel (2018), and in the independent comedy Business Ethics (2019). He also returned to his iconic film role in a sequel film titled Robert the Bruce (2019). Angus not only reprised his role as the Bruce, he also co-wrote the film's screenplay. Sadly, the film was mostly overlooked by critics and audiences, arguably due to the film Outlaw King (2018) released by Netflix the prior year. Angus later rebounded with a recurring role of Jor-El on the well-liked CW television series Superman & Lois (2021).50 moreRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pages
