Elizabeth PeñaActressDirectorRush Hour (1998)As she inherited her love for the arts by her father, well-known playwright, actor, director and novelist Mario Peña, it is not hard to understand that actress Elizabeth Pena already had designs to become an actress by the time she was eight years old.Born in Elizabeth, New Jersey on September 23, 1959, the petite (5' 2") actress was raised in New York City. Elizabeth's (and sister Tania's) parents, Cuban immigrants Mario and Estella Margarita Peña, would achieve a strong Latino reputation as the founders of the off-Broadway Latin-American Theatre Ensemble. They also encouraged Elizabeth's talent. In 1975, the young teenager became a founding member of the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors, and two years later graduated from New York's High School of Performing Arts, now the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts.Elizabeth found occasional work in repertory theater and in television commercials. Making her film debut in the independent Spanish-speaking feature El Super (1979), about Cuban refugees, she continued with playing a long line of independent and rebellious characters, which showed plenty of attitude and independence. Playing offbeat roles -- from a knife-threatening waitress to a disco queen -- she appeared in such early films as They All Laughed (1981) and Crossover Dreams (1985). Elizabeth's big break came in the form a support role in the hugely popular and entertaining comedy Down and Out in Beverly Hills (1986), co-starring Bette Midler, Richard Dreyfuss and Nick Nolte, in which she stole several scenes as the sultry, smoky-voiced, politically-minded maid Carmen.Two consecutive short-lived television series came about around this time. Her first, the ensemble comedy Tough Cookies (1986), had her playing a police officer, and the second was the title housekeeper role in the sitcom I Married Dora (1987). High in demand now, Elizabeth continued to spice up both the big and small screen in such roles as Ritchie Valens' stepsister-in-law in the well-received biopic La Bamba (1987); a drug enforcement agent in the miniseries Drug Wars: The Camarena Story (1990); PTSD-suffering Tim Robbins' live-in girlfriend in the complex drama Jacob's Ladder (1990); and a dedicated legal secretary on the corporate drama series Shannon's Deal (1990) starring Jamey Sheridan.Honors also came Elizabeth's way when she received the Independent Spirit and Bravo awards for the film Lone Star (1996), and four ALMA Awards for her performances in the television movie Contagious (1997), the films Tortilla Soup (2001) and Rush Hour (1998), and her regular role on the Latino drama series Resurrection Blvd. (2000).Into the millennium, Elizabeth found steady employment on television with guest roles on Boston Public (2000), CSI: Miami (2002), Without a Trace (2002), Numb3rs (2005), Ghost Whisperer (2005), Charlie's Angels (2011), Prime Suspect (2011), Common Law (2012), and Modern Family (2009). One of her last roles was on the television series Matador (2014). She also found herself further down the credits in films such as On the Borderline (2000), Transamerica (2005), The Lost City (2005), Mother and Child (2009), The Perfect Family (2011), Plush (2013), and Grandma (2015). Three other films -- Girl on the Edge (2015), Ana Maria in Novela Land (2015), and The Song of Sway Lake (2018) -- were released posthumously. She also provided a voice in the popular Disney/Pixar animated film The Incredibles (2004).A chronic alcohol problem severely hampered Elizabeth's life and she died suddenly from cirrhosis of the liver in Los Angeles, California on October 14, 2014, at age 55. She was survived by her second husband (from 1994), Hans Rolla, and their two children, son Kælan and daughter Fiona.6. Mickey RooneyActorProducerDirectorBabes in Arms (1939)Mickey Rooney was born Joe Yule Jr. on September 23, 1920 in Brooklyn,
New York. He first took the stage as a toddler in his parents
vaudeville act at 17 months old. He made his first film appearance in
1926. The following year, he played the lead character in the first
Mickey McGuire short film. It was in this popular film series that he
took the stage name Mickey Rooney. Rooney reached new heights in 1937
with A Family Affair, the film that introduced the country to Andy
Hardy, the popular all-American teenager. This beloved character
appeared in nearly 20 films and helped make Rooney the top star at the
box office in 1939, 1940 and 1941. Rooney also proved himself an
excellent dramatic actor as a delinquent in Boys Town (1938) starring Spencer Tracy. In 1938, he was awarded a Juvenile Academy Award.Teaming up with Judy Garland, Rooney also
appeared in a string of musicals, including Babes in Arms (1939) the
first teenager to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor in a leading role, Strike Up the Band (1940), Babes on Broadway (1941), and Girl Crazy (1943). He
and Garland immediately became best of friends. "We weren't just a
team, we were magic," Rooney once said. During that time he also
appeared with Elizabeth Taylor in the now classic National Velvet (1944). Rooney joined the service that same year, where he helped to entertain the troops and worked on the American Armed Forces Network.
He returned to Hollywood after 21 months in Love Laughs at Andy Hardy (1946), did a remake of a Robert Taylor film, The Crowd Roars (1932) called Killer McCoy (1947) and portrayed composer Lorenz Hart in Words and Music (1948). He also appeared in Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961),
starring Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard. Rooney played Hepburn's Japanese neighbor, Mr. Yunioshi. A sign of the times, Rooney played the part for comic relief which he later regretted feeling the role was offensive. He once again showed his incredible range in the dramatic
role of a boxing trainer with Anthony Quinn and Jackie Gleason in Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962). In the late 1960s and 1970s Rooney
showed audiences and critics alike why he was one of Hollywood's most
enduring stars. He gave an impressive performance in Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 film The Black Stallion (1979), which brought him an Academy Award nomination as Best Actor in a Supporting Role.
He also turned to the stage in 1979 in Sugar Babies with Ann Miller, and was nominated for a Tony Award. During that time he also portrayed
the Wizard in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz with Eartha Kitt at New York's
Madison Square Garden, which also had a successful run nationally.Rooney appeared in four television series': The Mickey Rooney Show (1954) (1954-1955), a comedy sit-com in 1964 with Sammee Tong called Mickey, One of the Boys in 1982 with Dana Carvey and Nathan Lane, and The New Adventures of the Black Stallion (1990) from 1990-1993. In 1981, Rooney won an Emmy Award for his portrayal of a mentally challenged man in Bill (1981). The critical acclaim continued to flow for the veteran performer, with Rooney receiving an honorary Academy Award "in recognition of his 60 years of versatility in a variety of memorable film performances". More recently he has appeared in such films as Night at the Museum (2006) with Ben Stiller and The Muppets (2011) with Amy Adams and Jason Segel.Rooney's personal life, including his frequent trips to the altar, has
proved to be just as epic as his on-screen performances. His first wife
was one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood, actress Ava Gardner. Mickey permanently separated from his eighth wife Jan in June of 2012. In 2011 Rooney filed elder abuse and fraud charges against stepson
Christopher Aber and Aber's wife. At Rooney's request, the Superior
Court issued a restraining order against the Aber's demanding they stay
100 yards from Rooney, as well as Mickey's other son Mark Rooney and Mark's wife Charlene. Just prior, Rooney mustered the strength to break his silence and appeared before the Senate in Washington D.C. telling of his own heartbreaking story of abuse in an effort to live a
peaceful, full life and help others who may be similarly suffering in
silence.Rooney requested through the Superior Court to permanently reside with
his son Mark Rooney, who is a musician and Marks wife Charlene, an artist, in the Hollywood Hills. He legally separated from his eighth
wife in June of 2012. Ironically, after eight failed marriages he never
looked or felt better and finally found happiness and peace in the
single life. Mickey, Mark and Charlene focused on health, happiness and
creative endeavors and it showed. Mickey Rooney had once again landed
on his feet reminding us that he was a survivor. Rooney died on April
6th 2014. He was taking his afternoon nap and never woke. One week
before his death Mark and Charlene surprised him by reunited him with a
long lost love, the racetrack. He was ecstatic to be back after decades
and ran into his old friends Mel Brooks and Dick Van Patten.7.

Romy SchneiderActressSoundtrackThat Most Important Thing: Love (1975)Romy Schneider was born on 23
September 1938 in Vienna, Austria into a family of actors. Making her
film debut at the age of 15, her breakthrough came two years later in
the very popular trilogy Sissi (1955). Her
mother, supervising her daughter's career, immediately approved Romy's
participation in Christine (1958), the
remake of Max Ophüls's
Playing at Love (1933), where
Magda Schneider once starred
herself. During the shooting, she fell in love with her co-star
Alain Delon and eventually moved with him to
Paris. At that time, she started her international career collaborating
with famous directors such as
Luchino Visconti and
Orson Welles. After Delon had broken up
with her in 1964, she married Harry Meyen
shortly after. Although she gave birth to a boy, David-Christopher,
their relationship was difficult, so they divorced in 1975. Being
unsatisfied with her personal life, she turned to alcohol and drugs,
but her cinematic career -especially in France- remained intact. She
was the first actress, receiving the new created César Award as "Best
Actress" for her role in
That Most Important Thing: Love (1975).
Three years later, she was awarded again for
A Simple Story (1978).
After a short marriage to her former secretary
Daniel Biasini, being the father of her
daughter Sarah Biasini, she suffered the
hardest blow of her life when her son was impaled on a fence in 1981.

Paris. Although it was suggested she committed suicide caused by an
overdose of sleeping pills, she was declared to have died from cardiac
arrest.19. Philippa NortheastActressTerritory (2024– )Philippa Northeast was born in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. She is an actress, known for Territory (2024), The Newsreader (2021) and My Brilliant Career.20. Henry SilvaActorThe Manchurian Candidate (1962)Henry Silva was born on September 23, 1926 in Brooklyn, New York. He quit public school to attend drama classes at age 13, supporting himself as a dishwasher in a Manhattan hotel. By 1955, Silva had moved up from dishwasher to waiter, and felt ready to audition for the Actors Studio. He was one of five students chosen out of more than 2500 applicants. When the Actors Studio staged Michael V. Gazzo's play "A Hatful of Rain" as a classroom project, it proved so successful it came to Broadway--with students Ben Gazzara, Shelley Winters, Harry Guardino, Anthony Franciosa and, of course, Silva in key roles. Called to Hollywood, he played a succession of heavies in films, including The Bravados (1958), Green Mansions (1959), Ocean's Eleven (1960), The Manchurian Candidate (1962) and Johnny Cool (1963).An Italian producer made Henry an offer he could not refuse--to star as a hero for a change--and he moved his family overseas. Silva's turning-point picture was a spaghetti Western, The Hills Run Red (1966), which made him a hot box office commodity in Spain, Italy, Germany and France. His popularity was enhanced by a gift for languages. He speaks Italian and Spanish fluently and has a flair for the kind of gritty, realistic roles that also catapulted Charles Bronson to European stardom. Returning to the United States, he co-starred with Frank Sinatra in the film Contract on Cherry Street (1977), then signed on as Buck Rogers' evil adversary Kane in Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (1979) and the television series of the same name. Silva now calls the San Fernando Valley home, but makes continual film forays back to Europe's production centers. A dedicated jogger, he puts in five miles a day "to keep in shape and relieve tension".21. Alex ProyasDirectorWriterProducerDark City (1998)Alex Proyas has moved
effortlessly between helming TV commercials and music videos to feature
films. Born to Greek parents in Egypt, Proyas
relocated to Australia with his family when he was three years old. He
began making films at age ten and went on to attend the Australian Film
Television and Radio School along with
Jane Campion and
Jocelyn Moorhouse. Proyas collaborated
with Campion on two of her shorts,
A Girl's Own Story (1984), for
which he wrote and performed a song, and
Passionless Moments (1983),
which he photographed. Proyas' own short,
Groping (1980), had earned him some
attention at festival screenings in Sydney and London. Also while still
a student, the enterprising novice formed Meaningful Eye Contact, a
production company.
Spirits of the Air: Gremlins of the Clouds (1987)
marked Proyas' feature debut as director and screenwriter. Set in a
post-apocalyptic world, the film, with its stylized production design
and aural texture, was atypical of standard Australian fare, more
closely resembling a longform music video. Critics admired the
director's vision, but felt the overall result was lacking. Proyas
continued to hone his craft helming TV advertisements for products like
Nike, Nissan and Swatch (earning kudos from advertising associations in
both Australia and England) and directing videos for such artists as
Sting, INXS and
Crowded House. In 1993 Proyas was tapped
to helm the screen adaptation of
James O'Barr's comic strip
The Crow (1994). During production, star
Brandon Lee died of an accidental
gunshot wound (ironically, the film's story revolves around his
character's resurrection). His death cast a pall over the remainder of
the filming and its subsequent theatrical release, although reviews
were generally favorably, most singling out the production values which
created a colorless rain-soaked wasteland that invoked comparisons with
Ridley Scott's seminal
Blade Runner (1982) and
Tim Burton's
Batman (1989). Made for about $14 million,
it grossed close to $50 million domestically. Proyas seemed set to move
on to other projects and was announced as the director of
Casper (1995), but left the project and
was replaced by Brad Silberling. After a
four-year absence he returned with another thriller,
Dark City (1998), about an amnesiac who
may or may not have been a serial killer.
Garage Days (2002) marked Proyas'
return to his homeland, Australia: the movie tells the story of a young
Sydney garage band desperately trying to make it big in the competitive
world of rock 'n' roll. In 2004 Proyas returned to Hollywood: he
directed I, Robot (2004), a
science-fiction film suggested by the
'Isaac
Asimov' short story compilation of the
same name that starred Will Smith. It
was a box office success, but met with mixed reactions by readers and
fans of the Asimov stories.22. Walter PidgeonActorSoundtrackHow Green Was My Valley (1941)Walter Pidgeon, a handsome, tall and dark-haired man, began his career
studying voice at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. He
then did theater, mainly stage musicals. He went to Hollywood in the
early 1920s, where he made silent films, including
Mannequin (1926) and
The Girl from Rio (1927). When talkies arrived,
Pidgeon made some musicals, but he never received top billing or
recognition in these. In 1937 MGM put him under contract, but only in
supporting roles and "the other man" roles, such as in
Saratoga (1937) opposite
Jean Harlow and
Clark Gable and in
The Girl of the Golden West (1938)
opposite Jeanette MacDonald and
Nelson Eddy. Although these two films were
big successes, Pidgeon was overlooked for his contributions to them.
MGM lent him out to Fox, where he finally had top billing, in
How Green Was My Valley (1941).
When he returned to MGM the studio tried to give him bigger roles, and
he was cast opposite his frequent co-star
Greer Garson. However, Garson seemed to
come up on top in
Blossoms in the Dust (1941)
and Mrs. Miniver (1942), although
Pidgeon did receive an Academy Award nomination for his role in the
latter film.Pidgeon remained with MGM through the mid-'50s, making films like
Dream Wife (1953) and
Hit the Deck (1955) with
Jane Powell and old pal
Gene Raymond. In 1956 Pidgeon left the
movies to do some work in the theater, but he returned to film in 1961.Pidgeon retired from acting in 1977. He suffered from several strokes
that eventually led to his death in 1984.23. Keri Lynn PrattActressA Single Man (2009)Keri Lynn Pratt was born on 23 September 1978 in Concord, New Hampshire, USA.
