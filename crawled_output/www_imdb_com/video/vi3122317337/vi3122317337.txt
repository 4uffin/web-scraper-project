The character was played by Henry Cavill ('Justice League,' 'The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare') in the first three seasons of the hit series.
Seasons 4 and 5 were shot back-to-back and will cover the final three books in the series. According to creator and showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich, “We’re thrilled to be able to bring Andrzej Sapkowski’s books to an epic and satisfying conclusion. It wouldn’t be our show if we didn’t push our family of characters to their absolute limit — stay tuned to see how the story ends.” The series is expected to conclude with Season 5.
Season 4 is set to premiere Oct. 30 on Netflix.
