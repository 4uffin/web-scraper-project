Join the conversation and make some noise about your favorite silent film here! Kirk-PicardEnter Here, Prospective Poll WriterThe current version of the IMDb polls started in 2013. Jessica asked in this poll : "If you haven't tried making polls, what is the main reason?" One of the options was: "I would like to, but I don't know how to begin." Another option was: "Seems too difficult or not enjoyable." As an experienced poll maker with a severe lack of English language skills at the beginning of writing my polls, I can confirm that there is good help to get started. There are guidelines for creating polls that you can find by clicking here . Now 285 of my polls are released (as of 09/11/2025) and I can say that creating polls has become easier. It's not really difficult, more like fun. If you would (just theoretically) start a poll idea, what kind of subject would you most likely use?
