Vought News will tell you it was the bravery of Cate Dunlap and Sam Riordan that saved the school just last year. However, if you watched "The Boys," you might have a different perspective. Something about an underground lab, a virus. There have even been sightings of traitorous enemies — Starlight and Billy Butcher. Season 2 of "Gen V" is sure to be a showcase of how these incredible students are molded into superior beings, maybe even a part of The Seven. Season 2 premieres on Prime Video Sept. 173.

Starring Jude Law and Jason Bateman as brothers set in New York City, we are eagerly waiting for more details to come out. The Netflix limited series will also serve as a reunion for Jason Bateman and Laura Linney, the former "Ozark" co-stars will direct different episodes of the mini-series. With the "King Richard" screenwriter Zach Baylin working on this original script, we are in for a sharply written and excellently directed limited series.Series premieres on Netflix Sept. 18 5.

Fans of the acclaimed show will also be happy to know that Apple has already renewed “Slow Horses” for a sixth season, so there are plenty of adventures to come for Jackson Lamb and his motley crew of reject intelligence agents.Season 5 premieres on Apple TV+ Sept. 24 11. Wayward20258 epsTV-MATV Mini Series6.9 (24)RateMark as watchedA bucolic but sinister town explores the insidious intricacies of the troubled teen industry, and the eternal struggle of the next generation.CreatorMae MartinStarsMae MartinToni CollettePatrick J. AdamsToni Collette running a troubled teen facility feels correct. "Wayward" is the new drama (which feels more like a mystery/thriller) from Mae Whitman, who formed a cult with their last Netflix series, "Feel Good." Whitman co-stars as a small-town cop who follows an investigative trail that leads to Collette's school, Shady Pines. I'm unsure why that's not the title of the series. Premieres on Netflix Sept. 2512. The Savant2025– 8 epsTV-MATV SeriesFollows the Savant, a top-secret investigator who infiltrates internet hate organizations to bring down the nation's most violent men.StarsJessica ChastainJames Badge DaleNnamdi AsomughaJessica Chastain stars in this eight-episode limited series about an undercover investigator's mission to infiltrate online hate groups and stop violent crimes before they occur.Premieres on Apple TV+ Sept. 2613. Chad Powers2025– 6 epsTV SeriesA disgraced college quarterback named Russ Holliday disguises himself as Chad Powers and walks onto a struggling southern football team to revive his football career.StarsGlen PowellSteve ZahnToby HussThis isn't the first time actor Glen Powell has played a Chad on the small screen (“Scream Queens,” anyone?), and yet his portrayal of Chad Powers in the new Hulu series of the same name may be the silliest. Co-created and produced by Powell and Michael Waldron (“Loki,” “Rick and Morty”), “Chad Powers” follows college quarterback Russ Holliday as he disguises himself in an attempt to return the game after his bad behavior gets him dismissed. If the premise sounds familiar, it may be because the show is inspired by a sketch from actual football star Eli Manning created for his “Eli’s Place” series on ESPN+. Along for the ride are a whole host of excellent comedic actors, including Steve Zahn, Toby Huss, Clayne Crawford, Perry Mattfeld, and Xavier Mills.Series premieres on Hulu Sept. 3014.

Monster2022– 28 epsTV-MATV Series7.8 (196K)RateMark as watchedAn anthology series about high-profile crimes or killers that captured public attention and notoriety.CreatorsIan BrennanRyan MurphyStarsEvan PetersRichard JenkinsCooper KochRyan Murphy’s controversial true crime series is returning in 2025, and this time the focus will be on serial killer Ed Gein. Charlie Hunnam stars as Gein, with Laure Metcalf joining the cast as his mother, Augusta. Let's just say the relationship between mother and son was disturbing. As dark as it is to say, Gein has long been a source of inspiration in Hollywood, influencing aspects of fictional killers like Psycho’s Norman Bates and The Silence of the Lambs’ Buffalo Bill. It seems that the murder’s status as a grotesque muse will be explored in the series, as it’s been announced Tom Hollander and Olivia Williams will portray Alfred and Alma Hitchcock in this third installment of the anthology series.Season 3 premieres on Netflix Oct. 216.
