Horror Recommendations on Netflixby IMDb-Editors • Created 3 weeks ago • Modified 6 days agoI dug through Netflix's horror page (all those carousels) and checked out a few things that had been getting stale on my Watchlist in order to offer up some recommendations. I'm a casual horror fan — no expert at all — but Weapons and Together made me want to dig a bit deeper in the genre lately. (Oh, and I figured most people have seen "Midnight Mass," "The Fall of the House of Usher," etc.) — Arno K.List activity58K views • 58K this weekCreate a new listList your movie, TV & celebrity picks.10 titlesSort byList orderList orderAlphabeticalIMDb ratingPopularityNumber of ratingsRelease dateRuntimeDate added1. Interview with the Vampire2022– 16 epsTV-MATV Series7.5 (34K)RateMark as watchedA vampire tells his epic story of love, blood, and the perils of immortality to a journalist.CreatorRolin JonesStarsJacob AndersonSam ReidAssad ZamanMy love for this series has turned into a monologue many times before. Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles benefits from longer-form storytelling, but there's no need to juxtapose the show with the Tom Cruise-Brad Pitt movie (which I love and saw in theaters as a recently out gay man back in '94). I could gush and overwrite; instead, I'll just say it's the series that rivals "Penny Dreadful" for me. Season 1 is streaming on Netflix, and Season 2 drops Sept. 30 (as part of AMC's deal with the streaming service). And Season 3 is in production for a 2026 release.2. Dracula19922h 8mR57Metascore7.4 (260K)RateMark as watchedCenturies-old vampire Count Dracula comes to England to seduce his barrister Jonathan Harker's fiancée Mina Murray and wreak havoc in the foreign land.DirectorFrancis Ford CoppolaStarsGary OldmanWinona RyderAnthony HopkinsPerhaps Nosferatu served as a gateway drug for some audiences, ones who weren't familiar yet with Francis Ford Coppola's fifth-best movie. If you've never seen Dracula, give Keanu and Winona's acting your most gracious patience and immerse yourself in the soapiest take on the son of the dragon (because "Dark Shadows" doesn't count). The seriously high drama is matched by enduring '90s art direction, production design, and Gary Oldman as the Count.3. All of Us Are Dead2022– 13 epsTV-MATV Series7.6 (84K)RateMark as watchedA high school becomes ground zero for a zombie virus outbreak. Trapped students must fight their way out or turn into one of the rabid infected.StarsPark Ji-huYoon Chan-youngCho Yi-hyunI'm only halfway through this series, and I 100% understand why fans are doing everything they can to avoid the zombie apocalypse while we wait until Season 2 is released sometime in 2026. 4. His House20201h 33mTV-1472Metascore6.4 (53K)RateMark as watchedA refugee couple makes a harrowing escape from war-torn South Sudan, but then they struggle to adjust to their new life in an English town that has an evil lurking beneath the surface.DirectorRemi WeekesStarsSope DirisuWunmi MosakuMalaika Wakoli-AbigabaBased on recommendations, I waited to watch this movie until I was in the right mood and mode for it: alone, down-tuned, and already haunted. This is the best original story on my list, and the movie features noteworthy atmosphere/sound design, too.5. Under the Shadow20161h 24mPG-1383Metascore6.8 (32K)RateMark as watchedAs a mother and daughter struggle to cope with the terrors of the post-revolution, war-torn Tehran of the 1980s, a mysterious evil begins to haunt their home.DirectorBabak AnvariStarsBobby NaderiNarges RashidiRay HaratianI kept seeing this Iranian movie mentioned in subreddits and on hidden gems lists. It pulls off a feat noteworthy horror films are capable of: being overtly political while remaining firmly rooted in genre or subgenre — psychological horror in this case.6. Archive 8120228 epsTV-MATV Series7.3 (65K)RateMark as watchedAn archivist hired to restore a collection of tapes finds himself reconstructing the work of a filmmaker and her investigation into a dangerous cult.CreatorRebecca SonnenshineStarsMamoudou AthieDina ShihabiEvan JonigkeitEver feel like some streaming series are a couple episodes too long but you'd still recommend them? That was the case for me with this found-footage series that should've lasted more than one season, but sticks its landing regardless. It's part Rosemary's Baby, part Silent Hill, and fully supported by Mamoudou Athie's square shoulders. And if any "Broad City" fans read this: Schiffilis has a supporting role! 7. Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities20228 epsTV-MATV Series7.0 (62K)RateMark as watchedBizarre nightmares unfold in eight tales of terror in a visually stunning, spine-tingling horror collection curated by Guillermo del Toro.CreatorGuillermo del ToroStarsLize JohnstonKevin KeppyEssie DavisGuillermo del Toro flexed a different creative muscle with this one-off anthology series, which feels like his take on "Goosebumps." I'd watch/re-watch during the ever-shortening gap between now and GDT's
Frankenstein.8. Veronica20171h 45mTV-MA6.2 (51K)RateMark as watchedMadrid, 1991. A teen girl finds herself besieged by an evil supernatural force after she played Ouija with two classmates.DirectorPaco PlazaStarsSandra EscacenaBruna GonzálezClaudia PlacerCool to see [REC] director Paco Plaza's Ouija board movie is still contacting fans from the spirit world nearly a decade after its release. The question of whether it's the scariest movie on Netflix is the sort of word-of-mouth money cannot buy. 9. Anaconda19971h 29mPG-1337Metascore4.9 (118K)RateMark as watchedA "National Geographic" film crew is taken hostage by an insane hunter, who forces them along on his quest to capture the world's largest - and deadliest - snake.DirectorLuis LlosaStarsJon VoightJennifer LopezEric StoltzAnaconda, wear your 4.9 IMDb rating as a badge of honor. You are one of the most re-watchable '90s cult classics, entirely deserving of the remake coming this December, which is paying tribute to your legend with a story about a group of fans setting out to make their own version of the movie. Travel back to a time when Eric Stoltz and Jennifer Lopez were an on-screen couple and Jon Voight's face acting is the real villain.10. The Perfection20181h 30mTV-MA60Metascore6.2 (52K)RateMark as watchedWhen troubled musical prodigy Charlotte seeks out Elizabeth, the new star pupil of her former school, the encounter sends both musicians down a sinister path with shocking consequences.DirectorRichard ShepardStarsMarie MaskellAllison WilliamsChristina JastrzembskaSometimes the way I describe a movie worth watching is: It kept me off of my phone. Recommended not just for Allison Williams Horror Completists, The Perfection isn't quite in the same league as Get Out or M3GAN, but this body horror confection (that rightly is compared to Black Swan), ranks ahead of M3GAN 2.0, for sure.More to exploreRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessFollow IMDb on socialGet the IMDb AppFor Android and iOSHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb DataPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top
