ExportCopy15 Festival Favorites From TIFF 2025by IMDb-Editors • Created 2 days ago • Modified 1 day agoBack in action for the 2025 Toronto International Film Festival, I had hoped to screen 50 films in honor of TIFF’s 50th Anniversary (or TIFFTY), but alas, my doctor advised me otherwise, and I caught only 21 films in six days of movie madness. With thanks to TIFF’s expert programmers, I screened Oscars frontrunners (e.g. Sentimental Value and Hamnet), buzzworthy titles that deliver the goods (Frankenstein and The Lost Bus), standouts from Cannes (It Was Just an Accident and Nouvelle Vague), Midnight Madness choice cuts (Obsession and The Napa Boys), the latest from filmmakers I love (Chandler Levack’s Mile End Kicks and Anders Thomas Jensen’s The Last Viking), and so much more (like, Christy!). So, here are 15 favorites that I hope you will love as much as I do. — Alex LoganList activity5.5K views • 5.5K this weekCreate a new listList your movie, TV & celebrity picks.15 titlesSort byList orderList orderAlphabeticalIMDb ratingPopularityNumber of ratingsRelease dateRuntimeDate added1. It Was Just an Accident20251h 45mPG-1389Metascore7.8 (962)RateMark as watchedA small mishap triggers a chain reaction of ever-growing problems.DirectorJafar PanahiStarsVahid MobasseriMariam AfshariEbrahim AziziHere’s a movie that instantly made me want to marathon the director’s entire filmography. Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi has been arrested for his art; Accident and his past five features were illegally shot in his home country. Despite the injustice he suffers, Panahi retains his compassion and channels it into a satirical revenge story that is more human drama than searing commentary in which a former political prisoner named Vahid believes he recognizes the distinctive squeak of his torturer’s artificial leg, but having been blindfolded during their past encounters, he does the only sensible thing – Vahid locks the suspected torturer in the back of his work van and hauls him around the city to ask other former political prisoners if they can identify the guilty party. What ensues is a gutting tale of traumatized people triggering their suppressed pain that is suddenly funny when you least expect it to be. But, it’s always human, always compassionate.2. Hamnet20252h 5m90Metascore8.4 (315)RateMark as watchedA powerful story of love and loss that inspired the creation of Shakespeare's timeless masterpiece, Hamlet.DirectorChloé ZhaoStarsJessie BuckleyPaul MescalZac WishartHumanity! Heart! Hamnet! I was worried that the “Shakespeare’s dead kid” movie was going to be a major bummer, especially at 9 in the morning, but writer/director Chloé Zhao is an empath who turns feelings – even the ones that hurt the most – into pure cinema. Jessie Buckley will be the one to beat for Best Actress, and for my money, Jacobi Jupe, who plays the titular doomed son, gave the most emotional performance by a child ... perhaps ever? Based on Maggie O’Farrell’s novel, Hamnet proffers that the Immortal Bard (played by Paul Mescal) concentrated the pain of losing his 11-year-old boy into writing "Hamlet," just as Zhao transforms the tragedy of loss into a wistful whimsy in her every frame of celluloid. Cinematographer Łukasz Żal and composer Max Richter combine forces with Zhao to create a pastoral dreamscape akin to Terrence Malick’s Days of Heaven.3. Obsession20251h 40m7.7 (53)RateMark as watchedA hopeless romantic's wish for his crush's love triggers a dark enchantment in Curry Barker's eerie directorial debut.DirectorCurry BarkerStarsMichael JohnstonInde NavarretteCooper TomlinsonThe clean, rad, and powerful simplicity of this film’s premise is matched by how freaky it’s willing to get while interrogating that central concept: What happens when a boy’s wish that a girl loved him more than anyone else alive comes true? The answer is obviously “bad stuff” in writer/director Curry Barker’s debut horror feature that was the talk of TIFF’s Midnight Madness. The filmmaker first gained attention with darkly comic shorts on YouTube, like 2024’s Milk & Serial, and is on a similar trajectory to Talk to Me directors Danny and Michael Philippou. This first film is likewise a killer opening and showcase for actress Inde Navarrette, who steals the show with a truly committed (to an insane asylum) performance as the girl afflicted by the boy’s not-so-innocent wish. The film’s final images were hard to shake, but the thrills (and laughs) were worth any and all psychological damage.4. Mile End Kicks20251h 45m73Metascore6.9 (35)RateMark as watchedA 24-year-old music critic gets romantically involved with members of an indie band she decides to publicize, set against Montreal's indie music scene in 2011.DirectorChandler LevackStarsJay BaruchelDevon BostickBarbie Ferreira“Euphoria” breakout Barbie Ferreira transcends her past supporting roles to become a winning lead in the story of a flawed-but-dedicated Canadian rock journalist who moves to Montreal to write a book about an alt-rock patron saint of the Great North, Alanis Morissette. Boys, roommates, and indie bands with their own inner turmoil complicate her quest in what could have been another twee tale of an idealistic dreamer who is too pure and naive to realize her big city dreams, but filmmaker Chandler Levack’s writing is as diamond-sharp in its satire (Pere Ubu does suck. I’m from Ohio, so I can say that!) as it is precisely layered in its relationship dynamics — and not just in matters of love, but in learning to become a decent friend, too. Levack’s first feature I Like Movies is a must-watch as well, but only if you like to cringe while you laugh (and cry). Additional kudos go to Jay Baruchel for playing the stand-in punching bag for womankind’s collective rage at manipulative and creepy bosses.5. Frankenstein20252h 29mR74Metascore7.3 (855)RateMark as watchedA brilliant but egotistical scientist brings a creature to life in a monstrous experiment that ultimately leads to the undoing of both the creator and his tragic creationDirectorGuillermo del ToroStarsOscar IsaacJacob ElordiChristoph WaltzWith his heart on his sleeve and a devilish grin on his lips, Mexican auteur Guillermo del Toro explained that adapting Mary Shelley’s masterwork into a personal fable of fathers and sons is “like marrying a widow – you have to respect the memory of the late husband. But on Saturday, you gotta party on.” Oscar Isaac plays the bad dad/mad scientist Dr. Victor Frankenstein, while Jacob Elordi absolutely disappears, physically and vocally, into the role of del Toro’s misunderstood monster, whose reanimated tissue is the beating heart of this extremely earnest and epic morality play. Sure, there may be too much of Victor’s childhood in Act I, then these chintzy CGI wolves look like leftovers from The Day After Tomorrow, and there are a few trademark on-the-nose lines, like “Victor, you’re the monster!” But, the visual spectacle of del Toro’s rip-roaring retelling hits harder than the Creature’s super-powered punches that literally break a man’s back in half during the film’s arctic ass-kicking of an opening.6. Christy20252h 15m57Metascore5.3 (607)RateMark as watchedTells the story of Christy Martin, the most successful female boxer of the 90s.DirectorDavid MichôdStarsSydney SweeneyColeman PedigoMerritt WeverIn the hackneyed parlance of a pugilist, Christy is a knockout that lingers in the ring for one round too many before “peekaboo” punching audiences in the guts with a harrowing survival story that I won’t spoil in case you aren’t familiar with the real-life bio of boxer Christy Martin. I wasn’t, and the climax left me agog. Agog, I tell you! Sydney Sweeney convincingly bobs and weaves in her custom pink tank tops and trunks, probably just enough to earn a nomination (if there’s room at the Academy for two fighters this year, assuming Dwayne Johnson will hit the campaign trail hard with The Smashing Machine). But, her performance “works” because of writer/director David Michôd’s subtle skill of loading all the hurt and rage of the real Christy behind Sweeney’s doe-eyes. Life’s incessant body-blows back her into a corner, until she explodes forth with the pent-up anger of a caged animal. Ben Foster could also earn his own much-deserved awards buzz, unless audiences are too repulsed by what might be his most detestable villain role yet. Still, you gotta admire the guy for never shying away from a heel turn.7. Sentimental Value20252h 13m90Metascore7.8 (2.7K)RateMark as watchedAn intimate exploration of family, memories, and the reconciliatory power of art.DirectorJoachim TrierStarsRenate ReinsveStellan SkarsgårdInga Ibsdotter LilleaasOpening with what feels like familiar territory for Joachim Trier, the brilliant mind behind The Worst Woman in the World, his latest expands beyond one alluring basket case (again played by the exceptional Renate Reinsve), to detail an estranged Scandinavian family of traumatized traumatizers and the home that holds generations of their secrets. Stellan Skarsgård just breaks your heart as the failed patriarch, a fading filmmaker who makes a last ditch attempt to undo years of neglect by casting Reinsve, an accomplished stage actress, in the lead role of his autobiographical comeback feature. When his daughter rejects him, Skarsgård casts a young starlet (Elle Fanning), who desperately wants to be taken seriously. While it can sometimes feel like Trier is aping an Ingmar Bergman movie about making a different Ingmar Bergman movie, this isn’t only for film nerds. The self-reflexiveness is earned and then balanced by the delicate performances of Reinsve, Skarsgård, Fanning, and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, who plays the saner of the two sisters.8. Roofman20252h 6mR67Metascore7.4 (172)RateMark as watchedA charismatic criminal, while on the run from the police, hides on the roof of a toy store. There, he adopts a new identity and becomes involved with an employee, beginning a relationship as unlikely as it is risky.DirectorDerek CianfranceStarsChanning TatumKirsten DunstLaKeith StanfieldBlue Valentine and The Place Beyond the Pines are the kinds of movies that people warn you about
—
do not watch without tissues, an emotional support animal, and a clear conscience regarding your romantic history, because otherwise, writer/director Derek Cianfrance will make your soul hurt. But, what if that masterful manipulator set his sights on ... charming an audience? And then, he hired the winsome pair of Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst to play his star-crossed lovers? Plus, he filled out the cast, even the small roles, with ringers like Peter Dinklage, Juno Temple, LaKeith Stanfield, Uzo Aduba, and Ben Mendelsohn? You’d only have to ask, "When can I see this absolute delight that mixes Mrs. Doubtfire (no, really, Cianfrance told me it was the biggest inspiration for Roofman during our interview) and Raising Arizona, but places them in a real-world, true-crime yarn that feels a bit too strange to be true?" Well, meet me October 10 at your local cinema, friend! I’ll buy the popcorn, you bring the therapy animal – you won’t need the support for Roofman, unless someone starts talking about that part in Blue Valentine when Gosling... oh no, here come the waterworks!9. The Napa Boys20251h 32m6.8 (20)RateMark as watchedIn the tradition of American Pie, Lord of the Rings, and Wet Hot American Summer comes a new installment in a beloved IP franchise: The Napa Boys are back - and for the first time, in this anarchic alt-comedy spoof.DirectorNick CorirossiStarsArmen WeitzmanNick CorirossiSarah RamosA no-budget indie comedy that lovingly lampoons Sideways as well as a few dozen familiar films that still rattle around self-described movie buffs’ collective unconscious. The satirical slings and arrows come from a place of love, a pair of true cineastes – writer/director/star Nick Corirossi, the mad genius behind Bolt Driver, a criminally under-seen jam on “Taxi Driver but for the Gig Economy,” and writer/star Armen Weitzman, the hilarious butler Garfield on “Another Period.” The duo assembles a murderers’ row of L.A. comedians (Mike Mitchell, Riki Lindhome, Paul Rust, David Wain) and a few choice celebrity cameos (Ray Wise, Chloe Cherry, Jay, AND Silent Bob) for a twisted trip through Wine Country as only Alexander Payne could have envisioned and shot it ... even when a wine barrel is being used as a toilet. 10. The Lost Bus20252h 9mR64Metascore7.3 (254)RateMark as watchedA wayward school bus driver and a dedicated school teacher battle to save 22 children from a terrifying inferno.DirectorPaul GreengrassStarsMatthew McConaugheyAmerica FerreraYul VazquezSpeed + Volcano, with the watertight direction of Paul Greengrass (United 93, Captain Phillips), and a pair of outstanding performances from a hard-luck Matthew McConaughey and a determined America Ferrera, The Lost Bus maneuvers past the ‘90s disaster thriller genre to which the film is so clearly indebted, mainly with stunning visual effects that will make you believe that Greengrass actually recreated hell on earth ... then drove a busload of kids through the middle of it! Based on the true account of a school bus driver and an elementary teacher’s race to rescue 22 children from the rapidly spreading wildfires that consumed acres of Northern California during the 2018 Camp Fire, this ride is best on a big screen, but I suspect most everyone will idle their engines until it hits Apple TV+ on Oct 3. 11. Nouvelle Vague20251h 46mR72Metascore7.4 (553)RateMark as watchedAfter writing for Cahiers du cinéma, young Godard decides making films is the best film criticism. He gets Beauregard to fund a low-budget feature, creating a treatment with Truffaut about a gangster couple.DirectorRichard LinklaterStarsGuillaume MarbeckZoey DeutchAubry DullinDirector Richard Linklater churns out films more often than I go see the dentist (he had TWO period-set features at TIFF this year). I opted for his French language film history lesson that has to be the most engrossing educational tool ever made. College professors must be rubbing their hands in anticipation – finally, a movie that introduces all the notable names from the 1960s French New Wave (or, Nouvelle Vague) before launching into a day-by-day recap of Breathless (1960), and how critic-turned-director Jean-Luc Godard (played by Guillaume Marbeck in the darkest set of sunglasses) changed cinema forever by virtue of his on-set inexperience and his exuberantly contrarian choices that all fly in the face of his frustrated American star, Jean Seberg (luminously embodied by Zoey Deutsch). In the end, Godard and Seberg chisel a 90-minute masterpiece from the raw marble of a girl and a gun, while Linklater codifies a movement in stone for all of us who weren’t around to catch it the first time ‘round.12. Sirât20251h 55m82Metascore7.2 (4.6K)RateMark as watchedA father, accompanied by his son, goes looking for his missing daughter in North Africa.DirectorOliver LaxeStarsSergi LópezBruno Núñez ArjonaStefania GaddaThe bleak, big truck energy of Henri-Georges Clouzot’s The Wages of Fear, or William Friedkin’s tough-guy remake Sorcerer, is imbued into the soul of this French and Spanish co-production that sets its suicide mission in the deserts of Morocco during a time of an unspecified war breaking out around the edges of the frame. Luis (heartbreakingly played by Sergi López) and his teen son Estaban (Bruno Núñez Arjona) stick out like sore thumbs at the crust-punk rave that sets the tone and canvas for this saga of sand, blood, and disaster. The pair are searching for Estaban’s missing sister, so they follow a two-truck convoy of desert dwellers to another, even more remote rave. But, their journey is doomed from the jump as it spirals from setback to tragedy, until it ends in the middle of a literal minefield. 13. The Last Viking20251h 56m82Metascore7.2 (170)RateMark as watchedA bank robber released from jail must unlock his traumatised brother's memory to recover stolen loot.DirectorAnders Thomas JensenStarsMads MikkelsenNikolaj Lie KaasSofie GråbølHere’s another where I love the director’s work so dearly that I bought a ticket without reading a synopsis. And then, here’s a film that almost defies being synopsized into a brief log line. Like Men & Chicken and Riders of Justice, two all-timers for me, writer/director Anders Thomas Jensen cranks the dark humor up to eleven for this wild fable of brothers trying to retrieve a buried loot. The great Mads Mikkelsen leads all three of Jensen’s directorial efforts, always playing a drastically different role. In fact, Nikolaj Lie Kaas, Nicolas Bro, and Lars Brygmann also carry over from the other films, a stock company of Danish comedic deviants who are fully on board for Jensen’s non-stop chaos that dashes between a history of Viking society in Denmark, a bank robbery, a hospital escape, the forming of a Beatles tribute act (of mental patients with dissociative identity disorders) that quickly transforms into an ABBA cover act instead, and a reckoning with the abuse the brothers suffered at the hands of their father. The zig-zagging tone may make your head spin, but if you hang on tight, this bumpy ride pays off with a lot of heart.14. Ballad of a Small Player20251h 41mR48Metascore6.0 (155)RateMark as watchedWhen his past and his debts start to catch up with him, a high-stakes gambler laying low in Macau encounters a kindred spirit who might just hold the key to his salvation.DirectorEdward BergerStarsColin FarrellTilda SwintonAlex JenningsDirector Edward Berger's lightweight follow-up to papal thriller Conclave attempts to channel Wong Kar-wai and Bi Gan for a neon-soaked lost weekend in the lush hotels and dark alleys of Macau’s gambling paradise/purgatory. Colin Farrell was made to smooth a John Waters-style pencil thin mustache as a degenerate card shark, and Tilda Swinton is in her comfort zone as the mysterious kook trailing Farrell, but this trip is only about the sightseeing, failing to dig below the grime and blood-soaked streets. I still recommend the virtual visit to Macau and pretty much anything with Farrell playing a dirtbag.15. Eternity20251h 52mPG-1364Metascore7.6 (142)RateMark as watchedIn an afterlife where souls have one week to decide where to spend eternity, Joan is faced with the impossible choice between the man she spent her life with and her first love, who died young and has waited decades for her to arrive.DirectorDavid FreyneStarsMiles TellerElizabeth OlsenCallum TurnerIt’s Albert Brooks’ Defending Your Life meets Celine Song’s Past Lives (Defending Your Past Lives?) as a recently-deceased Elizabeth Olsen struggles to choose whether she spends eternity with her first love who died in the war (the hunky Callum Turner), or her husband of 65 years (a nebbishy Miles Teller), while the lovers’ triangle fumbles through the sumptuous production design of a mid-century modern limbo. What ensues is as light on its feet as it is funny and charming, at least for the first 90 minutes, but afraid to close on a satisfying, if melancholy downbeat, the movie instead vamps for another 20 minutes, breaking all of its own rules and lore to get to a double happy ending that no one needs. Maybe it’ll work for you, maybe it won’t. Regardless, Olsen and her plucky Afterlife Coordinators played by Da’Vine Joy Randolph and John Early are too much fun to throw this baby out with the bathwater.More to exploreRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessFollow IMDb on socialGet the IMDb AppFor Android and iOSHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoLicense IMDb DataPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2025 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top
