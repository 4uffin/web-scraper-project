Black Phone 220251h 54mR71MetascoreAs Finn, now 17, struggles with life after his captivity, his sister begins receiving calls in her dreams from the black phone and seeing disturbing visions of three boys being stalked at a winter camp known as Alpine Lake.DirectorScott DerricksonStarsEthan HawkeMason ThamesJeremy DaviesPart Dream Warriors-era Freddy Krueger, part ‘80s sleepaway camp slasher, Black Phone 2 is meaner, gorier, and gives Madeleine McGraw a larger role battling The Grabber (Ethan Hawke) alongside the teen-angsty Mason Thames. Author Joe Hill (who wrote the original short story) pitched the sequel idea to director Scott Derrickson, which retcons some Grabber lore and fuels a new mystery for the plucky heroes to solve.2. The Evil That Binds Us2025RateMark as watchedIn 1950s rural Chile, a German family's calm shatters when a city relative visits. A teen's connection with a farmhand's daughter exposes family racism and violent past, triggering his anger despite attempts to hide it.DirectorNico PostiglioneStarsFernanda FinsterbuschCatrin StriebeckTilo WernerPossibly my favorite film that I screened at Fantastic Fest this year, this Chile-Mexico co-production from director Nico Postiglione had me hooked from the first frame. More of a dark drama than horror, the mystery at the heart of The Evil That Binds Us unfolds beautifully through some wonderful visual storytelling and several riveting performances.3. V/H/S/Halloween2025A collection of Halloween-themed videotapes unleashes a series of twisted, blood-soaked tales, turning trick-or-treat into a struggle for survival.DirectorsCasper KellyBryan M. FergusonR.H. NormanStarsLawson GreysonSarah NicklinJenna HoganThe brainchild of Brad Miska — founder of online horror website Bloody Disgusting — the V/H/S franchise just keeps going. And why wouldn't it? The marriage of two great horror sub-genres (found footage + anthology) has resulted in an endless trove of video delights, and this eighth installment might be the best in the series. Seriously. And if you’re really into the sub-genre, take a look at this Watchlist hand-picked by the directors of V/H/S/Halloween.4. Shelby Oaks20241h 39mR55Metascore5.7 (433)RateMark as watchedA woman's desperate search for her long-lost sister falls into obsession upon realizing that the imaginary demon from their childhood may have been real.DirectorChris StuckmannStarsCamille SullivanBrendan Sexton IIIMichael BeachBest known for his popular YouTube channel (which boasts over 2 million subscribers), director Chris Stuckmann crafted a creepy mix of found footage, mystery, and absolutely grisly terror. His vision for Shelby Oaks earned the support of NEON and executive producer Mike Flanagan and will be serving up a nice treat for horror hounds this spooky season.5. Primate20251h 29m6.0 (11)RateMark as watchedHome from college, Lucy reunites with family including pet chimp Ben. Ben contracts rabies during a pool party and turns aggressive. Lucy and friends barricade in pool, devising ways to survive the vicious chimp.DirectorJohannes RobertsStarsTroy KotsurKevin McNallyJohnny SequoyahWe’re always looking for a new worthy addition to Our Favorite "When Animals Attack" Movies, and Primate earns a spot with its practical effects and creatively gruesome kills. 6. Vicious20251h 38mR6.2 (81)RateMark as watchedA woman spends the night fighting for her existence as she slips down a rabbit hole contained inside a gift from a late-night visitorDirectorBryan BertinoStarsDakota FanningRachel BlanchardMary McCormackDakota Fanning is given a mysterious box and instructed to place three things inside: something you need, something you hate, and something you love. I had SO MANY questions going in, and believe me, the answers director Bryan Bertino (writer-director of the original The Strangers) are not
pretty.7. Coyotes20251h 32mRTrapped in their Hollywood Hills home, a family fights for survival when caught between a raging wildfire and a pack of savage coyotes.DirectorColin MinihanStarsMila HarrisBrittany AllenJustin LongTrigger warning: The dog(s) definitely die in Coyotes, as a pack of bloodthirsty canines terrorize on- and off-screen couple Justin Long and Kate Bosworth in this horror-comedy from director Colin Minihan (Grave Encounters).8. Mother of Flies20251h 32m6.7 (41)RateMark as watchedWhen a young woman faces a deadly diagnosis, she seeks dark magic from a witch in the woods - but every cure has costsDirectorsJohn AdamsZelda AdamsToby PoserStarsJohn AdamsLulu AdamsZelda AdamsThe Adams family have made a staggering eight features in the last 12 years. The latest from the filmmakers behind 2021’s Hellbender and who produce, write, direct, edit, score, and act in their movies, is a witchy work of art, with gorgeous visuals and a story that speaks to the disillusionment of modern science.9. Silent Night, Deadly Night202518+A child witnesses his parents' murder by a man in a Santa suit. Years later, as an adult, he dons a Santa costume himself and embarks on a violent quest for retribution against those responsible for the traumatic event from his childhood.DirectorMike P. NelsonStarsRohan CampbellRuby ModineMark AchesonChristmas came early with the first of four Secret Screenings at Fantastic Fest. Sunday night’s movie was a reboot of the ultra-sleazy ‘80s slasher Silent Night, Deadly Night. Directed Mike P. Nelson, the new version reframes the killer in a Santa Claus suit as a “Dexter”-like anti-hero. Rohan Campbell (The Monkey, Halloween Ends) is terrific as the killer, and there are enough twists, laughs, and kills in Silent Night, Deadly Night to recommend watching it in the theater this December.10. Sisu: Road to Revenge20251h 28m7.4 (13)RateMark as watchedA man returns to dismantle his family's house, where they were murdered in war, to rebuild it elsewhere. When the killer, a Red Army commander, tracks him down, a brutal cross-country pursuit begins.DirectorJalmari HelanderStarsStephen LangRichard BrakeJorma TommilaDirector Jelmari Helander's original Sisu is frequently regarded as Finland's John Wick, filled with violent set pieces, gorgeous landscapes, and a stoic performance from the weathered Jorma Tommila as a gold prospector hunting down Nazis. A sequel could have just been more of the same, but Helander (who also helmed the evil Santa Claus flick Rare Exports) cranked up the volume with even crazier action sequences and added Stephen Lang (Avatar, Don't Breathe) as a foil to Tommila's Aatami. 11. Reflet dans un diamant mort20251h 27m6.4 (534)RateMark as watchedA retired spy suspects his former adversaries have resurfaced when his intriguing neighbor vanishes.DirectorsHélène CattetBruno ForzaniStarsFabio TestiYannick RenierKoen De BouwEver since I saw directors Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani's The Strange Colour of Your Body's Tears, I've been fascinated by their unique aesthetic of '70s giallo on overdrive.12. Appofeniacs20251h 30m8.4 (28)RateMark as watchedThe use of AI technology reaches its most violent and bloody conclusion after a series of deepfake videos are unleashed into the world.DirectorChris Marrs PilieroStarsSean GunnJermaine FowlerMichael Abbott Jr.The kinetic trailer for Chris Marrs Piliero's Appofeniacs looks like a lost episode of "Black Mirror," or possibly what was happening down in the real world while the billionaires of Mountainhead were holed up watching the world burn. Now imagine that premise in a Tarantino-like narrative complete with time jumps, interconnected storylines, and monologues galore.13. Dracula20252h 50m5.4 (66)RateMark as watchedIn modern-day Transylvania, vampire hunts and labor strikes collide with sci-fi twists, romance, and AI-crafted tales, as multiple storylines blend folklore, classic horror, and contemporary elements into a fresh take on Dracula's legend.DirectorRadu JudeStarsSerban PavluIlinca ManolacheGabriel SpahiuRomanian director Radu Jude's multi-faceted riff on Dracula made immediate headlines on its Locarno Film Festival world premiere, mostly for being a wild mess of a movie, jammed full of genres, storylines, and asides. At nearly three hours, it's not an easy film to slot into a film fest schedule. But Dracula completists will not want to miss it.14. The Cramps: A Period Piece20251h 29m18+9.0 (5)RateMark as watchedAgnes defies her strict family by working at a salon, but her newfound independence is challenged when her menstrual cramps manifest as actual monsters, merging her real and nightmare worlds.DirectorBrooke H. CellarsStarsLauren KitchenMartini BearJared BankensDirector Brooke H. Cellars' debut feature draws its inspiration from auteurs like Federico Fellini, Mario Bava, and John Waters to create a body horror comedy like none you've ever seen.15. The Strangers: Chapter 220251h 36mR33Metascore5.0 (166)RateMark as watchedOn the final day of their cross country road trip, a couple's vehicle breaks down, forcing them to take refuge in a remote Airbnb. As night falls, three masked strangers terrorize them until dawn.DirectorRenny HarlinStarsMadelaine PetschGabriel BassoEma HorvathWhether or not you are a fan of 2024's relaunch of the Strangers franchise doesn't matter. The Strangers: Chapter 1 — the first of an announced trilogy — pulled in $48 million worldwide on an $8 million budget. Audiences LOVE the Strangers, and star Madelaine Petsch ("Riverdale") and director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) are back with Chapter 2. The third installment is expected to invade theaters in early 2026.
