Black Phone 2Releases Oct 17, 20251h 54mRAs Finn, now 17, struggles with life after his captivity, his sister begins receiving calls in her dreams from the black phone and seeing disturbing visions of three boys being stalked at a winter camp known as Alpine Lake.DirectorScott DerricksonStarsEthan HawkeMason ThamesArianna RivasDefinitely the most high-profile offering in the slate, Black Phone 2 makes its world premiere at the festival. Scott Derrickson is back in the director's chair, with Ethan Hawke (somehow) returning as the Grabber, and Mason Thames back as our hero, hot off the blockbuster success of How to Train Your Dragon. 2. V/H/S/HalloweenReleases Oct 3, 2025A collection of Halloween-themed videotapes unleashes a series of twisted, blood-soaked tales, turning trick-or-treat into a struggle for survival.DirectorsCasper KellyBryan M. FergusonR.H. NormanStarsLawson GreysonSarah NicklinJenna HoganThe brainchild of Brad Miska — founder of online horror website Bloody Disgusting — the V/H/S franchise just keeps going. And why wouldn't it? The marriage of two great horror sub-genres (found footage + anthology) has resulted in an endless trove of video delights, and this eighth installment carries on the tradition of featuring new blood and veteran shock-meisters (including REC director Paco Plaza!).3. Shelby OaksReleases Oct 24, 20251h 39mR58Metascore5.7 (412)RateMark as watchedA woman's desperate search for her long-lost sister falls into obsession upon realizing that the imaginary demon from their childhood may have been real.DirectorChris StuckmannStarsCamille SullivanBrendan Sexton IIIMichael BeachChris Stuckmann is best known as a film critic on his popular YouTube channel (which boasts over 2 million subscribers), but he found the backing of both NEON and executive producer Mike Flanagan to bring his vision Shelby Oaks to life. I'm rooting for Stuckmann, who's a true fan of cinema and has earned a shot at scaring the bejeezus out of horror fans like me. 4. The Cramps: A Period Piece20251h 29m18+RateMark as watchedAgnes Applewhite, a blossoming young woman caught between her sanctimonious mother and tightly wound sister, defies her family's expectations by taking a job as a shampoo girl at a lively beauty salon. As she thrives in this new colorful world, she is suddenly confronted by debilitating menstrual cramps that become real-life monsters, blurring the line between reality and nightmare.DirectorBrooke H. CellarsStarsLauren KitchenMartini BearJared BankensDirector Brooke H. Cellars' debut feature draws its inspiration from auteurs like Federico Fellini, Mario Bava, and John Waters to create a body horror comedy like none you've ever seen.5. PrimateExpected Jan 9, 20261h 29mHome from college, Lucy reunites with family including pet chimp Ben. Ben contracts rabies during a pool party and turns aggressive. Lucy and friends barricade in pool, devising ways to survive the vicious chimp.DirectorJohannes RobertsStarsKevin McNallyCharlie MannVictoria WyantAlways looking for a new worthy addition to Our Favorite "When Animals Attack" Movies.6.

I have SO MANY questions, but will trust I'm in good hands with director Bryan Bertino, the writer-director of the original The Strangers and many more.7. CoyotesReleases Oct 3, 20251h 32mRTrapped in their Hollywood Hills home, a family fights for survival when caught between a raging wildfire and a pack of savage coyotes.DirectorColin MinihanStarsMila HarrisBrittany AllenJustin LongTrigger warning: The dog(s) definitely die in Coyotes, as a pack of bloodthirsty canines terrorize on- and off-screen couple Justin Long and Kate Bosworth in this horror-comedy from director Colin Minihan (Grave Encounters).8. Reflet dans un diamant mort20251h 27m6.4 (529)RateMark as watchedA retired spy suspects his former adversaries have resurfaced when his intriguing neighbor vanishes.DirectorsHélène CattetBruno ForzaniStarsFabio TestiYannick RenierKoen De BouwEver since I saw directors Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani's The Strange Colour of Your Body's Tears, I've been fascinated by their unique aesthetic of '70s giallo on overdrive. 9. Sisu: Road to RevengeReleases Nov 21, 20251h 28mA man returns to dismantle his family's house, where they were murdered in war, to rebuild it elsewhere. When the killer, a Red Army commander, tracks him down, a brutal cross-country pursuit begins.DirectorJalmari HelanderStarsStephen LangRichard BrakeJorma TommilaDirector Jelmari Helander's original Sisu was considered Finland's John Wick, as a gold prospector hunts down and gets revenge on fleeing Nazis. It featured wild, violent set pieces, gorgeous landscapes, and a stoic performance from the weathered Jorma Tommila. Did it need a sequel? Probably not. But Helander (who also helmed the evil Santa Claus flick Rare Exports) has upped the ante with insane action set pieces and added Stephen Lang (Avatar, Don't Breathe) as a foil to Tommila's Aatami. I'm in.10. Mother of Flies20251h 32m6.7 (34)RateMark as watchedWhen a young woman faces a deadly diagnosis, she seeks dark magic from a witch in the woods - but every cure has costsDirectorsJohn AdamsZelda AdamsToby PoserStarsJohn AdamsLulu AdamsZelda AdamsI'm always in for a good witch movie, and the title — which conjures memories of Dario Argento's "witch trilogy" — hooked me.11. Appofeniacs20251h 30m8.3 (24)RateMark as watchedThe use of AI technology reaches its most violent and bloody conclusion after a series of deepfake videos are unleashed into the world.DirectorChris Marrs PilieroStarsJermaine FowlerSean GunnMichael Abbott Jr.The kinetic trailer for Chris Marrs Piliero's Appofeniacs looks like a lost episode of "Black Mirror" or possibly what was happening down in the real world while the billionaires of Mountainhead were holed up watching the world burn. 12. DraculaReleases Oct 31, 20252h 50m5.2 (61)RateMark as watchedIn modern-day Transylvania, vampire hunts and labor strikes collide with sci-fi twists, romance, and AI-crafted tales, as multiple storylines blend folklore, classic horror, and contemporary elements into a fresh take on Dracula's legend.DirectorRadu JudeStarsSerban PavluIlinca ManolacheGabriel SpahiuRomanian director Radu Jude's multi-faceted riff on Dracula made immediate headlines on its Locarno Film Festival world premiere, mostly for being a wild mess of a movie, jammed full of genres, storylines, and asides. At nearly three hours, it's not an easy film to slot into a film fest schedule. But Dracula completists will not want to miss it.13. The Strangers: Chapter 2Releases Sep 26, 20251h 36mROn the final day of their cross country road trip, a couple's vehicle breaks down, forcing them to take refuge in a remote Airbnb. As night falls, three masked strangers terrorize them until dawn.DirectorRenny HarlinStarsMadelaine PetschGabriel BassoEma HorvathWhether or not you are a fan of 2024's relaunch of the Strangers franchise doesn't matter. The Strangers: Chapter 1 — the first of an announced trilogy — pulled in $48 million worldwide on an $8 million budget. Audiences LOVE the Strangers, and star Madelaine Petsch ("Riverdale") and director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2) are back with Chapter 2. The third installment is expected to invade theaters in early 2026.
