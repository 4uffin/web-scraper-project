It opens with an elevated (gas station) heist (for flamin’ flamers chips), after all. There are ghosts and spirits, horror episodes, trips back into the ‘70s, the odd touch of a Western. In his second show, FX’s “The Lowdown,” Harjo and his team are still delightfully elastic when it comes to moving from comedy to thriller to character drama and back again — sometimes within the same scene.But “The Lowdown” unambiguously owes much more to film noir than any other genre. You need look no further than the fact that, like all great noir protagonists, Ethan Hawke’s Lee Raybon keeps getting the shit beat out of him.Raybon is the owner of a Tulsa secondhand book store by day, self-appointed “truthstorian” by night, who investigates the hypocrisies and hidden secrets of Oklahoma’s...See full article at Indiewire9/24/2025by Sarah ShachatIndiewireParamount, Hybe America’s K-Pop Movie Adds Nine to Cast, Including Korean Stars Sung Jun, Kang Sora and Hyongchol Lee (Exclusive)Paramount Pictures and Hybe America have finalized the cast for their upcoming K-pop musical drama, adding nine stars to an already buzzy lineup.Korean stars Sung Jun, Kang Sora and Hyongchol Lee are among the actors joining the cast, which features previously announced stars Ji-young Yoo (“Kpop Demon Hunters”), singer-songwriter Eric Nam (“The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender”), Yoo Ji-tae (“Oldboy”), Tony Revolori (“Spider-Man”) and Gia Kim.Also new to the cast are singer Ahin Lee, actor and singer Renata Vaca, musician-actor Silia Kapsis, Aliyah Turner (“Power Book III: Raising Kanan”), Shana Kim (“Love Me”) and Jubi Park.Ahin Lee, Renata Vaca and Silia Kapsis Lee: Courtesy Image / Vaca: Shervin Lainez / Kapsis: Monsee WoodBenson Lee (“Seoul Searching”) will direct the movie, which revolves around a young Korean American woman who defies her family’s wishes by competing in a televised competition to find the next K-pop girl group.See full article at Variety - Film News9/24/2025by Angelique JacksonVariety - Film NewsSlow Horses Season 5's Disturbing Opening Scene, Explained By The Showrunner [Exclusive]"Slow Horses" season 5 wastes no time getting into the action with a mass shooting that immediately manages to compel and disturb with its visceral imagery.

Once again, nomination announcements will overlap with the Sundance Film Festival, and the ceremony will frustratingly conflict with SXSW 2026.For those looking to make Oscar predictions, the biggest hurdle this time around will be the BAFTA Awards shifting their schedule forward, meaning it will announce its final nominations nearly a week after the Academy Awards announces theirs.

Perhaps most importantly, however, "Bags" continues to showcase the first truly great "Gen V" villain, Cipher (Hamish Linklater). Apart from offering us a long-awaited glimpse of the new Godolkin University dean's powers, the episode proves just how far he is willing to go on his mission to force a power upgrade on Marie Moreau (Jaz Sinclair) ... or, at least, so it seems.See full article at Slash Film9/24/2025by Pauli PoisuoSlash FilmSlow Horses Showrunner On Season 5's Tonal Shift And Making The Most Of Its Most Annoying Character [Exclusive Interview]"Slow Horses" is back, and there's a bit of a vibe shift this season. Slough House's resident tech guru and overconfident blowhard Roddy Ho (Christopher Chung) has a girlfriend, and considering his questionable dating history (he was scammed by a bot in a previous season), this new relationship naturally raises some red flags for the slovenly but ruthlessly effective MI5 agent Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman). With Ho being front and center, this season is automatically going to be funnier than season 4, which was a dark exploration of River Cartwright (Jack Lowden)'s family lineage and buried secrets finally coming to light.I recently had the opportunity to speak with showrunner...See full article at Slash Film9/24/2025by Ben PearsonSlash FilmListen: Sterlin Harjo Embraces Tulsa Noir in ‘The Lowdown’; Christopher Nolan Takes Side Job at DGAComing up today on the “Daily Variety” podcast, Variety TV chief Michael Schneider speaks to showrunner Sterlin Harjo, whose new series “The Lowdown” bows today on FX.

Sweetly earnest young Maria Spencer (Saoirse Ronan) is one of those unfortunate educators who, through no real fault of her own, has been placed in the latter column by her perceptive pre-teen students: She’s kind, dedicated and full of ideas, but can barely speak over the room, much less command it. A daringly discomfiting black comedy from Swedish director Jonatan Etzler, “Bad Apples” initially appears to be that rare classroom movie that courts more sympathy for adult than child — at least until Maria discovers her unlikely inner disciplinarian, and our allegiances ricochet all over the shop.A Toronto premiere that has since opened San Sebastian’s New Directors competition...See full article at Variety - Film News9/24/2025by Guy LodgeVariety - Film NewsJimmy Kimmel Made Himself Unassailable — Will That Be Enough?In terms of meeting the moment, Jimmy Kimmel’s monologue was pretty close to perfect.Greeted by a loud, raucous audience in his Los Angeles studio but speaking to a wary, even hostile, segment of viewers at home, the late-night host returned to ABC on Tuesday night with a difficult needle to thread. He’d faced a frustrating six-day stretch off the air, after threats from FCC chairman Brendan Carr pressured Disney (ABC’s parent company) to “indefinitely” suspend “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” leaving Kimmel and his hundreds of staff members in indefensible yet very real limbo.Public outrage was swift and loud — almost as if Americans don’t like the notion of losing their very first constitutional amendment — with formal condemnations from major news and entertainment organizations, protesters marching outside Disney’s Burbank studios, and the general public boycotting the company by canceling Disney+.Still, debate was split over whether “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” would survive.See full article at Indiewire9/24/2025by Ben TraversIndiewire‘They were so feral’: Cillian Murphy, Tracey Ullman and cast on nose-breaking remand school drama SteveIn the acclaimed new film about boys written off by the system, Murphy drew on his own past as a troublesome schoolboy while Little Simz played a teacher – and wrote a 90s-style banger of a songMonths before the publication of his latest book, Max Porter went on holiday with Cillian Murphy and a mutual friend. “I said, ‘I’ve just finished another novel,’” recalls Porter. “And they said, ‘You’ve only just done one.’ I said, ‘Well, I bang them out fast, then edit them slowly.’” He ended up reading it out aloud, giving them their first glimpse into the “sensejumbled” head of a teen delinquent named Shy, resident...See full article at The Guardian - Film News9/24/2025by Claire ArmitsteadThe Guardian - Film News15 Best Movies Like BarbarianThere are a lot of elements that contribute to "Barbarian" being one of the most genuinely shocking horror films of the decade so far. Director Zach Cregger, former member of the sketch comedy troupe The Whitest Kids U'Know, made an unexpected and indelible mark on genre cinema, seemingly out of nowhere, dropping this A+ example of midnighter genre cinema that springboarded him into making "Weapons," one of the most talked-about movies of 2025.The ghoulish magic of "Barbarian" is how it concocts a mixture that stands entirely on its own out of a clear-as-day set of influences.

They're the antithesis of everything cool in the world of espionage, and most other well-known spies would likely look down on them.

Director Paul Thomas Anderson’s action epic is tracking to open to $20 million to $25 million in its box office debut. That’s about even with DiCaprio’s last theatrical effort, 2023’s “Killers of the Flower Moon,” which co-starred Robert De Niro and opened to $23 million. However, Oscar buzz and positive word-of-mouth (“One Battle After Another” boasts a near-perfect 97% on Rotten Tomatoes) could propel initial ticket sales higher — or at least help the film stick around beyond its opening weekend. “One Battle After Another” is expected to collect another $20 million at the international box office.Staying power will be important because “One Battle After Another” carries a price tag above $130 million and requires big bucks — roughly $300 million — to break even theatrically.See full article at Variety - Film News9/24/2025by Rebecca RubinVariety - Film NewsGen V Season 2 May Have Just Sealed Marie Moreau's FateThis article contains spoilers for "Gen V" season 2, episode 4, "Bags."So, Marie Moreau (Jaz Sinclair) is now explicitly a Chosen One on a Hero's Journey.
