With a new cash rebate of up to 45%, the launch of Olivewood Studios, its first full-fledged studio complex, and steady political support from the royal family, the Kingdom is positioning itself as both a regional and international production hub. Speaking to Variety from South Korea’s Busan Film Festival, where the Royal Film Commission hopes to court new projects and partners, Ahmad Khatib, communications and culture manager at the Royal Film Commission, emphatically declared, “We want to become the Korea of the Middle East,” pointing to Korea’s blend of global exports and thriving local industry as a model.The strategy goes beyond luring foreign shoots.

From the sandstone cliffs of Wadi Rum to the carved façades of Petra and the bustling streets of Amman, Jordan has offered filmmakers landscapes and cityscapes that need little digital augmentation. Backed by the Royal Film Commission, generous rebates and royal patronage, Hollywood blockbusters and indie auteurs alike have found the support and crews they need on location in Jordan. These 10 titles, ranging from David Lean’s Oscar-winning epic to Netflix’s first Arabic-language series, illustrate how the country has become both backdrop and partner for some of cinema’s most ambitious projects, helping to shape stories seen around the world.‘Lawrence of Arabia’ (1962)(David Lean, U.K, U.S. Co-production partners: Horizon Pictures, Columbia Pictures (distribution))David Lean’s “Lawrence of Arabia” remains one of cinema’s foundational epics,...See full article at Variety - Film News9/20/2025by Essie AssibuVariety - Film NewsBusiness Building: Jordan’s Rebate, Locations, Crews Draw Shoots From Around the WorldDuring the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, Jordan’s Royal Film Commission presented its revamped cash rebate program, jumping from 25% to a tiered system that can grant productions a return of up to 45% of local spend, plus an automatic exemption from the Kingdom’s 16% Vat and 10% withholding tax to reach a combined savings of up to 56%.This aggressive new program comes as a response to increased rebates in the Arab world as well as European countries like Greece, a move that has forced a traditionally welcoming Jordan to up its game rebate-wise.Only a few months have passed since the announcement, but Jordan has already seen an “overwhelmingly” positive response, according to the Royal Film Commission’s head of production services and communications Bashar Abu-Nuwar.

The quartet vibed well, and decided to tour the comedy circuit as the Kids in the Hall. In 1985, Scott Thompson joined the group as well, and it's been those five kids ever since.Producer Lorne Michaels assembled the Kids for their own sketch comedy series, simply called "The Kids in the Hall," in 1988, and the troupe's semi-surreal, certainly offbeat, often confrontational, and weirdly dark comedy reached a mass audience.

This turned out to be the start of 20 years of development struggles for the character, as various Wonder Woman movies were developed, dropped, redeveloped, passed on, and restarted again multiple times. There was once a planned version of "Wonder Woman" with Sandra Bullock in the part. In the early 2000s, there was a potential production with either Mariah Carey or Catherine Zeta-Jones as the superheroine. Lucy Lawless was approached about the role at one point. Dozens of screenwriters took a crack at a script.See full article at Slash Film9/20/2025by Witney SeiboldSlash FilmStar Trek's Leonard Nimoy Had A Random Spock Cameo On A Popular Sketch Comedy ShowOn the December 4, 1967 episode of "The Carol Burnett Show," Burnett played the title character in a comedy sketch called "Mrs. Invisible Man."

The beginning of the sketch sees Mrs. Invisible talking to her aunt (Barbara Morrison), complaining about how scary it is that she can never see her husband. She's always tripping over his feet and is never sure when he's going to touch her. When Mr. Invisible Man comes home, audiences see that he is also a lascivious drunk who likes to paw at his wife without her consent.

Today we’re in the age when a film with topical relevance can feel like it was ripped, torn and bleeding, from reality.Two of the most high-profile movies of the 2025 fall film festival season powerfully illustrate that trend. “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” a tumultuous political docudrama that was a sensation in Venice, re-creates a war-zone calamity that took place in Gaza on Jan. 29, 2024. “Nuremberg” is ripped from the headlines of 80 years ago — it’s about how the captured Nazi Hermann Göring was placed on trial for war crimes. Both movies are furious indictments, and it’s telling that both place documentary evidence at the epicenter of their drama.“The Voice of Hind Rajab” is set entirely within the glass-paned...See full article at Variety - Film News9/20/2025by Owen GleibermanVariety - Film NewsA Beloved Friends Star Turned Down A Lead Role In Modern FamilyIt turns out that during the early days of the award-winning series "Modern Family," when it came to casting step-stumbling Dad, Phil Dunphy, "Friends" star Matt LeBlanc was considered for the role before it eventually went to Ty Burrell.

Yeah, there are some inconsistencies, but what do you expect out of one of the longest-running anime ever? In the games, a Level 100 Rattata could probably beat a Level 5 Mewtwo, but most wouldn't consider Rattata generally stronger than Mewtwo.

On the big screen, we've had stuff like "Creepshow" and the cult classic "Trick 'r Treat." But the modern era of the genre has largely been defined by the "V/H/S/" franchise, dating back to the original found footage entry that started it all in 2012.

Steven Lisberger's '80s sci-fi adventure brought the computer world known as the Grid to life through groundbreaking developments in the field of computer-generated imagery. It's still an eye-popping visual experience, albeit noticeably lapped by today's standards. Joseph Kosinski ("Top Gun: Maverick") managed to (mostly) push the developments in CGI even further with "Tron: Legacy," which gave the Grid a Daft Punk-infused upgrade. It's bio-digital jazz, man.

The idea for “The Treasure of Barracuda” originated from renowned producer Valérie Delpierre at Inicia Films during the pandemic, when García had the time to sit with it at home and think about the best way to approach the story.See full article at Variety - Film News9/20/2025by Rafa Sales RossVariety - Film NewsMarlon Brando Rejected One Of Burt Reynolds' Best Movies For A Good ReasonThere are certain classic movies that are majestic to behold, but when you consider the hardship of making the damn thing, you're kinda happy someone else went through hell and back for your entertainment. David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia" is infamous for its rigorous shoot; the film took over a year to complete, and much of it was shot in the deserts of Morocco, Jordan, and Spain. Rewrites and Lean's painstaking attention to shot composition led to long, swelteringly hot days, and you can feel the actors laboring (very much in character).

The perennially good-looking leading man went bald for his first few scenes.“That was me trying to be Jason Statham for a second,” Duhamel tells me. “I was like, ‘Ok, Allan, I got an idea.

This is a radically oversimplified explanation of how the pilot process works, but what I'm getting at here is that a pilot would be shot way before the rest of the inaugural season, and sometimes things changed between the pilot and the episodes that followed.Now that all of that's out of the way, recall,...See full article at Slash Film9/20/2025by Nina StarnerSlash FilmWhy Twilight Author Stephenie Meyer Was Worried About The MovieHaving your work adapted for the big screen is probably pretty scary, all things considered ... and according to an interview with Stephenie Meyer, the author of the "Twilight Saga," she couldn't have possibly been more apprehensive about the on-screen adaptation of the series' first book, "Twilight," which hit theaters in 2008.That same year, Meyer spoke to Karen Valby for Entertainment Weekly and said that, before she saw the first cut of director Catherine Hardwicke's adaptation of "Twilight" starring Robert Pattinson as vampire Edward Cullen and Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan (the human girl who falls in love with him), she was unbelievably anxious.

The star of Prime Video's hugely popular action series spoke to Men's Journal and hyped up the upcoming season, calling it "a gauntlet" and "a labyrinth of fights" in which Jack Reacher will face off against more faceless thugs than he's ever had to deal with — which considering this show is essentially a fight montage broken up by cursory dialogue scenes, is saying something."Reacher...See full article at Slash Film9/20/2025by Joe RobertsSlash Film2025 film festivals and markets calendar: latest datesScreenis running this regularly updated page with the latest film festival and market dates from across the world.To submit details of or alter your festival dates, pleasecontact us herewith the name, dates, country and website for the event.OngoingJakarta World Cinema, Indonesia - September 4-October 4Hong Kong Film Festival UK, UK - September 12-28Cinefest Sudbury International Film Festival, Canada - September 13-21Women Over 50 Film Festival, UK - September 14-October 12 (online)Busan International Film Festival, South Korea - September 17-26Calabasas Film Festival, US - September 17-21Clapham International Film Festival, UK - September 17-26Harlem International Film Festival,...See full article at ScreenDaily9/20/2025ScreenDailyGuillermo del Toro and Yeon Sang-ho Connect Over Monsters, Animation, and Creative Process at BusanTwo of cinema’s most imaginative voices came together at the Busan International Film Festival for an intimate conversation about their creative processes, revealing surprising connections between their work despite being separated by continents and cultures.Guillermo del Toro and Yeon Sang-ho, both masters of blending the fantastical with deeply human stories, participated in a session at Netflix’s Creative Asia conference. The conversation offered insights into how both directors approach their craft.Both filmmakers traced their creative origins to childhood encounters with monsters and Japanese animation. Speaking about his formative years, del Toro said: “I’m not a good outdoorsy guy. I’m an indoor observer, reader, consumer of audiovisual media, storyteller. You know, if there was no movies, they would throw me out of a cliff to die.”The Mexican filmmaker revealed how Japanese tokusatsu shaped his worldview: “So we watched all the series, not only Osamu Tezuka,...See full article at Variety - Film News9/20/2025by Naman RamachandranVariety - Film NewsIt's Still 2025, But We Just Saw The First Great Horror Movie Of 2026 [Fantastic Fest]We're still in the final stretch of 2025, firmly in the midst of the fall movie season.

It's one of those rare moments in the doc that's not about #winning, tiger blood, or the myriad other scandals that merged with Sheen's public persona, but instead is about a performer reminiscing about his early years when he was still filled with enthusiasm and excitement, eager to prove he had what it takes to make it in this chaotic and unreliable business.See full article at Slash Film9/20/2025by Akos PeterbenczeSlash FilmJuliette Binoche on Her Directorial Debut ‘In-i In Motion,’ Revisiting Her Daunting Experience Making a Bold Dance Show With Akram Khan: ‘I Felt Like I Wasn’t Going to Survive’Juliette Binoche won an Oscar for the “The English Patient;” has worked with the greatest auteurs, from Leos Carax to Abbas Kiarostami and Olivier Assayas; and has presided over Cannes and Berlin juries, among her many achievements. But in classic Juliette-Binoche style, the iconoclastic French actor didn’t take the easy route to direct her first film.‘In-i In Motion,’ which is world premiering today at San Sebastian Film Festival, charts her chaotic, daunting and ultimately cathartic experience co-creating and performing a dance show with well-known British choreographer Akram Khan over the course of a sabbatical year and a half in 2007. It turns out that making “In-i In Motion” proved almost as excruciatingly difficult as creating the show itself, Binoche tells Variety ahead of San Sebastian, because it required her to transform 170 hours of footage, chase music rights for songs used during countless rehearsal sessions and edit the abstract material into a film.See full article at Variety - Film News9/20/2025by Elsa KeslassyVariety - Film News‘Abject horror’: the troubling history of paedophile-hunting TV showsIn Predators, director David Osit goes back to the unease of the prime-time hit To Catch a Predator and asks uncomfortable questionsIt would go a little like this.A man would arrive at a house after chatting to someone he believed was underage, with a plan to have sex or engage in a sexual act.

Which of course feels great! Even more so because amateurs make up 60% of the main cast.”He added: “I really tried to keep the plot simpler than ever and forget about the rule book.

Defiantly going where few have gone before — one rare prior example being the bumbling-jihadist satire “Four Lions” 15 years ago — “Good News” ekes a surprising degree of variably droll and raucous humor from its spin on a real-life hijacking that threw the governments of Japan, the U.S. and both Koreas into crisis mode over half a century ago. The latest from South Korean director Byun Sung-hyun (of the more pokerfaced crime thrillers “Kill Boksoon” and “The Merciless”) is an impressively ambitious, twisty construct that errs only in stretching out a bit longer than the tricky tonal balance can sustain. After well-received festival bows in Toronto and Busan, it launches worldwide on Netflix Oct. 17.Squirrelly opening text (“Inspired by real events.

He explains why he’s hung in his office at Tres Cantos, a 25-minute car ride north of Madrid, a poster of “No tenéis ni **** idea,” a highly personal mini-series bio doc on Luis Enrique, the driven, outspoken and tragedy-struck manager of Paris soccer club Psg.
