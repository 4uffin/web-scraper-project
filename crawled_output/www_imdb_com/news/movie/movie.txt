But behind those statistics lies a more complex story of creative evolution, strategic risk-taking, and an industry learning to balance local authenticity with global ambitions.The architects of this transformation — Indonesia’s producers — are now grappling with how to sustain momentum while navigating everything from censorship battles to the challenge of serving 400 ready-to-release films through a distribution system that can only handle 150 annually.The numbers underline the scale of the shift. Year-to-date admissions in 2025 stand at 55.8 million for local films (63% market share) against 33.4 million for imports (37%), for a total of 89.2 million. That builds on 2024’s 126 million admissions and Cinepoint forecasts of Indonesian films reaching 100 million admissions annually by 2026, with overall growth projected at 10% per year. Film output is expected to rise from 152 titles in 2024 to around 200 by 2028, while screen count,...See full article at Variety - Film News9/26/2025by Naman RamachandranVariety - Film NewsWhy Marvel's New Wolverine Actor Liam McIntyre Looks So FamiliarFans of everyone's favorite nigh-unkillable X-Man and Insomniac's "Marvel's Spider-Man" games look to be in for a real treat with the upcoming "Marvel's Wolverine" game, which will see the clawed mutant slicing and dicing his way through baddies left and right. Played by Australian actor Hugh Jackman in both the Fox "X-Men" films and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Wolverine is a pretty beloved character who can carry everything from the heartfelt tragedy of 2017's "Logan" to the ridiculousness of 2024's "Deadpool & Wolverine." In fall 2026, players will be able to live out their greatest Wolverine brawler fantasies and play as the character themselves.

Is Paul Mescal Lead or Supporting in ‘Hamnet’? Studios Weigh Category Strategy as Award Deadlines ApproachThis Oscar season, love is in the air, and so are submission deadlines.The decision of whether, or how, a movie or performer should campaign for awards consideration is akin to whether a politician should run for president. The stakes are high, the costs are significant, and the ripple effects are long-lasting. Just as a potential candidate must weigh experience, polling data and public appetite before announcing a White House run, studios and strategists face equally consequential questions: where to submit films, how to position talent and when to risk resources on an uncertain path. The ultimate goal is to snag a seat inside the Dolby Theatre as an Oscar nominee — and, ideally, a winner.What could emerge from this year’s campaign strategies could reveal a fundamental shift in how Hollywood approaches awards season.For small independent films, the calculus is a gamble.

Be warned, this article contains major spoilers for "One Battle After Another."You could easily describe the films of writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson as "eclectic." There are throughlines, of course — inner lives, flawed characters, complex relationships. Many draw their essence from a specific time and place, making the setting the star in which the character studies unravel. There's always drama, but also comedy, romance, and suspense. And of course, the camera rarely stops moving.In a way, then, "One Battle After Another" is the ultimate Anderson film. Every one of those pieces is at play across the film's nearly three-hour runtime, creating a self-proclaimed epic that's...See full article at Slash Film9/25/2025by Rick StevensonSlash FilmEvery Paul Thomas Anderson Movie, Ranked from Worst to Best — Including ‘One Battle After Another’This list was originally published in December 2017. It has since been updated with further films from PTA.Paul Thomas Anderson’s characters are all defective in some way — not flawed so much as broken and incomplete. In an unpredictable filmography that spans from the waining days of the mid-’90s indie boom to the tenuous post-celluloid landscape of the modern age — a scattershot collection of stories that hops across the last 100 years as though it’s unstuck in time, resolving into a strange and feral people’s history of America in the 20th century — a fundamental sense of inherent vice might be the most consistent through-line. That feels especially true in the aftermath of “Phantom Thread,” which finds Anderson ditching his hometown of Los Angeles for London, but still retaining (or even doubling down on) his sincere affection for obsessive people with holes in their hearts.Common wisdom suggests that...See full article at Indiewire9/25/2025by David EhrlichIndiewireOne Battle After Another Director Paul Thomas Anderson Broke A Big Rule For One ShotSpoilers for "One Battle After Another" follow.Whether it's a romantic comedy like "Punch-Drunk Love" or an epic like "There Will Be Blood," writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson always brings a distinctive visual language to his films. Long takes, moving camera shots, clashes of symmetry and asymmetry, and distinctive color choices often define his work — a combination that often invokes an older era of Hollywood. Despite being known for that strong visual style, Anderson says that his approach is often to let the story and the filming locations determine the shots he takes, rather than going out of his way to create moments of high visual drama.According to Anderson himself,...See full article at Slash Film9/25/2025by Rick StevensonSlash FilmNetflix's Best Sci-Fi Thriller Just Premiered Its Third Season (And It's Must-Watch For Squid Game Fans)The heartbreaking and heart-pounding South Korean survival thriller series "Squid Game" is over, with the third and final season airing on Netflix in June of 2025.

The scope widens as necessary — to a cross-country train ride, a college campus, a corporate office, and more — but that duo by the water is the heartbeat of a poignant, unmissable film.“Homebound” is the story of best friends Chandan (Vishal Jethwa) and Shoaib (Ishaan Khatter), who dream of leaving their village and moving up in the world by becoming nationally recognized police officers. The story was adapted by Ghaywan and Sumit Roy from a New York Times article by Basharat Peer, with dialogues by Shreedhar Dubey and Varun Grover.

The film takes place over three years in Valbona, a suburban district of Barcelona, as Guerín prods at issues of displacement, identity, urban life, and ecological conflicts in this small neighborhood that serves as a microcosm of the world.Speaking with Variety ahead of the world premiere, Guerín says he has had his work featured in some of the largest festivals across the world, but for a film like “Good Valley Stories,” it feels right to have the world premiere in his home country. “Some aspects of it will inevitably be lost in other countries, so I feel San Sebastián is the most appropriate place for a first presentation.”He...See full article at Variety - Film News9/25/2025by Rafa Sales RossVariety - Film NewsJames Gunn Revealed The Most Powerful Member Of Peacemaker's Crew (It's Not Peacemaker)One of the fun aspects of comic-book superhero fandom is debating every character's power level, wondering what might happen if who fought who, what sorts of strengths and weaknesses they have, and so on. Sometimes these debates are backed up through some form of fact, with various major characters having their power levels canonized through some sort of roleplaying game, or trading cards, or official database, and the like. More often than not, though, fans are left to their own theories, guessing who's more powerful and why. In most cases, power levels seem self-evident.

But it’s the heaviest symbol of many in Claire Denis’s stripped-back, forthright new film, a barrier between haves and have-nots that proves as fixed and obdurate as the two men on either side of it, and the tensely opposed societies they stand for. On the inside are the outsiders, white western interlopers making would-be intruders of those whose land they’ve stepped on and built on — “a construction site in West Africa,” as an opening title card simply declares. Many things are simple in “The Fence,” an unusually sharp-cornered and rhetorical work from this typically elliptical and sensuous filmmaker, but the rage swelling beneath its still, mannered surface is not.As much as “The Fence” represents a departure for the...See full article at Variety - Film News9/25/2025by Guy LodgeVariety - Film NewsWhy Henry Cavill Left Netflix's The WitcherBehind every significant movie or television star is a trail of traumatized agents, most of whom likely received all the blame and none of the credit depending on each production their client signed up for over the years.

Walsh and Sherman both recognized Lupino’s superior intellect and resistance to unearned sentimentality.

He’s considered one of the last great movie stars – not just a permanent A-lister, but one who is expected to cover the cost of his salary and then some on a given opening weekend – and DiCaprio says the box office metric is as crucial as ever.On the road promoting his Paul Thomas Anderson epic “One Battle After Another,” DiCaprio caught up with Variety to discuss the importance of movie ticket sales in a landscape thrown off balance by unvetted streaming data and social engagement.We asked DiCaprio if he thinks box office numbers still matter in the new world.“I think there’s just an inundation of content and so much production going on now — which is a good thing, obviously.

After the initial meet-cute and sexy ice cream kiss and inability to stay away from each other, Noah (Adam Brody) and Joanne (Kristen Bell) leave their honeymoon phase behind and become a “we” in “Nobody Wants This” Season 2.The Season 2 trailer catches up with our favorite hot rabbi and his podcasting girlfriend as they merge their lives moving forward; bringing friends together, spending time with each other’s parents, and continuing to tiptoe around or walk right into the conversation about religion. Justine Lupe and Timothy Simons reprise their roles as Joanne and Noah’s siblings, respectively, as well as Jackie Tohn as Noah’s sister-in-law Esther.“Nobody Wants This” came from creator Erin Foster’s podcast and partly from her own life experience as she converted to Judaism in a relationship.

Following this year's big summer announcement that "Spaceballs 2" would finally be coming together just in time for the movie's 40th anniversary in 2027 (and complete with a hilariously long opening crawl), we finally have a first look at the "Star Wars" spoof's cast getting back together.However, rather than being just a vanity shot celebrating the reunion of the comedy's stars and filmmakers, the photo itself is also a parody of "Star Wars," because it's lampooning the first photo of the "Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Force Awakens" cast, which was released in April 2014:LucasfilmAs you'll see below, this is definitely meant to...See full article at Slash Film9/25/2025by Ethan AndertonSlash FilmFocus Features to Launch Immersive Event FocusFest Featuring Advanced Screening of ‘Bugonia’Focus Features has unveiled FocusFest, an immersive one-day festival experience on the Universal Studios lot in Los Angeles.

Scientists come up with solutions, Bruce Willis leads oil crews into space to drill holes through asteroids, or Dwayne Johnson helps people survive until the threat calms down and allows humanity to rebuild. It's rare to see the threat in question actually destroy the planet, which is why 2020's "Greenland" is so refreshing — it actually goes through with it. Now the sequel, "Greenland 2: Migration," is set to further explore some of the more harrowing developments from in the first movie, continuing a trend that is becoming more prominent in disaster flicks.Directed by Ric Roman Waugh, and starring our...See full article at Slash Film9/25/2025by Kieran FisherSlash FilmIf AI Was Really Used to Censor ‘Together’ in China, It Represents a Potentially Terrifying FutureStop us if you’ve heard this one before: a restrictive and repressive foreign country edited and censored an LGBTQ scene from a movie and now the American distributor is upset. We can think of a dozen movies that come to mind.In this case, a Chinese distributor caved to the government’s pressure and edited a scene in the recent indie body horror movie “Together,” changing a gay wedding to a straight one. Neon isn’t pleased, and it demanded that Hishow, the Chinese distributor to whom it sold the foreign rights, stop showing “this altered version,” the company told IndieWire in a statement.What’s weird, however, is that Hishow didn’t just cut the scene in question or edit it in such a way to make it look like it was a heterosexual couple getting married.

Before this, DiCaprio had teamed up yet again with Martin Scorsese on the award-winning "Killers of the Flower Moon," where he played the villainous Ernest Burkhart with incredible nuance.

Dean Cipher (Hamish Linklater) has his own reasons for setting up the match, but it's clear from the beginning that such superhero fights are a longstanding tradition among Godolkin University's highest-ranked students.
