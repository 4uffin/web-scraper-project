England's loudest band (Christopher Guest as Nigel Tufnel, Michael McKean as David St. Hubbins, and Harry Shearer as Derek Smalls) reunites with director Marty DiBergi (played by Rob Reiner) as guest editors of IMDb. The foursome reminisce about their decades of touring while going through props based on their comedy classic 'This Is Spinal Tap' (1984), such as a teeny tiny Stonehenge, a Grow-Your-Own-Drummer kit, and the glove from the original, censored "Smell the Glove" album cover. The "Rock Bottom" rockers are back together for a final concert (and to turn those amps up to 11 one last time) in 'Spinal Tap II: The End Continues' (2025).
