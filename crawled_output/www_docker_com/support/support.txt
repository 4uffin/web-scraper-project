Support FAQ
Support tickets
We normally keep tickets open until full resolution; however, we do end up in situations where a request/bug has to be escalated to our engineering teams over extended periods. In this scenario, we will close out the support ticket as ‘Solved’ even if the underlying issue is not resolved. If your team responds to any ticket we’ve marked as ‘Solved’, the ticket will reopen with your latest comment. Please include logs, steps taken, and any relevant information (e.g., environment, architecture, etc.).
Support documentation
Docker Documentation provides additional information about what is and is not supported.
Billing and payments
The Docker Billing documentation includes frequently asked questions and solutions.  If you are unable to find a solution here, contact Docker Support by opening a support ticket.
Restoring deleted data
Docker will consider restoration requests only when the request is for a project or group that is part of a paid Team or Business subscription, and one of the following is true:
The data was deleted due to a Docker bug/issue
The organization’s contract includes a specific provision
Log/IP access requests
Due to legal/privacy laws and for the security of our other customers, Docker does not provide raw logs, IP addresses, or other information requests related to our customers.
