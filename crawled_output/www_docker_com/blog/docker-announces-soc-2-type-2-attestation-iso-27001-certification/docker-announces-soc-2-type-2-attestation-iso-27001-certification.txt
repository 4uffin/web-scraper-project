Docker Announces SOC 2 Type 2 Attestation & ISO 27001 Certification
Posted Jun 4, 2024
Rachel Taylor
Docker is pleased to announce that we have received our SOC 2 Type 2 attestation and ISO 27001 certification with no exceptions or major non-conformities.
Security is a fundamental pillar to Docker’s operations, which is embedded into our overall mission and company strategy. Docker’s products are core to our user community and our SOC 2 Type 2 attestation and ISO 27001 certification demonstrate Docker’s ongoing commitment to security to our user base.
What is a SOC 2 Type 2?
Defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), a System and Organization Controls (SOC) is a suite of reports produced during an audit. A SOC 2 Type 2 is an audit report or attestation that evaluates the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls of information systems over five criteria principles, known as the Trust Services Principles: Security (also referred to as the common criteria), Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, and Privacy.
What is ISO 27001?
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent, non-governmental international organization of national standards bodies. ISO was established in 1947 and has a long history of producing standards, requirements, and certifications to demonstrate different control environments.
ISO 27001 is a worldwide recognized standard for the information security management system (ISMS). An ISMS is a framework of policies, procedures, and controls for systematically managing an organization’s sensitive data.
Continued compliance
Going forward, Docker will provide an annual SOC 2 Type 2 attestation and ISO 27001 certification following the timing of our fiscal year.
Docker is committed to providing our customers with secure products. Our compliance posture provides our commitment to lead the industry in providing developers with tools they can trust.
To learn more about Docker’s security posture, visit our Docker Trust Center website. If you would like access to our compliance platform to receive the documents, fill out the Security Documentation form, and the Docker Sales team will follow up with you.
