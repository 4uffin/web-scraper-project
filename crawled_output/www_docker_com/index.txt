What is Docker?
Accelerate how you build, share, and run applications
Docker helps developers build, share, run, and verify applications anywhere — without tedious environment configuration or management.

Build
Spin up new environments quickly
Accelerate your development by building Docker images locally or in the cloud with Docker Build Cloud. Create multiple containers using Docker Compose without the hassle of local build constraints.
Integrate with your existing tools
Docker seamlessly integrates with your development tools, such as VS Code, CircleCI, and GitHub. Meanwhile, Docker Build Cloud fast-tracks build times, resulting in an enhanced workflow without disruption.
Containerize applications for consistency
Ensure consistent application performance across any environment, whether it’s on-premises Kubernetes or cloud platforms like AWS ECS, Azure ACI, and Google GKE.
Optimize builds with Docker Build Cloud
Share
Discover and manage container images with Docker Hub
Explore Docker Hub, the world’s largest registry, where you can discover, distribute, store, and serve cloud-native components, including container images. Access a vast repository of trusted content from verified publishers and Docker Official Images.
Collaborate with your team seamlessly
Easily pull and publish images from Docker Hub to streamline sharing within your team, organization, or the broader community. Docker Hub simplifies the management and distribution of container applications.
Ensure security and trust with Docker Hub
Secure your workspaces with robust image access management, registry access controls, and private repositories. Docker Hub offers a secure and trusted marketplace for your container images, ensuring best practices and peace of mind.

Test
Test dependencies as code
Eliminate the need for mocks and complex environment configurations by defining your test dependencies as code. Simply run your tests, and Docker containers will be created and deleted as needed.
Unit tests with real dependencies
Utilize Testcontainers to provide lightweight, throwaway instances of databases, message brokers, web browsers, and more. Test anything that can be containerized for accurate, reliable testing.
Integrate and automate with ease
Efficiently run data access layer integration tests, UI/acceptance tests, and application integration tests using containerized instances. Enjoy a clean, consistent testing environment with minimal setup.
