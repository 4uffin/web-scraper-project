“Switching to Docker has transformed things for us. We can now create modular microservices instead of monolithic apps, with independent development and efficient deployment. It’s a quantum leap regarding the velocity we can deliver.”
Vladimir Mikhalev
Docker Captain, Ataccama
“We’ve seen massive savings in terms of time for our developers — they just get up and running straight away.”
Matt Law
Head of Engineering and Architecture, Warehouse Group
“Docker’s the default position for us as a business because we know that it works, it’s reliable, it’s efficient, it’s just really easy for us to get things up and running quickly and do you.”
Pat Heard
Site Reliability Engineer Government of Canada, The Canadian Digital Service
