WongSenior Culture Reporter, HuffPostSep 12, 2025, 01:28 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGShaun White and Nina Dobrev have called it quits after five years together. White, a professional snowboarder and three-time Olympic gold medalist, and Dobrev, an actor best known for her portrayal of Elena Gilbert on “The Vampire Diaries,” have ended their engagement and romantic relationship, People reported Thursday. Though details on the split are scarce, People cites a source close to the couple who said “it was a mutual decision, and wasn’t an easy one, but it was made with love and a deep respect for one another.”Advertisement
Representatives for White and Dobrev did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment. The news came as a surprise to many fans, given that White and Dobrev were photographed walking hand in hand Aug. 31 in Los Angeles. Dobrev also included a photo of herself relaxing in bed with White in a carousel of end-of-summer images on Instagram. By the time Dobrev turned up at the Toronto International Film Festival last week for the premiere of “Eternity,” however, she notably did not appear to be wearing an engagement ring. Advertisement
Shaun White and Nina Dobrev have reportedly called off their engagement and relationship after five years together. Chris Jackson via Getty ImagesShe also posted a cryptic TikTok video in which she lip-synced to audio of two women discussing how to “fix” a man. “Listen, Bob the Builder, he’s got 10 other women trying to fix him, too,” she mouthed in the clip. “And you all look like a damn construction crew.”Advertisement
And as People pointed out, the couple’s engagement photos weren’t pinned to the top of Dobrev’s Instagram account, as had previously been the case. White and Dobrev were first romantically linked in late 2019. The pair went public with their relationship in May 2020, when White shared photos of Dobrev giving him a haircut while in COVID-19 lockdown. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

White popped the question to Dobrev at New York’s Golden Swan restaurant last October. When asked by E! News in March why the couple had yet to start wedding planning, Dobrev said, “We’re just enjoying being engaged at this point and being in that sort of phase.”Advertisement
“You have a boyfriend for half of your life and then you have a husband for half of your life but the fiancé period is very short,” she added. “I really want to enjoy it and not rush that process.” RelatedNina DobrevShaun White'Pitch Perfect' Star Defends 18-Year Age Gap With Younger GirlfriendHalle Berry Claps Back At Ex-Husband On Her Birthday Over Marriage RemarksChris Appleton Breaks Silence On Split From ‘White Lotus’ Star After 6 Months Of MarriageNina Dobrev Is Now Engaged To Longtime Boyfriend Shaun White Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
