First Person Meets… Stephen Kaufman: Solving problems with technology and people
We meet Stephen Kaufman, who has spent 25 years architecting solutions on behalf of Microsoft. Stephen tells us that his defining characteristic is curiosity, and how his first memory was of taking things apart and putting them back together, more or less successfully. He says how that led him to a hobby in computers which in turn led him to a computer science degree. But he chose to major in both marketing and computers, because for him success is in solving problems with technology, for people.
