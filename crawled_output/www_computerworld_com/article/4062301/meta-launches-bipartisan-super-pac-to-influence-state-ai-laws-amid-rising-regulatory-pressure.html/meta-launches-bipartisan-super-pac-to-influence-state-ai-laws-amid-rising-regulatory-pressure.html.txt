Meta launches bipartisan super PAC to influence state AI laws amid rising regulatory pressure

The American Technology Excellence Project joins a wave of tech-funded lobbying efforts aimed at promoting AI innovation and defending industry-friendly candidates, as state legislatures accelerate AI oversight.

State-level AI regulations are advancing faster than federal efforts, creating new compliance challenges for enterprises, and prompting Silicon Valley to increase political spending to influence the outcome.
Meta is the latest to escalate its efforts, committing tens of millions of dollars to a new bipartisan super PAC that will support tech-friendly candidates across the country, Axios reported.
The group, known as the American Technology Excellence Project, will be led by Republican strategist Brian Baker and the Democratic consulting firm Hilltop Public Solutions. Its stated mission is to promote and defend US technology companies, advocate for AI progress, and give parents more control over how their children use online apps and AI tools.
The initiative follows Meta’s launch last month of a California-focused PAC to back candidates supportive of the tech industry in state races. It also comes on the heels of a reported $100 million super PAC announced in August by venture firm Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman.
Earlier this year, a proposal to bar states from regulating AI for 10 years was floated in federal budget negotiations but was struck down.
Compliance patchwork challenges CIOs
For enterprises, the implications of Meta’s lobbying push extend well beyond politics.
The prospect of state-driven AI regulation is creating uncertainty for CIOs who must ensure compliance across multiple jurisdictions without the clarity of a national standard.
“California may demand provenance labeling and parental notifications; Colorado already requires anti-discrimination checks for high-risk AI used in hiring or housing; and Texas is exploring disclosure rules around synthetic media,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research.
This would force CIOs to design AI workflows with jurisdiction-aware overlays rather than assuming a single baseline.
“Super PAC activity reflects growing state-level momentum,” said Kaustubh K, practice director at Everest Group. “With future action still uncertain, CIOs should prepare for varied state obligations by aligning with frameworks such as NIST AI RMF and designing for the strictest common denominator with adaptable compliance models.”
Limits of super PACs
Analysts suggest that super PACs like Meta’s may be powerful in shaping political agendas but are not quite effective at turning them into law.
Their influence lies in amplifying narratives such as presenting AI innovation as a patriotic duty or framing parental control as a path to safety. Yet they cannot substitute for the legislative machinery of Congress.
Governments may also be unlikely to give up local control on sensitive areas such as child safety, labor rights, or transparency.
“AI is a nuanced technology that will need an equally nuanced regulatory approach,” said Faisal Kawoosa, founder and lead analyst at Techarc. “Super PACs can help align the industry around common issues and push for consensus, but federal and regional governments will still prioritize local concerns. That means enterprises are unlikely to see a single, uniform regulatory framework, and regulations will progress at different speeds across jurisdictions.”
Gogia noted that enterprises should prepare for a prolonged hybrid environment. At the national level, agencies like NIST and the FTC are expected to keep issuing guidance. State legislatures will continue experimenting with disclosure and audit mandates, with some favoring industry interests and others imposing more stringent requirements.
