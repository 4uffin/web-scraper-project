The AI pay bump
AI is reshaping industries and this week we reported that CIOs are prioritizing certifications over college degrees to quickly validate tech skills and drive digital transformation. We listed out the top AI certifications that will get you hired and promoted. Who doesn’t want that?
Readers of Computerworld were keen to understand the impact of such certification in terms of cold hard cash. Really, what is it worth?
Smart Answers, parsing insights from decades of human reporting, has good news to share. Employers are indeed demonstrating a significant willingness to offer higher compensation to IT professionals possessing AI and generative AI skills. Tech professionals with AI expertise earn approximately 18% more than their counterparts without these skills. Employers are willing to pay an average of 47% more to IT professionals specifically with generative AI skills.

Android in the enterprise gets easier
Post the demise of BlackBerry managing personal devices in the enterprise has been its own unique challenge. The days of endless debate about BYOD vs a company-supplied fleet of ‘business’ devices seem a long time ago. Employees will use their cell phone for work, and organizations must secure and support that activity.
This week Computerworld reported on a major step forward in Android migration that on the face of it is more relevant for smartphone consumers.
The article prompted our readers to ask Smart Answers about the implications for use in enterprise organizations. And the good news is that these changes benefit enterprise IT departments as much as they do for individuals.
Smart Answers says that improved Android data migration and device management tools offer significant benefits for both individual users and enterprise IT departments, particularly in securing sensitive information and streamlining the transition between devices. So maybe Android is the answer for your workforce.

Protect yourself against dark web threats
It’s not somewhere we choose to look, but from leaked credentials to ransomware plans, the dark web is full of early warning signs — if you know where and how to look. This week on CSO we explained how security leaders can monitor these hidden spaces and act before an attack hits.
This prompted readers to probe for more, asking Smart Answers how to monitor the darkest recesses of the internet. Our generative AI chatbot explains that dark web monitoring platforms scan underground forums by checking for an organization’s information against compromised datasets that are being traded or sold. Security professionals can leverage this monitoring to gain insight into the underground ecosystem, observing forums and darknet sites where threat actors discuss upcoming threats and offer exploits for sale.
