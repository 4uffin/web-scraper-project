Save time and perform all sorts of advanced Android app sorcery with these off-the-beaten-path Play Store tricks.

When you think about hidden tricks and little-known features on Android, the Google Play Store probably isn’t the first place that comes to mind.
And why would it? The Play Store seems like a simple utility — a place where you go when you’ve got something you want to download or an app update you’re especially eager to seek out.
But like so many areas of Android, the Google Play Store holds scads of secrets for smarter, faster, and generally more effective phone maneuvering. Some of ’em are time-saving shortcuts, while others are out-of-sight bits of advanced insights or control over your Android app collection.
All of ’em, though, are things you’ll wonder how you remained woefully unaware of all this time — and things that’ll make your Android experience meaningfully easier in small but significant measures.
Ready to see what you’ve been missing?
[Psst: Love shortcuts? My Android Shortcut Supercourse will teach you tons of time-saving tricks for every imaginable area of your phone. Sign up now for free!]
Google Play Store secret #1: The speedy app install
More often than not, most of us head into the Play Store to find a new app — by searching or perhaps just stumbling onto something interesting in one of the storefront’s suggestions — right?
Well, here’s a handy little step-saver few Android-appreciating animals are informed about:
From anywhere in the Play Store — the main screen, a category screen, or even a search results list — you can simply press and hold your finger onto any app’s name or icon to install it right then and there, without having to first open up its info page and then poke around to find the standard “Install” button.
See?
Press, hold, install — it’s as simple as that.JR Raphael, Foundry
And now that you know, you’ll never be unaware again.
Google Play Store secret #2: A simple search shortcut
While we’re thinkin’ about finding and installing new apps in the Play Store, take note of this supremely simple but impossibly satisfying little step-saver:
When you’re ready to search for something, instead of tapping the “Search” icon at the bottom of the Play Store, then stopping, shifting your finger to the top of the screen, and then tapping the search box there, just double-tap that “Search” icon. That’s it.
Doing so will take you directly to the search prompt and even pop up your keyboard for instant typing — without all the needless moving around and time-wasting.
Google Play Store secret #3: A direct update detour
If you’re anything like me, the section of the Play Store you visit most often is probably the “Manage apps & device” screen — y’know, the place where you go to see which apps have updates available and to apply those updates immediately.
Typically, getting to that area of the Play Store requires a whole slew o’ steps — opening up the Play Store, tapping your profile picture in the upper-right corner, then selecting “Manage apps & device” from there. It’s anything but direct.
But — oh, yes — there’s a better way. It just requires you to remember to tap into Android’s exceptionally useful but all-too-easily-forgetten app shortcuts system.
And there really isn’t much at all to it, once you remember: From your Android device’s home screen or app drawer, just press and hold the Play Store icon for about a second. That’ll pop up a small menu of commands, including one called “My apps.”
Straight to your apps without interruption — always just a single long-press away.JR Raphael, Foundry
Tap that, and boom: You’ll be right on the screen you want, without all the usual effort.
Google Play Store secret #4: The fast app detour
Speaking of app-related shortcuts, the next time you want to get to the Play Store page for an app already on your phone — to check for an update, mayhaps, or peek in on some manner of related info — press and hold that app’s icon on your home screen or in your app drawer and then tap “App info.”
Depending on what kind of phone you have, you’ll either see an option to open its Play Store page immediately on the screen that comes up or you’ll have to tap “Advanced” to reveal the “App details” option.
But either way, you’ll zip over there in a metaphorical hop, skip, and shake — no searching or digging around required.
Google Play Store secret #5: The no-wait update
We’ve talked a bunch about Play Store app updates, and I’d be remiss not to mention my favorite new secret shortcut — a fun little somethin’ I stumbled onto inadvertently not long ago.
Have you ever noticed how when you first go into the “Manage apps & device” area of the Play Store on Android, it often takes the system a handful of seconds to search for pending updates and give you the option to move forward?
Well, get this: You don’t have to wait. You can just tap your finger onto the spot where the “See details” text should be (and will eventually be!), even before it’s there, and it’ll work the same way.
The link might not be visible yet, but you can still tap it — and it works.JR Raphael, Foundry
Mind. Blown.
Google Play Store secret #6: The internal update check
For all the focus we put on individual app updates, most of us don’t think much about updates to the Play Store itself. But you’d better believe the Play Store gets plenty of updates of its own, and sometimes, they can be pretty significant.
Typically, updates to the actual Play Store apply themselves sooner or later, once they’re ready. But if you’re ever feeling antsy and want to look for any available updates without the wait, you can actually do that.
Head into the Play Store, tap your profile picture, and select “Settings” — then tap “About” and look for the line that says “Play Store version.”
Directly beneath it will be a line that offers to “Update Play Store.”
Updates — for the Play Store? Who knew?!JR Raphael, Foundry
Tap that, and any available updates to the Play Store will be instantly applied. If no such updates are available, you’ll simply get a message letting you know as much.
Google Play Store secret #7: Your bulk uninstall buddy
It’s always good to clean house once in a while and eliminate any apps you aren’t actively using. But uninstalling a bunch of stuff can be time-consuming and cumbersome — at least, until you know this next Google Play Store trick.
Open up the Play Store on your phone, then tap your profile picture in the upper-right corner and select “Manage apps & device.” (Or, if you really wanna take the pro-level path, use the app shortcut trick from a second ago to get to the same place even faster!)
Tap the “Manage” tab at the top to see a list of every app installed on your phone this minute — then tap the outlined box next to any app you want to uninstall. Keep going until all the apps you want to eliminate are selected, then look for the unassuming little trash can icon in the upper-right corner of the screen.
Uninstalling apps has never been so easy.JR Raphael, Foundry
See it? Tap that bad boy and tap it good, and every last app you selected will sent a-packin’ at the same time — without any clunky one-by-one plucking.
Good to know, eh?!
Google Play Store secret #8: Added app insights
If you want a helping hand figuring out which specific apps might be good to get rid of — or if you’re just curious about your app-using habits — this next Google Play Store secret is just the thing for you.
On that same “Manage apps & devices” screen within the Play Store, tap the line toward the top of the screen that says “Recently updated.”
And hey, how ’bout that? That unexpected tap target pulls up a hidden menu that lets you sort your apps by size — a significant metric, if local storage space is a concern — along with how often you actually open ’em.
You’d never know it, but the Play Store lets you sort your apps in all sorts of potentially useful ways.JR Raphael, Foundry
Tap the “Least used” option, and you’ll see your apps sorted by order of when they were last accessed. That’s a smart starting point for considering which apps might be prime candidates for removal, though keep in mind that some system-level tools and apps that run in the background without explicit opening may appear high up in that list, despite the fact that you are actually still relying on ’em.
Google Play Store secret #9: Your hidden app history
While we’re in that area of the Play Store on Android, make yourself a mental note: Right in that same section lurks an incredibly useful way to find a full list of every app you’ve ever installed that isn’t already present on your current device.
It’s a fantastic way to rediscover something you’d installed before — whether weeks ago or even years in the past — and get it back on your current device without any brain-exhausting excavation.
So here’s the trick: On that same “Manage apps & device” screen we were just starin’ at, in that very same “Manage” tab, tap the box toward the top that says “This device.”
And just like that, you’ll find a tucked-away option to shift your view and focus on apps from your past that aren’t currently present — either broadly or based on which specific other devices of yours they are installed on.
You can find apps you’ve installed on other devices — or even just in the past — in a flash.JR Raphael, Foundry
From there, you can tap any app in the list to open its info screen and then install it — or you can take a cue from our previous tip and check the box alongside all the apps you want to bring back. If you take that route, just look for the downward-facing arrow icon at the top of the screen once you’ve made your selections to install everything you picked in one fell swoop.
Google Play Store secret #10: The device list declutter
Android has long offered the option to install apps from the Play Store’s web interface — which is a handy way to send something directly to your device while you’re looking on a computer. But if you’ve used Android for long enough, the list of devices associated with your account can rapidly get unruly.
Luckily, there’s an easy fix for that. It’s just not something any normal human would even be aware of.
But hey, you’re here! You’re reading Android Intelligence. You’re no average Homo sapien.
So make a mental note: If you pull up this page in the Play Store website settings, you can easily select which of your current and past devices do — and don’t — show up throughout the Play Store for you. Just uncheck the box next to “Show in menus” for any device that you don’t want to appear.
Removing or renaming devices is easy — once you know where to look.JR Raphael, Foundry
You can also change the name of any device while you’re there to make it simpler and clearer, if you want (or even just to give it a lovely pet name, like Petunia).
Just remember that if you have any old Android devices that you no longer own and aren’t actively using at all anymore, you’d be well-advised to fully remove their association with your Google account. You can do that in the Google My Account settings.
Google Play Store secret #11: The swipe-to-switch
While we’ve got Google accounts on our mind, if you’re using more than one Google account on your Android device — like one for work purposes and one for personal use (and maybe also one for your secret alternate identity as a gadget named Petunia) — there’s a helpful hidden way to switch between those accounts in a flash in the Play Store.
Just swipe your finger up or down on your profile picture in the upper-right corner of the screen. If you’ve got multiple accounts connected, that’ll flip between ’em faster than you can say “Hey pal, please don’t call me Petunia.”
Google Play Store secret #12: A simple sync shortcut
This next Play Store secret is specifically for those of us with multiple Android devices — be they phones, tablets, watches, or any combination. It even works with Chromebooks, since virtually all of those now support Android apps as well.
So here it is: The Play Store has a buried option that’ll let you automatically and continuously sync your apps between any two devices associated with your account. That means anything you install on one device will automatically appear on the other, and vice-versa — no double duty needed.
If you want to have that happen, head back into the “Manage apps & device” area of the Play Store on whichever device is in front of you. In the “Overview” tab, tap the line labeled “Sync apps to devices.” Then just check the box next to any other devices where you want to enable that sort of syncing.
Google Play Store secret #13: A better beta experience
You know how to join the beta channel of any Android app that offers one, right? It can be a great way to get new features fast, before most mere mortals ever see ’em, and get a glimpse at interesting new developments actively being shaped.
But one thing the Play Store doesn’t do is offer a simple way to (a) see exactly which of your already installed apps offer a beta option, at a glance and without looking into ’em one by one, and (b) see which apps you’ve already opted into the beta channel for and then optionally out back out — again, without just digging into every single app one at a time, which isn’t exactly an effective use of time.
A brilliant third-party tool called Beta Maniac fills that void. Install it once and sign in, and you’ll always have an easy-as-can-be streamlined spot for seeing all of your Android app beta activity and managing which apps you do and don’t use on a beta level.
Beta Maniac is a perfect power-up to the standard Play Store setup.JR Raphael, Foundry
Beta Maniac is free to use, with ads, or a buck a month if you want to remove the ads and support the developer.
Google Play Store secret #14: The embarrassing app eraser
Before we call it a day, there’s one more little-known Play Store option that’s well worth tucking away in your noggin for future reference.
If you happen to spot an app in your history that you’d rather not remember — for any reason imaginable (and don’t worry, I won’t ask!) — head back into that “Manage apps & device” area of the Play Store on your favorite Android device, tap the “Manage” tab, and then tap the box toward the top of the screen that says “Not installed.”
Tap the box next to any apps you want to obliterate, then tap the trash can icon with an “x” inside of it once you’ve made your selections.
One tap, and bam: An app is gone from your history forever.JR Raphael, Foundry
That’ll permanently remove any selected apps from your Play Store history and stop ’em from being associated with your account in any way. It’s almost as if your past interactions never even happened.
Ahh — if only the rest of life could be so simple.

He's written about almost everything imaginable at some point — including even construction, crime, and climate in his past life as a TV news producer — but these days, he's known primarily for his unmatched analysis of Google's Android and ChromeOS platforms (both of which he's covered closely since their starts) along with his knack for digging up off-the-beaten-path tech tips and treasures.
JR writes Computerworld's Android Intelligence column — the internet's longest-standing Android column and one he's conducted since its inception way back in 2010 — along with a variety of practical pieces about business productivity. That aside, he's the founder and editorial director of The Intelligence, where he waxes poetic with his calorie-packed Android Intelligence newsletter (a saucy sibling to the same-named CW column) as well as his cross-platform Cool Tools recommendation station. He is also a contributing editor at Fast Company and has written or been cited in everywhere from The Verge and Mental Floss to The New York Times, ABC World News, and USA Today.
(Random trivia: JR was actually quoted in Walter Isaacson’s best-selling biography of Steve Jobs — for, erm, somewhat salacious and very appropriately Android-related reasons.)
Despite his refusal to comb his hair, JR's work has been honored with a gaggle of awards over the years — including two Emmys, three Murrows, and a smattering of top distinctions from the Associated Press. He has also received a handful of coveted Azbee Awards for standout business reporting, most recently in recognition of his in-depth exposé of Google's business-aimed Android phone recommendations.
In his spare time, JR enjoys breathing, chewing, and staring aimlessly into space.
