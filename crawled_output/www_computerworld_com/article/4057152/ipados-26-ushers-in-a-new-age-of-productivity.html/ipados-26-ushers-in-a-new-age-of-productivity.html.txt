iPadOS 26 ushers in a new age of productivity

iPadOS 26 ushers in a new age of productivity

iPadOS 26 is a hugely important upgrade for Apple's popular tablet
Credit: 															Apple
With a Liquid Glass user interface design across all its products, Apple is shipping its new operating systems today, and while there are plenty of improvements across all its platforms (Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, TV), the iPad brings in a new set of features that realize the original promises of the device and makes it even more ‘Mac-like’.
Can you remember Apple’s iPad ad in which a young child asked: “What’s a computer?” Cast your mind back to those ‘Post-PC’ olden days and think about what’s happening with iPadOS 26, which takes several huge steps to realizing that promise. Does making the tablet more Mac-like make it a better PC replacement? Perhaps. It is at least a good alternative for any Windows 10 user seeking a new system.
Window management at last!
The first thing you’ll notice when you use iPadOS 26 for the first time will be the new windowing system, which gives you complete control over up to 12 windows, including how big they are, tiling and Mac-like traffic light controls. (Use these to close, minimize, and maximize windows and to access additional options on a long press of the light).
Such window management tools are a long-requested improvement that should transform iPads into being much more intuitive working spaces – particularly if you’re using an external display for a real ‘Mac-like’ vibe.
Helping you do what you want to do
It’s all very well having more control over the windows you are looking at, but what can you do with what you see there? A lot more in this release, it seems.
The revamped Files app lets you pin files to your dock. You can, for example, pin your iCloud folder to your iPad’s dock, which makes getting to the content you are working on far easier. Don’t worry if you or your company uses another cloud storage service, as this support extends to them too. You can also pop your most important folders in the Dock for quick access.
If you’ve not used an iPad before, the Dock is a strip of app and file icons that appears at the bottom of the iPad display to help you quickly and easily get to what you need.
Apple has at last also introduced an iPad version of the Mac’s Preview app. Preview lets you look at, edit, and mark up images and PDFs on your iPad using the same tools you use on your Mac. It’s a welcome introduction, particularly if you want to avoid coughing up cash to PDF app publishers for the ‘luxury’ of signing your name on digital contracts.
For me, the quietly stalking beast in this release is the improved automation, including Apple Intelligence tools, but also intelligent actions in Shortcuts, which lets you create your own custom workflows. We’ll have to wait to see if people do begin using these tools, but those who do should find it even easier to get things done on an iPad.
An amazing communication tool
For many of us, one of the best uses of the iPad is as a communication tool, particularly for video conferencing. This is about to become even more powerful, thanks to Apple’s Call Translation API and Live Translation, which means you can engage in constructive meetings with people despite any language barrier by delivering almost instant translation of what is being said. (And all on the device).
When making a call, using Messages, or in FaceTime, Live Translation will provide real-time translation captions in English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. When making a call using the Phone app, your words can be translated on screen in real time and then said in the language of the person you are speaking with. When they speak back, you’ll see their words translated on your screen and also hear a synthetic voice speaking to you in your own language. Even better, the other caller doesn’t need to be using an iPhone or iPad.
I really think Live Translation will be of huge use to international enterprise professionals. The API builds on this, making it possible to build translation into internal and externally-facing company apps. Messages (which can also translate Italian, Japanese, Korean and simplified Chinese, as well as the above) will also translate messages between languages for you.
There are several more features I think help make iPads more useful, including.
External audio. When you connect an external microphone (physically or wirelessly) you can now make sure it is your default input method, which wasn’t possible before. You can also capture high-quality audio and video during conference calls.
iPhone on iPad. The Phone app is also now available on iPad, which means you can use your iPhone to make calls directly from your iPad.
On background. Another improvement I think will be of benefit to knowledge workers, is the ability to have large file downloads and other computationally demanding processes run in the background while you continue to work.
Will you be downloading iPadOS 26 to your Apple tablet? Please let me know how you get on. I’m particularly interested to learn of the extent to which Live Translation may break down language barriers for business users.
