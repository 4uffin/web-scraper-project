DeepSeek, founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a Chinese entrepreneur, engineer and former hedge fund manager, is generating a lot of buzz — and for good reason. Here are five things that make it stand out (as well as a listing of the latest news and analysis about DeepSeek).
5 things you need to know about DeepSeek
More accessibility and efficiency: DeepSeek is designed to be less expensive to train and use than many competing large language models (LLMs).  Its architecture allows for high performance with fewer computational resources, which is designed to lead to faster response times and less energy consumption.
Open-source availability and rapid development DeepSeek is under active development with new models and features being released regularly.  Models are often available for public download (on Hugging Face, for instance), which encourages collaboration and customization.
Advanced capabilities: reasoning and multimodal learning Models like DeepSeek-R1 are designed with a focus on advanced reasoning capabilities, aiming to go beyond simple text generation. DeepSeek is expanding into multimodal learning, handling diverse input types such as images, audio and text for a more comprehensive understanding.
Limitations: Bias and context Like all LLMs, DeepSeek is susceptible to biases in its training data. Some biases may be intentional for content moderation purposes, which raises important ethical questions. While efficient, DeepSeek could have limitations in handling extremely long texts or complex conversations.
Architecture and performance DeepSeek uses  a “mixture of experts” architecture, employing specialized submodels for different tasks, enhancing efficiency and potentially reducing training data needs. DeepSeek has demonstrated competitive performance, comparable to established models in certain tasks, especially mathematics and coding.

September 18, 2025: A study has shown that DeepSeek AI may generate deliberately flawed code when prompts involve groups or regions deemed politically sensitive by Beijing, raising fresh concerns for enterprises about the security and reliability of Chinese AI systems.
DeepSeek releases new version of its R1 reasoning AI model
May 30, 2025: Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released an update to the R1 reasoning AI model that took the tech world by storm when it was launched at the beginning of the year. The new version, DeepSeek-R1-0528, has a whopping 685 billion parameters, meaning it can perform on par with competitors such as o3 from OpenAI and Gemini 2.5 Pro from Google.
DeepSeek’s open source movement
April 14, 2025: DeepSeek may have originated in China, but it stopped being Chinese the minute it was released on Hugging Face with an accompanying paper detailing its development. Soon after, a range of developers, including the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI), scrambled to replicate DeepSeek’s success as open source software.
How DeepSeek innovated large language models
March 13, 2025: The release of DeepSeek roiled the world of generative AI last month, leaving engineers and developers wondering how the company achieved what it did, and how they might take advantage of the technology in their own technology stacks.
DeepSeek claims 545% cost-profit ratio, challenging AI industry economics
March 4, 2025: In a GitHub post, DeepSeek estimated its daily inference cost for V3 and R1 models at $87,072, assuming a $2 per hour rental for Nvidia’s H800 chips. Theoretical daily revenue was pegged at $562,027, implying a 545% cost-profit ratio for DeepSeek with over $200 million in potential annual revenue.
DeepSeek offers steep discounts, escalating AI price war
February 26, 2025: Chinese AI firm DeepSeek unveiled a significant price reduction for developers using its AI models, a move that could intensify competition among both domestic and global rivals.
3 reasons Microsoft needn’t fear DeepSeek
February 12. 2025: Microsoft may have the most to lose from DeepSeek’s arrival. It’s invested billions of dollars in AI already, and has said this year alone it will invest another $80 billion. Given that DeepSeek said it built its newest chatbot so cheaply, is Microsoft throwing billions of dollars away? Can it compete with a company that can build genAI at such a low cost?
AI chatbot war breaks out with DeepSeek debut, and the winner is … you
February 5, 2025: DeepSeek’s chatbot hit Apple’s App Store and Google Play Store and downloads almost immediately exceeded those of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In short order, the DeepSeek-R1 AI model changed the genAI market, erasing $600 billion in market capitalization — the largest intraday decline in history — before markets started to recover.
Hackers impersonate DeepSeek to distribute malware
February 4, 2025: To make things worse
for DeepSeek, hackers were found flooding the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository with fake DeepSeek packages carrying malicious payloads. According to a discovery made by Positive Expert Security Center (PT ESC), a campaign was seen using this trick to dupe unsuspecting developers, ML engineers, and AI enthusiasts looking to integrate DeepSeek into their projects.
How would a potential ban on DeepSeek impact enterprises?
February 4, 2025: European regulators joined Microsoft, OpenAI, and the US government inefforts to determine if DeepSeek infringed on any copyrighted data from any US technology vendor. The investigations could potentially lead to a ban on DeepSeek in the US and EU, impacting millions of dollars that enterprises are already pouring into deploying DeepSeek AI models.
The DeepSeek lesson -— success without relying on Nvidia GPUs
Feb. 3, 2025: During the past two weeks, DeepSeek unraveled Silicon Valley’s comfortable narrative about generative AI (genAI) by introducing dramatically more efficient ways to scale large language models (LLMs). Without billions in venture capital to spend on Nvidia GPUs, DeepSeek had to be more resourceful and learned how to “activate only the most relevant portions of their mode
