With 94% faster evidence review, AI is helping attorney Brian Anderson fight for justice in hours — not days.

Artificial intelligence is now used in courtrooms for legal research, decision support, document automation, e-discovery, contract analysis, and even predicting case outcomes.
In some instances, the technology is even being used for jury selection, with AI-assisted voir dire tools analyzing verbal responses and facial expressions for bias. The legal community is one of the top 10 vertical industries using AI today.
Lawyers face a growing challenge with the surge of body-worn camera footage. Currently, 79% of local police departments in the US are utilizing body-worn cameras, and as many as 95% of federal law enforcement wear cameras.
AI now helps rapidly analyze what can be hundreds of hours of video footage from a single case, providing valuable support for both the prosecution and the defense.
For defense attorneys serving juvenile clients, AI-based video analysis tools are particularly crucial. By reviewing video evidence quickly, lawyers can argue for a client’s release on the same day versus what is often days.
“For vulnerable youth already struggling with arrest, every hour of freedom matters,” said Brian Anderson, a criminal defense attorney with his own practice, Anderson Law LLC.

Anderson said his use of AI saves up to 94% of evidence review time for his juvenile clients age 12-18. Anderson can now prepare for a bail hearing in half an hour versus days. The time saved by using AI also results in thousands of dollars in time saved.
While the tools for AI-based video analysis are many, Anderson uses Rev, a legal-tech AI tool that transcribes and indexes video evidence to quickly turn overwhelming footage into accurate, searchable information.
What prompted you to adopt AI for evidence review, and why did you choose Rev specifically over other legal tech tools? “The biggest challenge I faced was sorting through body cam footage. Police departments now use body cams extensively, so a single case can involve multiple officers, each with an hour or more of footage. This meant I could be sifting through four hours of video for a single case. It was a lot to go through, and many traditional transcriptionists weren’t interested in handling it due to poor audio quality and multiple speakers. I would often find myself watching the same scene from four different perspectives and fast-forwarding through the video, which was inefficient.
“I chose Rev because it turns that overwhelming amount of evidence into a manageable and searchable transcript. It’s a bargain for the value I’m getting. Now, instead of watching hours of video, I can upload the information, get a transcript, and use the generative AI chat as a “first pass.” I can literally ask questions like, “How many times is my client’s name mentioned?” This allows me to sift out irrelevant footage and focus on the really important pieces of a case.”
How does the AI technology integrate into your day-to-day case workflow — are there APIs, dashboards, or other tools you interact with directly? “The technology integrates very simply. I upload the video, and Rev provides a searchable transcript. A key feature are the hyperlinks embedded in the transcript. I can click on a specific part of the text, and it plays the exact audio from that moment. This is tremendously useful in court because it eliminates the manual process of having a video person create clips for me. I can just do it myself, on the fly, in about 30 seconds.
“I use the generative AI chat feature as my first pass, especially when I’m in a time crunch — for example, if I get access to a video 30 minutes before a hearing. I ask it questions and search keywords based on my review of the police report. This allows me to quickly isolate and narrow down the specific portions I need.”
You’ve seen a 94% reduction in evidence review time. How is that time savings translating into business value (ROI) for your practice? “The 94%-time reduction is transformative. What used to be four hours of body cam footage can now be condensed down to 15 really important minutes. This saves me at least three hours on a single case.
“The biggest ROI is in critical, time-sensitive situations, like a bail hearing. If a DA sends me three hours of video right after my client is arrested, I can upload it to Rev and be ready to make a bail argument in half an hour. This could be the difference between my client being held in custody for a week versus getting them out that very day. The time I save allows me to focus on what I need to do to win a case, like coming up with a persuasive argument or doing research.”
How much has adopting AI lowered your operational costs, and has it allowed you to scale or take on more clients? “Adopting Rev has easily saved my practice thousands of dollars. I have a small, intentional practice focused on one thing — defending kids. The efficiency AI affords has given me the freedom to use my time how I choose. This means I can dedicate more time to winning a case or, on some days, head home early to spend time with my family or other personal things that bring me joy.”
In what ways has using AI helped you improve service delivery for underserved communities, particularly families who can’t afford traditional legal fees? “My practice is intentionally small, focused on defending kids charged with crimes. The cost savings from Rev help me keep my practice accessible to families who need help most. When assessing a case, I don’t have to think about the hours — and thus additional expense — it’s going to take to go through evidence, then get that evidence into a form that’s easily usable in court. Rev does that for me.
“More importantly, the ability to make same-day bail arguments and secure my client’s release up to a week faster is a huge improvement in service delivery. For a traumatized youth already struggling with an arrest, every hour of freedom matters. Rev allows me to provide a fierce defense and potentially get kids out of detention much faster.”
How do you evaluate the accuracy and reliability of Rev’s AI transcriptions in high-stakes legal settings? “In high-stakes legal settings, I don’t just rely on the paper transcript. The transcript is my initial reference, but I use the hyperlinks to the audio for the actual words. This feature is incredibly powerful. For example, if an officer testifies in court that “the sky was black,” but on their body cam footage, they said “the sky is blue,” I can use the hyperlinked transcript to find that exact point. I just click a button on my laptop, and it plays the audio for them. When they hear their own voice, they’re often forced to admit they were wrong. This makes me an unstoppable force for truth in the courtroom.”
What’s your take on the broader role of AI in transforming solo or small legal practices — are we at an inflection point? “We are absolutely at an inflection point. I believe AI is leveling the playing field for solo and small practices. In the past, all of the time-consuming tasks of preparing for trial, like transcribing and editing video, were done manually. Rev has made it so easy to do on the fly, by myself, that I don’t have to anticipate where an officer will stray in their testimony. I can just react in real time. This technology empowers a small practice to have the same capabilities as a large one, allowing me to focus on the work that matters most.”
Are there features or capabilities you’d like to see Rev (or similar tools) develop to further improve your efficiency or case strategy? “The current capabilities are already incredibly helpful. I don’t have a specific request for a new feature, but I would be excited to see any further advancements that can continue to streamline the process.”
Have you been approached by other firms or public defenders interested in replicating your AI-driven workflow? “Yes, I have had conversations with other attorneys who are curious about how I use Rev. They see the same challenges I do with evidence overload and the need for quick turnarounds. I share my experience because I truly believe Rev is an important tool that has cut down on the time I spend going through evidence and made it so much easier to process and present information at trial. I wish I had found it sooner because it would have saved me so much time.”
As legal tech evolves, do you foresee building a hybrid practice that combines legal expertise with tech consulting or product partnerships? “My primary focus will always be on defending children. However, given the transformative impact that tools like Rev have had on my practice, I’m open to sharing my expertise and advocating for technology that empowers other solo and small firms.
“The ability to catch contradictions in real time and turn a time-consuming chore into a strategic advantage is a huge benefit. I believe that integrating legal knowledge with an understanding of new technologies is the future of the legal profession, particularly for those who operate with limited resources.”
