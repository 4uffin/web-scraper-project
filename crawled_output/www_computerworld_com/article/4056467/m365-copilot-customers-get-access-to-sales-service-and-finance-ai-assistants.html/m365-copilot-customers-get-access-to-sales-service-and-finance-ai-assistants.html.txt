Microsoft’s Copilots for sales, service and finance will be included in Microsoft 365 Copilot subscriptions at no extra cost, Microsoft said this week.
The M365 Copilot launched in 2023, providing access to the AI assistant in apps such as Outlook, Teams and Word. The core subscription costs $30 per user per month.
Last year, Microsoft introduced M365 Copilots tailored to specific job roles, namely for sales, service and finance, opening access to a wider range of business  and additional functionality. The Copilot for Sales, for instance, lets users access and update CRM records via the AI assistant, while the Copilot for Finance can tap into ERP systems and financial planning apps. It can also automate functions such as the creation of reconciliation reports.
These role-based Copilots cost an additional $20 on top of M365 Copilot subscriptions, for a total of $50 per user each month.
This week, Microsoft said the role-based Copilots will soon be available at no added cost. “There will be no changes to functionality for existing role-based Copilot customers,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Computerworld.
M365 Copilot customers will be able to access the sales, service and finance Copilots via the Microsoft 365 Copilot Agent Store beginning next month.
In related news, Microsoft will reportedly begin to integrate Anthropic’s AI models into M365 Copilot as it seeks to diversify its AI stack and reduce reliance on OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Microsoft is also building its own AI models, including MAI-1, which will power some Copilot features.
