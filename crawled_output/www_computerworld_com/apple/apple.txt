Apple
Apple, the iconic Cupertino, CA-based company that produces the popular iPhone, MacBook Air, iPad and a slew of other devices, computers and services, was long thought of as a consumer-centric firm. But the enterprise uptake of its hardware and popular operating systems (macOS, iOS, and iPadOS to name a few) has given Apple a real place in the business world. Most recently, it has begun to tout (and roll out) "Apple Intelligence," its take on the generative AI revolution.
Here's our latest round-up of news, analysis, features and authoritative opinion about what the company is doing:
