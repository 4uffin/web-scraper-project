Apple, the iconic Cupertino, CA-based company that produces the popular iPhone, MacBook Air, iPad and a slew of other devices, computers and services, was long thought of as a consumer-centric firm. But the enterprise uptake of its hardware and popular operating systems (macOS, iOS, and iPadOS to name a few) has given Apple a real place in the business world. Most recently, it has begun to tout (and roll out) "Apple Intelligence," its take on the generative AI revolution.
Here's our latest round-up of news, analysis, features and authoritative opinion about what the company is doing:

First Person Meets… Stephen Kaufman: Solving problems with technology and people
We meet Stephen Kaufman, who has spent 25 years architecting solutions on behalf of Microsoft. Stephen tells us that his defining characteristic is curiosity, and how his first memory was of taking things apart and putting them back together, more or less successfully. He says how that led him to a hobby in computers which in turn led him to a computer science degree. But he chose to major in both marketing and computers, because for him success is in solving problems with technology, for people.
