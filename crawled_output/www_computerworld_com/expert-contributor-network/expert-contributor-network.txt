The Foundry Expert Contributor Network is a free platform for IT experts to share their stories and insights in a way that truly resonates with their peers and their industry – after all, who better to tell the truth of what’s happening in IT than those living it?
The Expert Contributor Network is a collection of blogs written by you and other leading IT practitioners about the technology, business opportunities and challenges you face every day. Work with our award-winning editors to craft your own posts, published to the pages of CIO, Computerworld, CSO, InfoWorld and Network World. You can find recent examples here.

What you’ll do
We’re looking for 1,200-1,500-word articles on a variety of topics, and our editors can support you in building your post. We are interested in topics including artificial intelligence, cloud computing, data management, enterprise applications, emerging technology and more. In fact, here’s a look at our core topics:
AI / MLDatabasesNetworkingBusiness ApplicationsFuture of WorkProductivity SoftwareCloud ComputingIT LeadershipSecurity / CybersecurityData CenterIT ManagementSoftware DevelopmentData ManagementIT Strategy
We’re interested in a first-person perspective of your lived experience in the trenches as an IT and business decision-maker, your in-depth knowledge about the everyday challenges of senior IT- and business leaders, the considerations and calculations that go into making tough decisions.
Join now!
What we’ll do
For our part, we’ll do anything to enable you on all organizational matters, so you as a contributor can focus on writing content relevant to peers and our community of technology decision makers.
Provide an experienced editor to optimize your article for our audience, and to ensure alignment with our style guide and brand standards.
Publish the article on the most relevant brand website.
Promote it across our social channels, tagging both you and your organization for maximum visibility and re-sharing.
We’ll also reach out to you regularly to participate voluntarily in a crowd-sourced article, where we will present the thoughts, ideas, reactions and opinions of a variety of C-level IT and business decision-makers in one story. And, as the network grows, we’ll produce a monthly email newsletter featuring content from the Expert Contributor Network.
Join now!
What are the next steps?
Simply register your interest in the form below, and we’ll be in touch. An additional good next step would be to develop a pitch for an article with all the above in mind. You could choose any of the areas we mention above, but we’re also very open to hearing what stories you want to tell. The pitches don’t need to be much more than a working title/topic, and a few brief sentences synopsizing the article’s focus.
With that, we can approve as-is, or work with you to develop the story a bit more to ensure it will best resonate with an audience.
We ask all contributors to sign and return a simple Writer Agreement. It’s a standard end-user agreement that is as much for your protection as it is for ours.
If you have any questions, let us know by emailing edward.murray@foundryco.com.
