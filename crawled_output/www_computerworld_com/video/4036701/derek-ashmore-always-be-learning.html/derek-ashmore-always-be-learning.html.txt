OverviewWe meet Derek Ashmore, a career-long consultant who says the first thing we need to know about him is that he learns for a living. Derek talks about a fortuitous entry into the industry when accountancy turned into coding, but how a lack of political acumen (and patience) almost derailed him. The answer has been to work in consultancy, joining teams to act as mentor and mentee, learning and guiding to successful outcomes. Derek tells us how he doesn't believe in failure, but that his biggest mistakes have been not staying the course and trusting his judgement. But overall his career has been successful because he has given and taken something from everyone he has worked with.Register Now

Matt Egan ( .28) Hello, hello, hello.
00:01
Welcome to First Person, the show where we meet the most interesting people in IT and learn from them what makes them tick by focusing only on their firsts. I'm your host, Matt Egan, asking you to enjoy, like and subscribe wherever you find us.And if you are an interesting person in IT, let us know. You might be the next First Person. The next voice you will hear will be today's guest. He is Derek Ashmore. Derek is an author and presenter.He spends his time helping organizations unlock real value from cloud platforms using AI, cutting costs, improving security, achieving greater performance and availability. From that, you will be able to tell Derek is definitely one of the most interesting people in IT.We are delighted to have him as a guest on First Person. So Derek, welcome. And first up, what is the first thing people should know about you? Derek Ashmore ( .27) Great question.
00:52
I usually tell people that I learn for a living. That's what I do. I take time to give clients the benefit of those learnings and the people I work with the benefit of those learnings.But the way I look at it is I learn for a living and I have been doing that throughout my career. All right. Ever since. Matt Egan ( .966) I love that.
01:19
Derek Ashmore (
01:21
.518) ever since I started in a mainframe cobalt dv2 world through all the miscellaneous gyrations and transformations that I've made over the years. I guess what ends up happening is after a few years in one space I guess I get bored and I Matt Egan ( .965) Okay.
01:49
Derek Ashmore ( .062) or something else.
01:51
And so, I mean, I can take you through the trail, but I mean, essentially I've migrated from mainframes to client server development to case tool development to relational database administration to Java development and architecture. In fact, even wrote a couple of books in that space.in my time to the cloud and then to artificial intelligence. Matt Egan ( .075) Okay.
02:29
Always learning. Well, that makes me even more interested to have this conversation, Derek. And this is a trait we notice in successful people. But yeah, let's go into our first section, which we call First Things First.And this is where we like to get to know about our guests by understanding some of their first times. And you've kind of trailed this, but what could you tell us, Derek, about your way in? Tell us about your first job in this industry.Derek Ashmore ( .096) Always learning.
02:32
Derek Ashmore ( .766) That is interesting.
02:57
My first job was actually for Continental Bank, which no longer exists as an entity. In college, I actually studied business or operations research. All right. So I was intending to be somebody that figures out how long traffic lights are at different… different intersections and that kind of stuff.And the first job I got at Continental Bank, they stuck me in a training class. This is back when they didn't expect people to know how to code. They were expecting to have to teach them.basically that class at the end of that class, they figured out whether you're going to go the accounting route or whether or not you were going to be a programmer. And I suck at accounting. So basically, and as it turned out, I lucked out.I turned out to have an aptitude for application development and coding and appeared to learn that skill set. Matt Egan ( .357) Yeah.
04:03
Derek Ashmore (
04:24
.236) very quickly, although I did have a couple of comp sci classes in college, but I didn't major in that. And so I really lucked out. I consider myself very lucky from that perspective.And basically that's where I learned all my rookie mistakes as far as how to deal with corporate politics, as far as some of the more Soft skills that that you need in in corporate environments and I guess I mean I'm either lucky or klutzy depending upon how you look at it, but I made my my my my corporate political mistakes early and learned from them so In a learning mode kind of thing I don't have to repeat lessons very often Matt Egan ( .422) I'm Matt Egan (
05:03
.455) I mean.
05:15
Matt Egan (
05:20
.639) Yeah, one of my bug bears is the idea of luck versus good fortune, right? Like it may have been good fortune that you were given the opportunity, but clearly, you you had some aptitude for it, right?And you were also able to recognise, I could be good at this, this is the thing for me. But I wonder how you got from… there to where you are today, right? You've already trailed this. There've been lots of changes.There've been lots of different iterations of Derek's career kind of thing. What takes you from that initial point of, it's coding or accountancy, I'm encoding, to drive through this incredible career you've had? Derek Ashmore (
06:07
.64) Well, as it turns out, I'm not without, I won't say wrong turns, but turns I didn't necessarily take advantage of.Given that I started with a bank at that point in time, if you were going to climb up the corporate ladder, as it were, you basically were incented at that time to get an MBA. Matt Egan ( .791) you Matt Egan (
06:13
.463) Mm-hmm.
06:30
Derek Ashmore ( .152) All right.
06:37
And so I dutifully did that. I basically applied and was fortunate enough to get into a top tier MBA school and started down that path. And somewhere in that time frame, I started working on a client server development.I'd already migrated off of mainframes to something, something, something else. And I started working with a independent consultant. And they turned me on to the fact that, Derek, you have talented this, you have other options. You do not necessarily need to climb the corporate ladder.And he, he educated me as to what the world of independent consulting is like, what the options are, the costs and the benefits are, very level-headed kind of individual.And he basically acted as my mentor as I made the transition from corporate life into consulting, which I guess really is corporate life, but it's a little bit different flavor.I find that consulting basically fit me and my attitude towards learning and learning new things because you basically it's your job to do that in that kind of realm. So basically. Matt Egan ( .671) Yeah.
08:29
So you've got the kind of mind where you like to learn new things. Presumably you like to move on from project to project. But again, it feels fortunate, but you know, in your gift that you were able to recognise that.I'm really one of the questions we often ask about this stage of the conversation is about a great boss or a great mentor. And it sounds like at this stage, this is where you found somebody who recognised in you. Derek Ashmore ( .406) That's right.
08:39
Derek Ashmore ( .917) Yes.
08:55
Matt Egan (
08:56
.787) that you were going to be better or maybe brilliant at being a consultant who moves from things to things rather than staying in this corporate situation. Derek Ashmore (
09:07
.842) Yes, yes, I was like, like I said, I was, I was fortunate and that's not the first mentor I've had. So I always, I actively seek to that. Someone once told me that if I'm the smartest person in the room, I'm in the wrong room.Matt Egan ( .768) Okay.
09:14
Matt Egan ( .727) Yeah, yeah, totally.
09:25
Hard agree. But what does it mean to you then to have that kind of mentor figure? What are you looking for? Is it as simple as that? Is it who can tell you something you don't know, maybe? Derek Ashmore (
09:39
.374) I look at it as a two-way street. Some as I've evolved, know, some mentors I have gotten more than I've given, right? But I try not to make my exchanges that one-sided. I try to contribute to the conversation as well.And normally what happens is I… Matt Egan ( .177) Yeah.
09:51
Derek Ashmore (
10:09
.312) I look at it that everybody has things that they do well and things that are challenges to them. Right? So normally I look for people who are complementary. Right?So oftentimes there are places where I can help others out in addition to they can help educate me on different points. So just so that I can get better. I try to take a constructive attitude towards everything. That's just my nature. Matt Egan ( .403) Yeah.
10:44
Yeah. No, for sure. Matt Egan (
10:51
.497) So has it been a continual thing to have those mentor-mentee relationships as you've gone along?Which I'm guessing, like in a consultancy role, like you're not, you know, you're not always part of these larger organisations, but you've still successfully found people to mentor and people to be your mentors as you've gone along through your career. Derek Ashmore ( .704) That's right.
11:11
There has, in fact, just about every consultant engagement that I've had, and I've had well over two dozen at this point, right? Probably more like three or four dozen. But anyway, just about every consultant consulting engagement that I've been at for any length of time, I retain.know, friendships and associations with the people that I've worked with. And if somebody needs help or needs assistance, I always work on the theory that, you know, goodwill will come back to me at some point. So I always volunteer to help others and… Matt Egan ( .353) Definitely.
11:57
Derek Ashmore (
12:04
.542) in those cases where I need help on a specific topic or whatnot, normally somebody's willing to help me with that. Matt Egan (
12:14
.353) I always say this, that you should never feel bad about reaching out to the person in your network because you never feel bad when someone reaches out to you. I'm always happy to help somebody because that is how it works.I would think that certainly working in that consultancy role, I mean, I think it's the same in any role, honestly, and I've worked for the same corporation for 22 years, but I think… Derek Ashmore ( .974) That's right.
12:24
Matt Egan (
12:40
.455) I think in that consultancy role, it's especially important that you're always adding value and giving because you're going to be able to reach out and get the help you need when you need it.Tell me, Derek, have you been, so you've been consulting ever since like that first course? Derek Ashmore ( .57) That is correct.
12:57
I spent a couple decades as an independent consultant. And some of the people that I've worked with ended up being, we were all doing complimentary things.And we got the idea that, well, you know, if we joined forces, we could achieve Matt Egan ( .206) and Derek Ashmore (
13:22
13:27
.074) better things than we could individually. And so we got together and we formed Sparedis Consulting, which is who I work for. Basically, we're a boutique cloud consulting firm that has migrated onto things now that most… Most corporations are already in the cloud.We're past the days of like the early adopter kinds of phases and we're helping people deliver a lot more value to their customers. Matt Egan (
14:09
.417) So I guess you've almost got the best of all worlds there, right?Because you've got the independence and the, I guess what I'm hearing is that the need to constantly learn and develop and try new things, but you're also part of a collective, which means you have that kind of, not safety net, but that community around you where you can rely on other people to figure things out collectively if required.Derek, this is all. Derek Ashmore (
14:33
.048) That is the best. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Matt Egan (
14:36
.007) Well, was going say this is all sounding really rather too positive and you've already trailed some of your failures.So if you don't mind, I feel we need to move to our second section, which is where we really dig into those failures, because we're not just here for the good stuff. Right.And I suspect in your lifelong learning, you've learnt a lot from your mistakes as you've gone on.So I wonder if you could tell me something about the first mistake that comes to mind or the first big mistake that you've had professionally and maybe if you did learn something from it. Derek Ashmore (
15:06
.446) that is a good question. First of all, let's define failure. I look at life as, as, as an experiment. All right. When people hear the word failure, they think that definitely means a bad thing to my way of thinking.That is something that I did that doesn't work out. And I should not do that again. Matt Egan ( .27) Thank Matt Egan (
15:10
.443) Mm-hmm.
15:15
Matt Egan ( .237) Mm-hmm.
15:30
Derek Ashmore (
15:34
.552) That doesn't mean I go back and criticize myself because I chose that in the first place. I don't have a time machine, right? can't go back and make a different decision. So I would say early on, I made some Matt Egan (
15:44
.669) Yeah, yeah, Derek Ashmore (
16:03
.758) political mistakes in my first job. And as a result, I didn't advance as far as I thought that my skill set should have enabled me to advance.So I took a look at that and I did some internal introspection and figured out, this is what I did wrong. And I should not do that again.I guess another mistake was not having us, or actually having a side conversation with somebody in these days where, you know, we're… doing slacks and teams and accidentally saying something that was embarrassing, what I thought was a private message that ended up getting displayed because the group was presenting at the time.And I learned Matt Egan ( .567) Thank Derek Ashmore (
17:09
17:26
.242) very quickly that, you know, that is something I need to like not do again. Matt Egan ( .474) Yeah.
17:35
The interesting thing about that, Derek, you wouldn't believe, but like in an interview earlier in this series, somebody else said exactly the same thing, right? Like the whole thing, like failure, don't really accept that, right? You try something, you make a mistake, you learn from it.But the one thing I can never come back from is in her case, it was she'd sent an email to the wrong person, criticising them. So there are some things, it turns out, that you can just learn not to do them. Derek Ashmore ( .766) Yeah.
17:58
Matt Egan (
18:04
.061) I wonder if… Derek Ashmore (
18:06
.068) And there's another failure I would mention. Basically, I was fortunate enough to spot the whole microservices trend early on. And in fact, actually one of my books focuses on microservices back when it was early and I was in the early adopter phase. Matt Egan ( .076) Yeah.
18:09
Derek Ashmore (
18:35
.924) I very quickly realized that microservices basically had limitations. In other words, everything shouldn't be microservices. Everything doesn't deserve to be microservices. And I guess I hit that trough of disillusionment before everybody else did.And I think I could have, now this might be a positive or might, it would definitely be a, it definitely was a business failure for not sticking with that scene longer when it finally caught on because I could have capitalized on it much more than I did.Matt Egan (
19:26
.207) I think even just recognizing that is a thing.One of the questions I sometimes ask at this point, which is kind of like that, but I wonder if you might have a different answer is, if there's, you know, in this, this lifelong learning approach that you've taken, you know, is there a first time you can think of where you realize something that you knew actually was wrong?Like, has there ever been a point where something you thought you knew turned out to be wrong? Or I guess in your case, if you're continually learning, things adapt and evolve anyway as you go. Derek Ashmore ( .348) Yeah.
19:30
Derek Ashmore (
19:56
.238) there has never been something that I've done that I looked at and said, okay, this was perfect. I couldn't have ever better in any way, shape or form that just doesn't happen.I guess, one of the, the wrong turns, I think I'm, I, I made in the days of, early Java development, there was a, Matt Egan ( .405) Yeah, fine.
20:05
Matt Egan ( .857) Yeah.
20:10
Derek Ashmore (
20:25
.824) an acknowledged need to be able to Java classes to relational database tables. All right. And this was in the days before Hibernate was a thing. Matt Egan ( .723) Mm-hmm.
20:36
Derek Ashmore ( .352) Right?
20:44
And I think the decision that I made back then was to take a look at the metadata of a database and the tables in it and dynamically generate Java source that pertained to that. Right?So that basically eliminated the need for application programmers to actually code things like SQL statements and those kinds of things. I think the need identification was like spot on. It definitely was a need.There's a reason that Hibernate got invented and it existed, but I think there were more elegant ways for me to solve to address that need. than the code generation tactic that I took. And I didn't realize that until later.And Hibernate came along and basically took the game away. So. Matt Egan (
21:54
.002) It's not like the two previous points, right? None of this has ever been like a complete full stop failure. It's very much a yes, rather than no kind of thing. And I guess the lesson from this is where you came in at the beginning, right?Which is if your approach and your attitude is that you're continuously learning from every environment, from every experience, from every person, you almost can't fail because you're going to continually develop and evolve your approach and your knowledge. Derek Ashmore ( .471) That's right.
22:04
Derek Ashmore ( .76) Right.
22:21
Yeah. And I guess the lesson I kind of learned from that and a couple other experiences is that there's this whole time thing to what's a good idea and what's not. Right.I mean, I think I was right in addressing the need, but I think I was like, you know, a couple of things where I was right, but at the wrong time or Matt Egan ( .931) Mm-hmm.
22:33
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Matt Egan ( .533) Yeah.
22:49
Derek Ashmore (
22:51
.182) And I think I was very quick to exit a couple of things where I shouldn't have been. Microservices being one of them, right? Matt Egan (
23:00
.445) Yeah, well, yeah, we live and learn, I guess. Derek, this is super interesting and I really appreciate the benefit of your wisdom here. I'm going to move on now because I want to make sure that we sort of keep to our normal time scale.And I'm going to move on to a section that we call quick fire first, because we want to get to know you beyond your professional persona and veneer. We want to find out about the real person.And we do that by using a piece of proprietary technology that I built called the random question generator. Derek Ashmore ( .772) Okay.
23:21
Derek Ashmore ( .262) You Matt Egan (
23:29
23:29
.823) So Derek, could you please pick a number between what are we at? One and 14. Derek Ashmore ( .814) I will pick 17.
23:36
Matt Egan (
23:40
.255) I said one and fourteen, but I can go for number seven if that's… Derek Ashmore ( .632) okay.
23:46
said one. All right. I misheard you. my. Let's go seven. Matt Egan ( .072) Number seven.
23:51
Okay. Please tell me something about the first place you would go if time and money were no objects. Right. You can just drop in from and go there anywhere in the world. Where would you go right now? Derek Ashmore (
24:06
.926) Where would I go right now? I think if I could just drop everything, would basically go to Europe and start off in Amsterdam. And I think what I would like to do and Matt Egan ( .619) Mm-hmm.
24:25
Derek Ashmore (
24:30
.762) expanding the time horizon a little bit.One of my dreams is to be able to go live in interesting places for like say six or nine months, travel a lot, and then basically go to another place and live there for six or six or nine months or something like that.The goal for me would be to be able to get past all the tourist stuff. Matt Egan ( .481) cost.
24:33
Matt Egan ( .983) Mm-hmm.
24:41
Matt Egan ( .582) Yeah.
24:47
Matt Egan ( .659) Yeah.
24:52
Yeah. Matt Egan (
24:58
.93) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Derek Ashmore (
25:00
.094) and relationships and get a sense for how the people live, know, beyond the tourism aspect, right? Not just this, but. Matt Egan ( .689) Yeah.
25:07
Yeah. I suppose in a weird way, you've kind of had that experience professionally through consulting, right? Because you get to be a part of the team, but not forever. I've spent a lot of my professional life commuting to the US.In my life, I've spent more than a year in Boston, but I've never lived there. just worked there for weeks on end.And I sort of feel that's a privilege as well, because you get to see… like the differences and the similarities and people are the same everywhere but they're also different everywhere, so getting beyond the tourist to your point without actually fully committing to a place.That's a really cool answer. We've never had that before, Derek. I appreciate that. Could you maybe pick another number between 1 and 14? Derek Ashmore ( .07) Certainly, let's pick 11.
26:01
Matt Egan ( .511) Number 11.
26:04
Okay, so this is, we never know what we're gonna get with this question. Could you tell me something about the first record you can remember buying and what it meant to you? Derek Ashmore (
26:18
.402) The first record that I remember was my dad playing some Janis Joplin music for me. Basically when I was a young kid, Take a Piece of My Heart. I remember that song, That and the Doors basically were Matt Egan ( .716) there you go.
26:29
Matt Egan ( .143) Yeah, yeah.
26:38
What a tube. What a- Matt Egan ( .275) Yeah.
26:44
Okay. Derek Ashmore (
26:48
.27) things that I was introduced to early. I evolved rather differently from that. These days I tell people I listen to dead people because I listen to a lot of classical music and I play classical music. I basically do… Matt Egan ( .513) Okay.
26:58
Derek Ashmore (
27:13
.422) do mostly that, but if you look at my record collection, it's all over the place. Matt Egan (
27:20
.499) Yeah, well, that's a good thing, right? Surely, think. I don't believe in guilty pleasure, I believe in pleasures, right? And there is something definitely to be said for those kind of childhood memories of your parents playing.And to be fair, your dad's coming out that quite well, because I think his tastes, I mean, it could have been a lot worse, right? So, really, really interesting, like the dichotomy between where you started and where you are now.That's cool, but you still have those fond memories of that music from childhood. Derek Ashmore ( .446) you Derek Ashmore (
27:22
.71) Yeah.
27:38
Derek Ashmore ( .583) Yes.
27:46
Yes. Matt Egan ( .144) Amazing.
27:51
Well, thank you, Derek. can't, how does this is to say we're actually moving into our final section now. This has been such an interesting conversation. But I'm really interested to ask you, Derek, what would be the first piece of advice you would give to someone who's just started.Derek Ashmore (
28:07
.31) I guess what I tell people who are just starting out, and in fact I even told my son this, although I don't think the lesson has resonated yet, but when you first start out, what's more important is you getting the experience and you learning and adding to your skill set.Matt Egan ( .795) Do it time.
28:19
Derek Ashmore (
28:35
.052) that is more important than the money. Although I remember starting out with a comparatively small salary and understand the whole concept of living hand to mouth is no fun. I get that.But I remember somebody I was coaching at one of the one of the places I was leading application development for. And I was trying to convince him to move to my team.That basically I couldn't really meaningfully increase his salary right then and there, but I could teach him enough in two years where he could go outright double his salary. and it turned out he took the short-term decision.He moved to a separate team, took a modest 5 % raise and didn't realize that, no, I was serious.You may have to live at the level that without the 5 % raise for a little while, but I will make it so that you can go out into the market and your skill set would, you know, I can escort you into the higher level of living that you want.You have to be a little patient and you have to put in some elbow grease. Matt Egan (
30:14
.079) Yeah, no, I think that's very good advice that, um, yeah, it's funny. Speaking to, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, it's, know, you, you do have to do the work, right?Like we were having a conversation with someone on this series, very similar, only a few days ago, like, like there is no, um, there's, there's no alternative to doing the work. And yeah, to your point. Derek Ashmore (
30:17
.49) and I've pulled back to several people along the way as well. Matt Egan (
30:38
.969) have to play the long game. And I also appreciate you saying that, you know, it isn't any fun living hand to mouth. We do have to. I think sometimes it's easy to forget that if you've gone beyond that point.But again, if you take yourself and your career seriously, you have to believe that you can you can get to the next stage that requires you to put the work in. Derek Ashmore (
30:58
.37) That's, I completely agree with that. Matt Egan ( .819) Excellent.
31:01
Derek, I'm going to ask you one final question, if you don't mind. And I'm really interested to ask you specifically, what's the first project or achievement that you would want to tell people about, if you could only tell them about one thing?What's Derek's masterpiece from this great and storied career? Derek Ashmore ( .182) Thank Derek Ashmore (
31:03
.79) What's Derek's masterpiece?
31:19
That's a hard question because I was serious about the fact that I've never taken a look at everything and thought it perfect, right? Matt Egan ( .927) you Matt Egan (
31:24
31:35
.731) But maybe that's it, right? Maybe it's the collective, it's the fact that you've continued to develop. Derek Ashmore (
31:40
.994) That, I mean, that is true. can look at several things that I've done that at the time I thought was fantastic. And I look at it now and I hold my face and my hands and. Matt Egan ( .055) Thank Matt Egan (
31:53
.424) That's just life.
31:58
Derek Ashmore (
32:00
.942) I guess the thing I would point to was my first Java architecture book. Not that it was a fantastic book, but I had the presence of mind to do self-publishing before it was cool. Matt Egan ( .739) There you go.
32:18
That's pretty cool. Derek Ashmore (
32:20
.814) All right, and right now you can go into the bookstore if you can still find a bookstore for and literally I know what to look for literally about a quarter of them are self-published.Right, but back when I did this in like say 2003-2004 Matt Egan ( .233) Yeah.
32:40
Derek Ashmore (
32:48
.334) That wasn't the case. And that was really, that really took a lot and was a fair amount of risk at that point. It cost me about $15,000 at that point to go through the process and to put it on the market.And as it turns out, I made many times that. in terms of revenue so it was successful. if, you know, it was a couple nail-biting months in terms of making new investment and hoping it paid off and hoping I wasn't going to take a bath on it.Matt Egan ( .243) Yeah.
33:28
Matt Egan ( .599) Yeah.
33:37
Well, I mean, the interesting thing there, Eric, like is so few published by publisher books, you know, very few authors who are paid in advance get more than the advance. Whereas you having, having in essence put up your own advance, like, read the benefits.So that's a, that's a good story to add to the overall sense of we're continually learning, we're trying things, we're optimistic that the best is yet to come. I think that's a really nice. Derek Ashmore ( .867) Thank Matt Egan (
