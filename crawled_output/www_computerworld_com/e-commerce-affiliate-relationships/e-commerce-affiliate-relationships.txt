E-commerce Affiliate Relationships
E-commerce Affiliate Relationships
In much of our product-focused content, you’ll find buttons and text links that redirect to Amazon and other reputable online retailers. If you click on one of these affiliate links, and end up buying something from the retailer, our parent company, Foundry, will earn a small commission on your purchase. This revenue helps keep us in business, and ensures that our writers can continue to publish news, reviews, how-tos, and analysis to the highest editorial standards.
The inclusion of affiliate links does not influence the editorial direction of our product coverage. We are committed to evaluating products with utmost integrity, and the inclusion of an affiliate link should not be interpreted as a product endorsement.
Indeed, we make every attempt to apply affiliate links across the board to all product reviews—regardless of whether a product receives a poor, average, or exceptional score. So, if you don’t find a link in a product review, it’s likely we couldn’t find an online retailer selling the product at the time of publication, or the review was originally published before May 2016 (the month and year when we began our affiliate program in earnest).
Currently, Amazon is our main affiliate partner. Between Amazon’s strong pricing, inventory, and Prime membership benefits, it’s often our first choice for online shopping. That said, we also apply affiliate links for Apple, Best Buy, Newegg, and other reputable online retailers. The choice of one affiliate source over another should not be interpreted as an editorial endorsement, and we can’t guarantee that the link we’ve chosen represents the product’s best current price.
