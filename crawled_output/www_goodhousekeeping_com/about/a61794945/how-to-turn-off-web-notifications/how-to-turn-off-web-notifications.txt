If you’re anything like me, you love getting Good Housekeeping notifications that keep you up to speed on home decor, food, and even beauty. Maybe you’ve been receiving these notifications by accident, or you might have even signed up to receive updates from GoodHousekeeping. (If so, good choice on your part!)Although you might love seeing updates on new recipes,
viral kitchen gadgets, or the latest Amazon deals, we totally understand that you might no longer want to receive these notifications. Luckily, we did you a favor and created a step-by-step guide on how to disable notifications in Google Chrome and Safari. How to Turn Off Notifications in Google Chrome: Open Chrome on whatever device you are using.Go to the top right corner, click on the three vertical dots, and select “Settings.”Scroll Down to find the “Advanced” section.Navigate to Privacy and Security and click on a subsection called “Site Settings.” Scroll to “Notifications.” Select which website you want notifications from.Automatic Notifications vs. Asking Permission:This is the part where you get to choose whether you want notifications automatically or you want to be asked first. If you chose to have a website ask your permission before sending you a notification, you will receive a pop-up that says “Allow” notifications or “Block” notifications.Take a moment to scroll to the section that is marked “Allow” notifications and click on the set of three vertical dots. Here you can choose to block, edit, or remove certain sites.Select “Block” if you want to block the website from sending you notifications. Select “Edit” to change the website’s name in the notifications you receive.If you choose “Remove,” the notification will stop for a period of time, but you might be asked again if you want to resubscribe in the future.What If I Want Notifications Again?We are all entitled to change our minds! If this is true for you, it’s pretty simple to reverse this process. First things first, head back to the website you disabled notifications from. You will likely be asked if you want to subscribe to notifications again. Hit “Allow” to enable the notifications.
How Do I Turn Off Notifications in Safari on Mac?If you’re using Safari on a Mac (like me at this moment), fixing your notifications looks different, but that’s nothing we can’t handle. After opening the Safari App on your Mac, click on Safari in the top left corner of your screen, find the preferences, and then open up a section that says “Websites” under a little globe icon. After clicking on this option, you’ll find a list of different sites you may have subscribed to or visited. Select “On” or “Off” from the drop-down arrows from each site to choose your notification preference.
