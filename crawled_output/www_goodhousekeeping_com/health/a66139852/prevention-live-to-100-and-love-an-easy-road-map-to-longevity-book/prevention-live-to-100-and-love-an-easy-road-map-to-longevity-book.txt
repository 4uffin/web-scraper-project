Prevention’s new book, Live to 100 and Love It!: An Easy Road Map to Longevity, is a comprehensive guide to aging healthfully from the inside out, and features answers to all the questions you’ve ever had about getting older, conveniently located between the same two covers.Prevention Live to 100 and Love It!: An Easy Road Map to Longevity$25 at Amazon$25 at WalmartThat’s not to say that the book is dense with overwhelming information. In fact, it features 100-plus photos and digestible bits of input from Prevention editors and experts, all of which are science-backed. The tips cover disease prevention, memory preservation, social well-being, and more—because aging is quite the dimensional process, and so many factors go into making it not only smooth and enjoyable, but rewarding. More specifically, the book answers the question: Is it possible to reverse aging? With that comes insight on superagers (those thriving well into their 80s and beyond), maintaining youthful energy through every decade of life, and strategies for maximizing your “healthspan.” Those include practical, hands-on pointers like 25 exercises to help preserve and build your balance, flexibility, strength, and cardiovascular endurance—all of which are keys to lasting vitality. Healthy aging diet plans—including the Mediterranean Diet, DASH diet, and MIND diet—are also discussed, as are tips for navigating menopause and sexual health later in life. The book even covers myths about aging (like the fact that it isn’t fun!) and gentle, encouraging pushes to imagining an expansive, buoyant future.To help you put all of its guidance into action, the book ends with simple to-do checklists—including a three-week longevity challenge. This will ensure that what you learn from its contents makes it into your daily life.The book was released on September 16 and is available to purchase on Amazon. It would make a great gift during the upcoming holiday season, and the perfect resource to heed going into the New Year. Truly, what’s a better gift than a longer life?
