Doctors Say It DependsHere's what doctors and researchers want you to know about the hormone-disrupting chemicals printing from the cash register.By Julie StewartPublished: Sep 13, 2025Medically reviewed by Eric M.

The nonprofit Center for Environmental Health recently sent violation notices to 119 companies after finding high levels of bisphenol S (BPS), a chemical similar to bisphenol A (BPA), in receipts printed at their stores and restaurants. BPA is a known endocrine disruptor, which means it can alter hormone function. That’s why so many people opt for BPA-free water bottles and baby food. Do we need to rethink touching receipts, too?Probably, experts say. “This is a fairly large exposure of bisphenols for people,” says Gillian Zaharias Miller, Ph.D., senior scientist at The Ecology Center.To really understand the risk, we explored the research and asked experts to explain how bad paper receipts really are for our health.Jump to:What toxic chemicals are in receipts?Why are these chemicals in receipts? How can the chemicals in receipts harm health?What is the safest way to handle receipts?What toxic chemicals are in receipts?The story starts with BPA. About 15 years ago, researchers realized many receipts contained the endocrine-disrupting chemical. As a result, the states of Connecticut and Illinois banned receipts with BPA. In turn, the makers of receipt paper introduced BPA-free options. But BPA-free didn’t always mean bisphenol-free. Some swapped in BPS, a "cousin" of BPA with a similar chemical structure. In a 2023 study published in the journal Environmental Pollution, Miller and colleagues found bisphenol S in 85% of receipts tested from national and local retailers.“Because of the structural similarity, there are similarities in those chemicals’ actions in the body, in particular, their ability to interact with hormone receptors, which is the source of their potential toxicity,” says Miller. Why are these chemicals in receipts? It turns out receipts aren’t printed with run-of-the-mill ink. They’re created using thermal printing, which quickly spits out numbers and letters on special heat-sensitive paper. “Instead of a printer that shoots out ink, the printer head applies heat in tiny little spots on the paper,” says Miller.zuperia//Getty ImagesThermal paper is coated with thin layers of chemicals, including a developer chemical that reacts with heat to darken the receipt. That developer is often BPS, which makes up about 1% of the receipt. That sounds small, but research shows that BPA leaches from thermal paper faster than it does from a polycarbonate water bottle. On top of that, these chemicals easily slough off thermal paper. The thin BPS layer on a receipt is made of tiny molecules that aren’t chemically bound to the other materials around it, says Miller. While it often takes heat or wear and tear to release bisphenols from hard plastics, simply touching a receipt is enough to loosen these substances. “They do absorb through the skin, and ingestion by touching your face or your mouth is also a known route of exposure,” says Miller.How can the chemicals in receipts harm health?“Bisphenols are endocrine disruptors,” says Philip J. Landrigan, M.D., MSc, the director of the Program for Global Public Health and the Common Good at Boston College. “They're manufactured chemicals, and when they get into the human body, they can basically hack or hijack the endocrine system and send out garbled signals to the organs of the body, which can result in diseases.”Touching a receipt isn’t going to throw off your hormones immediately. You don’t need to handle receipts with tongs, no matter what you saw on TikTok. However, repeated exposure over time could add up, especially for people who already have something hormone-related going on, says Dr. Landrigan. “It could aggravate underlying disease, especially in somebody who's overweight or has elevated cholesterol or liver disease,” he explains. People who spend a lot of time touching receipts, such as retail cashiers and restaurant servers, face the most risk, according to Dr. Landrigan. “Especially if one of them happens to be a pregnant woman, and the chemical gets into her body, the chemical can pass through to her child, and infants in the womb are much more sensitive to endocrine disrupting chemicals, like bisphenol S, than adults,” he says.What is the safest way to handle receipts? Go digital. When a store
gives you a choice between a paper or an email receipt, opt for email. It
saves paper and reduces the chemical exposure. Plus, “if you're meticulous
about keeping your files, the e-receipt is probably better anyway,” says Dr. Landrigan.
Give paper receipts a quick fold. “If you do get a paper receipt, fold it printed side in, because
that's the side with the chemical layers,” says Miller. “The backside
doesn't have the chemical layers, so that's one simple thing to reduce
exposure.”
Wash your hands. After touching
a receipt, wash your hands with soap and water as soon as possible to
remove bisphenol residue from your fingers. “Absorption is a gradual
process, so interrupting that by washing your hands is a very good idea,”
says Miller.
Wear gloves if you touch receipts often. If you must handle receipts at work, wear nitrile gloves or reusable
work gloves to reduce bisphenol exposure, says Miller. Research found that workers who wore gloves while handling receipts didn’t
increase their BPA levels by the end of a shift, while those who handled
receipts with bare hands had increases in BPA levels. Gloves could also be helpful if you handle shipments frequently, says Miller. The labels that go on shipping packages are often made of thermal paper.Medically reviewed byEric M. Ascher, D.O.Eric M. Ascher, D.O. is a board-certified family medicine physician.
