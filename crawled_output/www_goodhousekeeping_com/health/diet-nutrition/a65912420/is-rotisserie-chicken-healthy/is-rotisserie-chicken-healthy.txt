Most store-bought versions are high in sodium, may contain additives, and the skin adds saturated fat.It can still be part of a healthy diet when paired with vegetables, whole starches, and healthy fats. There’s no denying the appeal of a rotisserie chicken. You can have a perfectly seasoned — and cooked — chicken on your dinner table with just a quick stop at your local grocery store. “Rotisserie chicken is convenient, versatile, affordable and protein-rich,” says Karolin Saweres, MS, RDN, LD, the owner of My Nutrition & Me. It also tastes great. But can something that tastes so good and requires so little prep work actually be good for you? To find out whether rotisserie chicken is actually healthy, we consulted two top nutritionists to find out what advice they give their clients. What is rotisserie chicken?“Rotisserie chicken is a chicken that is cleaned, trimmed, and often seasoned or marinated with dry rubs, brines, or injected flavor solutions,” says Saweres. “The chicken is often roasted for about 1.5 to 2 hours at a moderate temperature. The result is usually crispy skin, juicy meat, and rich flavor without needing much added fat.”Is rotisserie chicken healthy?“Rotisserie chicken can be a nutritious and practical choice,” says Samantha Cassetty, MS, RD, the co-author of Sugar Shock. “It’s a lean protein source that helps keep you full and helps you meet your protein requirements for muscle maintenance and overall health.”Plus, you can’t beat the convenience. Because rotisserie chicken is precooked, it’s a huge time-saver. “When you have a rotisserie chicken (or pick on up on your way home), it encourages you to eat at home instead of grabbing a less nutritious takeout option,” says Cassetty.However, it’s not perfect. “Most store-bought rotisserie chickens are seasoned and injected with salt, flavorings, and additives, leading to a high sodium content,” says Saweres. “Some versions contain additives such as MSG, sugars and/or phosphates, which can be a concern for individuals with kidney issues and food sensitivities.” For reference, a 3-ounce serving of rotisserie chicken can contain more than 400 mg of sodium while a 3-ounce serving of unseasoned grilled chicken breast contains less than 50 mg of sodium. “Also, the crispy skin is delicious, but like all chicken skin, it’s high in saturated fat so it’s best enjoyed in moderation,” adds Cassetty.One last thing to keep in mind about rotisserie chicken is sustainability and the health of the earth. "If you’re considering environmental impact, poultry production has a larger footprint than plant-based proteins," says Cassetty. To minimize your impact, try to buy from a local farm or butcher. If you can't do that but still want to know where your chicken is from, you can look up the USDA plant number on the package to figure out where it was processed, or you can buy from a brand like Farmer Focus which includes a Farm ID on each package that you can look up to pinpoint where the chicken came from. That said, sometimes the cooked rotisserie chicken label doesn’t make the chicken's origin clear, especially when it’s cooked in-store, so it’s smart to ask someone working at the meat or deli counter where it’s sourced from.EXPLORE MORE32 High-Protein Vegetarian MealsHow to make rotisserie chicken part of a healthy mealFirst, Saweres recommends choosing a plain or lightly seasoned rotisserie chicken when you can. Then, remove most of the skin to cut down on saturated fat and calories.“Use the chicken as the protein base of your meal,” says Cassetty. “Fill out half your plate with colorful produce, a quarter with a whole starchy food (like roasted potatoes or quinoa) and accessorize it with healthy fats.” She says because it can be easily shredded or sliced, rotisserie chicken is particularly great for topping salads, mixing into grain bowls, adding to veggie-packed soups, incorporating in sandwich wraps or using as a taco base.The bottom lineYes, rotisserie chicken is convenient and delicious. It’s also rich in nutrients like protein and iron, and it can make eating at home easier. “You don’t have to cook everything from scratch to be healthy,” says Cassetty. “A rotisserie chicken can be part of a nutritious, balanced eating pattern, especially if you serve it with vegetables, whole starches and healthy fats.”MORE IDEASHealthier Chicken Recipes We LoveHigh-Protein Chicken RecipesGrilled Chicken RecipesMedically reviewed byValerie Agyeman, R.D.Contributing WriterValerie Agyeman (she/her) is a women's health dietitian and the host of the Flourish Heights podcast, where she produces science-driven content covering overlooked nutrition, wellness and women’s health topics.
