Then, on August 27, the company expanded the recall to include more products. Here's everything you need to know about the recall, including a full list of impacted products. Jump to:What is Burkholderia cepacia?What products are recalled?What to do if you used a contaminated product?What is Burkholderia cepacia?Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of bacteria that is often found in soil and can infect humans. Some people don’t experience any symptoms with a Bcc infection, but it can be very serious for those with weakened immune systems, especially people who have cystic fibrosis. Fever and fatigue are signs of a potential Bcc infection.In this case, the affected products are applied topically to skin so that’s where the risk of exposure is. “For healthy individuals with minor skin lesions, the use of the product may result in local infections, whereas in immunocompromised individuals the infection could spread into the blood stream, potentially leading to life-threatening sepsis,” according to a press release from the company on the Food and Drug Administration's website.Although Bcc is a type of bacteria, many strains are resistant to antibiotics. If you suspect that you may be infected, the best thing to do is reach out to your physician so they can determine the best course of treatment, which may or may not include antibiotics.What products are recalled?According to DermaRite, the 32 products listed below are included in the current recall.
