Perhaps you can go snowshoeing or ice-skating. Then, when spring arrives, you might hit a botanical garden. Knowing you can’t do these things year-round can help make them feel especially joyful.Dance the salsa.“Salsa dancing makes people happy,” says Martha Santos, Ph.D., an associate professor of Latin American history at the University of Akron. “The music is percussive and exciting, and when you combine it with rapid movements from the various Latin American dance traditions in salsa, it’s like the dance has a healing quality.” Search online for a studio near you that teaches salsa.Getty ImagesLook at the stars.Step outside on a dark, cloudless night and dare yourself not to be awed by the sky. When you’re looking up and gazing at the stars, you’ll often feel inspired and find some sort of creativity or deeper understanding. Go bowling.Bowling keeps people of all ages and skill sets in a state of hilarity. “When you’re around people you care about and enjoy, I think it’s great for your mental health,” says Chad Murphy, executive director of the United States Bowling Congress.
