Hobbies “add a much-needed sense of meaning and purpose to our lives,” and that can make you happier, says Nicholette Leanza, M.Ed, LPCC-S, a psychotherapist at LifeStance Health in Beachwood, Ohio.

Studies also show that hobbies may reduce your risk of chronic disease and cognitive decline, boost mental well-being and improve overall life satisfaction. If you’ve been thinking that having a hobby would make you happier but aren’t sure where to start, here are some leisure activities that may do the trick. 1CookingAnchiySimilar to other creative outlets, cooking can help you relax, gain a sense of purpose, put you in a good mood and help you eat better, Hester says.
