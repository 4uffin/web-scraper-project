According to a new study, midlife hearing loss could be linked to an increased incidence of late-life dementia.Over the last 15 years, numerous studies have suggested a connection between hearing loss and the development of dementia. But this study, published in Nature Aging, is different. Instead of focusing on older adults, the new study started by looking at individuals in midlife, primarily those in their 40s or 50s.“The novelty is this study provided a much longer follow-up of hearing loss than most studies we have, so we’re able to look at the outcome of dementia that far out,” says Alison R. Huang, PhD, MPH, an assistant program director of NYU Langone Health’s Optimal Aging Institute in New York City. Huang and two of her colleagues were asked by the editors of Nature Aging to offer an analysis of the study in a subsequent issue.Here’s what else the study uncovered and why it’s important to pay attention to even slight hearing loss. Age and hearing lossHearing loss is a natural and biological part of aging. In fact, age-related hearing loss, also called presbycusis, is the most common cause of impaired hearing, according to StatPearls. In most instances, age-related hearing loss affects both ears. Presbycusis typically becomes noticeable around the age of 60 and slowly progresses, eventually affecting approximately two-thirds of Americans aged 70 and older. Though not as frequent, presbycusis can occur much sooner, even as early as someone in their thirties or forties, according to the National Institutes of Health. Meanwhile, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association reports that 6.1% of people aged 18 to 44, 17.8% aged 45 to 64 years, and 31.6% aged 65 to 74 years have hearing trouble.There are various reasons behind why hearing starts to fade with age but for the most part, it’s basic wear and tear. Long-term loud noise exposure and the degradation of inner ear “hair cells,” (sensory receptors that help you hear) are two examples. Diabetes and cardiovascular disease, conditions that are more prevalent in older people, are also associated with hearing loss.What this study found The researchers at France’s Université Paris Cité used data from two UK cohort studies, the Whitehall II and the UK Biobank, to follow more than 385,000 participants between the ages of 40 and 69. Their goal was to examine the longitudinal association between hearing loss during those midlife years with incident dementia. To do so, they issued questionnaires taken at baseline and then subsequently every four to five years afterwards. One group was followed over the course of 14 years while the other was monitored for 25. In their questionnaires, subjects were asked about their hearing ability, such as if they had trouble talking to someone in a quiet room (with a hearing aid if they wore one) and whether or not they had great difficulty following a conversation if there was background noise like a TV, radio, or children. Lab hearing tests from the UK Biobank were also used as well as medical records to see which participants went on to develop dementia.At the conclusion, the subjects who reported having hearing impairment in midlife had a 12% higher risk of developing dementia in their older years. When looking at the measured hearing lab tests versus the self-reported hearing loss, the people with poorer hearing had an even higher risk (31%) of dementia. One explanation for the difference could have something to do with having people self-report their amount of hearing loss compared to actual hearing testing. “There’s a different perception of how someone perceives their own hearing rather than getting their hearing tested,” says Huang. In her team’s published paper, it’s noted that some people may underestimate their hearing ability or have a higher sensitivity to reporting hearing loss. How hearing loss affects brain functionWhile there’s no definitive explanation why hearing loss increases dementia risk, there are some possible reasons. One supposition is that when you’re hard of hearing, you need more brain power, and that can be tiring, says Huang. “With the presence of hearing loss, speech and sound is heard as garbled, so the brain has to work harder to understand them and be able to communicate,” says Huang. That extra effort can take away from other cognitive processes and contribute to changes in the brain also linked to dementia, she adds. The additional expended energy may lead to changes in the brain that affect thinking and memory abilities, according to the Alzheimer’s Society. Hearing loss can also lead a person to withdraw from social situations because it can be too difficult or stressful and may cause embarrassment. This can contribute to loneliness, feelings of isolation or depression,
anxiety, and reduced physical activity, which are all linked to an increased risk of dementia. The takeawayHuang and her colleagues believe the results represent an important step toward understanding the hearing and dementia relationship because “we’re able to identify this risk factor in midlife and deal with it accordingly,” she says. “Hearing loss is modifiable and not all risk factors for dementia are easily modifiable. But hearing loss is pretty special because we do have a treatment and an infrastructure to help people hear better.” This study shows there’s a midlife association between hearing loss and dementia so Huang says it opens up the question that if you treat hearing loss earlier, does that relate to reducing the dementia risk? “We don’t know yet for sure, but we’re seeing some evidence of this,” says Huang.Watch Next Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowReaders Also Read10 Hobbies That Are Good for Your BrainMariska Hargitay Walks 2025 Emmys Red Carpet9 Morning Habits For Better Health, Per Doctors
