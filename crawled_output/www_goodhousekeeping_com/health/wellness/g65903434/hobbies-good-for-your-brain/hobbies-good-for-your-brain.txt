Keep Your Wits About You: The Science of Brain Maintenance as You Age and founder and CEO of CerebroFit Integrated Brain Health. “Many hobbies, such as making art or playing music, challenge your mind, which strengthens the brain’s ability to adapt and build new connections.” Hobbies that involve movement, such as pickleball, gardening, or hiking, support the growth of healthy brain cells and improve connections between brain cells. Social interaction helps, too. “When hobbies involve connecting with other people, they can benefit brain health by fostering connection and purpose, which are linked to better cognitive health as we age,” says Dotson.
Hobbies also help us feel happier and reduce stress, which protects memory and cognition. Relaxing hobbies, such as knitting or listening to music, which lower stress levels or involve mindfulness, also reduce stress hormones such as cortisol, which can contribute to anxiety and cognitive decline. They increase release of brain chemicals, too, such as dopamine and serotonin that are linked to feelings of happiness and wellbeing, says Dotson. Adopting new hobbies benefits us as well. “Learning something new is stimulating and rewarding. Many studies have shown that novel, positive experiences promote the release of dopamine, which reinforces the actions involved in the positive experience,” says Margaret Rice, PhD, professor in the departments of neurosurgery and neuroscience at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. “But any activity that stimulates a given brain circuit strengthens that circuit, with repetitive actions leading to stronger synaptic connections in pathways underlying the behavior involved — even shuffling cards at the bridge table.” Strengthening synaptic connections is a key component underlying learning and memory. Research has found that hobbies can help us feel better mentally and physically over time.
In fact, a 2023 study surveyed over 93,000 older adults and found that those who had hobbies reported better health, more happiness, fewer symptoms of depression and higher life satisfaction — which are all linked to better brain health, says Dotson.
Fortunately, the benefits of hobbies occur no matter what your age. “Learning may take a little more time than when we were younger, but the brain can still learn and adapt,” says Dotson. “The brain maintains neuroplasticity, or its ability to reorganize and form new neural pathways in response to experience, throughout the lifespan.”
In fact, studies have found that healthy older adults who start a new hobby show positive changes in their brain, such as increases in the size of different brain regions and more efficient cognitive processing. But research shows that even people with cognitive impairment or dementia can benefit cognitively and emotionally from engaging in hobbies, says Dotson.
While it’s important to understand that having hobbies won’t prevent you from getting conditions such as Alzheimer’s, they can help you stay engaged and reinforce flexible thinking, says Dotson. Here are 10 research-backed hobbies you can try to support better brain health: 1Aerobic Exerciseskynesher//Getty ImagesIt’s probably no surprise that physical activity, such as brisk walking or hiking, tops the list of hobbies that are good for you. One recent review found that exercise improved cognitive function in the study participants in their 50s and older, regardless of their cognitive status. It doesn't matter what you choose: “The best exercise is the one you’ll do regularly,” says Rice.

While dancing ticks the box for aerobic exercise, it also often involves a social aspect, which is protective for brain health, says Dotson.

Research hasn’t identified why music is so good for us, but one theory is that it engages multiple neural systems of the brain. In addition, if you’re learning a new instrument, for example, you’re challenging your brain to adapt, and novelty activates neuroplasticity, says Dotson.
4GardeningKathrin Ziegler//Getty ImagesWhether you plant flowers, vegetables or herbs, gardening has been shown to be good for the brain. One study showed levels of brain nerve growth factors related to memory were significantly increased after gardening activity. Gardening also yields a sense of accomplishment, which is linked with better cognitive health, says Dotson.RELATED: 11 Old-Fashioned Hobbies to Try If You’re in Your Granny EraAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below5Arts and CraftsSusumu Yoshioka//Getty ImagesCreating something with your hands is another way to keep your brain healthy. Dotson notes that one study found that engaging in visual arts, such as coloring, doodling and free drawing, activated the medial prefrontal cortex. Participants found the activities relaxing and reporting improvements in creativity and problem-solving at the end of each art-making session.

Dotson points to a recent study that found that encounters with birdlife were associated with improvements in mental wellbeing, including in people with a diagnosis of depression. So, go ahead and feed the birds or bird watch in your own backyard to get a positive brain boost.
