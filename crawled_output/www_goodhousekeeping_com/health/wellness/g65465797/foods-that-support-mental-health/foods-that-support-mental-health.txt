By Nicole ClancyPublished: Sep 22, 2025Medically reviewed by Gillean Barkyoumb, MS, RDNfrom_my_point_of_view//Getty ImagesIt’s becoming more common for health professionals to look at the entire lifestyle of their patients when providing care, instead of simply prescribing meds. Even if you're getting evaluated for mental health concerns, they may ask about your sleep and exercise patterns, your stress level and yes, your diet too.“In general, psychological science is getting better at understanding the link between the foods we eat and the way we feel,” says Kristina Pecora, Psy.D., a licensed clinical psychologist in Chicago. “We know that food contains nutrients and certain nutrients have effects on mood.” In fact, a 2023 study found that certain nutrient deficiencies can negatively impact your brain and nervous system and are linked to symptoms of depression.If that seems far-fetched, put on your science and chemistry hat for a minute. At a basic level, the nutrients in the food you eat serve as precursors or building blocks for chemicals called neurotransmitters. When neurotransmitters are released in your body, they act as messengers to trigger other things to happen such as the movement of muscles or the feeling of emotions. For a simplified example, the neurotransmitter serotonin makes you feel energized while dopamine makes you feel alert. However, research shows that when neurotransmitters are off kilter, it can cause an array of disorders including depression, insomnia and anxiety.“What we eat has a direct impact on our brain chemistry, hormone production and gut health — all of which influence our mood and emotional well-being,” says Emily Morgan Martorano, R.D.N., CDN, LDN, the founder of EM Nutrition Group. “A diet high in ultra-processed foods and refined sugars and low in fiber can contribute to inflammation and gut dysbiosis, both of which have been linked to depressive symptoms.” A 2023 study actually found that women who eat a lot of processed food (about nine servings a day) were 50% more likely to have depression symptoms than those who ate less than half that (no more than 4 daily servings).Martorano says that eating healthy foods helps support the production of neurotransmitters, which are keys to emotional regulation. A well-balanced diet helps your brain receive the nutrients it needs to function well such as omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, magnesium, zinc, iron, potassium, vitamin D, vitamin C and vitamin E, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.Rather than consuming large amounts of specific nutrients, though, Martorano says it’s more important to focus on consistency and diversity. She recommends aiming for 3 to 4 nutrient-dense foods each day that support mental health. Below are 11 of the best foods to help reduce symptoms of depression.1SalmonSimpleImagesSalmon, and other "fatty" fish, are rich in vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids that increase levels of serotonin and dopamine. Pecora says both of these neurotransmitters help you feel good. That may happen because they target the pleasure part of the brain, according to Cleveland Clinic.RELATED: 15 Best High-Protein Fish to Eat, According to Nutritionists2Pumpkin seedsMirageCThese seeds, which can be eaten with or without the shell, are full of zinc and healthy fats.

They boast a good portion of zinc, vitamin E and healthy fat. In fact, one UK study determined that people who ate a small amount of walnuts (up to 30 grams) every day had a 17% lower risk of depression.RELATED: 9 Signs You Need to Take a Mental Health Day4BananasTetra ImagesThis everyday fruit contains vitamin C, vitamin B6, potassium and magnesium—all of which can help boost your mood. For instance, some research suggests that vitamin C deficiency may be linked to depression or cognitive impairment.

One study found that elderly people in China who ate a small number of eggs every week (up to 3 servings) had a 30% lower risk of depression symptoms compared to those who didn’t eat any eggs. Study participants who ate more than 3 eggs every week had a 38% lower risk. 6AvocadoslocknloadlabradorWith vitamin B9, omega-3 fatty acids, and magnesium (just to name a few!), avocados pack a punch of depression-fighting nutrients. In one study, people who had low magnesium levels and high levels of stress experienced significant improvements in depression and anxiety symptoms after supplementing with magnesium for just four weeks. Make your cut avos last longer by drizzling on lemon juice, cover completely in plastic wrap and place in an airtight container.RELATED: 50 Best Self-Care Ideas for Mental and Physical WellbeingAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below7YogurtozgurcoskunYogurt is loaded with B vitamins and healthy gut bacteria, both of which may signal a feel-good burst. Research from 2023 concluded that healthy gut microbiota (microorganisms that live in the body) positively impact mental health through the gut brain axis. In other words, nutrients and microbes in your gut help produce neurotransmitters that can support your mental health. Whether you opt for Greek or regular yogurt, look for a plain one with “live and active cultures” listed on the label. 8Leafy greensLecicWe’re talking about all leafy greens, but kale and spinach are two popular types that are common-place in grocery stores. They have plenty of B vitamins and magnesium, among many others nutrients. Mix up in a smoothie with your fave greens, or toss into your salad with some protein.

There’s also tryptophan in chicken, which your body uses to make serotonin. Research has found that when your body metabolizes tryptophan, the result is a decrease in symptoms of depression. Combine chicken with chickpeas or leafy-green salad for double the variety in nutrients.RELATED: 30 High-Protein Chicken Recipes10Chickpeasfcafotodigital//Getty ImagesYielding B vitamins and magnesium, chickpeas are versatile and affordable. Vitamin B6 seems to be particularly important as it “affects levels of norepinephrine, another neurotransmitter associated with mood, and can support people in treatment for depression,” according to Pecora.
