Before you buy, here are the main factors to consider to ensure you get a shed that meets your needs and lasts for years to come.✔️ Size and storage needs: If you plan to store seasonal gear, tools or a riding mower, opt for at least an 8-foot x 10-foot shed. If space is tight, a vertical or horizontal shed can still provide useful storage.✔️ Material: Plastic (Resin): Low-maintenance, resistant to rot and rust and often the easiest to assemble.Metal: Tough and secure but prone to rust if not properly treated.Wood: Classic and customizable but requires upkeep like painting or sealing. ✔️ Ease of assembly: Some sheds come with pre-cut panels and can be put together in a few hours. Others require a full DIY effort. If you're not handy, look for options with interlocking panels and clear instructions. "A premade shed makes more sense for the vast majority of homeowners, since it saves you the trouble and cost of assembly, plus you're able to spend less on the unit itself," said Good Housekeeping Institute's Home Improvement & Outdoor Director Dan DiClerico.✔️ Weather resistance: If you live in an area with heavy snow, wind or rain, prioritize sheds with reinforced walls, weatherproof seals and sloped roofs to handle the elements.✔️ Ventilation and accessibility: Ventilation prevents moisture buildup (a must for wood and metal sheds). Look for vents, windows and double doors for easy access to larger items.What foundation should I use?Timothy DahlIt's tempting to build a shed on a plot of dirt or grass, but this is not a good idea. You need a solid level base for your shed to live on that won't shift or be prone to flooding.The best choice is a concrete slab or patio. You can also place your shed on a plywood platform or level base of gravel or pavers. If you have a lot of critters in your area it's best to stick with concrete or pavers as they can dig under gravel or find empty spaces below wood foundations.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWhy trust Good Housekeeping?This roundup was written by contributing writer Timothy Dahl, an experienced product reviewer, who based his selections on his experience building sheds from the ground up as well as using many different types of sheds for his woodworking and gardening needs.
