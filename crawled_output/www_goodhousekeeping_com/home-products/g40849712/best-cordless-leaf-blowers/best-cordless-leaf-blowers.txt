To keep your yard in top shape year-round, a cordless leaf blower is essential.
Not only are many of today’s top-performing leaf blowers cordless and able to run on rechargeable batteries, but they combine power and control to effectively (and quietly) spruce things up.At the Good Housekeeping Institute, our engineers and outdoor experts test all kinds of yard tools, from lawn mowers to leaf vacuums. When selecting the best leaf blowers, we evaluate performance, ease of setup and construction quality in the Lab, then we test them in real-world conditions, including on dirty New York City sidewalks, to ensure they effectively clear leaves and debris.1Best OverallToro 60V Max 157 MPH Brushless Leaf Blower Shop at Amazon$299 at Lowe's$290 at WalmartCredit: ToroProsExcellent sweeping power Turbo mode for loosening leavesDurable designUp to 140 minutes run time ConsNoisier than a few others on the listToro is a perennial powerhouse in our leaf blower tests and the brand is at it again with the 60V Flex Force. And for under $200, it's a steal. One tester noted, “it’s a ton of power in your hand, but it’s surprisingly easy to control.”We credit the Toro’s lightweight, ergonomic design and variable-speed trigger with cruise control, which makes it easy to harness all the force coming out of the 605-CFM motor, even in turbo mode. Impressive run time of up to 140 minutes on the 60V lithium-ion battery should be sufficient for large leaf-clearing jobs (though the turbo mode does gobble up power more quickly).The brushless motor technology, which we’re seeing on more power tools, should extend the lifespan of the blower. Its 63-decibel noise level is a tick higher than the quietest battery-powered models, so noise might be the biggest reason to consider another blower.TypeBattery-powered handheld (60 volt)Maximum air flow605 CFMMaximum air speed157 mphWeight10 lbsNoise rating63 dBRun timeUp to 140 minutes2Best ValueSKIL PWR Core 40 Brushless 40V 530 CFM Leaf Blower KitNow 13% Off$159 $139 at Amazon$159 at Lowe'sCredit: SKILProsGreat priceVariable-speed controlSolid constructionConsSome users complain of short battery run timeSkil is the DIY-friendly brandmate of Skilsaw, a brand aimed at professionals. Though Skil leaf blowers are well-priced, they offer many of the same features as Skilsaw, making for a high-value, high-performance product. The PWR Core 40 is a prime example.The impressive 530 CFMs of airflow, helping make short work of heavy leaf clearing. For the price, this leaf blower is also solidly built, including its brushless motor, a design that our tests have found to be durable over time. The relatively lightweight leaf blower also boasts many user-friendly features, like the variable-speed control and fast-charging battery, though some online reviewers have noted that the battery run time is short.TypeBattery-powered handheld (40 volt)Maximum air flow530 CFMMaximum air speed140 mphWeight6.4 lbsNoise ratingNot availableRun timeNot availableAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below3Best Battery BackpackEcho eForce DPB-5800T$700 at Amazon$780 $700 at Walmart$700 at Home DepotCredit: EchoProsEasy-to-use controlsBackpack design with chest strapFeatures triple battery port ConsRun time could be longerThis leaf blower was put through its paces by one of our expert testers, Vinny Brodo, a professional landscaper based in New Jersey. Though Brodo is not ready to give up the power and run time of the gas blowers he uses when making the rounds for work, he likes a battery-powered option for home use. “For someone who might be intimidated by a gas-powered backpack blower, this Echo is a great option,” he said, highlighting its simple setup and easy-to-master controls.At the GH Institute, our pros are impressed by its exceptional blowing power, with 195 MPH speed and 795 CFM airflow that will sweep up any foilage left on the ground. On the downside, all that power takes up a lot of battery, hence the less-than-stellar run time of 50 minutes. We do like, however, that the blower features a triple battery port so you can adjust your power needs depending on the size of your yard.The chest strap helps to keep the backpack secure and comfortable during use.

When testing the tool, its performance was excellent in our assessments, the only downside being that the system is pricey.While multi-use tools are newcomers to the product tool category, they're still a great choice for some homeowners, including those who are short on storage space and want to tackle a variety of yard work in one go.

Its variable-speed trigger made it easy to switch from low-speed sweeping to turbo-boosted loosening of stuck-on debris.The cruise control setting is helpful when you’re in the zone, methodically clearing leaves from the middle of the yard. As with many Ryobi tools, a second battery is included, along with a rapid charger that our tests confirmed needs just 40 minutes for a full charge. One thing to keep in mind is that the turbo mode uses up a lot of battery power, significantly reducing the run time.TypeBattery-powered handheld (40 volt)Maximum air flow730 CFMMaximum air speed190 mphWeight9.4 lbsNoise rating57 dBRun timeNot available6QuietestStihl BGA 60 Cordless Leaf Blower with Battery and ChargerNow 17% Off$300 $250 at acmetools.comCredit: StihlProsExcellent sweeping and loosening power Durable construction and design ConsRelatively short battery run timeStihl bills the BGA 60 as its "most powerful battery-powered blower." After several weeks of field tests witnessing its excellent sweeping and loosening power, we're inclined to agree. "The blower almost jumps out of your hand when you kick it into boost mode," one tester noted, referring to the maximum-power setting of the variable-speed motor. The Stihl combines
impressive oomph with an incredibly lightweight design and quiet operation — at 7.8 pounds, it's the lightest of all top picks and its 56 decibels is the lowest noise rating. We also like its durability, including the brushless motor and the metal ring on the blower nozzle, a unique feature that should protect against wear and tear over years of service. The one trade-off is a relatively short run time of its battery pack — about 16 minutes at normal speed and 13 minutes in boost mode. So it's best suited to small- to mid-sized yards, say, one acre or less.TypeBattery-powered handheld (36 volt)Maximum air flow459 CFMMaximum air speed154 mph Weight7.9 lbs Noise rating56 dBRun timeAbout 16 minutes at normal speed,13 minutes in boost modeAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below7Best GasHusqvarna 125B Gas Leaf Blower$179 at Lowe'sCredit:

blower from Husqvarna can move a lot of air in a hurry — 470 cubic feet per minute at a speed of 170 miles per hour to be exact. That translates into serious sweeping power. The lightweight construction and ergonomic design maximize comfort and control, while the cruise control setting is nice if you have a lot of leaves to clear and don't need to switch speeds. The clear gas tank is helpful for determining when it's time to refuel. Just be prepared for noisier operation than an electric model — ear protection is a must.

It’s a rugged, powerful blower with a 1,100 CFM engine that can really make leaves fly. Our testers liked the vented back pad that provides cooling comfort during long runs or warm days. The 79.9 cc two-stroke engine is definitely pro-grade, but that means a little more care and maintenance on your part, including mixing in the right amount of oil and adding a fuel stabilizer at the end of the season. But the gas tank is clear, which makes keeping tabs on fuel levels easier. Just take note that the Echo is also the noisiest pick on our list, so be sure to use ear protection when using. Also double check that your municipality doesn't have noise limits on outdoor power equipment, since the Echo is likely to exceed them.

They tend to be pricey, but this gas-powered Champion is quite affordable while delivering all the oomph — up to 1300 CFM — you’ll need to clear thick blankets of leaves all season long. Like all walk-behind blowers, the 97-pound push machine is a lot to move, but the beefy 12-inch rear wheels help maneuver over all kinds of terrain. The Champion also has many ergonomic features our experts look for, like a soft grip and adjustable-height handle that minimize hand and arm fatigue. Keep in mind that you’ll need more storage space for the wheeled unit, which measures three feet wide and nearly as deep. It's also quite noisy, so ear protection is essential, and the machine might be in violation of local noise ordinances.TypeGas-powered walk-behind blowerMaximum air flow 1,300 CFMMaximum air speed 160 mphWeight97 lbsNoise rating77 dBRun timeNot availableHow we test cordless leaf blowers Philip FriedmanOur product experts keep up with the marketplace to identify top-selling leaf blowers that you’re most likely to find at stores and online. We attend trade shows and industry events like Equip Exposition to stay on top of the latest in lawn and yard care. When choosing specific models for testing, we focus on brands that have performed the best and proved the most reliable through years of testing at the Good Housekeeping Institute. We also consider newer brands with unique features or innovations.Hands-on testing starts in our Lab where we assess ease of assembly, quality of construction, battery life, convenience features, noise and more. Our product experts also take leaf blowers home to evaluate them in the real-world conditions of their yards. In the field, we clear leaves, grass clippings and more, assessing each blower's ability to sweep away loose debris and remove embedded particles from the lawn. We also evaluate ease of use, for example, noting how quickly hand fatigue sets in, based on the weight of the machine and the comfort of the handle. And we note how noisy the machines are in actual neighborhood settings.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowPhilip FriedmanOur performance tests, pictured here, focus on how quickly and thoroughly models removed leaves and debris (and vacuumed and mulched, when applicable). We also evaluate usability — for example, the intuitiveness of the controls and the run-time of battery-powered blowers. The best cordless leaf blowers are equally adept at sweeping loose leaves and removing embedded debris from grass or other groundcover.What to look for when choosing the best cordless leaf blower ✔️ Type: The first and most critical choice is deciding between a gas- or battery-powered model. Here are the key pros and cons.Gas-powered engines tend to be more powerful but are also louder (so much so that some communities prohibit their use) and are often more difficult to start. Most have two-stroke engines, which require mixing fuel and oil. Backpack and walk-behind cordless blowers almost always run on gas. A full tank of gas on a typical gas blower might give you anywhere from 45 to 60 minutes of run time. Of course, as long as you have fuel on hand, you can keep topping off the tank to run the blower indefinitely. Whereas with a battery-powered blower, once it’s out of juice, you’ll need to stop to recharge the battery, which might take anywhere from 1 to 3 hours.
Battery-powered engines use a rechargeable battery that usually provides about 30 minutes of run time. They used to be less powerful than gas models, but they've become much better as of late. Very little maintenance is required, making them a very popular option. ✔️ Variable-speed control: This feature lets you adjust the blower power, from higher speed when clearing open areas to lower speed when you're close to the house or foundation plants. Cruise control is also nice since it allows you to take your hand off the trigger.✔️ Multi-purpose use: Some leaf blowers can also vacuum leaves and mulch them to bits. Consider the ease of converting between different modes. Some blowers convert with the flick of a switch, while others use different tubes or nozzles that you have to attach and detach in order to convert. For more information on multi-purpose leaf blowers, check out our guide to best leaf vacuums. ✔️ Ergonomic grip: Softer grips minimize hand fatigue. Models with a second grip towards the nozzle tend to offer better handling. Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowHow is leaf blower power measured?There are a few factors involved. If the equipment has vacuum and/or mulching modes, you'll also want to pay attention to its claimed capacity.✔️ Blowing power: The power of a leaf blower is determined by how much air it is able to blow out, which is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM), and how quickly it does so, which is measured in miles per hour (mph). The ideal combination of the two measurements depends on the nature of the blowing work. For example, if your yard is filled with large, dry leaves, high air flow (500 CFM and up) will give you excellent sweeping power. If you live in a wet region with small, sticky leaves, high air speed (150 mph or more) will deliver superior loosening power.
✔️ Vacuuming power: This applies to leaf blowers that also have a vacuum mode, good for sucking up small piles of leaves and debris from under bushes and around foundation walls. Like blowing power, vacuuming power is determined by a combination of airflow (CFM) and speed (mph). The power of a blower is measured by how much air a blower is able to take in and how fast it does so. Multi-purpose leaf blowers often have similar vacuuming and blowing power, but it's important to know both when purchasing a convertible machine. ✔️ Mulcher reduction ratio: Some blowers also have a mulching mode and bag attachment for collecting smaller volumes of leaves. The mulcher reduction ratio is the ratio between the number of bags of leaves that the vacuum encountered and the number of bags that the leaves were reduced to through mulching. Most mulchers have a reduction ratio of either 10:1 or 16:1.Why trust Good Housekeeping? Dan DiClerico has tested and written about leaf blowers for the better part of two decades.
