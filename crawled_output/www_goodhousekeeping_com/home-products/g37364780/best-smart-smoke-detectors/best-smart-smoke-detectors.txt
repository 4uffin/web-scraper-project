Nest Protect Smoke and Carbon Monoxide AlarmRead moreBest ValueKidde Smoke & Carbon Monoxide DetectorRead moreBest Integration With Ring Security SystemFIRST ALERT Z-Wave Smoke Detector & Carbon Monoxide AlarmRead moreThe best smoke alarms on the market just got even better, thanks to a new industry standard that took effect on June 30, 2024. Known as the UL 217 8th Edition Smoke Alarm Update, the rule is designed to reduce the risk of nuisance alarms and make the devices better equipped at detecting smoke from synthetic materials. “We know that all too often, nuisance alarms from things like burnt toast can lead to inoperable smoke alarms when consumers take out the batteries,” said Dan DiClerico, director of Home Improvement and Outdoor at the Good Housekeeping Institute. “This new standard will reduce the risk of that and other safety hazard inside homes.” In pulling together this list of top-rated smart smoke alarms, our experts only considered models that meet the latest standard, in addition to our own safety and performance standards. It's the same rigor we apply to all essential home safety equipment, including fire extinguishers and gas leak detectors. Based on our latest review, the following smart smoke detectors make the cut by being industry-certified, easy to install and boasting simple-to-use apps.1﻿Best OverallGoogle
Nest Protect Smoke and Carbon Monoxide AlarmShop at Amazon$119 at Wayfair$149 at Lowe'sCredit: GoogleProsWireless interconnectivity sends alerts to other Nest Protects in the houseEarly warning voice alertLocation-based alertsConsCannot be set up in Google Home app The Google Nest Protect has been the top pick with our experts through multiple product generations. The latest model, available in both hardwired and battery-powered options, not only detects smoke and fire but also carbon monoxide. When our Lab experts tested the device, one of the main things that sets it apart from other smoke detectors is the early warning voice alert. Instead of beeping when it detects smoke, a human voice will tell you where the incident is taking place in the house.We also like that the detector is wirelessly interconnected and sends an alert to other Nest Protect units in the house, so you can get a warning if you are in a different room if it has a Nest Protect unit. Alerts come from the ceiling and the Nest smartphone app, which means that you and multiple users can be alerted whether you're home or not. (One drawback: Nest Protect can't be set up on the Google Home app, so you'll need to have both apps on your phone if you have other Google devices in the home, like cameras and thermostats.)The app will also tell you when the battery needs to be changed ahead of time, instead of chirping like other devices. One final safety feature that our experts noted is the integrated pathway light, which illuminates at night to help you find your way in the dark.RELATED: The Best Smart Home Devices of 20242Best ValueKidde Smoke & Carbon Monoxide DetectorShop at Amazon$45 $39 at Walmart$25 at Home DepotCredit: KiddeProsVoice alerts instead of loud beepingAlso detects carbon monoxideConsWill need to replace batteriesThrough years of testing fire safety equipment, our experts have come to recognize Kidde as a solid manufacturer with very competitive prices. It's also one of the most widely available brands within the category.This device costs significantly less than our best overall pick, but it still does the job detecting smoke, fire and carbon monoxide. Rather than beeping loudly, it will give clear voice alerts, such as "Fire, fire," or "Warning, carbon monoxide." It runs on two AA batteries, so you'll never need to worry about the smoke detector failing in the event of a power outage, though, of course, you will need to remember to change the batteries.In addition to our expert recommendation, the Kidde Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Detector has over 34,000 reviews and a 4.6 star rating on Amazon, with many reviewers who said that it's easy to install and works particularly well to detect carbon monoxide.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below3Best Integration With Ring Security SystemFIRST ALERT Z-Wave Smoke Detector & Carbon Monoxide AlarmShop at Amazon$57 at Wayfair$46 at WalmartCredit: First AlertProsSeamlessly integrates with RingLoud 85-decibel alarmRuns on batteries so no need to hardwireConsWill need to replace batteriesThis smart smoke detector is our top pick for homeowners who already own a Ring security system, since integration in our Lab tests was seamless. Once the detector is synced up, you'll receive real-time notifications in the Ring app when smoke or carbon monoxide is detected. It also has an 85-decibel alarm so you'll be sure to hear it. The smart smoke detector runs on two AA batteries that you'll need to remember to replace, but the unit does not need to be hardwired.The unit has over 10,000 reviews on Amazon and a 4.5 star rating, with many users who said how easy it was to set up with Ring, often taking less than a minute. It's also compatible with SmartThings and Nexxia Home Intelligence when connected to a Z-Wave Plus gateway hub (sold separately).RELATED: Best Doorbell Cameras for a Safer Home4Best SetX-Sense Smart Smoke Detector with Base StationNow 30% Off$100 $70 at AmazonCredit: X-Sense ProsExcellent valueOptional monitoring planConsNot compatible with other smart home ecosystemsThe X-Sense Fire Safety System offers excellent value for shoppers looking for a full-home protection system, such as new homeowners who want to install new smoke alarms throughout their house.This low-priced system comes with three interconnected smoke detectors, plus a base station that allows them to communicate with each other. There's also an optional subscription plan ($50 per year) that provides 24/7 professional monitoring and even dispatches the local fire department in the event of an emergency. The devices boast a 4.5 star rating on Amazon, with a number of reviewers noting their ease of installation and citing the user-friendly app. One reviewer, who said he was a firefighter, said he’d recommend them to anyone in his family. The downside: The X-sense system is not compatible with other smart home integrations, such as Google Home or Apple HomeKit.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAnother smoke detector we testedWe also tested the FIRST ALERT OneLink Safe and Sound Smoke and Carbon Monoxide Detector, which has been discontinued, though you might still come across it online. The device is Alexa-enabled, which means on top of being a smoke and carbon monoxide detector, you can ask it to play music or podcasts. You can also use the Alexa feature as an intercom to have two-way conversations with other Alexa devices in another room. It also works with Apple HomeKit, so it can be controlled with Siri as well. In our extensive home tests, the smoke detector was easy to install (though it's hardwired, the unit comes with adapters so there's no need for re-wiring). Setting up the app was also fairly intuitive, though we did find that alerts weren't always received, something to consider if remote monitoring is a top priority with your smart smoke detector.How we test smart smoke detectors Products experts and market analysts at the Good Housekeeping Institute continuously survey the marketplace to identify the models that consumers nationwide are most likely to find in stores and online. For this report, we focused on brands that have performed the best and proved most reliable through the last decade of fire safety equipment tests. We also made sure that all smoke detectors included in the review meet industry standards, including rigorous safety tests set by UL Solutions.Hands-on testing starts in the Home Improvement and Outdoor Lab at the Good Housekeeping Institute, where our engineers do a thorough spec review to make sure the smoke detectors will perform as promised. They also evaluate ease of assembly and setup, including the design and usability of companion apps, when applicable. We also send smoke detectors to the homes of expert testers, who conduct installation and usability tests over several months in real-world conditions.

Some smoke detectors work across multiple ecosystems, including Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa and Samsung SmartThings.✔️ Hardwired vs. battery-powered: Some smart smoke detectors are designed to be hardwired into your home or are meant to replace existing smoke detectors that are hardwired. This means they will receive power from your home, and you won’t have to worry about the battery running out (the best options also have a battery backup in the event of a power outage). Other smoke detectors run on batteries alone which will eventually need to be replaced, but these are also easier to place where you need them and there's no need to worry if the power goes out.What are the benefits of a smart smoke alarm?Smart smoke alarms aren’t a necessity, but they provide a number of attractive features. Most notably, they send alerts to your phone if they detect smoke — even when you’re not home. They’re also easier to silence during a false alarm since you can control them from an app, rather than needing to hoist a broom or climb a ladder to turn off the device. Some devices also respond to voice commands, integrate with other smart devices in your home and provide room-specific alerts if you install multiple devices.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowHow often should I change the batteries on my smart smoke alarm?Guidelines can vary by manufacturer. However, the NFPA recommends changing the batteries in your smoke detectors at least once a year unless the smoke alarm runs on non-replaceable 10-year batteries. Tip: Test your smoke detectors every six months to make sure the battery is working.Where should I place my smart smoke alarms?You should have a working smoke detector on every floor and in every bedroom of your home. In terms of placement, if you mount an alarm on the ceiling, put it 4 inches from the wall, the Texas Department of Insurance suggests. If you want to install one on a wall, position it 4 to 12 inches from the ceiling.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWhat other steps can I take to protect my home from fires?In addition to installing working smoke detectors throughout your home:Make sure you also have a top-rated fire extinguisher on every floor.Never use a stove or an oven to heat your home. Clear roofs and gutters of dead leaves and debris that could catch on fire from embers. Keep all flammables — such as paper, clothing, bedding and drapes — at least 3 feet from a space heater, stove or fireplace.Never leave your kitchen while you’re frying, grilling, boiling or broiling food.Always turn off portable heaters before leaving the room.Why trust Good Housekeeping?For over 120 years, the Good Housekeeping Institute has provided expert tips and product reviews on all things safety-related for your home, including fire protection equipment.
