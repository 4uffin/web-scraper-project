I know I'm not alone in that quest! Luckily for all of us volume seekers, there’s a wide range of products designed to thicken, plump and create the appearance of full, lush hair. These hair-thickening products work in various ways: “Some, like serums, contain active ingredients that thicken each strand’s diameter for a fuller look and feel,” explains Craig Ziering, D.O., F.A.A.D, a dermatologist and hair transplant surgeon.That said, the only FDA-approved over-the-counter ingredient for hair loss treatment is minoxidil, says Danusia Wnek, a senior chemist in the Good Housekeeping Institute. “Minoxidil is known to slow down hair loss and stimulate hair growth, but we still don't have a lot of data on exactly how it works,” she notes. Other products, like volumizing sprays and mousses, coat hair to create thickness and stiffness, while dry shampoos use powders to increase volume through friction.To help you navigate the options, the GH Institute Beauty Lab has evaluated over 400 formulas, analyzing performance on human hair swatches and gathering feedback from consumer testers on ease of use, results and satisfaction. Along with our top picks below, you can also boost volume with volumizing shampoos and conditioners as well as styling products like sprays and mousses that temporarily bulk up strands.While you can achieve the look of thicker, fuller hair with styling products, consult a doctor for a health assessment if you have new or increased hair loss.

Good HousekeepingIn addition to Lab data, label-masked products (above) were distributed to consumer testers to use and evaluate at home in order to provide feedback on ease of use, performance and overall satisfaction. GH Beauty Lab scientists tallied over 26,267 consumer data points to round up the best hair thickening products on the market.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowTRI PrincetonFor the microscopic measurement needed, products were sent out to a third party lab for testing. TRI Princeton in Princeton, New Jersey, used their laser micrometer to measure diameter changes on hair strands before and after treatment.What to look for when shopping"The rule of thumb here is to use products that are gentle on the hair but pack a big punch," says Dr. Ziering. Look for the following: ✔️ The right ingredients.
Look for products with biotin, collagen, amino acids, peptides and niacinamide. "These ingredients are key for overall hair health to keep the individual hair follicles strong and thick," Dr. Ziering says. Celebrity hairstylist and curl expert Sophie Rose Gutterman is also a fan of biotin and recommends castor oil and aloe vera as well as they "work great for general hair health."✔️ The right formulation. There are many types of hair thickening products that provide different benefits; choose the right match for your needs or layer them in your routine as desired:Leave-in products (like serums, mousses, creams and gels) are generally applied to damp hair and can provide the biggest fullness boost, according to Wnek. "They coat hair to make it feel thicker and give it grip to help you manipulate strands into a voluminous look," she says.Rinse-off products like shampoos and conditioners "have fewer conditioning ingredients so they won't weigh hair down," Wnek explains. "They can set a good foundation for fullness but are not a replacement for styling products."Finishing products like texturizing sprays and dry shampoos are another option to use solo or complement leave-in and rinse-off products, as they "usually contain powders like starches to increase the friction between strands and absorb oil, which creates volume," Wnek says.Dori PriceContributing Beauty EditorDori Price is a New York City-based freelance writer and editor and beauty, style and wellness expert who was the Beauty & Fashion Director at Family Circle for 13 years before she joined Good Housekeeping, Prevention and Woman’s Day as a freelance beauty editor.
