Gray hair tends to be coarser and needs a little extra TLC to keep it shiny and healthy. "Gray hair typically has a yellow hue to it, so adding a cool color (like purple) can make it look whiter and brighter," explains
Michael Dueñas, celebrity hair stylist and founder of Veluer Creative. He advises using a shampoo with a violet or purple tint to keep gray hair color vibrant and fresh. "It doesn't need to be a daily wash, but using it once a week will cut brassiness and give you spectacular shine." "Avoid using any shampoos that add warmth to gray hair, as cool-toned shampoos will help hair better reflect light," he adds. Since gray hair tends to be drier and prone to frizz, Dueñas also recommends steering clear of harsh shampoos, as "it's important to leave as much moisture in the hair as possible."

Coming from a brand known for its transformative hair treatments, this one is sulfate-free and gentle on gray hair as it removes yellow and brassy tones. "While the deep purple color is intimidating, it rinses out well and doesn’t stain the tub," she adds.
"My hair was soft to the touch after blow-drying, which is a nice change considering that my hair tends to get coarse if I don't condition it enough."

Celeb Luxury's shampoo comes in a variety of color options to match your desired hue.

In the Lab, instruments like the Instron machine are used to measure conditioning properties and factors like hair color enhancement and fade resistance are gauged. Products are also label-masked and distributed to testers around the country, who use them in their routines and evaluate them on factors like ease of use, scent, texture, and effects on the look and feel of hair.

This will help counteract any brassiness (unwanted orange undertones), common from hard water or product deposits, and keep your hair color vibrant. "Going back to the color wheel, purple neutralizes yellow and orange," she explains.✔️ If you prefer non-tinted formulas, "seek out shampoos labeled specifically for gray or silver hair, which can be made with other types of ingredients like pigments that enhance your natural hair shade and shine," suggests Du.✔️ "Pick a formula with claims like “smoothing” or “hydrating” to restore slip to gray hair, which may feel drier," adds GH Beauty Lab Reviews Analyst Chiara Butler.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowHow do you make gray hair soft and shiny?"It is all about adding moisture," Dueñas notes. You want to use a shampoo and a conditioner that imparts rich hydration to prevent hair from becoming dull and straw-like.
He advises using a smoothing shampoo and conditioner, along with a deep conditioning treatment once a week to "transform your gray from frizzy and dry to shiny and bouncy."How often should you use purple shampoo on gray hair?"The Lab recommends starting with once a week to maintain the brightness of gray hair without over-toning," says Wizemann.
"If the gray is particularly prone to yellowing, you can use it more frequently, such as every other wash." If your hair starts to take on a purple tint or becomes too ashy,
she suggests reducing the usage to every other week.Celebrity colorist Christopher Naselli agrees with Wizemann with once weekly usage as the baseline for most people. "Gray hair, like blonde or light-colored hair, can become yellow or brassy and the frequency of using purple shampoo on gray hair can vary based on individual hair type, condition, and desired outcome," he says. "It’s important to monitor your hair’s response and adjust usage from there." He suggests alternating between purple shampoo and a regular, moisturizing shampoo to prevent overuse and keep hair hydrated.

"Purple shampoo is generally better for gray hair than blue shampoo, but both can be used depending on your hair's undertones," says Naselli. "Purple shampoo can help cancel out brassy yellow tones that can appear in gray hair, while blue shampoo can help gray hair shine and eliminate brassy tones." One of his favorite purple collections is AGEbeautiful Ultra Bond Care Purple Shampoo and Conditioner, as "it's a great duo to neutralize any unwanted brassy tones while keeping your gray shiny and healthy."Does gray hair need a different shampoo?"It’s not a necessity, but special formulations can address the issues that are unique to gray hair," says Butler. "Purple or blue shampoos can counteract unwanted yellow tones that gray hair is prone to show. Hair may also feel coarser as it turns gray, so it can be helpful to have a more conditioning formula to smooth and make hair feel more manageable."Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWhy trust Good Housekeeping?GH Contributing Beauty Editor Dori Price originally wrote and updated this article with new picks and information about the shampoos.
