I can write about it but am not always great at practicing what I preach. One thing I've learned: the actual hair dryer you use makes a huge difference. Lucky for me and now all of you, we get to reap the benefits of the Good Housekeeping Institute Beauty Lab and all of our scientists' in-depth testing and knowledge of the category for years. They, along with our hairstylist pros, agree: choosing the right tool is essential for any heat styling needs. "The best hair dryers offer faster drying times, reduce frizz and [promote] better hair health," says Cynthia Alvarez, a celebrity hairstylist in Los Angeles and New York. For optimal results, "you need maximum power with the best airflow, all in a lightweight design," adds Michelle Cleveland, owner of Hair Addict Salon in Toms River, New Jersey.Over their long history testing hair dryers, GH Beauty Lab scientists have found that all models are definitely not created equal. There have been some epic fails, including one tool that caught on fire and others whose parts have fallen off! To find the best hair dryers on the market, Beauty Lab experts rigorously test them in the Lab for performance on human hair samples and technical attributes, plus distribute them to consumer testers, who evaluate them at home for ease of use and effects on hair.✔️ Hair dryers tested: 41✔️ Hands-on testing hours: 320✔️ Duration of testing period: 8 weeks✔️ Airflow and air temperature experiments: 24 ✔️ Surface temperature measurements: 2,196In total, GH Beauty Lab scientists tallied 2,244 Lab measurements and tester responses to determine the best hair dryers for all hair types, from fine to frizzy, thick and curly, including affordable budget buys and models with
hair diffusers included.Best OverallDyson Supersonic Hair DryerRead moreBest ValueInStyler Turbo Max Ionic Hair DryerRead moreBest for TravelShark Beauty SpeedStyle High-Velocity DryerRead more1Best OverallDyson Supersonic Hair Dryer$520 at AmazonCredit: DysonProsFastest drying time in Lab testsFive magnetic attachments includedStrong airflowLong cordConsExpensiveHeavy compared to other hair dryers With a powerful motor in its handle, Dyson's innovative dryer has proven to be a game-changer that's worth the splurge. It dried hair faster than any model in the history of GH Beauty Lab hair dryer testing. The dryer comes with five magnetic attachments to suit different hair types, including two concentrators, a diffuser, a flyaway smoother and a gentle air attachment.The tool is also a favorite among professional hairstylists. "It's pricey but worth it," Alvarez said. "The technology is so advanced, the cord is so long and its three heat and airflow settings make it so efficient. It dries hair quickly, and the smoothing attachment gets rid of frizz without needing a styling product, making blowouts last longer."LAB TEST RESULTS: The model dried an eight-inch hair sample in just 54 seconds and delivered strong airflow in Lab assessments. Lab experts also like that it has a long cord, helping you reach distant outlets or mirrors and avoiding awkward positioning while styling. A few drawbacks: It is on the heavier side, lacks a cord tie and has buttons that can be tricky to reach. WHAT TESTERS SAY: Consumer testers with various hair types (straight to curly) and lengths (short to very long) told us they loved this dryer. One tester said, "On the most humid days, it smoothed my hair faster than any dryer I've used." Another added, "The air pressure was great, and it dried my hair faster than usual."READ OUR FULL REVIEW: Dyson Supersonic Hair DryerWattage1,600Attachments2 concentrators, diffuser, flyaway attachment, gentle air attachmentNumber of Settings3 speed; 4 heatWeight1.9 lbs.Cool shot buttonYesIon technologyYes2Best ValueInStyler Turbo Max Ionic Hair DryerNow 20% Off$100 $80 at instyler.comCredit: InStylerProsStrong airflowDries hair quicklyLightweightEasy to useConsNoisy in sound testing InStyler's ionic hair dryer, featuring a customizable heat dial, stands out for its lightweight design, comfortable grip and easy-to-use buttons at an under $100 pricepoint.

In the most recent test, our scientists evaluated 41 hair dryers over eight weeks (that's 320 hours of hands-on testing!), analyzing 2,244 data points to identify the top-performing models. Hair dryers are tested as follows:✔️ In the Lab: GH Beauty Lab experts test hair dryers at various price points and power levels (1,500 to 2,000 watts) in the Lab, measuring drying speed on standardized human hair samples, airflow force, air temperature, weight, surface temperature and cord length. ✔️ On consumer testers: Consumer testers with a range of hair types (thin, medium, thick) and textures (straight, wavy, curly, coily) assess them at home for ease of use, scalp and hair damage, and appearance of hair after drying. ✔️ For noise emission: Noise emission is also measured by third-party certifier Quiet Mark, which issues a star rating (1 star for Poor/Loud, 2 stars for Average, 3 stars for Good/Quiet) based on sound level tests.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWhat to look for when shopping for a hair dryer✔️ WattageA hair dryer's wattage determines its power.1,875 watts is the most common hair dryer wattage.The GH Beauty Lab recommends a range between 1,500 and 2,000 watts for best results on all hair types.✔️ AttachmentsAttachments can significantly improve different hair textures by altering the air flow.Diffusers and concentrators are the most common attachments, and may be included with your dryer or sold separately. Diffusers are ideal for curly hair as they reduce frizz, define curls and add volume by gently circulating air to the hair ends.Concentrators focus the hair dryer's airflow for smooth, sleek styles. Broad, extended nozzles dry thick, long hair faster, while short, narrow ones help tame curly or frizzy hair for a sleek blowout.✔️ Heat & Speed SettingsAdjustable settings let you customize the level of heat and power to suit your hair type and preferences.Our top-tested hair dryers all have a cool-shot button to close the cuticle, lock in the style and prevent frizz after drying.✔️ Weight & DesignIn testing, we take each model's weight into account, since a too-heavy hair dryer can affect ease of use.Our scientists also measure the length of its cord, since a longer hair dryer cord offers more flexibility.We assess noise level, because a loud dryer can be uncomfortable to use, especially for extended periods ✔️ Safety CertificationCheck for safety verification emblems like ETL (Electrical Testing Laboratories), UL (Underwriters' Laboratories) or TUV or SUD (both part of the Technical Inspection Association) on the packaging. These certifications ensure the dryer was tested for safety and met requirements.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowIs a ceramic or ionic hair dryer better? Ionic technology offers visible benefits and is ideal for curly hair prone to frizz and flyaways, says Wizemann, noting that it reduces static and leaves hair smoother. "In testing, it is easy to see effects when you have ionized technology switched on and off," she explains. "Static builds up when you blast air without an ionizer, and with it, the hair is more aligned and appears shinier." On the other hand, many hair dryers advertise technologies like ceramic, tourmaline or far-infrared radiation, but our testing has found these aren't essential. While research exists, there's little data on their specific benefits in hair dryer design. What's the best hair dryer for my hair type?When choosing the best hair dryer for your hair type, focus on finding one with customizable settings. Here are general guidelines for different hair types:✔️ Curly hair (3a to 4c types): Opt for an ionic dryer with attachments. "A diffuser is essential for embracing natural texture, and a narrow nozzle helps smooth the hair," Wizemann says.✔️ Thin hair: Look for a dryer with low heat settings to prevent damage. "High heat is unnecessary unless specific styling requires it," she advises.✔️ Thick or long hair: Choose a dryer with higher wattage for stronger airflow and heat. "This is ideal for styling thick, dense or long hair," Wizemann says.✔️ Hair extensions: Standard hair dryers work well for both synthetic and real extensions, Cleveland notes.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWhich hair dryer is least damaging?Minimizing hair damage is actually more about the dryer's features and how you use it. "Using the correct heat settings for your hair type is more important than the dryer's technology," Wizemann says. Generally, lower heat generally causes less damage, but since all hot tools can damage hair, it's essential to protect strands. "Always prep hair with a leave-in styling product that provides heat protection before blow-drying," to form a protective barrier against heat, Alvarez advises.What is the best way to blow dry hair?Here are celebrity hairstylist and Kerasilk Brand Ambassador Harry Josh's tips for a bouncy DIY blowout:Apply product: Work your leave-in styling product through damp hair from roots to ends, then comb for even distribution.Section and start: Divide hair into four parts and dry one at a time. Use the dryer's nozzle to focus airflow while lifting strands with your fingers for volume at the roots.Use a brush: Wrap a 1-inch section around the brush and run the nozzle down the hair shaft as you pull the hair taut. Repeat until each section is fully dry.April FranzinoSenior Beauty & Style DirectorApril (she/her) is the senior beauty and style director at Good Housekeeping, Prevention and Woman's Day.
