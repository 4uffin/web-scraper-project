"Over the past decade or so, there have been advancements in hair color use experience including low-odor, ammonia-free and no-drip formulas, customization to help achieve your ideal color, inclusion of post-treatment haircare to extend color life and improve hair quality, and shade expansion into more vivid and pastel colors," explains GH Beauty Lab Senior Chemist Danusia Wnek. The next generation of at-home hair color products are easier to use and deliver better results than ever, offering a speedy, less expensive way to update your look without the cost and time commitment of a trip to the salon. To identify the best brands on the market, Good Housekeeping Institute Beauty, Health & Sustainability Lab scientists tested at-home hair color kits in the Lab for color vibrancy and gray coverage, using state-of-the-art technical instruments to measure shade fading when hair was repeatedly exposed to washing and UV light. They were also evaluated on consumer testers to gauge ease of use, product attributes, and results, including the look and feel of hair after application. Here's what went into the most recent at-home hair color test, conducted by Wnek and GH Beauty Lab Reviews Analyst Chiara Butler:✔️ Consumer testers: 136✔️ Human hair samples: 160✔️ Hands-on Lab testing duration: 400 hours✔️ Time hair samples exposed to UVA light: 800 hours✔️ Tester survey responses collected: 2,712Find the best fit for you among the GH Beauty Lab's top-tested at-home hair color products, including permanent, semi-, and demi-permanent and temporary dyes for all shades from dark black to brown, blonde, red, and beyond.

It provided the richest, most uniform, and true color, and users found that it lasted longer than all others tested. The formula left hair feeling the softest after application and was the least messy dye and the overall tester favorite. An impressive 100% of testers agreed that it gave rich and even color results. The kit also ranked best for ease of preparation; not being messy; producing a shade that matched the color on the box and lasted; and leaving hair feeling nourished. “The best hair color I have ever used, including professional,” a user raved. Several testers said that it left their hair shiny. A caveat: The shade range is not as extensive as that of other brands and select shades are currently out of stock.FormulaPermanentNumber of shades21IncludesAmmonia-free permanent hair color, developer, gloves, color-protecting hair mask2Best ValueRevlon ColorSilk with Bond Repair Complex Permanent Hair Dye$5 at WalmartCredit: RevlonProsEasy to useMild scentLeaves hair silky and shinyConsNot as strong gray coverageRevlon’s ammonia-free boxed hair color came out near its pricier competition in terms of performance in GH Beauty Lab testing. Despite its low cost, it earned the highest scores in numerous categories. Testers gave this drugstore dye top marks for having clear instructions, being simple to prepare and rinse out, having a minimal aroma, and making hair appear smooth and shiny. Take note, though, that it wasn’t the best at covering grays compared to other formulas and some users needed more than one box to cover their hair. Several users commented on how effortless it was to apply and the “beautiful color” it produced (true to its name). “It made my hair soft, shiny, and nourished,” one marveled.FormulaPermanentNumber of shades41IncludesAmmonia-free permanent hair color, developer, gloves, conditionerAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below3Best for RedheadsVidal Sassoon Pro Series Permanent Hair Color$9 at WalgreensCredit: Vidal SassoonProsStrong fade resistance and gray coverage in Lab testsEasy and non-messy to applyTrue color resultsConsMay not be as widely availableWnek recommends this Vidal Sassoon kit, a top performer in past GH Beauty Lab hair color testing, for redheads because of its strong fade resistance (a big issue for dyed red hair), color options, and the resulting hue closely matching the shade on the packaging. In Lab tests, the dye scored high for covering gray well and retaining color over time. Consumers gave it top points for not being messy to apply, having the right consistency, rinsing easily, delivering their desired color, and adding shine. (One drawback is that the product isn't currently as widely available in all the shades.) "The color was rich and multi-dimensional and looked fresh compared to others," a tester remarked.

It was a top performer in the GH Beauty Lab's at-home hair color test for providing the desired shade, giving rich and even results, and leaving hair looking silky and feeling nourished, although it didn't provide as good gray coverage or resist fading as well as other custom hair color brands in Lab testing. Former GH Beauty Lab Executive Director Birnur Aral, Ph.D, is a fan of the service and another former GH Beauty Lab scientist called it "a great option if you want the customization you get from working with a hair colorist and the convenience and savings of doing it yourself at home." It "felt very personalized—the service, the color I wanted, the emails with helpful info and tips," a tester raved.

While all brands tested for blonde shades have only scored average (or worse) for covering up gray, this stood out for fade resistance and keeping its shine. In Lab evaluations, it scored high for giving a natural look, 79% of testers said it left their hair soft and shiny and 90% said it didn’t cause irritation. The hair color also comes in a huge range of 50 shades from very light blonde to dark blue-black. "Easy to apply and left hair extremely soft, even without conditioner," a tester reported.

L'Oréal Paris kit, which was a strong performer in GH Beauty Lab testing. It ranked near the top in several areas: successfully covering grays, not being messy during application, and delivering color that lasted. Although consumer testers thought the color had staying power, it didn't score well for fade resistance in Lab assessments. They also didn't rate it highly at leaving hair looking smooth and shiny. Many testers commented on how easy it was to apply; others praised "the color saturation" and that it "looked so rich and beautiful."RELATED: The Best Gray Hair Dyes for Gorgeous Silver HairFormulaPermanentNumber of shades39IncludesPermanent hair color cream, developer, gloves, pre-color treatment, comb applicator, conditioning treatment sample12Best for Dark HairSchwarzkopf Keratin Color Permanent Hair Color$11 at AmazonCredit: SchwarzkopfProsEasy applicationGreat gray coverageUniform, true color payoffResists fadingConsBlonde shade tested didn't perform as wellIn GH Beauty Lab testing, this Schwarzkopf dye was a star in deep shades like brown and black.

In the Lab, our scientists dye human hair samples in black, brown, red, and blonde shades and visually evaluate each for color results and gray hair coverage. They then assess each hair dye's color retention with a series of tests including 20 wash and dry cycles using the Swatch Wash Station (above) and 10 hours of UVA light exposure with the Q-Lab QUV Accelerated Weathering Tester (simulating four weeks of wear). Finally, Beauty Lab scientists measure color change in the dyed hair samples using the VeriVide DigiEye system (below) to determine how much each faded over time.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowGood Housekeeping/Jillian SollazzoBoxed dyes are also sent to a panel of women all over the country who evaluate them on factors such as ease of preparation and application, scent and color performance, including gray coverage, color richness, uniformity, and accuracy compared to the image on the box. They provide real-life feedback on resulting hair shine, softness, and smoothness, as well as color fade over four weeks after application. The GH Beauty Lab's most recent at-home hair color test included 136 consumer testers and 160 human hair swatches. In total, Lab scientists exposed colored hair samples to UVA light for 800 hours and tallied 2,712 consumer survey responses.What to look for when shopping for the best at-home hair colorHere's what you'll want in a typical at-home hair color kit (and should have on hand before application), according to GH Beauty Lab experts:✔️ Hair color: This container holds a blend of the alkalizer and the dye precursors, the molecules that form the final color molecules in hair.✔️ Developer: Usually housed in an applicator bottle, the developer contains hydrogen peroxide and is mixed with the hair color before application.✔️ Instructions: Each product is different, so read the directions fully before use to familiarize yourself with the process, and follow them closely for best results. Lay out tools before starting for easy access.✔️ Gloves: One set is often included to protect skin from dye, but have extra gloves on hand just in case you need to switch them out for a different size or a fresh pair.✔️ Applicators: Most kits come with an applicator bottle in which the developer and the color are shaken together. Some also include a mixing tray or bowl and an applicator brush. If not included, gather a bowl to dispense the dye into, an applicator brush, and clips to section hair to ensure even coverage.✔️ Extras: Kits may have packets or tubes of color-protecting shampoo, conditioner, or a deep-conditioning treatment to enhance the result. Some also include color-remover wipes to sweep away dye splatters and a shower cap to slip over your hair while the dye processes to prevent dripping. (If not, GH Beauty Lab pros recommend having your own ready.)Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWhich type of box hair dye is best?Choose your hair dye formula based on how long you want the color to last and your desired results. Aral shares a quick primer:Permanent: This dye often contains ammonia (to open hair’s cuticle) mixed with a developer (hydrogen peroxide) to lift and deposit pigment, changing the hair’s color until it grows out. This dye lasts the longest and is best for covering grays.Demi-permanent: Ammonia-free, it deposits dye with a developer and lasts up to 24 shampoos for subtle enhancement and blending of regrowth.Semi-permanent: It has no ammonia or developer and deposits dye only to soften gray or boost color, lasting through about six to eight washes.Temporary: This is both ammonia- and developer-free, which means it's the least damaging hair dye. Large color molecules adhere to the outer layer of strands and can be washed out in one to two shampoos.Are home hair dyes as good as professional hair color?Yes, high-quality at-home hair dye formulas like those recommended here can provide results equivalent to salon hair color, including gray coverage, GH Beauty Lab experts say. That being said, if you are interested in more intricate hair color like lowlights, extensive highlights, balayage, ombré, or a drastic color change, it's best to visit a salon professional who is trained in those techniques.April FranzinoSenior Beauty & Style DirectorApril (she/her) is the senior beauty and style director at Good Housekeeping, Prevention and Woman's Day.
