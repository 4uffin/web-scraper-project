That's because earlier today, Amazon announced the dates of its annual Prime Big Deal Days sale, which will officially take place on October 7 and 8. SHOP EARLY PRIME BIG DEAL DAYS And based on what we know about Prime Big Deal Days from working the event the past couple of years, the discounts you’ll find on kitchen appliances, fashion, tech, and more will be just as good as the deals from July.Once sales officially start going live, we'll scour through and narrow down the only deals worth checking out (because there will be a lot). We'll start by diving deep for Good Housekeeping Institute-tested products that are on sale during this fall's event. Stay tuned. What is Amazon Prime Big Deal Days?By now, you may have heard of Prime Day, Amazon's biggest sales event of the year that typically happens in the middle of summer. It runs over a couple of days and promotes steep discounts across all categories—exclusively for Amazon Prime members.Amazon introduced Prime Big Deal Days in October 2022, and it has returned every October since then. Many refer to it as “October Prime Day,” since the deals are just as big as the ones you’ll find on Prime Day. (Plus, "Prime Big Deal Days" is a tongue twister, so if you'd rather called it "October Prime Day," I don't blame you). What's the difference between Prime Big Deal Days and Prime Day?You can think of Prime Big Deal Days as a fall version of Prime Day. They're practically the same event, with exclusive discounts just for Prime members, but they occur at different times of the year. Prime Day (usually happening in July) will slash prices off items across all categories (think home essentials, everyday appliances, and everything outside of that).
Because Prime Big Deal Days typically falls in October, the event tends to highlights hot-ticket holiday items, letting you check off your holiday shopping list early and score the hottest gifts at a discount. (Think tech, TVs, toys, best-selling beauty and more.) Also, Prime Big Deal Days is typically shorter at just two days long. This past Prime Day in July 2025 was four days long for the first time in the retailer's history—and each day was paired with "Today's Big Deals," which were product groups curated by Amazon that were heavily discounted for a limited time. At the time of publication, we aren't sure if the Prime Big Deal Days event will feature its own "Today's Big Deals," too.When is October Prime Day 2025?October Prime Day—or as it's officially called, Prime Big Deal Days—kicks off on Tuesday, October 7 and runs through Wednesday, October 8. Although this savings event is technically live for 48 hours (as compared to Prime Day in July, which was 96 hours long), we often see early deals popping up days and even weeks before the event.Is it actually worth shopping October Prime Day?Definitely. While Amazon hasn't released an official list of October Prime Day deals to the public yet, the retailer tends to offer competitive discounts across every category on the site."Since the holiday shopping season has been progressively getting earlier and earlier, Amazon's October Prime Day is actually my favorite time to get my holiday gift shopping done," says GH Editorial Commerce Director Jessica Teich. "Waiting until Black Friday and Cyber Monday feels foolish when there are so many great deals to be had earlier in the season—and, if you shop now, you don't have to worry about potential inventory issues and shipping delays spoiling your holidays." During last year's Prime Big Deal Days event, we saw steep markdowns on home and beauty products like Shark vacuums, Samsung TVs, and RoC skincare, so you can expect to see similar savings during 2025's October Prime Day. And if this past July's event is any indication (hint: it usually is), we'd be shocked not to see some pretty good deals on Apple tech. (In July, we saw 40% off the AirPods 2 Pro, the GH Institute's best overall AirPods pick.)How to shop October Prime DayLike most Prime Day events, the best prices during Prime Big Deal Days will be reserved for Prime members only. Your subscription comes with a suite of other perks, like free two-day shipping, access to movies and shows through Prime Video, discounts on groceries, and more. But if you're not already a member, here's a hack: You can sign up for a 30-day trial to get access to all the Prime Day deals and try out all the exclusive perks for free. Just be sure to cancel before the 30 day mark to avoid being charged.Did Amazon Prime shipping change?For some people, yes. Amazon recently announced that it's phasing out its Invitee program on October 1, which—beginning in 2009—let Prime members share their shipping benefit with someone else. If you were invited into the program when it was accepting new invitees (until 2015), the shipping benefits you were grandfathered into will likely stop one week before Big Deal Days.According to an Amazon spokesperson, "fewer than 1% of U.S. Prime members are affected by this change." If you're part of that 1%, you have a few new options:You can join Amazon Family, which lets one Prime member share their benefits—shipping, streaming, and more—with an adult who lives in their household. You can join Amazon Prime for discounted year. According to Amazon, those who were invited into the Invitee program can get 12 months of Prime for just $14.99 if they sign up before December 31. (The typical price for Prime is $14.99 per month, so this is a big deal.) If you're eligible for this discount, you should have received an email from Amazon to redeem the offer.Sign Up for Amazon Prime Early October Prime Day dealsGH AWARD-WINNING BEDDING BRANDBedsure Queen ComforterNow 44% Off$50 $28 at AmazonCredit: AmazonBEST VALUE TABLET (NEW MODEL)Amazon Fire HD 10Now 36% Off$140 $90 at AmazonCredit: AmazonTOP-TESTED SPEAKER BRANDAnker SoundCore 2Now 35% Off$45 $29 at AmazonCredit: AmazonTOP-TESTED SPEAKER BRANDJBL Go 3 Portable Bluetooth Wireless SpeakerNow 25% Off$40 $30 at AmazonCredit: AmazonLAB EXPERT FAVORITEBedsure Sherpa Fleece Throw BlanketNow 39% Off$28 $17 at AmazonCredit: AmazonONE OF OUR TOP-TESTED VACUUM BRANDSShark AV2501AE AI Robot VacuumNow 54% Off$650 $300 at AmazonCredit: AmazonWhy trust us?Lauren Gruber is an associate commerce editor who has covered the last five Amazon Prime Day events for various publications, including GH.
