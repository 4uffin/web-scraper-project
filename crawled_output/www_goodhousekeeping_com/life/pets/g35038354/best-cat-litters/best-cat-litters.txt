While scooping the box is not joy, I am glad I can do it in my pajamas, without having to step outside, and no more than once a day. I also think the chore is less smelly than picking up dog poop, and that's thanks to cat litter. The best kitty litter hides odors and clumps to make scooping fast and easy.A pain point is that some litters migrate out of the box, attached to a cat's paws. (It's referred to as "tracking.") Also, some giant containers of litter can be back-breaking to lift. So when the experts at the Good Housekeeping Institute tested more than 25 cat litter brands, we looked at odor control and clumping ability, plus tracking and overall ease of maintenance.

Others had granules so large that they didn't clump much at all. Dr. Elsey's Ultra Premium cat litter had medium-size bentonite clay granules that form hard clumps, making scooping easy.In our at-home tests, daily litter-box cleaning became a 20-second chore with this litter. Because of its reliable clumping it's also among the best cat litters to use with self-cleaning litter boxes like the Litter-Robot.Dr. Elsey's has no added scent, which veterinarians prefer, but we think it controls odor well, even with multiple cats. Our only complaint is that the 40-pound bag is so heavy. We suggest using an empty plastic container to scoop out new litter when you need it. Or there's a lighter 20-pound box.Dust might rise up when you first pour this into the litter box, but we found that it quickly settled. The large bag can last up to two months with one cat.RELATED: I Tried the Litter-Robot in My HomeFeatures at a GlanceClumpingYesScentedNoMain ingredientClayPackaging40-lb bag (shown) or 20-lb boxApprox. cost per pound51¢2Best ValueSpecial Kitty Odor ControlShop at Amazon$7 at WalmartCredit: Special KittyProsLow priceEasy pour 14-pound jugWorks for multi-cat householdsUnscentedConsTracks a bitIf you're looking to keep costs low, prefer a 14-pound jug to a bag or box weighing 20 pounds or more, and don't mind the occasional sweep around the litter box to pick up a few tracked granules, this Walmart exclusive has a low price and is easy to use. The top unscrews and the litter easily pours out. Then the jug can be recycled.Like our best overall choice it's comprised of bentonite clay which forms clumps to speed your scooping time. Though it may not clump quite as tightly as some others, many online reviewers using this litter have multiple cats and say this works well for them.Fans of this brand appreciate not having to lay out more than $10 at a time for cat litter. The unscented Odor Control version gets the most reviews, but the brand also sells a fresh scent version.

That means less tracking and less cleanup outside of the litter box. Both the scented version and this unscented version have earned the Good Housekeeping Seal. The larger pellets also make for less dust, reviewers report. Some express concern that cats with sensitive paws might not like it, but in our review, cats took to it just fine.This clumping litter works well, so scooping is easy. This litter is also easy to find. Amazon ships the box, shown, or Chewy will ship two 20-pound jugs if you prefer to pour from one of those.

We like all the various Arm & Hammer cat litters but Clump & Seal stands out for clumping well and being easy to scoop. We've seen it recommended on Reddit forums and it's got tens of thousands of five-star reviews on Amazon.Because of its superior clumping ability, this is another great choice for an automatic cat litter box (like the Litter Robot). But unlike our best overall pick, this one has a scented added—a pro for some, a con for others. The brand also uses its signature baking soda to absorb odors. We tested Arm & Hammer cat litter in an open-top litter box placed just outside the kitchen of a home with a senior cat. To our noses, there was no telltale smell even after it was left unscooped for several days. "My cat tracks this litter, but it's still worth it for the odor control," the tester said.Arm & Hammer also makes a favorite cat litter deodorizer.

You need to do a big initial lift, or you might need someone to deliver the full 38-pound package, but then you can then pull out one pouch at a time. Each 9.5-pound pouch fills the inside of one litter box. It makes the chore of changing a whole box a lot easier on your arms and back and takes the guesswork out of how much litter to pour.Scoop Away's 38-pound package can be especially helpful if you have multiple cats and more than one litter box to regularly fill and clean. (Any vet and sites like preventivevet.com will tell you that you're officially supposed to have at least one litter box per cat.) It does, however, create a lot of plastic waste.This scented litter does a good job of masking odors, and the quick-clumping clay is easy to scoop.ClumpingYesScentedYesMain ingredientClayPackagingFour 9.5-lb bags in a 38-lb packageApprox. cost per pound51¢6Best for Sensitive CatsFresh Step Clumping Cat Litter$20 at AmazonCredit: Fresh StepProsUnscented, which is recommended by vetsActivated charcoal helps odor controlSmooth litter pieces are gentle on a kitten's pawsLarger granules, which don't track as muchConsNot as hard-clumping as othersVets recommend unscented litter for finicky cats and for kittens, but, of course, cat owners don't ever want to be able to smell the litter box, picky cats or no. We home-tested this with a family whose litter box sits in the hallway, and the odor control was top-notch, especially considering this is unscented litter.The brand says it uses activated charcoal to help neutralize odors. You should be able to go a few days without scooping (if you have just one cat) and a month and a half without changing out the whole litter box.The brand also claims these smooth granules are easy on a cat's or kitten's small paws. We did notice less tracking with this litter, but it doesn't clump as tightly as other clay litters on this list, maybe because the granules are on the larger side.The litter pours easily out of a hole in the side of the box. It's not dust-free, but if odor-fighting is a top priority and your cat is sensitive, this is a good option.Features at a GlanceClumpingYesScentedNoMain ingredientsClay and activated charcoalPackaging18.5-lb boxApprox. cost per pound$1.08Advertisement - Continue Reading Below7Best Low-DustWorld's
Best Cat LitterNow 18% Off$23 $19 at Amazon$23 $19 at Walmart$21 at TargetCredit: World's BestProsPlant-based rather than clay-basedCan be flushed (though not if you live in California)Lightweight formula doesn’t weigh down trashNo added fragrances or perfumesConsSmall particles get trackedWorld's Best Cat Litter is made from corn, so it's much lighter and has much less dust than clay litter. Your trash bag won’t sink from the weight of your daily cleaning and you might be able to do less vacuuming. The brand claims that this is flushable and septic-safe, as long as you don't flush more than two clumps at a time. Good Housekeeping writer Yolanda Wikiel used and flushed this litter for a year with no ill effects. "I definitely prefer to be able to flush litter," she says. (The state of California asks its residents to always place litter in the trash rather than flushing.)Wikiel purchased World's Best Cat Litter when she adopted two new kittens. "A lot of the animal rescue organizations I talked with recommended it, and the kittens gravitated to this brand when I put out two boxes, each with a different litter," she says. "But the pieces of litter are small, so they do get everywhere." The litter smells a bit malty, since it's plant-based. That's offset by the fact that it clumps so well there's very little litter waste as you clean.

Normal, healthy cat urine should make the crystals yellow or olive green; any other color, including red or blue, could signal a need for a trip to the vet for a possible health concern. (Blue, for instance, might mean there's a urinary tract infection.) Most cats are stoic and don't let on if they're feeling sick, so using this litter might be worth the price for the peace of mind.We tested Tidy Care both in our Lab and in homes. Our experts report that the granules can absorb their own mass in liquid. Indeed, all of our testers gave it a perfect score for absorbing urine effectively and noted that it also killed the smell. For liquid waste, you stir the crystals daily so your cat doesn't keep peeing on the same litter. Solid waste is not absorbed; you'll want to scoop that daily or every few days to avoid odors. For one cat, you'll need to change out all the litter once a month and put in a fresh bag. Some online reviewers report dust with this, and some say there is tracking, but users seem to have varied experiences with both. The main reason to buy this type would be for health monitoring.

The 17-pound package stretches as far as 35 pounds of regular clay litter, according to the brand. The granules are light and easy to pour, scoop, and haul away in a garbage bag.

I have a cousin who uses it, too. "The con is that it's so lightweight it goes everywhere if your cat tracks it," my cousin noted, but since she carries litter down to a basement litter box she likes this lightweight option. Some online reviewers said it sticks to their cat's paws, but others said they didn't have that issue, so tracking might vary cat to cat.This version of Tidy Cats does clump and has a light scent. For real fragrance buffs, there is a lightweight version scented with Glade that, if your cat accepts it, can practically double as a room freshener. It's labeled as nearly dust-free, but our testers and online reviewers say you should expect some dust when you initially pour this into the box.Related: 8 Best Cat Treats, According to Veterinarians ClumpingYesScentedYesMain ingredientsClay and mineralsPackaging17-lb boxApprox. cost per pound$1.504 More Non-Clay Cat Litters We LikeYou might want to use one of these if you are looking for something other than clay litter. Just note that because urine can trickle down through non-clumping pellets, you will want to empty and clean the entire box every week or two.Pretty Litter is white silica gel crystals that should turn yellow or olive green if your healthy cat pees on them. If they turn red or blue, you may want bring your cat to the vet. The brand recommends owners "thoroughly mix the litter every day" to avoid having cats saturate the same granules over and over. Pretty Litter is nice and lightweight—each bag weighs only six pounds, yet fills a box. Per pound, this is the priciest litter on our list, but a little goes a long way.So Phresh Paper Pellets claims to be made of recycled paper pellets that create no dust and won't track. We realized another benefit while home testing: If your cat noisily kicks around clay litter, this So Phresh paper formula solves that problem—it's quieter as your kitty rakes away. This formula is made with baking soda in addition to a scent, and the combination masks most odors. It's sold exclusively through Petco in 25-pound bags. sWheat Scoop is granules of wheat with no added fragrances or chemicals. It claims to biodegrade and be safe to flush. (We did not try the flushing part, and flushing litter is not allowed in California.) You can compost the litter when you do a total box changeover—not the cat poop, only the excess litter.
Online reviewers who have older cats with sensitive paws, picky cats, or cats with scent sensitivities or dust allergies gravitate toward this soft, unscented litter.ökocat Wood Clumping Cat Litter is shredded-wood litter with a soft, natural texture and no added scent. It does not clump as well as clay, but does clump more than other non-clay alternatives. It's plant-based; the pellets were originally developed in Germany but are now produced domestically, in Georgia, from what the brand says is a blend of spruce, fir, and pine. It's lightweight, but may produce some natural wood dust.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowHow we test the best cat littersJessica HartshornOur Lab experts, lead tester and home testers reviewed more than 25 cat litters over the course of three years and continue to test. We also interviewed cat owners about their favorites and combed through online reviews to get a full picture of how each brand works in real-world conditions. Users answered questions about the packaging, ease of scooping, odor control, level of dust, level of tracking, and their cat's acceptance of the litter. We also interviewed pet expert Megan Conrad, BVMS, about what to look for when shopping for the best cat litter for your household.What to look for when shopping for the best cat litterAccording to the American Veterinary Medical Association, when you're analyzing different types of cat litter, you should identify which factors you consider most important. In the end, though, your cat may be the decision-maker. ✔️ Material: Clay (technically bentonite clay) is what most litters are made of, and it's usually inexpensive. When urine hits the clay, it balls up. That makes it easy for you to scoop the waste and throw it in the garbage. When your cat rakes a clay litter, it will, ideally, easily bury its own solid waste, so this kind of litter can also be very effective at controlling odors. Some varieties are scented, some are unscented, and some have added minerals or baking soda to help kill odors. Don't flush clay litter or you'll clog your plumbing.Silica gel crystals have recently grown in popularity because the color can change based on your cat's urine content, helping indicate if there's a health problem. Crystals do not clump but they do absorb urine. They do not absorb solid waste. Crystal cat litter tends to be the most expensive, but it's also lightweight and not as dusty as some clay litters. Don't flush crystal cat litter.Wood, wheat, corn, and paper are often referred to as more "natural" choices. (Clay is natural, too, and gel crystals are sodium silicate sand processed with oxygen and water so it absorbs a tremendous amount of liquid, according to Chewy.) Wood, wheat, corn, and paper varieties might be milled, sawed, ground, or cut into fine granules or chunky particles. Some are flushable outside of the state of California, or even compostable once you've removed the actual waste.✔️ Odor control: Any litter that clumps or that your cat can use to bury waste can be odor-controlling. Some varieties go further to mask odors by including baking soda, activated charcoal, or added scents. However, any of these odor-masking ingredients can be a turn-off to some picky cats. "According to research, most cats seem to prefer an unscented litter that's fine-grained," said Dr. Conrad. "Some cats aren't picky and will use whatever you buy, but others will skip the box if they don't like what's in it," she explained. "It may be a matter of experimenting, or even creating a 'box line-up' of different litters to find something your cat will regularly use that also works for your lifestyle."✔️ Clumping ability: Clumping cat litter makes it easy for you to scoop. Clay cat litter can clump well unless it's too fine-grained or too large-grained to hold together. Clumping cat litter is the best kind to use in self-cleaning automatic litter boxes such as the Litter Robot 4.Crystals are non-clumping litter, and so is paper cat litter. With non-clumping litter, it's difficult to scoop urine or fecal matter without changing the whole pan, but some people prefer to clean the entire box weekly rather than scooping daily. ✔️ Dust level: This isn't just important for keeping your floors and furniture clean; it's also helpful for preventing you and your cat from sneezing. Some people are much more sensitive to dust than others. Often a litter is dusty just when you first pour it into the box and then it quickly settles.✔️ Tracking: The goal is for your cat's litter to stay in the box and not get tracked around the house. Clay litters tend to track more than some other materials, such as paper or wood, and small particles of clay from sand-like litter tend to track more than large pieces of litter. A mat outside the litter box (such as this cat litter mat from Amazon) can help remove particles from a kitty's paws.

That said, plenty of households (especially small apartments) have two cats sharing a box. If the cats are fine with it (no accidents happening) and you keep it clean, then no harm is being done.How often should I scoop the litter box?Whether you're using clumping or non-clumping cat litter, you should scoop daily. If you comb the Reddit forums, most cat enthusiasts claim they clean daily or even twice a day. But the Pet Health Network says that it's okay to scoop every other day too. If your cat scratches around outside the box, that could be a sign that it's not thrilled with the waste inside the box and you should scoop more often.If you use an automatic, self-cleaning litter box, you don't need to scoop daily but you'll need to empty the waste drawer at least once a week.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowHow often should I clean the entire litter box?Dr. Conrad says that if you're using a clumping cat litter, you might change over the entire box and litter contents once a month. You'll have to do it weekly or every other week if you're using a non-clumping litter. If you have access to an outside hose, you can empty the litter box and spray-clean it outdoors. If you live in an apartment, many Reddit posters recommend emptying the box completely and cleaning the box in your bath tub, then cleaning the tub. Find directions for cleaning the Litter Robot on its site.Should I use an open litter box, or a box with a cover?Vets say most cats like an open litter box, particularly senior cats and kittens. However, we've known shy cats (including my own) who seem to prefer the privacy of a box with a cover.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowHow can I make the litter box more appealing to my cat?Jessica Hartshorn We like these tips from the ASPCA:• Most cats like a shallow bed, so only fill your box with one to two inches of litter.• Most (but not all) cats prefer clumping, unscented litter. Sometimes a cat keeps preferring whatever it used as a kitten.• Cats like their bathroom to be in a quiet location. If you can use a cat-door to a basement or garage, that might be best. Cats also like to do their business somewhere where they're not "trapped;" in other words: there's an exit that they could escape through quickly if a person or another pet approaches. A box in the human bathroom might not work if the door is often shut, keeping the cat out or trapping it in.The ASPCA also has a lot of great advice for resolving litter box problems. Much of it boils down to the fact that cats can't be shame-trained to use a litter box. It's up to a cat owner to put a box somewhere their cat feels safe, fill it with a litter that the cat likes, and clean it often.Why trust Good Housekeeping?
