It's an exciting time to bond and get ready for all the love you will share together. But don't forget that the sudden change in living situation can also be overwhelming for pets.Beyond stocking up on the best dog toys and the softest dog bed, you need to know how to actually help your dog adapt to their new environment. That's where the 3-3-3 rule for dogs comes in.What Is the 3-3-3 Rule for Dogs?The 3-3-3 rule for rescue dogs is a helpful rule of thumb for how to settle a pup into their new home. It outlines how to spend the first 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months of having a newly adopted dog to help them acclimate to you and your home. It covers when to give your dog space, when to focus on bonding, and when to start basic training. "The 3-3-3 rule provides a roadmap for the adoption process and helps ensure a smooth transition for both the dog and the owner," according to the Longmont Humane Society. "It also helps set realistic expectations and prevents common mistakes such as overloading the dog with too much too soon."While this rule is just a guideline—every dog is different and will get comfortable at their own pace—it’s a good overview of what to focus on and when.What to Do in 3 DaysThe first 3 days after you bring a dog to a new home, the focus should be on your dog decompressing. Let them take this time to explore their new surroundings, sniff all the interesting scents, and get used to your presence. "Start your daily routine right away but do not force interaction. Set your boundaries early while still giving them space," advises the Longmont Humane Society.To do this, don’t overwhelm the dog with too many new people, and make sure they have a calm and quiet space to retreat to as they process this major change.During that time, your dog may be stressed and overwhelmed. They might sleep a lot, hide, or have bathroom accidents even if they are potty-trained. "Be patient and stay positive!" the organization recommends. Let the dog come to you when they are ready.What to Do in 3 WeeksThe next 3 weeks are about training and bonding with your dog. During this period, "Take your dog on daily walks and spend time playing and challenging your new pup," advises the Longmont Humane Society. Encourage bonding with treats, tummy rubs, and toys. Start acclimating your dog to being in new environments with you, like the dog park and other public places.As your dog adjusts to their new home, they will start feeling safer and showing more of their personality. "At this point they may be testing the boundaries, so don’t get discouraged," advises the organization, which notes that this is the time when behavioral difficulties may start to appear. Stay patient and start to work on basic obedience and fundamental commands like sit, stay, and come. Shorter training sessions are more effective and less overwhelming for your dog, so spend just a few minutes at a time teaching commands and reward good behavior. Positive reinforcement and consistent boundaries will help your dog thrive.What to Do in 3 MonthsAfter 3 months, your dog should be settling into your home. Your dog should look to you for guidance and feel comfortable exploring new or scary things with your encouragement because they feel safe with you."Take them to the park, go on car rides, and let them interact with other dogs and people while being mindful of their unique personalities and limitations with strangers. This will help build confidence and strengthen your bond," advises the Longmont Humane Society. Continue to reinforce their training and socializing, as well as your boundaries and routines. By this time, you and your dog should be understanding each other and feeling truly at home together. If your dog needs a little more time to feel comfortable, don’t worry. Dogs that come from challenging backgrounds may need more time than just 3 months to feel settled into their new home, and that's normal. Bottom lineThe 3-3-3 rule is just a guideline for respecting your dog’s initial need for space and then their bonding, training, and comfort needs. With patience and love, your dog will settle in their own time as they adjust to their new loving home.
