Sure, it's easy to say "yes" right after nabbing a dream job or going to an event you've been looking forward to attending. But happiness is more than just feeling great at one given moment. "There are many factors that contribute to happiness,” explains Sonja Lyubomirsky, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside and author of The How of Happiness. “Happiness really is more internal than external, so it’s how you feel about yourself, other people, and the world around you. It’s how you think, how you behave on a daily basis that influences happiness the most." JOIN GH +No matter who you are or where you live, most can agree that a big goal of life is to be happy, something that sounds so easy but can be a real struggle, especially because it can't be guaranteed by looks, money, or possessions. While we can't promise everyday to be easy, our new 14-Day Happiness Challenge, which we created in partnership with Prevention, can help transform your outlook on life so you learn to cultivate happiness in your own life on a daily basis..In this exclusive guide for GH+ members, you can expect to get tips on creating healthier lifestyles and changing the way you view yourself and others. The two-week challenge enables you to take your happiness to new levels, while also giving you the tools needed to succeed when the first 14 days are over. Want a quick peek at what you can expect to find in our happiness guide? Check out the first-day tasks of the challenge below:Day 1: Practice Self-CareAdobe StockSelf-care is a broad term, and sometimes people confuse self-care with self-indulgence, or an act of selfishness. But self-care really is about nourishing bodies and minds so that we can be the best version of ourselves in all areas of life: “When we don’t take care of ourselves, we’re more likely to feel fatigued and get physical symptoms, like stress-related headaches or pain,” says Helen L. Coons, Ph.D., a clinical health psychologist specializing in women’s behavioral health and wellness at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “The biggest thing is being intentional of how we take care of ourselves. When we’re not last on the task list, we have more energy to do what’s important to us.”To start on a path toward better self-care and create a self-care routine, try looking at the things that make you feel revitalized and add more of those things to your weekly schedule. Everybody has a different version of self-care, but we can all agree that neglecting yourself can detract from happiness, Lyubomirsky explains. Acts of self-care can be anything that makes you feel happy, healthy, and rejuvenated. Try these ideas that might work for you:✔️ Rest and relaxation: engage in some “me time” with a luxurious bath complete with scented candles and epsom salt. Go the extra mile with a do-it-yourself manicure and pedicure, hair mask, or face mask (or all three, we’re not judging).✔️ Get moving: try an impromptu, stress-busting dance party to revive your body and mind. Add in your favorite tunes and let loose whenever and wherever the mood strikes you.✔️ Be kind: a random act of kindness can put things in perspective and help you see goodness and positivity in the world. “Helping others actually helps people feel happier,” Lyubomirsky says. So try offering up compliments, or holding doors for others, for a true mood-boosting activity.Join Our Membership Club to Get Unlimited AccessLearn More About GH+Credit: GHWant full access to the challenge?
