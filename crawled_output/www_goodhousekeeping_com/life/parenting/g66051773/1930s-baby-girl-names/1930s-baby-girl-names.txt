For example, it's a fad in both eras to take a name traditionally given to boys, change the ending to -ie, and bestow it upon a baby girl. (Think Billie Eilish or Billie Holliday.) And that's not the only place where the two decades line up.For families looking for a baby name with that vintage feel, these are 1930s baby girl names that won't feel out of place today. In fact, all of them have increased in popularity between last year and the year before, according to the Social Security Administration (SSA), meaning they rank among the top 1,000 most popular girl names today. And all of them were also huge in the '30s, counting themselves among the top 200 names. Test them out, and see if the timeless, classic vibes are a fit.1MarjorieGeneral Photographic Agency//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 43SSA rank today: 822Year-over-year increase in rank: 429 placesMeaning: "pearl"If there's one baby-naming mega-trend that exists in both the '30s and in 2025, it's the popularity of names that end in -ie. Some names appear in both decades—for examples, see the top three names on this list—while some have fallen out of favor today. (Willie, Johnnie, and Bobbie were also on in the top 200 for girls in the '30s.) Marjorie, as in Primrose Path actress Marjorie Rambeau, leads the pack in terms of fast-climbers, increasing a huge 429 places between last year and the year before, when it didn't even make the SSA list of the top 1,000. (It last ranked in 2017.) 2BillieMichael Ochs Archives//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 107SSA rank today: 694Year-over-year increase in rank: 171 placesMeaning: "resolute protector"Billie, as in jazz singer Billie Holiday, hit its peak in 1930, when it was No. 79 on the SSA list. Or did it? The name has been increasing in popularity since 2022, moving up more than 250 places in rank, so it's possible that this decade could beat Billie's previous record.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below3NellieBettmann//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 135SSA rank today: 521Year-over-year increase in rank: 94 placesMeaning: "shining light"Nellie—as in Nellie Tayloe Ross, a former governor of Wyoming who was the first woman to run the U.S. Mint—spent four decades off the SSA list after failing to rank in 1980. But in 2019, Nellie came back in a big way, re-entering the list at No. 863. Now, it's climbed to No. 521, as Western/cowgirl names are making it big.RELATED: 100 Western and Cowboy Baby Names Galloping to the Top of the Charts4FlorenceJohn Springer Collection//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 55SSA rank today: 435Year-over-year increase in rank: 87 placesMeaning: "flourishing"In addition to -ie names, place names are really hot right now: Think of all the babies being named Vienna, Brooklyn, Paris, and Phoenix. This bodes well for Florence, as in soprano Florence George. While Florence peaked in 1902, when it was No. 7 on the list, it spent the '30s as a top-100 name. Like Nellie, it fell off the list for a time—it didn't rank between 1981 and 2017—but it's been inching up in the ranks ever since.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below5LorettaBettmann//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 81SSA rank today: 677Year-over-year increase in rank: 86 placesMeaning: "laurel"The 1930s was the decade for Loretta, as in Call of the Wild actress Loretta Young, and the name peaked in 1938 when it was No. 62. It stuck around longer than the other '30s names, only falling off the SSA list in 1991. And it was only gone for a brief time, re-emerging onto the list in 2020, and increasing in popularity every year since.6RosieSasha//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 169SSA rank today: 311Year-over-year increase in rank: 81 placesMeaning: "Rose"While most people associate the name Rosie with Rosie the Riveter, the name actually peaked much earlier than the World War II era; it reached its highest rank ever in 1910, when it was No. 114. Today Rosie, as in stage actress Rosie Barsony, is not as popular as Rose (No. 115), but it's still been having a tremendous comeback, gaining in popularity every year since 2013.RELATED: 250 Short Girl Names That Get Right to the PointAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below7JudithLondon Express//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 40SSA rank today: 832Year-over-year increase in rank: 73 placesMeaning: "praised" or "woman of Judea"Add the name Judy to Judith in the 1930s, and the name would go up an extra 10 places in rank for the decade. But today, Judy no longer makes the SSA list, while Judith, as in Rebecca actress Judith Anderson, is having a moment, hopping up more than 70 places in rank between last year and the year before.8EileenSasha//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 113SSA rank today: 593Year-over-year increase in rank: 69 placesMeaning: "desired"Eileen—as in fashion designer Eileen Idare—is a tried-and-true name that never really falls off the SSA list, it just moves up and down. In the '30s, it was a top-200 name, and now it falls somewhere in the middle of the pack, but it seems to always have a place on the list. It's good for families who like classic, trend-proof names.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below9SylviaKeystone-France//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 76SSA rank today: 361Year-over-year increase in rank: 65 placesMeaning: "forest"In the 1930s, Sylvia, as in suffragette Sylvia Parkhurst, was hitting its stride. The name peaked in 1937, when it was No. 50. It's fallen since then, but the fact that it's increased in popularity every year since 2019 shows it could be staging its big comeback.10BonnieBettmann//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 66SSA rank today: 441Year-over-year increase in rank: 61 placesMeaning: "beautiful"Sports fans of the '30s may have heard the name Bonnie in relation to tennis star Bonnie Miller (right)—but, in the decade, the name was more infamous than famous because of the bank robberies of Bonnie and Clyde. The outlaws didn't dampen the popularity of the name, though, and the name kept climbing until it hit its peak until 1950, when it was No. 33.

The name reached its peak a couple of years before, in 1927, when it was way up at No. 8. Today, it's in the middle of the SSA list, overshadowed by other -ia names, like the ever-popular Olivia and Sophia.RELATED: 200 Beautiful Middle Names for Girls, Since Middle Names Are the Most Fun to Choose12LouiseDonaldson Collection//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 41SSA rank today: 540Year-over-year increase in rank: 45 placesMeaning: "famous warrior"Louise—which was the name of my grandmother, who was married to my grandfather, named Louis!—was on a steady decline in the 1930s. The name had peaked way back in 1914, and, while it hung on as a top-100 name in the '30s, it slipped until eventually falling off the list in 1992. But Louise, as in bob-haired actress Louise Brooks, returned in 2018, and has been a stalwart on the SSA list ever since, steadily rising since its re-emergence.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below13CynthiaEdward Steichen//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 191SSA rank today: 826Year-over-year increase in rank: 45 placesMeaning: "from Mount Kynthos"Cynthia—as in stage actress Cynthia Rogers, pictured here with Sterling Holloway, the voice of Winnie the Pooh!—was on its way up in the '30s. It spent the decade as a top-300 name, but it didn't peak until much later, in 1957, when it was all the way up at No. 7. Today, it's not as popular as it was even in the '30s, but its upward trajectory since 2022 shows it could make it all the way back up again.14IreneArchive Photos//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 49SSA rank today: 638Year-over-year increase in rank: 37 placesMeaning: "peace"The name Irene, as in Cimarron actress Irene Dunne, peaked in 1919, but the 1933 song "Goodnight, Irene" gave it a moment in the spotlight during the '30s. Today, Irene is still behind the similar-sounding Eileen, but is quietly steady in the middle of the SSA list.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below15DaisyCecil Beaton//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 199SSA rank today: 76Year-over-year increase in rank: 34 placesMeaning: "day's eye" or flower nameDaisy Bell, an 1892 song begs, "Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do," might explain why the name was more popular at the very beginning of the 20th century, when it was a top-100 name, than in the 1930s, when it was a top-300 name. But the year when the name Daisy—as in Harper's Bazaar editor, author, and fashion icon Daisy Fellowes—was most popular? It's actually 2024, when it was No. 76.16DorothyBettmann//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 6SSA rank today: 431Year-over-year increase in rank: 31 placesMeaning: "gift of God"There was an extremely famous Dorothy everyone knew in 1939, telling everyone that there was no place like home from the big, silver screen. But the name Dorothy, as in singer Dorothy Maynor, was a hit even before the 30s; the name spent eight straight years as the No. 2 name in the country, ending its streak in 1927. Today, movie fans may be more excited about Wicked than The Wizard of Oz, but Dorothy still makes the SSA list.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below17LeonaGeneral Photographic Agency//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 150SSA rank today: 488Year-over-year increase in rank: 30 placesMeaning: "lioness"Leona, as in violinist Leona Flood, is another extremely early favorite, peaking in 1905 at No. 69. The name eventually fell off the list in 1982, but came back in 2009, a couple of years after Leona Lewis won The X Factor and brought the name back into the spotlight.18FrancesNew York Daily News Archive//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 19SSA rank today: 379Year-over-year increase in rank: 26 placesMeaning: "from France" or "Free man"Parents who are into unisex and gender-neutral names (or at least homophones of them) are flocking to Frances, which has more than doubled in popularity since 2010. And while it's tremendously successful today, Frances, as in Yankee Doodle Dandy actress Frances Langford, was even more popular in the 1930s, when it spent the decade as a top-30 name.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below19RamonaFPG//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 186SSA rank today: 772Year-over-year increase in rank: 22 placesMeaning: "wise protector"Ramona—as in singer Ramona Davies (who just went by the mononym Ramona)—peaked just before the start of the '30s, landing at No. 117 in 1928. It's another one that lost its way in the '80s, and didn't appear on the SSA list at all between 1989 and 2015. But then Ramona returned, and has increased 180 places since 2016, so it's safe to say its comeback is assured.20ClaraOtto Dyar//Getty ImagesSSA rank in the 1930s: 79SSA rank today: 78Year-over-year increase in rank: 20 placesMeaning: "bright" or "clear"Clara, as in actress and "It" girl Clara Bow, is about as popular now as it was in the '30s. It ranked 79 then, it ranks 78 now—so the '30s really are happening all over again when it comes to baby names.
