Sheila Lirio Marcelo, the future founder of Care.com, had recently had a baby during her third year of college. The term “invisible load” — a phrase used to describe the unseen mental and emotional work of managing daily life, often carried by women in heterosexual relationships — was years from finding its way into our Instagram feeds and vocabularies, but her body was already feeling it. She came down with a stress-related illness that landed her in the hospital. “I was the breadwinner…we were dealing with a lot of mental health issues in our family,” says Marcelo, who started Care.com in 2006. "No matter what, [there was] the mental load—all the things we were juggling as young parents, undergrad and graduate school, and work. I started to realize that care also included all the mundane tasks of everyday that we have to take care of:
to put food on the table, pick ups and drop off. Even if you had a great nanny, you have to figure out schedules and logistics and navigating things.”In 2015, she started to brainstorm an app integrating some of artificial intelligence’s newly discovered capabilities. She knew it would work for moms too. Nearly a decade later, she announced the launch of her app, called Ohai.ai (pronounced “Oh, hey!”). In her launch announcement, the serial CEO, who has been named Forbes 50 over 50 and Fortune’s Top 10 Women Entrepreneurs, noted a 2020 study conducted by Oxfam that showed just how dire the problem was. “Women would have made a collective $10.9 trillion in one year if compensated minimum wage for their unpaid care work, spending four hours per day on average," the study said. "With the amount of time spent on tasks such as managing calendars, planning appointments, and overseeing the family's wellbeing, the cognitive load of managing a household and caring for loved ones is a significant contributor to burnout.” Within the Ohai app, a virtual assistant named “O” is out to ease that load. As a busy mom of 5 kids under 10 and a business owner working full time, I jumped into the app excited to see what load it could take off my shoulders.What is the Ohai app?When you arrive at the Ohai app’s home page, you’ll see examples of some of the tasks the app can help with: There's O reminding you to dress your kid (by name) in “something cute” for picture day tomorrow, or telling you how many people have RSVP’d to your event Saturday.Ohai is a part organizer and part virtual assistant that you can interact with passively, such as uploading your school calendar and having it populate to your own typical digital calendar, or actively, such as talking to O about upcoming events or issues. The idea is to have a one-stop-shop to keep yourself and your family organized, but Marcelo points out not all families have the same organizational systems—a difference that Ohai accounts for. During onboarding, she shares, you’ll self-identify with terms such as “color coder” or “hot mess” to further customize your options.The Ohai.ai app can help with tasks like scheduling.What can the Ohai app do for busy parents?One dilemma I typically have when starting a new organization app or system is not fully understanding just how much it can take off my plate. There is a bit of a learning curve as you determine what O can actually do for you, and which features are most helpful to start with. For example, if grocery shopping and meal planning is a big burden, as it is for me with my family of seven with specific dietary needs, it might be most helpful to start with that, especially since the app has a partnership with Instacart. But taking stock of the invisible load is half the battle: What are you doing that you don’t even realize you are doing for your family that someone such as O could actually help with? Marcelo says they are even adding human tutorial meetings to their agenda to further help parents get the most use from the app as possible. One way the app streamlined my own life was through the document uploader. As a new grandmother, Marcelo says her own daughter-in-law came home excited about the plethora of activities available at the community center, but noted they were still in a hard copy booklet. But nobody wants another app with another calendar, so into Ohai it goes. I integrated my Google Calendar with the app with a few clicks, and started uploading various hard copy schedules and documents I needed from my kids’ schools. This quickly reduced the physical clutter on my counters.Related StoryWhat Will It Take to Achieve Household Equality?There are still a few hurdles to work through.As with any organizational solution, there can sometimes be some issues to work through as you get set up and oriented to the app. For example, the app couldn’t find my school’s annual calendar to integrate it into my schedule. Also, you might find out that syncing your systems points out other issues in your organizational life, such as when I started digging and figured out there were problems with my own Google Calendars that I had to work out before trying to integrate them with the app. But, once you're up and running, you can do things like track birthdays and send e-cards, find out the weather and reminders for the day, track to-do lists, and even add “O” to your contacts to talk to her like a real person. Making relief more accessible.Ohai.ai is available for between $10 and $30 per month, depending on the number of accounts and desired features. Marcelo says the pricing was created with an eye on equity, with a goal to “serve every family, including 50K income households.” Just as her own live assistants give her a “sunrise ping” with a preview of the day, she says O can do the same for all families, which inspired the name of the app. Marcelo says as they test and add features, their standard is 95% of the task must be complete-able by AI before launch.
Involving the whole familyIs learning and implementing another app just another task on my plate? Marcelo says the future of Ohai is designed so it doesn’t feel like mom is just doing it all and “nagging everybody.” Instead, she hopes to empower everyone in the household including the kids, so they “learn the behavior as they grow older.” They're soon releasing an octopus mascot, designed by a 14-year-old named Eli. The mascot will be “reminding, chit-chatting, and making it even [more] fun,” she says. “Household management is not all on Mom." They're also planning on having more young kids weigh in and think through the product.Until then, I’ll enjoy the daily reminders of what’s coming up in my own day, the seamless integration with systems I already use, and an encouraging little assistant in my pocket when the load gets heavy.Related StoriesInvisible Labor Might Be Making You DepressedI Got a First Look at Apple's New ProductsYou've Heard of Burnout, But More Parents Are "Rusting" OutAlexandra FrostFreelance WriterAlexandra Frost is a Cincinnati-based freelance journalist and content marketing writer, focusing on health and wellness, parenting, education, and lifestyle.
