Think of all the times a person has to sign their name in their life, and how having fewer letters to write could be an advantage. Shorter names are often easy to pronounce and easy to spell (though not always). And parents don't have to worry about if their baby's name will fit when they get it personalized. Perhaps that's why, even back in 2018, Quartz noted the rise of the four-letter baby name. For families who are on board, these 250 short baby girl names offer some quick-and-sweet inspiration. Some of them rank among the most popular girl names of the year, according to the Social Security Administration (SSA), meaning they're right on-trend. Others are still ranking outside the top 1,000 names, so they're still flying under-the-radar or are not yet overused. Try these on for size, and see how powerful they sound.
Unique Two-Letter Girls' NamesTwo-letter names are a tough sell, to be honest. While there are many two-letter girl names that fit various naming trends—like Io, a Greek mythological name that's also a moon of Jupiter, and the unisex name Jo—none have made it on the SSA's list of the 1,000 most popular baby girl names. (There are two on the list of most popular boys' names—Bo and Ty—that could easily be snatched up for a girl.) Instead, two-letter girl names are most often shortened forms of longer names, like these:AnDiElEmKiLoLuMoRoViRelated StoryI Had Baby Name Regret
Popular Three-Letter Girls' NamesThe shortest girl names that have made the SSA list are at least three letters, which is almost as short as they come. Here's every one that made the top 1,000 this year, in order from most popular to least popular.MiaAvaZoeIvyEvaLiaAdaAnaAmyNoaGiaMyaJoyMaeAriEveAyaIlaLuzSolSkyLeaLivTruEmiSome of these are as trendy as well as popular, landing themselves on the SSA's list of the fastest-climbing names. The most impressive is Emi, which jumped a whopping 143 places in rank between last year and the year before. Luz is right on its tail, hopping up 93 places, followed by Sol (+73), Tru (+74), Aya (+65), Noa (+45), Eve (+30), Lia (+23), Ana (+20), Joy (+12), and Zoe (+7).Rare Three-Letter Girls' NamesThese didn't make the SSA's list of top 1,000 most popular names, so they're good ones to consider for families who want something under-the radar.AliAnnAsh BayBeaDotFayGemIdaIsaJanKayKitLeeLouLuxMaxMayNyxPazPiaPipPoeRae/Ray/ReyRenRioRueSamSiaTajTeoUnaValWynZiaGetty ImagesThe Trendiest Four-Letter Girls' NamesFor many, four letters is the sweet spot: not too short, not too long. There are a lot of four-letter names on the SSA list, and many are climbing the charts at a rapid pace.

The -la names are getting hot, like Xyla and Zyla (Nyla also increased in popularity by 21 places in rank). And Halo is part of a trend of word-name names, like True and Dream, that's just starting to bubble up.Popular Four-Letter Girls' NamesWhile those are the fastest climbers, there are plenty of other four-letter girls' names on the SSA list—this is the rest of them, listed in order of popularity, that haven't been mentioned already.EmmaLuna NoraLilyAriaEllaMilaLucyIslaNovaMayaLeahZoeyRubyAylaIrisEdenLylaJadeAnnaCoraRoseMaryRemiSageJuneAryaRuthKaiaMylaSaraLilaWrenVeraNylaZaraLenaJaneLolaZuriEvieRoryLeiaKaliHopeNinaNavyEsmeTheaRayaLanaMiraAnyaOpalDemiKiraMaiaAlmaElleSkyeLyraKoraCaliKateFayeKylaAliaLexiIylaLinaYaraMaraCleoMinaRheaAbbyMyraMacyRosaRemyRyanHanaKyraLaraAndiNolaMaciAilaErinEliaLoveKoriNayaZoraAyraVadaAyahEttaZoyaDiorLisaKaraUnique Four-Letter Girls' NamesStill bubbling under the radar, these haven't hit the list of the most popular names yet, so your kid will probably get to claim these as their own.AmalArmyAshaCamiCatyClioCocoDedeEchoEdieElmaEmmeEnyaGaiaGigiGishGinaHeroHudaInesIvieJeanJunoLakeLarkLeyaLoisLuluMikaMimiMonaNavaNeelNilaNourOrlaRenéRiniRitaSabaSajaSheaSisuSnowStarSukiTaraTessTinaTroiUtahVaroVegaVidaXenaYanaYuanYukiMore Girls' NamesLooking for more baby-name inspiration?
