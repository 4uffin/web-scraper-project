Millions have said goodbye to their native countries and embarked on a journey to create a new life in "the land of opportunity." Today, 62.1 million Hispanics make up the largest minority group in the U.S., accounting for roughly 19% of the nation's total population. To honor and pay tribute to all of the contributions Hispanic-Americans have given to the United States — and the world — we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month.Originally established as Hispanic Heritage Week by Rep. Edward R. Roybal and President Lyndon Johnson in 1968, the now month-long tribute is observed from September 15 to October 15 each year and commemorates those in the U.S. whose ancestors came from more than a dozen countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Spain, Uruguay and Venezuela.Because the term Hispanic specifically refers to Spanish-speaking countries and the territory of Puerto Rico, there are those calling for the celebration to be renamed Latinx Heritage Month, which includes people who speak indigenous languages as well as Brazilians who speak Portuguese. While the debate over the name continues, what is unquestionable is the power and resilience of the Hispanic, Latinx and Latino-identified people. From Grammy-winning artist Bad Bunny to the creative mind of Guillermo del Toro and trailblazing actress Rita Moreno, many have made a name for themselves in Hollywood. Off-screen, changes have been made possible with the help of important figures in government like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. But this month isn't just about the names we know — it's about all Hispanic people who have contributed to our society, in big and small ways, in the past, present and those who will do so in the future.We invite you to learn more about what makes this 30-day celebration so meaningful. Together, we can all show our love to the Hispanic, Latino and Latinx communities in this country, each and every day.Learn What Is Hispanic Heritage Month?Read NowWhat Does Latinx Mean?Read NowWhat Is the Difference Between Hispanic, Latino and Spanish?Read NowFamous Hispanic People to Learn More About Read NowLatina Actresses Who Are Proving the Importance of Latinx Culture in HollywoodRead NowWatchIncredible Spanish-Language Movies on Amazon PrimeRead nowIMDBAmazing Latinx Movies on Netflix Read NowIMDBMust-See Spanish-Language Movies on NetflixRead NowIMDBSpanish-Language Netflix Shows to Watch ASAPRead NowIMDBLatinx Documentaries You Need to Stream Read NowIMDBRead and ListenBooks by Latinx Authors to Add to Your List Read NowPublishersSpanish-Language Books to Broaden Your PerspectiveRead NowpublishersExciting Spanish and Latinx Podcasts Read Nowcourtesy of podcastsApps to Help You Learn Spanish at Every LevelRead Nowcourtesy of appsCelebrateTraditional Hispanic Foods to Try NowRead NowMike GartenHispanic Heritage Month Activities to Help You CelebrateRead NowDelicious Hispanic Desserts for Any CelebrationRead NowMike Garten, Jonny ValiantLatin American Comfort Food Recipes That Are a Must to MakeREAD NOW Mike GartenSupportLatinx Beauty Brands to Shop Read Nowcourtesy of brandsLatinx-Owned Businesses to KnowRead Nowcourtesy of brandsLatinx-Owned Etsy Shops We LoveRead Nowcourtesy of brandsAmazing Latinx-Owned Food Brands Read Nowcourtesy of brandsLatinx-Owned Wellness Brands to TryRead Nowcourtesy of brandsLatinx-Owned Fashion Brands to Add to Your ClosetRead NowCourtesy of brandsTop Gifts from Hispanic and Latinx-Owned BrandsRead NowCourtesy of brandsSelena BarrientosEntertainment & News EditorSelena is the entertainment and news editor for Good Housekeeping, where she covers the latest on TV, movies and celebrities.
