Whether your home has drafty spots or you’re someone who always feels a little chilly, a space heater can help you stay warm without having to heat the entire house. Some are small enough to move from room to room, while others are better suited for heating larger spaces like bedrooms or basements.At the Good Housekeeping Institute, our engineers and analysts lab test a wide range of HVAC essentials, from air purifiers to humidifiers and now space heaters. We look at how quickly they heat up a room, how easy they are to use, how much noise they make, and how safe they are to operate. After hands-on testing and reviewing feedback from real users, these are the best space heaters we recommend for keeping your home comfortable.
Best Deal Vornado MVH Vortex Heater $70$35NOW50%OFFJUMP TO REVIEW1Best Overall Vornado MVH Vortex Heater$1 at Amazon$60 at Wayfair$70 at Lowe'sCredit: Dan DiClerico / Good Housekeeping ProsPowerful heat output with three settings Compact, space-saving designQuickly and quietly heats up spaces, according to online reviewersPortable ConsPotential reliability issues over years of useSmall but mighty, we found that this top-rated space heater can circulate warm air throughout a room in minutes. It features three heat settings (750 watt, 1125 watt, and 1500 watt) so you can control just how much heat output you need. We also love that it's packed with a number of safety features. The case stays cool to the touch, and a wide base helps prevent it from being knocked over. If it does get tipped over (or if it starts to overheat), it will automatically shut off. A built-in carrying handle makes it easy to take the heater with you throughout your home, and our pros love that it's whisper-quiet. One customer said it's "the quietest forced-air heater I've come across." Other online reviewers loved how effectively the Vornado space heater warms up large rooms, which is impressive given its compact design and the fact that it's only advertised for medium-sized rooms. Though some users complained of reliability issues after using the unit for years, in our testing, we found Vornado's customer service to be extremely responsive, and your purchase comes with a five-year warranty should anything go wrong.

Despite being one of the smallest and most inexpensive options we evaluated, the Atom 316 has one of the widest feature sets—including an adjustable thermostat—and packs as much heating power as models that cost over three times as much.During extensive tests in the GH Home Improvement & Outdoor Lab, the heater raised the temperature of a medium-sized room by 7°F in just 30 minutes on maximum power. At its maximum setting, the sound level was 47.9 decibels from 6 inches away—about as quiet as a typical home refrigerator. It’s also loaded with safety features, including a cool-to-the-touch exterior, an automatic timer, and tip-over protection. To prevent overheating, the fan even runs for 30 seconds after the heater shuts off.The only potential negative pointed out by testers is that the heater’s touch-sensitive buttons may be difficult for some users to locate or identify since they're not backlit and lack tactile feedback.Heat settings3Thermostat41-95 °F (In 1°F Increments)Heating elementElectricWeight3.83 lbsDimensions6.02" x 6.02" x 9.64"Advertisement - Continue Reading Below3Best Safety FeaturesGood Housekeeping Oscillating Ceramic Tower Space Heater $71 at Amazon$67 at Wayfair$71 at WalmartPros Equipped with all essential safety featuresSpace-saving designFeatures a 12-hour timerConsA bit noisy at its highest fan speed When our team set about developing a Good Housekeeping-branded space heater, safety was every bit as important as heat output. The result: this 30-inch oscillating ceramic space heater with all the safety stops, like overheat protection with automatic shut-off, cool-touch housing, and a tip-over safety switch. “You still need to follow every safety precaution, including keeping any flammable objects at least three feet from the heater,” said Good Housekeeping's Home Improvement & Outdoor Director, Dan DiClerico. “But when used properly, the heater will keep you safe and cozy in spaces up to 200 square feet.”The Good Housekeeping tower space heater was also designed with convenience and usability in mind. The remote control lets you operate it from the sofa or bed, while the 12-hour timer is good for programming the machine to turn off after a set period. And while the 30-inch-tall heater throws plenty of warm air, its footprint is just 8 square inches, so it won’t take up too much floor space. The one drawback is at the highest speed the fan noise can be a bit loud.Heat settings2ThermsotatExact numerical temperatureHeating elementCeramicWeight4.56 lbsDimensions8" x 8" x 31"4Most StylishLasko Artisan Series$68 at Amazon$112 $70 at Walmart$68 at Home DepotProsStylish modern designFast, even heatingEasy-to-use controlsConsLimited color optionsThe Lasko Artisan Series offers a smart blend of style and performance. With its sleek black ceramic tower and light wood base, it looks more like a decorative piece than a typical space heater. It’s compact, easy to place in any room, and designed to warm up larger spaces like bedrooms, home offices, and living rooms. Despite its small footprint, it delivers powerful, consistent heat thanks to its 1500-watt output and widespread oscillation.In lab testing, this model stood out for how quickly and evenly it warmed up a room. It includes key safety features like overheat protection, tip-over protection, and a cool-touch housing, all of which meet the safety standards our experts look for. One tester noted how quickly the unit reached the set temperature and appreciated the built-in thermostat, saying it could help reduce heating costs during colder months by maintaining the right level of warmth without running constantly.The controls are straightforward, with a large digital display and two comfort heat settings that are easy to adjust. A six-function remote makes it even more convenient, letting you control everything from across the room. Testers also liked that the unit comes fully assembled and is easy to move from one space to another. Such a stylish unit would look great in other colors, but it's only available in black. With reliable performance, useful features, and a look that complements modern decor, this heater is a strong option for anyone looking to warm up their space without relying on central heat.Heat settings2ThermostatAutoEco thermostat that maintains your set temperatureHeating elementCeramicWeight5.1 lbsDimensions16" × 6.75" × 6.75"Advertisement - Continue Reading Below5Best TabletopLasko Ellipse Ceramic Tabletop Heater$65 at Amazon$70 at WalmartProsFast and even heatCompact and lightweightMultiple heat and fan settingsConsNot ideal for large spacesThe Lasko Ellipse Ceramic Heater is a strong performer in a compact, lightweight frame. Weighing just over three pounds, it’s easy to move from room to room and fits neatly on a table, desk, or shelf. Its curved design feels more intentional than most small heaters, and the wide grill paired with 120-degree oscillation allows it to push heat evenly across a medium-sized room. During testing, our engineers noted that this model “packs impressive heat output in a compact housing,” making it a great pick for bedrooms, home offices, or smaller living spaces.Testers appreciated how quickly it starts up and how simple it is to control. The top-mounted buttons are intuitive and visible from above, which makes setup and adjustment more user-friendly. One tester shared, “It starts up and gets hot immediately. The oscillation is a great feature.” Another noted, “It’s compact, reasonably attractive, lightweight, and effective. I like that it has three heat settings and two fan settings.” In addition to the customizable heat options, the unit includes a 12-hour timer, AutoEco energy-saving mode, and a seven-function remote control with onboard storage.Safety and quiet operation are also key benefits. The heater runs under 40 decibels, so it won’t disrupt sleep or work. It includes overheat protection, a tip-over switch, a child lock, and cool-touch housing for added peace of mind. While this model scores high in performance and features, its small size means it’s not intended for heating large rooms.

It comes with low-heat, high-heat, and fan settings, and we found it to be lightweight enough, at just over 3 pounds, to carry from the bedroom to the bathroom to the kitchen and back with no hassle. Plus, there's a built-in handle to make it even easier.Many users set this space heater up on a countertop so they don't need to bend down when they're ready to move it to another room or adjust temperature settings. Other online reviewers reported keeping a Lasko space heater at their work desk. One thing to note: This electric heater doesn't come with an auto-shut-off safety feature like some of our other top recommendations, so you'll want to keep an eye on the machine when it's on.Heat settings3ThermostatRelative temperature settings 1–11Heating elementCeramicWeight3.18 lbsDimensions9.2" x 7" x 6"Advertisement - Continue Reading Below7Best Hybrid Dyson HP07 Purifier Hot + Cool FanNow 11% Off$619 $550 at Amazon$750 at Wayfair$750 $550 at DysonCredit: DysonProsPurifies air while it heats or cools10 heat settings Wi-Fi-enabled to work with Dyson app or Alexa, Siri, and Google HomeFeatures digital displayRemote included ConsExpensiveHeavyThough it may be the priciest unit on this list, this premium three-in-one appliance from Dyson is a space heater, a fan, and an air purifier, so you can use it year-round. Not only is it able to warm up cold rooms, but it can provide some much-needed breeze in the summer. Even better, it helps purify the air no matter what mode it's in. The sealed HEPA filter channels hot or cold air into the room, all while removing common allergens, including dust, smoke, pollen, and dander. The heat function is controlled by a thermostat, so you can choose the exact temperature you want. In the automatic setting, the fan will kick into high gear until your desired temperature is reached and then will quiet back down to maintain your ideal environment. It's also safe: The fan is bladeless, and there are no visible heating elements. Plus, the Dyson will automatically shut off when tipped over. We also like that while a remote is provided, you can use the MyDyson app to control your air quality or voice assistants such as Alexa, Siri, and Google for quick, hands-free adjustments. A digital display shows you the air quality at a glance, among other settings like fan speed. Just keep in mind that at over 10 pounds, it's not the easiest space heater to move around.

Remote not included For a more discreet electric space heater that can blend right into a wall, look no further than this model from DeLonghi. At just 3 inches deep but 32 inches wide, it can replace a radiator to warm up a space as large as 300 square feet, like a bedroom or basement. Just note that the air blows out the sides, so you'll need to have a little extra space around the heater for proper airflow. You can set the space heater on the floor or use the included mounting kit to hang it up to save floor space. One online reviewer said it's the only heat source she uses to get through the winter in her South Carolina home, while others loved its attractive design, compact size, and efficiency. Though it's larger and heavier than other models we've tried and doesn't come with a remote, it's a great semi-permanent solution and one that's impressively quiet. It also has a 24-hour timer so you can program it to shut off when no longer needed.It includes safety features like tip-over protection and auto-shut-off should it overheat. We appreciate that it'll automatically turn on if the ambient temperature dips below 41°F, to prevent pipes or plants from freezing.Heat settings3ThermostatRelative temperature settings 1–6Heating elementMetalWeight29 lbsDimensions26.9" x 3.5" x 18.1"Advertisement - Continue Reading Below9Best Retro-Looking Vornado VHEAT Vintage Metal Heater$160 at Amazon$144 at Wayfair$170 at Lowe'sCredit: VornadoProsSleek, vintage design available in green or white Warms a room quicklyAirflow angle is easy to adjustConsAll-metal design is heavy, so best left in one spotOnly two heat settingsWe love this space heater for its vintage appeal with modern engineering that quickly and safely heats a room. This one, inspired by a classic 1945 design, is available in green or white and has tip-over protection should you knock it over, as well as an automatic shut-off feature should it get too warm. Though we wish it offered more heat settings, we found that this space heater is the perfect size to place by your bed or desk. The fan tips up and down so you can adjust the heat to flow right where you want it. But because it's all metal and a bit heavy for its size, it's best to choose a place of honor for it and leave it there.Heat settings2ThermostatRelative temperature settings 1–10Heating elementMetalWeight9.05 lbsDimensions8.7" x 11" x 13.7"How we test space heatersThe engineers and product analysts at the Good Housekeeping Institute have researched, reviewed, and tested more than 24 space heaters in the past five years. To find the best ones on the market, our pros evaluate space heaters for ease of use, performance, and safety in temperature-controlled rooms. When evaluating ease of use, we assess how easy space heaters are to set up and operate and whether manuals are readable and easy to understand. We also consider each space heater’s weight and any features that improve or hinder its portability.To analyze performance, each space heater is evaluated for how effectively it heats up a 50°F area in a 90-minute time interval while we monitor temperature, electrical usage (wattage), heat distribution, and noise levels. We also consider extra features such as adjustable thermostats and the number of heat settings. Lastly, we review the safety of each space heater during use and foreseeable misuse by testing a unit’s stability, automatic tip-over, shut-off protection, surface temperature, flammability, safety sensors, and more.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWhat to look for when shopping for the best space heaterWhen shopping for space heaters you’ll come across a variety of options. Here's what to look out for:✔️ Type: Space heaters use a heating element to operate, and there are three main types to choose from with various pros and cons.Fan heaters use a metal coil as their heating element. An internal fan blows hot air from the coil into the room. “Fan heaters deliver solid heat distribution, but they’re noisy, especially on the highest fan settings,” said Good Housekeeping’s Home Improvement & Outdoor Lab Director Dan DiClerico.Ceramic heaters are like fan heaters, except that they use ceramic plates instead of metal coils. The plates heat up very quickly as electricity passes through them, and a fan distributes the air into the room. “These are effective and inexpensive, but also on the noisy side,” DiClerico said.Infrared heaters use radiant heat that instantly warms up objects and people, rather than the air in the room. “That makes them quiet and energy efficient, but they’re not the best at heating large spaces,” said DiClerico.✔️ Size: Space heaters range from smaller, spot-heating units that take about 15 minutes to properly kick in, or larger units that are best for heating a bedroom or living room. Smaller units are likely to be lighter and more portable, so you can move them around your home, while larger units are heavier and best kept in a permanent location.✔️ Features: Look for a thermostat with multiple settings so you can choose between low, medium, or high heat. You can also consider one with an eco setting to save electricity (for instance, overnight), or one with an adjustable thermostat that allows you to choose a specific temperature. Your space heater should also have a timer to save energy when it’s not in use, a remote control, portability features such as a handle or wheels to make moving it around easier and, of course, key safety features.✔️ Safety: As with any electrical device, space heaters can be dangerous, and you should look for one that has been vetted by a third-party safety certification such as UL or ETL. Features such as automatic shut-off in case of overheating, a programmable timer, tip-over protection, and an adjustable thermostat are important to have. Never use your space heater with an extension cord; always place it on the floor for stability, and if you notice any signs of damage to power cords, immediately stop using the space heater.Are space heaters energy efficient? If you want to keep costs at a minimum, it’s important to find an energy-efficient space heater that uses the least amount of electricity possible. “Because they run electricity, space heaters tend to be fairly expensive to operate, especially if you live in a state with high electricity rates,” said DiClerico. “That said, you can lower your total energy costs this winter by using a space heater to warm frequently occupied rooms and turning the central heat down in the rest of the house.” When shopping for an energy-efficient space heater, DiClerico suggested a few tips. First, find a space heater with multiple output settings (low, medium, high). “This lets you choose the lowest possible setting to keep the room cozy,” he shared. You should also consider a space heater that features a built-in timer. “Timers can save energy by programming the heater to turn off when it’s no longer needed,” he said. For instance, you can set your bedroom space heater to shut off after an hour; this way, you’re warmed up as you drift off to sleep, but not overheating in the middle of the night when you may not need as much warmth.
