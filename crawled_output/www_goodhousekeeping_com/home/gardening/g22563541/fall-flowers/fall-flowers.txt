The only thing that can make that even better? Being surrounded by the best fall flowers. To set your fall garden up for success, it's always a good idea to start early. Some of our favorite fall blooms (think chrysanthemums, marigolds and salvias) can be planted mid to late-August, meaning you might want to start mapping out how you want your yard to look beforehand. If you're a beginner plant parent, be sure to review the USDA's Plant Hardiness Zones for more information on what and when to plant based on your geographic location. Depending on where you're located, there might be different recommendations for certain flowers. Keep scrolling for our top picks, ranging from popular perennial flowers (think hydrangea) to vibrant annuals like black-eyed Susans.1CaryopterisimageBROKER/Jürgen Pfeiffer//Getty ImagesAs a late summer to early fall bloomer, Caryopteris are ideal autumn flowers for USDA zones 5-9. Plus, they're a great choice for a pollinator garden, as they attract bees, butterflies and other insects. SHOP CARYOPTERIS2SalviaPakin Songmor//Getty ImagesAvailable in a range of colors, salvias can spruce up any autumn garden. In USDA zones 7 and warmer, salvias can be planted in August and still establish root before the cold weather kicks in, making them the perfect fall flower. However, if you live in a colder area, you may want to plant them a little earlier, or take them inside if frost comes early.

They like full sun and can withstand heat, making them a good pick if you live in an area where scorching summers can extend into the fall (looking at you, Texas!). SHOP NOW8Violas Ali Majdfar//Getty ImagesThese perennials bloom in the summer and return in the fall to add purple pops to your warm-toned garden. They're fast-growing and the flowers are edible, too. Violas like moist and acidic soil, so a peat-based potting mix or adding peat moss into their soil is best for them. SHOP NOWAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below9Petunias Clive Nichols//Getty ImagesPetunias are one of the most popular flowers for gardens because of their long flowering period: from spring until frost! They're great for hanging baskets — just know that they need full sun so they won't do well in the shade of a porch. Petunia seeds are very small, almost resembling dust, so it might be easier to get a start from a nursery.

New flowers grow over the old blooms so they always look freshly bloomed too. They bloom best in full sun. SHOP NOW14StrawflowerJacky Parker Photography//Getty ImagesThe bright yellow, button-shaped blooms are nearly as beautiful as the silvery-green foliage. This pick is perfect for hanging baskets, where both the blooms and the stems can be displayed. Though they can tolerate partial shade, they won't bloom as much as full sun exposure.
