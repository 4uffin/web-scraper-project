Leaf vacuums are versatile tools that make yard cleanup easy, sucking up leaves from tight spots and mulching them to reduce waste. For those who prefer bagging over blowing leaves, the mulching function speeds up the process, even for large piles. With options ranging from handheld models for small spaces to powerful gas units for large yards, shopping for a leaf vacuum can almost be as overwhelming as raking leaves manually. The Good Housekeeping Institute Home Improvement and Outdoor Lab evaluated over 20 models, assessing performance, ease of use, durability and noise to find the best fit for every homeowner’s needs and budget.

Our reviewsBEST OVERALLWorx TRIVAC 3-in-1 Electric Leaf Blower/Mulcher/Vacuum$100 at Amazon$100 at Lowe's$95 at Home DepotProsCombines vacuuming, blowing and mulchingExcellent air speedLarge 10-gallon reusable bag minimizes emptying frequencyMetal impeller ensures long-lasting performanceConsCorded design restricts its use to areas within reach of an electrical outletType: Corded electric | Air flow: 350 CFM | Air speed: 210 MPH | Weight: 9.3 lbs | Bag size: 10.5 gallons | Noise rating: Not listed
Our experts like the versatility of the corded-electric Worx Trivac, a powerful three-in-one blower, vacuum and mulcher that handles each task with ease and efficiency. With an impressive air speed of 210 miles per hour, this leaf blower quickly and efficiently clears away even the toughest leaves and debris. In our testing, it was particularly adept at scarfing up leaf fragments and other small debris.
While it's also very quiet, the big downside is the cord, which is a nuisance to drag around and also means you'll need an exterior-grade extension cord if you have a large yard.
The Worx's metal impeller ensures long-lasting performance and has an 18:1 reduction ratio, meaning it can mulch 18 bags of leaves down to one. This model also comes with a 10-gallon reusable collection bag.
WHAT TESTERS SAID: "I like that it's equipped with an on-board conversion switch, so that you can flip between functions quickly and without the hassle of separate tubes and attachments," said one tester, who used the Worx over several weeks at her home.
She noted that the angled end of the vacuum tube was helpful for sucking leaves from gutters and other hard-to-reach places.

Like its cold-weather brand mate Snow Joe, whose snow blowers we've also tested, Sun Joe has established itself as a value-driven name in outdoor power equipment that often punches above its weight. In fact, this budget-friendly, three-in-one leaf vacuum, blower and mulcher performed as well as some models costing two and three times as much in testing.
The device's 12-amp motor blows up to 250 miles per hour with six adjustable speeds so you can tailor it to various tasks. We found that the Sun Joe's front wheels provided smooth handling and stability, even on uneven terrain, and we also appreciated its durable metal shredding blade, which ensures thorough mulching performance.
WHAT TESTERS SAID: Though the manufacturer doesn't list its noise rating, testers found the motor on the Sun Joe to be relatively quiet. Testers also reported that it's easy to switch between modes. One downside: Because it requires continuous trigger pressure, testers found it could lead to hand and finger fatigue during extended use.BEST FOR SMALL YARDSToro Ultra Electric Blower VacNow 21% Off$127 $100 at Amazon$100 at Lowe's$103 at Home DepotProsLightweight and easy to maneuver and handleAdjustable speed settingsImpressive 16:1 mulching ratio for the priceConsTransitioning between blower to vacuum isn’t as intuitive as other optionsType: Corded electric | Air flow: 405 CFM | Air speed: 260 MPH | Weight: 8.5 lbs | Bag size: Not listed | Noise rating: Not listed
An easy-to-use and relatively affordable option, this Toro is a plug-in leaf vacuum that scored points with our testers for its combination of power and lightweight design.
The tool’s 16:1 shredding ratio produced small, easily decomposing leaf mulch for composting or mulching. Plus, our experts like the variable speed control, which seamlessly allows you to adjust the power in both vacuuming and blowing modes.
But you will need to contend with the power cord, plus the added cost of an exterior-grade extension cord if you have a lot of ground to cover, which means it's best for smaller yards.
WHAT TESTERS SAID: "It's a great choice for homeowners with small- to mid-size yards," said one tester, who noted that it gathered and removed leaves quickly. Testers reported that this device was also easy to operate, thanks to its push-button electric start and quick-release latch that lets you switch from blowing to vacuuming without tools.BEST CORDLESSRyobi 40V Cordless Leaf Blower/Mulcher/VacuumShop at Amazon$459 $299 at Home DepotProsLarge 10.5-gallon leaf bagHas a long 18-minute runtime and two rechargeable batteries included20-to-1 mulching ratio is industry-leadingConsMore expensive than most on the marketType: Battery-powered | Air flow: 600 CFM | Air speed: 100 MPH | Weight: 15.2 lbs | Bag size: 10.5 gallons | Noise rating: Not listed
If you have a lot of leaves to sweep up, Ryobi's 40-volt cordless leaf vacuum is a great pick, thanks to its massive 600 CFMs of vacuum power and its ample 10.5-gallon bag. The Ryobi also has an industry-best 20-to-1 mulching ratio, which means it's excellent at reducing leaves to a fine matter, getting the most capacity out of every bagful.
It converts from vacuum to blower mode with the turn of a knob on the main handle, but you'll also need to switch attachments, so it's not the most convertible combo we tested.
The Ryobi is also on the expensive side, but it's important to note that the kit includes a pair of 4.0 Ah batteries, which together delivered more than 30 minutes of runtime in our tests, even when operating the variable speed motor at full tilt.
WHAT TESTERS SAID: "The one drawback is the metal impeller was a little more prone to jamming when sucking up harder stuff like twigs," said GH Institute Test Engineer Alec Scherma. "But this is the perfect vacuum if you're primarily clearing a lot of loose leaves from your lawn."BEST CORDLESS UNDER $250Greenworks Cordless Blower Vacuum$189 at Amazon$47 $33 at NordstromShop at WalmartProsBattery-operated for free range of motionDoubles as a leaf blowerLightest on our listConsNot as easy to switch from vacuum to blowerType: Battery-powered | Air flow: 340 CFM | Air speed: 185 MPH | Weight: 5.6 lbs | Bag size: 10.5 gallons | Noise rating: 70 dBOur experts have been testing Greenworks products for the better part of a decade and we've come to know the brand as a leader in battery-powered outdoor equipment. This cordless leaf vacuum is another example, with its combination of reliability and performance.Though the air flow isn't as powerful as with gas or corded-electric devices, this battery-operated model allows you to clear and remove leaves unrestricted by a cord, plus it's extremely lightweight which reduces arm fatigue. WHAT TESTERS SAID: Our engineers say the brushless motor should deliver a long runtime and improved torque, while also reducing strain and extending the vacuum's lifespan. Though the device can convert from a vacuum to a blower, it uses separate tubes for each function, so it's not as easy as flipping a switch, the way you can with other top picks.BEST GAS-POWEREDHusqvarna Gas Blower Vacuum$249 at Amazon$400 at Lowe's$598 $544 at WalmartCredit: HusqvarnaProsEasily switches between leaf blowing, vacuuming and mulchingVariable speed controlEasy-start system on boardConsNoisier operation than electric modelsType: Gas-powered | Air flow: 425 CFM | Air speed: 170 MPH | Weight: 9.6 lbs | Bag size: 14.4 gallons | Noise rating: 109 dBIf you don't want the hassle of cords, a gas-powered leaf blower can be a good way to go, especially if you're also looking for maximum power. This Husqvarna gas-powered leaf vacuum can move a lot of air in a hurry — 425 cubic feet per minute at a speed of 170 miles per hour. The lightweight construction and ergonomic design maximize comfort and control, while the quick-start system ensures you don't have to continuously pull a string starter to the point of exhaustion. Just be prepared for the noisier operation, which is loud enough that you'll want to wear ear protection.WHAT TESTERS SAID: Our experts say it should perform capably whether you set it to vacuum, blow or mulch leaves and other yard debris. Since it has a 16:1 mulch ratio, it can grind up leaves and other debris in tiny fragments to store in its included collection bag.BEST BACKPACK-STYLECraftsman 3-in-1 Leaf Blower, Vacuum and MulcherShop at Amazon$100 at Lowe's$121 $80 at WalmartProsEasily switches between leaf blowing, vacuuming and mulchingComfortable and ergonomicOffers outstanding performance for the priceConsImpeller is made from less-durable plasticType: Corded electric | Air flow: 450 CFM | Air speed: 260 MPH | Weight: 11.3 lbs | Bag size: Not listed | Noise rating: 55 dB
Traditional leaf vacuums often come with satchel-style leaf bags, which can be uncomfortable and heavy to carry, especially when filled with wet leaves. So, if your yard has a lot of leafy trees, a backpack-style model can make cleanup jobs much more comfortable. This Craftsman leaf vacuum comes equipped with a reliable 12-amp motor and functions as a powerful blower and mulcher, offering outstanding performance for the price.
With an air volume of 450 CFM and a 260-mile-per-hour airspeed, it's more powerful than other backpack-style blowers and quieter. However, the impeller is made from plastic, so it may not prove to be as durable over time. Regardless, we think its overall performance and comfortable backpack-style design makes it worth considering.
WHAT TESTERS SAID:
Its mulching system helps reduce the volume of waste for an efficient cleanup. However, the collection bag requires unzipping to empty, which means it's prone to occasional jams.BEST WALK-BEHINDTroy-Bilt Gas-Powered Chipper Shredder Vacuum$899 at Home Depot$387 $274 at herbalmena.comProsAlso functions as a wood chipper and shredderGood for large properties ConsRequires much more storage spaceExpensiveType: Gas-powered | Air flow: Not listed | Air speed: Not listed | Weight: 125 lbs | Bag size: 18 gallons | Noise rating: Not listed
Take one look and you can see right away that walk-behind leaf vacuums are a different breed of lawn care equipment. This one from Troy-Bilt adds in a chipper and a shredder, nice if you live on a large property with a lot of trees and fallen branches. It uses a different engine than gas leaf blowers, which is why the manufacturer doesn't list air speed and flow.
But make no mistake: Weighing in at 116 pounds, this walk-behind leaf vacuum is a lot of lawn gear, so it’s difficult to store and may be hard for some to push. If you want to lessen the load, we suggest paying a little extra for the self-propelled model.
WHAT TESTERS SAID: Our experts are impressed by the specs, starting with the 24-inch-wide vacuum head, which helps you cover a lot of ground fast during the leafiest weeks of fall. The 7-foot vacuum hose is helpful for sucking up smaller leaves and twigs from under bushes. It also has a generously sized 18-gallon collection bag, so you won’t have to empty it as frequently.
RELATED: The Best Wood ChippersHow we testedOpen GalleryOur product experts in the Good Housekeeping Institute Home Improvement and Outdoor Lab began their research by surveying the marketplace to identify top-selling leaf vacuums readily available in stores and online. (We also attend trade shows and industry events like the Equip Exposition to stay informed on the latest advancements in lawn and yard care.) From there, we focused on brands that have consistently excelled and demonstrated reliability throughout our years of testing, while also considering newer brands offering unique features or innovations.Following an in-depth review of technical specifications, our experts selected various models for hands-on testing, which starts in our Lab, where we assess ease of assembly, construction quality, convenience features and more. Then, some of our experts take the leaf vacuums home to evaluate them in real-world yard conditions.Performance testing emphasizes how quickly and thoroughly each model clears small leaf piles in the yard and, where applicable, from gutters. We also assess usability, such as ease of attaching and detaching the collection bag, control intuitiveness, battery runtime for cordless models and motor noise levels.What to look for when shoppingWhen choosing the best leaf vacuum for your needs, there are a few key factors to consider. Whether or not the vacuum also functions as a leaf blower or mulcher, it's essential to look at the power source, the size and design of the collection bag, as well as its weight and durability.✔️ Power type: Leaf vacuum engines can be battery-powered, gas-powered or corded electric. The power type that is best for you depends largely on the size of the project.Battery-powered leaf vacuums offer cordless operation and they're also the quietest. Thanks to improvements in battery technology, they're also nearly as powerful as gas machines.Gas-powered leaf vacuums still tend to be the most powerful but they are also louder, more difficult to start and require extra care maintenance, including mixing the oil and gas.Electric leaf vacuums have a cord that restricts mobility but ensures an unlimited runtime.✔️ Collection bag form and size: Some leaf vacuums feature backpack-style collection bags with higher capacity, while others have bags attached below the engine. For mulching vacuums, check the reduction ratio to see how much debris the bag can hold — for instance, a 10:1 ratio fits 100 gallons of dry leaves into a 10-gallon bag. Collection bags may be reusable or disposable.✔️ Convertibility: For an all-in-one tool to tackle leaves and debris, consider a model that converts between blowing, vacuuming and mulching. Check how easily it switches functions — some have a simple switch, while others require changing tubes or nozzles. Although more effort, our tests show that models with separate attachments often perform better in both vacuuming and blowing.✔️ Weight: Most leaf vacuums are handheld and lightweight, ideal for minor clean-ups. For heavy-duty tasks, more powerful vacuums may be heavier and harder to maneuver. Models as light as 5 pounds work for light debris, but for larger jobs, expect a 10-pound machine or heavier, as these are typically more durable and effective for extensive yard cleanup.How leaf vacuum power is measuredThere are a few factors involved. If the equipment has a mulching mode, you'll also want to pay attention to its claimed capacity.Cubic feet per minute (CFM): The power of a leaf vacuum is partly determined by the air flow, or how much air it is able to take in, which is measured in cubic feet per minute. The higher the CFM, the more air it can take in. The most powerful vacuums have 400 CFMs and up.Miles per hour (MPH): Then there's air speed, i.e. how quickly a lead vacuum takes in air, which is measured in miles per hour. Above 200 MPH is ideal.Mulcher reduction ratio: This is the ratio between the number of bags of leaves that the vacuum encountered and the number of bags that the leaves were reduced to through mulching. Most mulchers have a reduction ratio of either 10:1 or 16:1.Why trust Good Housekeeping?
