They thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, making them a low maintenance pick for beginner gardeners and pros alike. While mums aren't too picky in terms of care requirements, they do have certain preferences when it comes to their garden neighbors—both flowers and veggies. "If you're growing food at home, mums can be good companion plants for a lot of different vegetables. They'll help keep some pests away from your veggies," says Lindsey Chastain, founder of The Waddle and Cluck, a homesteading blog.We spoke to gardening pros to learn more about the best companion plants for mums—plus what not to plant nearby—for a successful, colorful fall garden. Read on for tasty veggies and beautiful blooms that benefit from being planted alongside mums.1TomatoesSusumu Yoshioka//Getty ImagesMix and match flowers and veggies this fall for pairings that are both aesthetically pleasing and mutually beneficial. "Tomatoes benefit from the pest deterring properties of mums. They have similar soil and sun requirements, so they make great companions," says Chastain.RELATED: 14 Perfect Companion Plants for Tomatoes2Marigoldswulingyun//Getty ImagesMarigolds and mums make for a visually appealing pair. "Both repel similar pests which make them great for porches. Their blooms will pop at the same time and they look beautiful in combination. Mums are taller than marigolds, so you can put the mums right behind them for a cool layered look," says Chastain.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below3SquashAna Rocio Garcia Franco//Getty ImagesAnother veggie that benefits from nearby mums? Squash. "Squash love being near mums because mums deter squash bugs. Choose upright mums to plant," says Chastain.4Ornamental GrassGrace Cary//Getty ImagesOrnamental grasses like Panicum or Chasmanthium latifolium create a natural barrier when planted near mums. "They provide the all-important clouds between the mums—and soften any feeling of formality," says Sarah Raven, author of the forthcoming A Year of Cut Flowers.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below5PansiesMimi Ditchie Photography//Getty ImagesCreate a fuller look in your fall garden by pairing mums with pansies. "Pansies thrive near mums in the fall. Both flowers can even tolerate a light frost. The pansies will fill in some of the gaps around the mums and make your beds look lush and full," says Chastain.6CauliflowerPhoto by Cathy Scola//Getty ImagesCauliflower and other plants in the Brassicaceae family—think broccoli, kale, and cabbage—like living alongside mums as they help deter cabbage worms.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below7Salviaswulingyun//Getty ImagesMix in salvias for more vertical height in your garden this fall. "They are brilliantly late and long-flowering to coincide with the mums. Go for a whopper such as Amistad or more compact varieties to tuck into the mums skirts like Cero Potosi," says Raven.8ViolasT. I. / 500px//Getty ImagesAnother colorful addition, violas work similarly to pansies when planted near mums. "They'll fill in those gaps as they trail and spread. You can also plant violas and mums in a container," says Chastain.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below9PeppersPramote Polyamate//Getty ImagesSimilar to tomatoes, peppers like to live alongside mums for their pest-deterring qualities. Plus, mums actually attract insects that are beneficial to peppers, making it a win-win.10HeleniumsHelaine Weide//Getty ImagesMums and heleniums share similar growing conditions, making them a great garden duo. "I love to grow and pick mums with Heleniums—given the Chelsea chop—to ensure later flowering. Go for a rusty color like the stellar, traditional Moorhead Beauty," says Raven.Advertisement - Continue Reading Below11What NOT to Plant With MumsSince mums love the sun, experts don't recommend planting any flowers or veggies that prefer full shade nearby. There are also a few other plants you should avoid growing near mums:Peas and beans: "The mums will pull too many of the nutrients from the soil and the peas and beans won't grow well—same with plants that need a lot of water like lettuce. Mums don't like as much water as lettuce, so the mums may not thrive," says Chastain.Hostas and ferns: Like lettuce, hostas, and ferns need a lot of water compared to mums. These differing care requirements make for a more difficult pairing.Dahlias: "Avoid anything too rigid and static such as dahlias. They tell too much of the same visual story and compete rather than enhance each other," says Raven.Roses: "Roses are also a no for living next door to mums. They like to suck up all the nutrients in the soil," says Chastain.Laura MillarAssistant Lifestyle EditorLaura Millar (she/her) is the assistant lifestyle editor for Good Housekeeping, where she covers home design.
