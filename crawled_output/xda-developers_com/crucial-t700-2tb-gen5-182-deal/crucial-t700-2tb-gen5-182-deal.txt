The Crucial T700 is a fantastic M.2 SSD that really delivers when it comes to performance. You're getting impressive read and write speeds, with 12,400MB/s and 11,800MB/s respectively. And you can count on this performance for long data transfer sessions with sustained speeds that will leave you impressed. The M.2 SSD also manages to deliver impressive cooling as well, thanks to its heatsink that comes mounted right out of the box. It's important to have ample cooling on Gen 5 SSDs in order to get the very best performance that you can. Now as far as compatibility goes, you're going to need a motherboard that supports Gen 5 SSDs.
While you can stick this SSD into an older M.2 slot, you won't have access to the top listed speeds. With that said, grab this SSD right now for the best price we've seen. You can't go wrong if you're looking to take your device to a new level.
