Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
In recent months, I've talked a whole lot about moving away from Windows 11 and how much I prefer Linux. And yes, I've used Linux quite a bit on a few laptops, but the truth is I work on a desktop computer 95% of the time, and that's not a Linux PC. Indeed, I work on the M4 Mac Mini I reviewed last year, and while I initially complained about a lot of macOS behaviors, things have changed. macOS has since become my absolute favorite operating system to be on. It doesn't have all the customization I love about Linux, but when it comes to getting work done, I have slightly different priorities, and macOS has proven to be so much better than Windows for my needs, while avoiding some of the drawbacks of Linux.
Significantly less nagging
I don't need to deal with annoying pop-ups
One of the most frustrating aspects of Windows is how it constantly needs some kind of attention from the user and constantly tries to interrupt their flow. You have to sign in with a Microsoft account, then right during setup, you're bombarded with a bunch of upsells for Microsoft 365 and PC Game Pass, plus multiple ways to collect your data in order to advertise to you or provide "tailored experiences". It's not like Apple doesn't have its own things to sell, but after the initial setup almost a year ago, I can remember exactly one time when a feature I don't care about tried to make its way onto my PC, when generative AI features were starting to be implemented. It happened once, I disabled it, and it never bothered me again. I've never been asked to set up backups, sign up for one of Apple's subscriptions, or been shown any fake warnings about how I need more cloud storage for some reason. My searches have never been redirected to Safari when I used Spotlight — they just use my default browser (they do use Google instead of my search engine, though). I've never had screens after an update telling me to "update my browser settings" or reminding me to enable backups with iCloud. Life on macOS is a peaceful one, and I can't say that about Windows 11.
All my apps are still here
The big problem with Linux
Linux as a platform has grown a lot, and a ton of apps are available there at this point. But the fact remains that many of the most popular ones aren't. macOS may not have the market share of Windows 11, but it's a much bigger platform than Linux desktops in terms of popularity, and it's got pretty much every major app I need. When I first switched and I was still using Microsoft 365, macOS supported those apps. Linux doesn't. And now that I mostly use WPS Office, while those apps are also on Linux, they get much more active support on Windows and macOS, so I have a better time here. Then there are the Adobe apps. I use Photoshop and Lightroom daily, and these apps are only on Windows and macOS. Yes, there are alternatives on Linux, but they're nowhere near as intuitive and easy to use. I need these tools for my work, and I simply can't do said work as efficiently if I work on a Linux machine because I have to adjust to whole new apps that are often much more complex than they need to be. macOS is a big enough platform that there aren't really major hurdles in the transition. It's only some of the smaller things I rely on that required a bit of extra searching, but overall, I've been able to replicate all the features I liked on Windows with my Mac, and in some cases, I've found better experiences on macOS than I ever had on Windows.
Customization... exists
It's kind of better than Windows, in some ways
Something that I love about Linux is how customizable it is, with different desktop environments offering very different approaches to customization that let you do a ton. Windows 11 is far more locked down, and I figured macOS would be even more so. To some extent, that is true, but honestly, I find the customization options in macOS are still quite nice. One thing it does that Windows doesn't is customize the app icons, including dark and light modes, and starting with macOS 26 Tahoe, you even get two translucent icon options: clear and tinted. I can make icons any color I want, which is quite cool, even if I think they could look slightly better. That's something Windows just doesn't offer natively. I also have a dark theme that generally works a bit better than on Windows since it's applied in a more uniform and consistent way. One thing I really like about macOS is the default wallpapers, and Apple makes new ones every year. A cool feature of macOS is that many wallpapers are dynamic, so the colors will change to match the time of day or your system theme, and that applies to some more abstract wallpapers, but also to real-life locations. It's really cool to see how places look throughout the day.
Raycast is possibly the best app ever
It's so useful
macOS is great and all, but I would be remiss not to mention the best part about this entire thing: Raycast is (for now) a Mac-exclusive app, and it's simply amazing. It's a launcher, not unlike Flow Launcher on Windows, but it takes everything to the next level. It's like Spotlight on steroids, except the steroids took steroids, too. Most of the time, I use Raycast for extremely simple things. When I take a break from work, I launch Raycast with a keyboard shortcut, type in "Sle", and it immediately shows the option to put the computer to sleep. In fact, I don't even need to type anything anymore. This is my most used Raycast command, so it's automatically suggested at the top when I launch the search bar. I can also use Raycast to launch any app on my PC, which even includes Windows apps available through Parallels. When I'm done with work for the day, I can also quit all my apps with a simple command and then shut down the computer, all within Raycast. But that's just the beginning. Raycast provides a clipboard history feature, and it's the best clipboard history I've used. It's fast, searchable, it works with images, and it keeps a history of my copied items for a long enough time that I never notice anything missing. It's also got an emoji panel, which is also easily searchable, and again, even better than the one on Windows. It's significantly faster and more intuitive. Raycast also integrates with the Calendar app, which has my online work meetings. When I launch Raycast a couple of minutes before a meeting starts, that meeting is the top result suggested automatically. All I need to is press Enter, and it opens the Google Meet link in my browser instantly.
But that's still not all. Raycast also has a huge extensibility platform, and it's so powerful. I have a pair of extensions that I use to search and download YouTube videos. One extension lets me search YouTube for videos or channels, and when I select a video, I can either open it or just copy its link. Then, I use the YouTube download extension, paste in that link, and I'm able to choose the target quality and download the video. I do this sometimes when I need footage of something I don't have for my own YouTube videos, and it makes my life so much easier. I have an extension that lets me convert images to a different format, too. I can select files in Finder (or another file manager), launch Raycast, and it recognizes those images and lets me convert them. I even have a Pokédex extension that can show me plenty of information about a Pokémon without ever leaving Raycast. And all that is just scratching the surface of what's available. And all of this is available by regular search terms, but you can also set shortcuts in two ways. One is an alias, where you can type a shortened command to instantly launch a specific extension within Raycast, but you can also set keyboard shortcuts to launch an extension without even going through the search bar. It's so configurable. I know this section turned unexpectedly long, but Raycast is probably the best thing about using macOS, so I needed to explain why.
What don't I like?
It's not perfect, but...
macOS is certainly not a perfect platform, but most of the problems I had with it were overcome very shortly after my initial experience, and they don't really become a problem again. I don't like that I always had to choose whether to keep my open apps after shutting down the computer, but with Raycast's commands, I've worked around that. I didn't like the default storage location for screenshots, but that was also easily changed. Window management on macOS is also not great out of the box, but I already used FancyZones on Windows, too, and with MacsyZones, I get the same exact functionality on my Mac. I also missed smooth scrolling in my browser, but I used an app called Mos to fix that. Having these little fixes in place has made for a macOS experience that's generally been pretty perfect for me, to the point where I've seriously considered getting a MacBook as my primary laptop, too. While I love Linux and will keep using it on my current laptops, macOS provides the experience I want at almost every level, so I think it'll be hard to fully convert me away from it.
Linux is still amazing
Don't get me wrong, though, I'm still a big fan of Linux and I'm rooting for it to become a much more mainstream operating system. Not everyone can afford (or wants) to buy a Mac, and Linux is certainly a step up from Windows at its core. No matter which way you swing, you can probably do better than Windows, and that's the main takeaway here. For now, though, macOS has my heart.

Exactly what i think. I'm 100% of my time on desktop. And all of that is on Linux. Linux Mint, btw, which i can recommend to anyone coming from windows. Faster. Easier.

I actually commented the same but I'll just append to yours :This article seems to have been written by an Apple fan wanting to appeal to Windows users with surface level stereotypes.I have a macos for work and a PC at home. I will give my MacBook the following:EZ mdm managementBattery life. EVERYTHING ELSE is better on my PC, ESPECIALLY my windows management Good luck finding that one browser window on a Mac if you have several open in full screen. Oh you purchased rectangle or magic or some other windows tiling or management tool? That's the point, I didn't have to with my PC it's just better at it. Tell me why, on a Mac, if I full when an app my secondary display goes black? I can't have two full screen apps? And others have highlighted this point. I have spent $0.00 on my PC the last 20 year.I'm the first 4 months of macos ownership I had to BUY 2 apps in macos in JUST to get a taskbar. And even then, Apple heavily restricts the apps functionality. It's absolutely insane that I can't get rid of mission control. How is this customization.So basically Apple sucks so you have to buy apps to add functionality that Apple then restricts because it's not built by them (please see Fitbit and Garmin limitations when integrated with an iPhone vs Android).I tried Apple for a year in 2019 and again in 2024-25, which is more than most people who switch to either platforms. I also had a Macintosh as a kid.Apple creates this crappy universe... And you don't realize you're in a sandbox and the actual universe is way better outside.I'll stick to my Android and Windows devices, they actually are exciting to use and free.

Of course, only an article paid by Apple would feature such high praise as "Customization... exists" in one of the headers. Smart investment on their part, really.

This reads like a non technical person using a computer. Both Windows and Mac have naggy stuff you can disable. You didn't disable the Windows ones, but did for the Mac. That caused you to conclude that Mac is better... Ok.

TLDR. I saw macOS and immediately was like nope. As a software developer, Windows and Linux are where it is at hands down. The amount of lock down macOS has is just stupid.

After facing too much app issues, now i have to move from mac to some other os, but still thinking which one to choose. I think Linux can run windows apps (using winboat). Good for gaming. Now confused between windows and ubuntu, no way coming back to mac.

Stay away from Ubuntu.If you want gaming performance then go for an Arch based distro like CachyOS, BigLinux, or EndeavourIf you want A Debian based distro then try Mint or
PopOSIf you want Fedora based then Fedora or NobaraI used BigLinux as a daily driver for everything.
entertainment, gaming and development.
It's easy to use, newbie friendly and won't have you looking for help every day.

No Linux distros currently come with WinBoat preinstalled. It is a new application, and users must install it manually on their existing system. On the other hand, several distros come with a Windows compatibility layer preinstalled. That layer would be Wine or Proton. Proton is actually built on Wine. The distros with Proton prinstall are the ones that are optimized for gaming. That would be Bazzite (based on Fedora), Nobara (also based on Fedora), ChimeraOS (based on Arch for console gaming only), and SteamOS (based on Arch for console gaming only). The Fedora-based distros can be used as any other normal desktop workstation when not gaming. Distros that come with Wine preinstalled include Zorin OS and Anduin OS, both based on Ubuntu. Additionally, CachyOS (based on Arch) has consolidated all necessary gaming software, including Wine and Proton, into a single package to simplify installation. Recommendation: Go with Bazzite if you value gaming performance but value a very stable OS even more. Go with CachyOS if gaming performance is everything and and you're willing to spend some time and effort with the Arch user community to work out an occasional glitch. Go with Zorin OS if you want to stick with a conventional Ubuntu LTS model.

I used MacOS for years tried Windows OS. Window OS is very fun and gets all the jobs done in a timely manner for work. Easy to use. Home laptops and desk top computers are Linux OS. I really enjoy using Linux Mint OS. Linux will get the job done in a simple form way. No thinking about anything extra, Linux just works. Linux is not a fully loaded car will all bells and whistles, its just a car that gets you where you want to go.
Best of all its free.

Exactly Linux isn't going to be for everybody, but the people it works for are really going to enjoy it. It's freedom you can edit the source code

Ummm, no. You do not need a MS account to use W11 to its full potential. You can use a local account, and there are several legal ways to do that.

I found that once you go the way of the Apple, incompatibilities baked into the ecosystem increasingly entrench and lock you into it. The quality and performance of the products are fairly consistently above average. So, that's OK if money is no object. Apple also makes commercials that second to none.

If money is no object, you still get way better quality with a Linux PC. The problem is that people compare apple products with fastly cheaper PC's and android phones. Hardly a fair comparison.

No, sorry, you may never do better than Windows. If you're extremely tech-savvy, you may like Linux (and/or are looking for a legally free OS). For instance, Linux upgrade is a PITA. Say, for Ubuntu, you have version A and want version C, you must upgrade to version B first...WHY? My upgrade of version A to B went fine but to C went wrong (no apparent mistake from my side, it just failed to load C due to server error or whatever) so that I had to start over. Too many problems need to be solved using commands in the terminal, which is a setback for most people out there.MacOS is great but can never compete with Windows for simple tasks. Two days ago, I was using Safari in MacOS for my presentation using HDMI output. A tab on the website didn't load on clicking when the Macbook was connected to the external display via HDMI; the tab loaded only natively on Macbook when HDMI was disconnected. Worked perfectly when I switched to a Windows PC.On Windows, the Win+S command loads Power & sleep settings. Yes, you may not make it sleep hitting Enter but hey, you get options, which is fine for me.I keep coming back to Windows to do real-life things despite that MacOS and Linux are superior w.r.t. many jobs.

You need to be "Tech Savvy" to use Linux? I best go and let my elderly users of Ubuntu and Linux Mint that they need a PhD! And my 6 and 9 year old kids need to go to university to use it? The choice of OS's are out there, and they have their users, some like yourself, the article author and others who are total "fan boi's" that literally go to extremes of slagging others off. I'm on the 40 yard line, even though Linux is my daily driver and the families, and I use a Roku ecosystem in the house to connect to my Plex server for family to connect to and steam from.I sense an article bashing streaming devices next, like "I moved from Roku to Fire TV or Android TV because of x and y" really it's down to personal preferences and what each of us feels comfy with. I used to use Windows till 2009 after bouts of BSOD's etc on Vista, and yes back then the terminal was needed for a lot of things on a Linux Distro, but now....
My 9 year old updates the Ubuntu PC via the GUI, installs apps via the GUI, I remote into the PCs if needed, but not done it in over 8 months when he had a power cut and while he was updating.... Even then it was fixed in seconds! I used to work as an IT Tech/Admin with Windows server, but after losing a large part of my sight thanks to Hydrocephalus, I took the opportunity learn something new, granted like moving from Windows 7 to Windows 10 would need a little time to learn, but it's not too hard with a desktop that's familiar to the one you're k moving from....Anyway that's my rant and hope whatever OS everyone chooses is right for them....

"My upgrade of version A to B went fine but to C went wrong (no apparent mistake from my side, it just failed to load C due to server error or whatever)"I'm sorry that you're unable to perform a simple upgrade.
All of my Linux xystems (mostly Manjaro and CachyOS) automatically keep themselves upgraded.
On my schedule, not Microsoft's.

You must be shelling out a hell of a lot of money in order to keep Microsoft 365 because all microsoft is after is money, money, money and more money. Also microsoft is also responsible for the viruses that is plagueing the computer world. So good luck with Microsoft 365.

Microsoft has made the conscious decision not to make their products available on Linux. Linux can support MS Office if and when Microsoft decides to make Office available on Linux. Until then, LibreOffice works Just Fine - and it reads and writes MS Office file formats Just Fine as well. Interoperability issues are often a matter of font choices - and since many of MS's fonts are openly available and can be loaded into Linux that's less of an issue than perhaps it once was.

I'd be happy if Microsloth made classic outlook available on Linux.
Don't care about the rest
as LibreOffice is fine.

How are there so many folks whose lives are fully-dependent on running Adobe LightPhotoRoomSuite on an hourly basis?I will heartily chuckle when Adobe offers a fully web-based (or Linux-native!) version and this oft-cited reason gets retired in favor of the next.I would guess that there still would be myriad excuses not to move away from walled gardens and consensual spyware, but "10 reasons simple human inertia kept me from switching!" certainly has less of a ring to it.

I feel like the writer isn’t being honest with everyone. My Windows PC has never done any of these negative things. It’s a corporate laptop managed through group policy. Coming from IT I know I can setup any MS to behave the same. This means the author doesn’t know how to issue a proper setup or just complaining about nothing. I personally would switch to Linux if it’s only a personal device. It doesn’t really matter to me because all the platforms offer something unique and it’s hard to fault any of the popular choices.

I work primarily on the windows platform but I have an m1 mac mini at home. I also have a windows 11 laptop at home where I have setup Ubuntu inside of Windows Subsystem for Linux.I have powershell core and windows terminal on windows 11 as well as bash. I have zsh and powershell core setup on that Ubuntu in wsl. I also have zsh and powershell setup on my Mac mini. In every environment, I have ohmyposh setup and I have designed my own custom variation of a theme I found. I also wrote a .net core network utility that functions like the display portion of ipconfig. It compilies for windows, Linux and macos as native single file exes from a shared codebase with compiler preprocessor directives to separate platform specific code.Stop being platform snobs. I plan on upgrading to an m4 mini soon.

I see you're using an ultrawide monitor, how did you solve HiDPI scaling issue on its native resolution? Apple does not care about it and I'm forced to use a virtual screen mirrored onto my main monitor for it to be sharp at the cost of refresh rate (stuck at 60Hz), otherwise it would look like a blurry mess. The highest I can go with HiDPI is 1720'ish which makes the UI suitable only for people with significant sight impairment. This is utterly ridiculous.

The free version of Better Display should solve all of your HiDPI problems. It's really an essential app for third-party monitor users in

87BCE I am already using paid version of it (hence virtual screen), but it's very picky and the farthest I can go is 3072x1282 which isn't perfect, but bearable. The problem is that I keep losing this configuration regularly and then need to struggle to make betterdisplay recognize it as HiDPI again. Apple is a state of mind and I will sooner throw my m4 mini out the window than replace my monitor to 16:9 for it to work properly.

Tried a mac mini m4 today at running an 8b parameter AI model. Home assistant generally sends around 8k tokens to it with all its tool calling. Takes like 10-16+ seconds just to get to first token just to turn on a light, even if you only had 5 entities exposed.Anyone able to run a dedicated GPU on windows or Linux will smoke any mac. Nothing against Macs, low power usage is great if I want to play YouTube while on ps5.I'll just boot my windows PC if I have to program generally, even my old 5950x with 128gb of ECC memory feels way more responsive.

Eh? I never have windows nagging me for things because I turned it all off in the setup, and have DnD mode on permanently. And who uses a launcher for sleep? There's literally a button on my work laptop that does that. Or on the front of your PC case. If I need anything, I hit the windows key and type the first couple of letters and boom, it's up. But I get it. You don't like windows and your experience has been bothersome. Why not switch to macOS if you think it's better? I hope your credit card is ready to pay for all the apps you'll need for basic functionality. Good luck!

MacOS itself sucks. There are extensions to make it better, but it is on you to go find those extensions. For example, I can't change the scrolling direction for the touchpad and mouse independently. Most mice don't scroll smoothly. There is no built in clipboard app. Window management is abhorrent. All of these are huge issues with MacOS that are solved by third party apps. How does one ignore all these drawbacks when the majority of these features come built into Windows/Linux or are available for free via third party apps, unlike on MacOS where they are paid.
