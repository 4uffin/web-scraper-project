Soundbars aren't going to be for everyone, but they can make your desk space less cluttered while still providing great sound so you can still enjoy your entertainment. This one from Monster measures in at 20 inches, and features two 52mm speakers and two bass diaphragms that pump out a robust sound that's great for all uses. As mentioned before, this soundbar has multiple ways to connect, with AUX, USB, a memory card slot, along with Bluetooth 5.4. Monster claims that latency for wireless audio comes in at just 15ms, which can be important if you're looking to go fully wireless for your audio setup. As an added twist, this soundbar also has a built-in battery, which means you can even take it with you on the go. For the most part, we really like what Monster's offering here. It's a solid choice for anyone looking to make their sound setup more compact on a budget. Again, soundbars aren't for everyone, but if you've been looking to explore, the Monster S220 is going to be a great option.
