Mini PCs are all the rage now, offering plenty of power in a compact size. But this one is a little different thanks to its micro-sized design and extra affordable price of just $85. While the discount isn't huge, we think that this one is worth taking a look at, just in case you need a PC for those projects that need to squeeze into tight spaces or don't require a full-sized tower.
Versatile and small
The best part about any mini PC is going to be its size. Of course, you also want power as well, which most models offer now. When it comes to this model, you're getting a decent set of specifications, with an Intel Pentium N4200 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage.
Naturally, this setup isn't going to work for everyone, but if you're looking for a PC that can get the basics done, this one is going to be it. As far as what to expect, this mini PC is great for browsing the web, showing off presentations, playing media, or running your home lab. And just because it's small, that doesn't mean it loses out on connectivity. This mini PC packs two USB-A ports, one USB-C, microSD card slot, Ethernet, HDMI, Wi-Fi, 3.5mm audio jack, and Bluetooth. Plus, it's fanless, which means it can be used even in tight spaces.
We think this versatile mini PC is going to be able to handle quite a bit, but it's a good idea to temper your expectations. It isn't the most powerful mini PC on the market, but it'll be perfect for the right application. Grab it now for $85 when you clip the coupon from Amazon.
