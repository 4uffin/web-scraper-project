Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Every PC gaming peripheral seems to hinge on marketing with impressive numbers; numbers like 32,000 DPI, 8,000 Hz polling, or a 0.1 ms response time. On paper these specs sound like game-changers (and they're easy to market), but in reality most are just marketing fluff beyond a certain point. Gamers have been led to chase ever-higher metrics that don't actually improve gameplay in any meaningful way, and as proof of that, you'll find that professional players in esports titles have also identified these metrics simply don't matter. For the last decade, I've competed in Counter-Strike in Ireland, and I've gone through peripherals repeatedly over the years. For my mouse, I've never gone above 1,200 DPI, and for my keyboard, polling rate or response times have never even been a factor. As for headsets, well... I never even really used one. Instead, I used headphones and a separate microphone. There's a lot of marketing hype when it comes to PC peripherals, but the truth is that most of what companies focus on simply doesn't matter. They're just easy numbers to market, and here's what you actually need to care about.
When it comes to your mouse, even Razer says high DPI doesn't matter
Professional players aren't all jumping to 8,000 Hz or 40,000 DPI
DPI, standing for Dots Per Inch, is the flagship spec attached to the marketing of any gaming mouse. Today you'll see mice boasting 16,000, 25,000, even 40,000 DPI sensitivity. Sounds impressive, but here's the truth: anything above a few thousand DPI is essentially useless in practice. High DPI means the cursor moves faster for a given physical movement, but beyond a certain point it's too fast to control, and the accuracy it may boast is still non-existent once you start climbing up the thousands. Don't believe me? Razer itself even admits it, sharing the following in the Razer Viper 8K reviewer's guide, according to Tom's Hardware:
Unlike the usual chase for higher DPI, we believe in giving gamers an actual advantage. If it truly had any practical applications in gaming, then the highest DPI settings would be used by every eSports player.
This is the reason you'll find that most professional FPS players deliberately use a low DPI (often 400, 800, or 1600 DPI) for better accuracy and control, and tune their in-game sensitivity instead. Mouse sensors are what truly dictates the accuracy of your movement, and you can find the same sensor in multiple different mice. Other factors which often matter more, such as lift off distance (LOD), are rarely talked about, and some mice even come with a configurable LOD. I personally play Counter-Strike with my mouse set to 400 DPI, an in-game sensitivity of 1.2, and a lift-off distance of under 2.4mm.
Polling rate is the other big number thrown around with mice, and has snuck its way into keyboard marketing, too. This is how often the peripheral reports its position to the PC, measured in Hz. Standard gaming mice poll at 1000 Hz (meaning 1000 times per second, or one update every 1 ms). Lately, companies have been pushing 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz, even 8,000 Hz mice, all while claiming that more frequent updates reduce input delay. What this means, in pure theory, is that an 8,000 Hz mouse can have as low as 0.125 ms intervals between reports, making it eight times faster than 1 ms.
Think about that for a second: does the difference between 0.125 ms and 1 ms actually matter? The answer is that it almost certainly does not. Consider the fact that 1,000 Hz (1 ms) is already incredibly fast, and refreshing your inputs every 0.125 ms is significantly quicker than the 7ms between frames on a 144 Hz monitor or the 2.8 ms between frames on a 360 Hz monitor. Going beyond 1,000 Hz returns diminishing, invisible "benefits," which can decrease the battery life of your wireless peripherals. Plus, many of the world's best Counter-Strike 2 professionals still use a mouse that's only capable of 1,000 Hz. My mouse, the
Vaxee XE-S Wireless, goes up to 4,000 Hz, but I play on 1,000 Hz as it has a much longer battery life.
On top of all of that, you actually need to meet a few conditions to use that polling rate to its fullest. First, you need to be sending enough "events" (measured movements) to saturate that polling rate every second, and this will often require using a higher DPI. On top of that, the USB port you plug the dongle into needs to be in xHCI mode rather than EHCI, which is only supported by a USB 3.0 port. xHCI has lower interrupt moderation times (typically 50 µs) that allow for the higher polling rate. Without it, you won't ever reach polling rates as high as 8,000 Hz. Saving an extra half a millisecond or more with a higher polling rate won't suddenly make you more competitive, and you'll get far more mileage out of a reliable sensor, a comfortable shape, and an LOD suited to you. Ignore the high DPI marketing, and instead use a DPI and sensitivity that let you aim consistently. And that DPI is usually found in the hundreds, not tens of thousands.
Keyboard polling rates are more of the same
They just don't matter past a certain point
Gaming keyboard makers have joined the spec race too, touting features like "8,000 Hz polling" and light-speed switch actuation. If you've seen marketing for the latest optical or hall-effect switch keyboards, you've probably heard claims of 0.2 ms key response times often contrasted with "slow" traditional mechanical keyboards that take 2 to 5 ms to register a keystroke. It sounds like a huge improvement on paper (0.2 ms compared to 2 ms!), but once again the benefit is essentially theoretical for real use. That roughly 2 ms gap is negligible, buried by other delays in the input chain like game engine polling, USB processing, and more. Similarly to mice, keyboard polling rate has jumped from the standard 1,000 Hz to new extremes like 8,000 Hz on high-end boards. And just like mice, the real-world impact is minimal. Yes, an 8,000 Hz keyboard technically reports key presses every 0.125 ms, but that doesn't mean your in-game actions happen that much faster. There are still internal delays from the key switch mechanism, the debounce logic or firmware, the USB transmission, and the game's own input processing. In practice, a well-designed 1,000 Hz keyboard with good switches and firmware will feel just as responsive as an 8000 Hz model, and you almost certainly won't notice the difference. For rhythm games, you'll need a keyboard with a polling rate on the higher end, but we're talking about upgrading from 125 Hz or 500 Hz to 1,000 Hz, not 1000 Hz to 8,000 Hz. All this isn't to say keyboard latency never matters, but today's keyboards are already incredibly fast. Many professional players across a wide range of esports titles use keyboards that boast a mere 1 ms response time and 1,000 Hz polling rate, yet if it made a difference, they would all be on higher-tier hardware with the lowest response times and the highest polling rates possible. Instead, focus on things that do affect your experience: the switch feel (linear, tactile, clicky, etc), the layout and key rollover, the build quality, and features that improve comfort.
Headsets aren't safe from marketing either
"Surround sound" can actually make it sound worse
Gaming headsets come with their own pile of marketed metrics and features that sound impressive when printed on a box or placed in some marketing copy, but these often fail to translate into tangible advantagaes. One of the most common is "7.1 Surround Sound" in headsets. You've probably seen boxes bragging about virtual 7.1 or "3D audio" that supposedly gives you superhuman positional hearing. Unfortunately, most "surround" gaming headsets use virtual surround processing on a standard stereo driver setup, and it's largely a marketing gimmick for competitive play. Many games have actual surround sound settings built-in that you should enable instead. Don't believe me? Professional players and serious FPS players overwhelmingly favor using a good stereo headset (or even headphones) with accurate sound imaging, rather than any faux-surround mode. In fact, many even disable virtual surround despite their headset supporting it, because it can distort or muddy the sound. A high-quality stereo headset provides clear, unprocessed audio with accurate positional cues, and that's exactly what you need to pinpoint footsteps and gunshots. Not an approximation of sound based on what an on-device driver is trying to "improve" the quality of. Personally, I've nearly always played with a pair of decent headphones and a separate microphone, rather than a gaming headset. I've used the Audio Technica M50X, the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0, Sony WH-1000XM3, the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless, and only in the last year have I actually used a gaming headset in the form of the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless, and I still use an external microphone. While a gaming headset is convenient, most gaming headsets that I've tried (from friends who have also attended LAN events with me) lacked the sound quality you'd expect when competing at a higher level.
Unlike polling rate and response times, though, surround sound isn't always useless. A good virtual surround can add a sense of spaciousness and better vertical audio cues in certain games, but these are better tailored to single-player experiences than competitive titles. In many cases, a $100 set of headphones will sound better and give you an improved directional accuracy than a $100 headset crammed with cheap "7.1 surround sound." The true measure of quality for a headset should be the drivers and sound tuning, not the number of audio channels being faked or the software gimmicks packed into the adjacent client. You might even find yourself pinpointing audio more accurately using a simple equalization profile, rather than a headset tuned for virtual surround sound. Other audio specs to be wary of include things like frequency response range and "Hi-Res Audio" labels. You'll see headsets boast frequency responses from "10 Hz to 40,000 Hz" as if it matters, implying they produce more sound than competitors. To be clear, the useful range for human hearing is roughly 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Advertising beyond that is mostly marketing fluff, and having drivers that can (in theory) play up to 40 kHz doesn't make the headset sound better if the actual audio material, like the game's audio output, doesn't have meaningful content up there — and I can assure you that it almost certainly doesn't. Likewise, a "Hi-Res Audio" badge (requiring an audio resolution of at least 24-bit/96 kHz) isn't a guarantee of better sound quality. Game audio is typically mastered in and around 16-bit/48 kHz; the limiting factor in gaming headsets is almost always the driver quality and tuning, not the digital specs. All of this is to say that you shouldn't let yourself be swayed by a headset just because it touts specs like 50mm drivers, hi-res audio certification, or outrageous frequency ranges. Pay attention to reviews of the actual sound quality, and consider the comfort and build instead. A headset that you can wear for hours without pain which lets you accurately hear your game is far more valuable than one that checks a bunch of marketing boxes. That's why I've been using the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless that I mentioned earlier; I don't care about the "gaming" features, it just genuinely sounds good, I can wear it for hours, and it's wireless.
It's all just marketing
Numbers are easier than technical details
Peripheral makers face a problem: it's hard to clearly explain why your device is better than a competitor's when much of its appeal depends on technical details or how it feels. It's easier to tout an 8,000 Hz polling rate, a 0.2 ms response time, or "High-Res Audio" than to explain sensor nuances, the quality of a keyboard gasket, or the tuning of headset drivers. There are plenty of other marketing talking points: gold-plated connectors, braided cables (useful for durability and flexibility, but not much else), and N-key rollover, which describes how many keys can be pressed simultaneously. You'll see that last one advertised as 6KRO or NKRO, but many keyboards already support it, they just don't promote it. Unless you plan to press 20 keys at once (what game are you playing?), a modern gaming keyboard will handle it easily. Instead, spend time researching the parts that companies don't talk about as much. Most high-end keyboards, mice, and headsets are fine when it comes to polling rates, DPI, and audio quality. Instead, look into comfort and what it's like to use over many hours, battery life (if it's wireless), and other additional bits and pieces like lift-off distance for a mouse or the switches the keyboard uses. I have never once died in Counter-Strike or Valorant and thought "if only I had enabled the 4,000 Hz polling rate on my mouse," and I'm sure you won't either.

I agree with you. And feel weird when I activate high DPI on my mouse. The game say error, too many activity (overload I guess). I often fail to click on the game, specially game on virtual android like NOX player. When use game loop player, sometime I can't access menu on game.
