Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:

Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Having extra accessories for a video game console can be pretty helpful. While most first-party accessories can enhance the experience of playing games, they can also make some aspects of gaming easier and more comfortable. However, there are also accessories on the market that don't do things better, but can rather be harmful to your system. And if you're not careful, the wrong accessory can do irreparable damage to a very expensive video game console. That's a problem nobody wants to find themselves dealing with. I often find myself browsing through accessories for my game consoles that I know can be useful, as well as affordable. Over the years, I've come to learn which ones I should avoid buying at all costs, especially if I want my gaming consoles to last a long time. It's often better not to buy a cheap accessory for a console, especially if I can get something that is actually safe to use with it, even after paying a little more for the guarantee. Here are some gaming accessories that I avoid picking up for my consoles, and why you should do the same.
Extra fan attachments
Just blowing smoke up
It might sound like a good idea for a game console to have an extra fan blowing out air. It can make sense for anyone who wants to be sure that their new hardware isn't overheating from a long play session. But this is something I learned to avoid a long time ago, during the Xbox 360 era, when console temperatures were a big point of discussion. Most Xbox 360 units suffered from the "red ring of death", which was linked to the heat being generated during regular game time and the faulty design of the console itself. Most accessories that are extra fans don't help out as much as they should, and in some cases, can do the opposite of what they're intended for. Originally, I purchased a fan attachment that went onto the back of my Xbox 360, which blew air with three additional fans. But instead of making my console cooler, it actually pulled in more electricity to the unit and made things worse, along with a louder-than-normal noise when I played games like Call of Duty and Gears of War. I ended up with a console that had three flashing red lights faster than I had hoped for. So, I was left without a console for an extended period of time. Extra fans like this can disrupt the internal workings of a console with the extra heat generated. At the same time, the accessory can also cause the built-in fans of a console to work harder to compensate, which can also lead to additional wear and tear over a shorter period of time. While the Xbox 360 had its fair share of heating problems, I avoided any and all fan attachments for my consoles from that point forward.
Third-party charging accessories
Not shockingly smart
Game consoles come with their own cables and chargers inside the box. And if something were to happen to them, the same companies that release them have additional cables and chargers that anyone can purchase to replace them. But all too often, gamers will find themselves getting these same items from a third-party seller, mostly because of the more affordable price. But this is a bad idea for most consoles, especially ones that have been purchased recently. One console that has popped up recently with issues like this is the Nintendo Switch 2, where a third-party charger melted after being attached to the Switch 2 USB-C port. Although the console was repaired by Nintendo, they warned the owner not to use accessories for charging that weren't manufactured by Nintendo. Not every USB cable can handle the power transferred to the console from a wall outlet. Faulty cables can be the catalyst for major problems like overheating, performance issues, and other hardware damage that could be avoided.

The same thing can be for third-party dock accessories for a console like the Switch 2. Because of the quality being questionable and not always living up to the same Nintendo quality for hardware, these types of accessories can damage a Nintendo Switch 2 in various ways. Whether that's damaging the screen of the console or the inner parts of it, it's all bad news for players who inadvertently impact their console negatively. Most third-party docks won't work with the Switch 2 by default because of a lockout that Nintendo has for the console, but it's best to avoid this entirely by not using any of them.
Third-party covers and stands
A flawed design

There was a time when customizing a console was a big trend, which saw many different third-party companies releasing products for gamers. Stores would carry items like faceplates and covers to put onto a console, as well as unique stands or display cases for them. But here's a big issue that many people don't often think about when getting accessories like these: they cover everything. Those same cases and plates that have a cool design to show everyone can also, at times, cover up important parts of a console's hardware, like the fans and vents that are built into them. Dust cases and covers, such as those made by some companies for the PlayStation 5, have a significant issue with this when players fail to remove them after turning on the device. They can cause a console to overheat and stop working as intended. The simple solution is to just take off the case when you're going to play a game, but some people forget or just don't do so.

At the same time, display stands that do things like elevate or put a console into an awkward position can make it more vulnerable to dropping or slipping off a display. Even if a console feels like it's sturdy enough, it's never a good thing to gamble on. Any sort of damage that comes from a fall is almost an instant way to make sure it does not work ever again. Some displays for the PlayStation 5 try to take advantage of the console standing upright, while also having fans blowing or other functions with it. Regardless, these types of displays don't do much to help the console and instead open it up to more potential problems that can be very costly.
Being a smart console owner
It can be fun getting new accessories for a video game console, especially a brand-new one that has just hit the market. But sometimes, it's best to avoid issues altogether by not picking up cheap accessories or staying away from third-party options. Accessories for a system are meant to enhance the experience of using it, not make things a massively expensive headache. Through a lot of trial and error over the years, I've learned what to be open to buying for my consoles and what to stay away from, which has aided me in making sure my game consoles work for a very long time after purchasing them. And even if I have to spend a few extra dollars to get an accessory from the console manufacturer themselves, it's much better than finding out my console is broken from a cheap alternative.

"Those same cases and plates that have a cool design to show everyone can also, at times, cover up important parts of a console's hardware, like the fans and vents that are built into them." So like OG Sony faceplates that cover the PS5's side fans. Gotcha. It's good I got third party faceplates that actually had wholes for the side fans of the console. Going by this articles logic my PS5 would have already melted with the OG faceplates.

This article provides excellent insights into a topic that many gamers overlook. I really appreciate how it explains the risks of using certain accessories that may seem harmless but can actually shorten the lifespan of a console. The emphasis on avoiding products that cause overheating, add unnecessary strain to hardware, or compromise overall performance is very useful. It’s a reminder that protecting our gaming systems isn’t just about keeping them clean, but also about making smart choices with the accessories we use. Definitely a valuable read for anyone who wants to extend the longevity and reliability of their consoles.
