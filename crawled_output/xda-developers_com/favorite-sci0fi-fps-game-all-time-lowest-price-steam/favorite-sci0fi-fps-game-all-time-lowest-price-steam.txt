Give me a lighthearted recap
When you think of sci-fi first-person shooters, your mind may immediately go to titles such as Halo or Destiny. However, before they saw the light of day, there was System Shock 2. The game set a huge bar for FPS titles and even set the foundation for its spiritual sequel series that would become what we know as BioShock. Unfortunately, as much as I love System Shock 2, it was released all the way back in 1999, so it's quite challenging for a new audience to get into it. Fortunately, the game got a 25th anniversary remake that updated the graphics and added a co-op mode, and it's currently at its lowest price ever seen on Steam.
The System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster is 60% off on Steam right now
If you've never heard of System Shock 2 before, it's a classic in the sci-fi FPS scene. You're stuck on a spaceship alongside an AI called SHODAN, who has seemingly gone crazy. Now the ship is stuffed with both deadly security robots and mutants, and it's up to you to survive and find a way out. Here's how the developers describe the game:
System Shock® 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster by Nightdive Studios brings to you the modernized remaster of the FPS/RPG classic, featuring Cross-Play Co-Op multiplayer, Mod Support and more.
It’s the year 2114 and as you awake from cryo sleep on the FTL ship Von Braun, you are unable to remember who or where you are… and something has gone terribly wrong. Hybrid mutants and deadly robots roam the halls while the cries from the remaining crew reverberate through the cold hull of the ship. SHODAN, a rogue AI bent on the destruction of mankind has taken over and it's up to you to stop her.
It's one of my favorite sci-fi shooters ever, so I'm really happy that it's currently 60% off on Steam. It's the lowest price it has ever reached on the platform before, so if you're interested, be sure to grab it before the deal vanishes on September 24th.
