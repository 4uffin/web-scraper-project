This Alienware gaming monitor is one that we loved, and it managed to deliver on all levels, which is why we decided to give it an impressive 9/10 score. Of course, the $900 price tag doesn't make it an easy purchase, which is why this current deal from Amazon that knocks $326 off is so important. For a limited time, you can grab this QD-OLED monitor for its lowest price, which makes it an absolute steal.
A must-buy at this low price
Alienware has been delivering some heat with its monitors lately, with a lineup that features some of the best tech you'll find in a gaming monitor. This particular model features a subdued design and a 27-inch QD-OLED 1440p screen that features colors that pop, and deep black levels with VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification.
Beyond that, the monitor has a 360Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time, along with support for AMD's FreeSync Premium Pro and VESA AdaptiveSync technologies. The connectivity is also quite good as well, with HDMI, two DisplayPort, USB-A, USB-C, and USB-C ports. So, while it's great for PC, feel free to plug in other devices to this monitor too.
You get a subdued design with a small pop of RGB lighting at the rear that is customizable. The real draw here is going to be the performance and price. Right now, you can score a stellar discount on a fantastic monitor as it drops to $574 from Amazon. It's the best price we've seen so get it while you can.
