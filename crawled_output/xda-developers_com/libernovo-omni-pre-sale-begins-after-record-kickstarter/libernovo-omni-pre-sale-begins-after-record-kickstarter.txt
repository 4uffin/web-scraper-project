Give me a lighthearted recap
If you spend hours on end on your desk, the right chair can mean the difference between lasting comfort and nagging back pain. Unfortunately, most traditional ergonomic chairs are hit or miss. They often fall short by forcing you into a rigid, one-size-fits-all posture. Not to mention, if your height doesn’t line up with the lumbar support, it quickly becomes uncomfortable. That’s the problem LiberNovo set out to solve with Omni, its flagship dynamic ergonomic chair. Instead of locking you in place, Omni adapts in real time to your natural movements, providing continuous support through every task, every gaming session, and every late-night push. The LiberNovo Omni recently smashed its Kickstarter goal, and it’s now available for preorder. From September 23 at 7:00 PM PDT through October 20 at 7:00 PM PDT, customers can reserve the chair at 23% off in the US and 29% off in Canada, with bonus accessories including an eye mask, eco-bag, and foot cushion. In addition, new subscribers in both regions will receive an extra 5% new-customer discount.

There is no shortage of ergonomic chairs, but the majority of them force you into a single, rigid posture. That might sound supportive, but in practice, it locks the body in place, which can lead to spinal misalignment, chronic muscle fatigue, slower circulation, and back pain over time. LiberNovo designed Omni to take a different approach. Instead of just supporting your back, it adapts to it as you move. At the core of this design is a Dynamic Support System that actively responds to micro-movements throughout the day. Whether you’re leaning in to debug code, reclining after a late-night gaming session, or shifting positions during a long video edit, the chair adjusts in real time to maintain proper support.
Adaptive backrest that mirrors your spine

The highlight of Omni’s Dynamic Support System is its Bionic FlexFit Backrest. Built with 16 pivot joints and eight adaptive panels, the backrest is engineered to conform to the natural S-curve of your spine, not just in one position, but in all positions. It automatically adjusts your lumbar and spinal support up to 13 times per hour to ensure continued support and contact, whether sitting upright or leaning back to relax. In addition, the chair comes with incredibly plush cushioning on the seat, backrest, and headrest. Unlike the mesh backrests you'll find on most ergo chairs, the Omni is very comfortable for long periods, especially with its dynamic backrest. Plus, the seat is contoured for excellent weight distribution with high-density foam on the rear and soft foam on the front. For anyone who has struggled with midday stiffness or nagging lower-back pain, the adaptive support and cushioning material make a measurable difference in how long you can stay comfortable and productive.
All-day comfort through smart adjustability

No two bodies are the same, and Omni’s design acknowledges that. The chair ships with 4D armrests, 3D neck support, adjustable seat height, and a built-in motor that lets you dial in just the right lumbar support for your body. With a touch of a button, the Bionic FlexFit backrest shifts in or out, maintaining perfect contact from your lower back up through your shoulders. In addition, the chair is fully customizable. Starting with the armrests: they can go up and down, forward and back, and swivel outwards and inwards. Plus, you can also adjust the width of the armrests in three steps, which can come in handy when transitioning between PC, console, or mobile gaming. The adaptive neckrest is another big highlight for the LiberNovo Omni. It can be adjusted up and down like in most ergo chairs, but users can also move it in and out, ensuring proper neck support when sitting upright or reclining. Add in the usual seat height adjustments and the optional footrest, and Omni becomes a chair you can stay in comfortably from morning stand-up calls to late-night side projects.
Recline modes for every moment

The Omni promotes different sitting positions, whether gaming or working. It offers four intelligent recline modes designed for the different ways people actually use their chairs throughout the day.
105° Deep Focus keeps you upright and alert, ideal for presentations, video calls, or intense problem-solving.
120° Solo-Work provides balanced support for extended coding sessions or long writing sprints.
135° Soft Recline is perfect for gaming marathons or late-night streaming.
160° Spine Flow promotes active recovery, easing pressure and helping circulation reset after hours of staying locked to the same sitting position.
Thanks to Omni’s SyncroLink mechanism, the whole chair moves with you as you lean back, so the headrest, armrests, and lumbar support always stay where you need them. The headrest and backrest tilt at different angles to keep your eyes locked on the screen instead of drifting upward, while the armrests slide back to match however you’re sitting. You can dial in the tilt tension too, so the recline feels smooth and safe.

On top of that, users can activate the OmniStretch massage mode when fully reclined. In this setting, the Bionic FlexFit backrest gently pushes forward in a rhythmic motion, gradually stretching your spine and lower back. It can help ease stiffness, improve circulation, and help reduce discomfort after a long day of work or first thing in the morning.
From record-breaking crowdfunding to your desk
When LiberNovo launched Omni on Kickstarter earlier this year, it didn’t just meet its funding goal; it shattered records. The campaign became the most-funded ergonomic office chair in Kickstarter history, backed by thousands of users eager for a better way to sit. Now, you can pre-order the same chair at a discounted price, complete with exclusive perks. From September 23 at 7:00 PM PDT through October 20 at 7:00 PM PDT, customers can reserve the Omni at $848 in the US (23% off MSRP) or C$1,292 in Canada (29% off MSRP). An extra 5% new-customer discount at checkout drops the US price as low as $806, making it one of the most affordable chairs in its class. Shipping begins October 20, 2025, and every pre-order also includes a gift pack with an eye mask, eco-bag, and foot cushion. Alongside Omni, LiberNovo is introducing a matching accessory, the Cooling Seat Cushion. Available to pre-order from September 23 through October 1 at a $59 launch price (25% off MSRP), it ships starting October 1.
