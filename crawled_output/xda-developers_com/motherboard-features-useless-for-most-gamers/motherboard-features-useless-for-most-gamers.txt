Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
The motherboard is perhaps the only PC component that involves sifting through tons of specs, reviews, and misinformation before confidently buying one. In contrast, buying a CPU, GPU, or SSD is incredibly straightforward since considerably fewer variables are involved. Out of the many motherboard features that people claim are indispensable, there are some that most gamers don't even look for. Enthusiasts and home lab users might swear by them, but they make little difference to an average gamer's experience.
5Gb (or 10Gb) Ethernet ports
I don't even need the 2.5Gb port I have
As newer chipsets arrive on the market, the threshold for what makes a decent motherboard keeps rising. Consumers get access to features on budget motherboards that were once considered premium, such as onboard Wi-Fi, M.2 heatsinks, PCIe 5.0, USB-C ports, and quick-release slots. That said, 5Gb Ethernet ports are still not as common as one might think, and that's fine. Gamers aren't rejecting motherboards for the lack of multi-gig Ethernet. The average internet speeds globally can't even saturate a 1GbE Ethernet connection, let alone a 2.5GbE or 5GbE one. Gaming generally benefits more from a wired connection than, say, streaming or casual browsing, but a 5GbE port is way past overkill for the majority of gamers. The only users who can legitimately use such high-bandwidth Ethernet ports are home lab and NAS users who need a high-speed local connection. The rest of us can easily last for a few more years with 2.5GbE ports that have now become the standard on most motherboards.
Dual BIOS
It's rather optional
Depending on your preference, updating your motherboard's BIOS might or might not be mandatory, but having BIOS flashback can still come in handy. All you need is a USB stick with the relevant BIOS file to recover your bricked motherboard, or update your BIOS without a CPU installed. This makes dual BIOS rather optional, and that's how most gamers treat it. Having a backup BIOS on your motherboard is convenient if you mess up the other one, but BIOS flashback is already up to the task. I haven't once looked for this feature when buying a motherboard in the last 25 years. BIOS flashback is invariably present on even the cheapest motherboards, so dual BIOS becomes a nice-to-have, rather than a must-have feature. If it's present on your motherboard, that's great; if not, you're not going to miss it.
Quad M.2 slots
A challenge to think of a use case
When it comes to storage, 2TB is the sweet spot for most gaming builds, and it's usually seen in the form of a 2TB Gen4 NVMe SSD. Another popular configuration is two 1TB SSDs occupying two M.2 slots, presumably after one runs out of space on a single but affordable 1TB drive. So, most people don't really need more than two M.2 slots on the motherboard. Even if you make a case for a third slot, motherboards with four M.2 slots are irrelevant for almost all gaming builds. Yes, professionals and productivity users always need more storage, but we're talking about gamers here. Many users on the internet might push you toward buying the motherboard that boasts the best I/O stack and has a minimum of four M.2 slots, but you know you'll never use them. Even when you eventually feel like adding a Gen5 SSD to your motherboard, you can relocate your Gen4 drive from the primary slot to a spare one. A motherboard with two or three slots will satisfy every use case you can conceive of, so it's okay to ignore boards with quad M.2 slots the next time you're in the market for a new one.
Extreme DDR5 speeds
It's a bit extreme to worry about this
While the frequency and timings of your RAM depend on multiple factors, you need support on the motherboard before you can think of running blazing-fast DDR5 kits. For most people buying DDR5-6000 kits, any motherboard will suffice, but faster kits are where the trouble begins. You need the Integrated Memory Controller (IMC) of the CPU to be able to handle those speeds, and the motherboard to support them as well. The reality is, however, gaming doesn't benefit a lot from DDR5-8000 or even DDR5-7200 kits — 6,000MT/s memory is still all you really need. This is why only a fraction of gamers are really after RAM speeds in the 7,000–8,000 range. Even the cheapest B650 mATX boards will usually support speeds of up to 7,200MT/s, provided your CPU can run them reliably. So, most people buying 6,000–6,400MT/s RAM don't need to worry about whether their motherboard will support those speeds. Hence, support for blazing-fast DDR5 RAM isn't top of the mind when gamers are shopping for a motherboard.
Overkill VRM design
What's in a VRM?
Finally, elaborate VRM designs with dozens of phases and oversized heatsinks are something that only overclockers and enthusiasts care about. These days, even budget motherboards come with a decent VRM solution packing 10, 12, or 14 phases, quality capacitors, and a reliable track record when it comes to VRM temperatures. This combination is all that most people need for their new builds. Motherboard manufacturers might boast overkill VRM designs in their marketing, but they're only talking to a small niche of users. Even if you're running a 24x7 overclock on your 6-core or 8-core gaming CPU, you're unlikely to require $300–$500 motherboards to sustain it. Most people can still manage almost all gaming and overclocking use cases with a $200 motherboard. This is why gamers look for features like a robust I/O stack, adequate expansion slots, and M.2 heatsinks before diving into the details of the VRM design.
Most gamers don't obsess over motherboards
Unlike a small percentage of users, most people building gaming PCs only care about a select few features before buying a motherboard. The supposedly "must-have" items on an enthusiast's list never make it to the consideration set of an average user. Modern motherboards don't affect an average user's experience as much as they used to, provided one is not buying sub-$100 models. Almost all motherboards priced around $130–$150 (and higher) are good enough for anything most gamers will ever do on their systems.

You sound like a rich person that can afford to have a separate computer that is just for playing games. My computer also has to be able to do a lot of other tasks as well so I need a lot more RAM and a lot more storage, both on board and on line. I also use many of the features you claim are in needed.

For most parts in this topic I agree on 100% (if not more) but on the part of M.2 slots - I have to disagree. As a gamer for the past 25 years who is not stuck to playing only 1 or max 2 games and instead keeping 5-6 games that I play frequently and a few extra triple-A games installed in addition for the time required to run through their stories (campaign modes). Nowadays a lot of games go north of 100+ GBs - hell... some reach over 200 GBs each (cough... Skyrim, Fallout 4, Ark Survival Evolved,Call of Duty...cough).So at least 4 TB storage is needed for the good performance of a nice Win 11 system with a few games + all the Windows shenanigans (hibernation, page file, etc.), add 100 GB extra (on Nvidia for shader cache) to workaround issues like the latest Borderlands 4 stutter and there you go.With the mentioned above games and cache and win 11 - so far a person would be at around 2 TB ssd needed, now add some standard apps + their cache (browser + office + some other software for let's say streaming) if only for streaming maybe a gamer can fit in 3 TB if they want to record and edit some of the videos before putting them on YT, Twitch and etc. Good luck with that...

I think you are over estimating. I manage a lot of PCs (not counting gamers) and none of them go over about 200 GB for the OS and all the apps. The ones with a lot of extra user data like photos never go over 1TB.So using your estimate of 100GB per game (which is more than most games) and 5-6 games installed simultaneously I'd say 2TB should be still ideal for most gamers, especially if they don't have money to burn.Also a regular 4TB regular HDD, for 1/3 the price, can make a great secondary storage location for photos and videos to help keep the SSD free for the games.

"24x7 overclock on your 6-core or 8-core gaming CPU"Someone forgot how many cores some CPUs pack. One of stability issues on Intel is power sensitivity for their large CPUs.

Buy ahead as far as you can when updating your system, that includes future developments that you can "imagine".Specifications or development of System specs happen only when you put your mind to where you want to "go". Think BIG or quit playing around, it's all in what and where you direct YOUR mind to be ! ! !Want to get on board ?Think about it, and make IT HAPPEN.

I can't find anything I disagree with here. My advice is buy into the brand and line you like and are familiar with. Motherboard isn't that big of a deal unless you're going for OCing records or have a specific use case for a feature today..... All those features you think you need to have because you might use them someday, you're not going to use them.

I found some really crazy spec'd no-name brand motherboards on Amazon, usually under a listing like W680 NAS Motherbaord or similar. I can't justify buying one because they likely have no warranty or bios updates ever, but
I do wish more mainstream brands like ASUS, ASROCK, Gigabyte and MSI would create some of those.Specs like the following:-mATX-LGA 1700-DDR5 ECC (4 slots)-12 SATA Ports-10g ethernet + 2.5g ethernet-vPro management-3x M.2 slots-4 PCIe slots
