The Cooler Master MK770 wireless mechanical keyboard is built to last, delivers incredible features, and doesn't cost a whole lot. You can now grab it for just $50, which is 49% off its current retail price. It's great for everyday use, and can even deliver an incredible experience for gaming. The Macaron color might not be for everyone, but if you love the way this keyboard looks, it's definitely the time to pick one up.
Sleek, colorful, and feature-packed
This compact wireless mechanical keyboard features an ABS exterior with full gasket structure to ensure that you're getting the best typing experience possible. By default, the keyboard comes with doubleshot PBT keycaps, red switches, and customizable RGB lighting. You also get three ways to connect through USB, Bluetooth, and wireless using 2.4Ghz.
If you're looking for the best performance, wired or using the 2.4Ghz connection is going to be your best bet, with a maximum polling rate of 1,000Hz. There's a 4,000mAh battery on the inside, and compatibility with Windows, macOS, Apple and Android devices. There's also a multi-function roller that can be used to control action on your connected device.
It's a keyboard that looks good and also performs well too. The important part is that it's now more affordable than ever thanks to the 49% discount from Woot. You can get while supplies last. Or if you're still on the fence, it might be a good idea to see how a mechanical keyboard can better fit into your current workflow.
