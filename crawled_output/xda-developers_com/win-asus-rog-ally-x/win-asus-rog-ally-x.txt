Summary
Handheld PC gaming booms post‑Steam Deck; many alternatives run Windows 11 or SteamOS.
Hell Is Us is giving away the only‑ever ice‑blue ROG Ally X plus the game to only one winner.
To enter: RT the post, follow @HellisUsGame, and comment your all‑time favorite game.
The handheld gaming scene has continued to grow in strength over the past few years. Ever since the Steam Deck changed how we play our PC titles, other companies have taken their shots at making the perfect portable pal, and there are a ton of excellent Steam Deck alternatives out there for you to try out. You can pick out a budget-oriented model or splash out on a deluxe version, then equip it with either Windows 11 or SteamOS. Life's pretty good for gamers on the go. If you want in on the scene but you're not keen on dropping a lot of money on a new console, the Hell Is Us team may just have what you're looking for. They're giving away an exclusive Hell Is Us edition of the ROG Ally X, plus a copy of the game itself, to one lucky winner. On top of that, there's only one of these in existence right now, which means you can also score some serious bragging rights.
Hell Is Us is giving away a ROG Ally X with a free game
In a post on X (thanks for the spot, Notebook Check!), the Hell Is Us team showed off this shiny, one-of-a-kind ROG Ally X. It has a really sleek, ice-blue look to it, which makes it even more painful that it's going to be the only one ever to exist. Seriously, I never win these giveaways.
If you want to win it, head over to X, RT the post, follow the good people giving away this console, then comment declaring your favorite game of all time. I'm not sure if saying that Hell Is Us is your fave game will earn you favor or if they think you're just being nice for the sake of a free console, but if you really love the game, you might as well try it. And if you want to see what it's like, we published a review about the ROG Ally X. It's worth noting that since its publication, Valve has released SteamOS for the public to install on whatever they please, so that's definitely an option if you dislike Windows 11.
