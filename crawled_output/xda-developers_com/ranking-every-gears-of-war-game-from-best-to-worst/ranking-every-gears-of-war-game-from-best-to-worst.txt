Few franchises define Xbox quite like Gears of War. Since its debut in 2006, the series has influenced entire generations of shooters. Across spin-offs, sequels, and reimaginings, Gears of War has seen both highs and lows. Some entries revolutionized the shooter genre, while others fell short of expectations. Here, we’ll be ranking every Gears of War game from worst to best.

Gears of War: Judgment (2013)
A lackluster spin-off
Released in 2013 as a prequel, Gears of War: Judgment aimed to shed light on the events following Emergence Day through the perspective of Lt. Damon Baird and Kilo Squad. While the premise seemed interesting, the execution left much to be desired. The story never reached the emotional heights of the mainline trilogy, largely because it lacked the familiar presence of Marcus Fenix and Delta Squad. Baird may be a fan favorite, but as the sole lead, he couldn’t carry the same gravitas as Marcus and Dom. Gameplay changes also alienated long-time fans. The arcade-style scoring system, restrictive mission structures, and stripped-down multiplayer removed much of what made the series distinct. While not a terrible game by any means, Judgment stands as the weakest link in the series.

Gears of War 4 (2016)
An average sequel to a great trilogy
Credit: Gears of War 4
By 2016, Epic Games had passed the torch to The Coalition, which debuted its first mainline entry with Gears of War 4. This game introduced a new generation of characters: J.D. Fenix, son of Marcus and Anya, alongside Kait Diaz and Del Walker. The story attempted to pass the torch to the new team, but fans of the series weren't entirely on board for that. On the gameplay side, Gears 4 was solid but not groundbreaking. Cover-based shooting was as polished as ever, but outside of weather effects like wind flares, it didn’t innovate much. Multiplayer and Horde mode carried the experience, but as a whole, the game played it too safely.

Gears Tactics (2020)
An RTS Gears of War simulator
In 2020, the franchise took a bold leap with Gears Tactics, a turn-based strategy game set 12 years before the original. Fans were skeptical, but to the surprise of many, the experiment worked remarkably well. The story followed Gabe Diaz (Kait’s father), offering a new perspective on the early days of the Locust War while still tying directly into the main story. Gameplay-wise, Gears Tactics borrowed heavily from XCOM but kept the DNA of Gears. Chainsaw executions, overwatch mechanics, and fast-paced combat gave battles a visceral edge. While it didn’t reach the same level of popularity as the mainline shooters, it proved the series could thrive outside of the FPS genre.

Gears of War (Original, 2006)
The one that started it all
Credit: Source: Epic Games
When Gears of War first launched in 2006, it redefined what third-person shooters could be. The introduction of cover-based combat, “active reloads,” and brutal executions made it stand out in a crowded market. The story, though straightforward, had an undeniable impact on gamers of the time. However, compared to later entries, the original feels like a foundation rather than a fully realized vision. Multiplayer was barebones, and the campaign, while iconic, lacked the emotional punch of its sequels. Still, without Gears of War, the series, and arguably the Xbox brand, would not be what it is today.

Gears of War 3 (2011)
A great end to the original trilogy
Gears of War 3 is often remembered as the emotional peak of the series. Released in 2011, it delivered a satisfying and heartbreaking conclusion to Marcus, Dom, and Delta Squad’s story. The fall of humanity, Dom’s tragic sacrifice, and the final confrontation with the Locust Queen all hit with tremendous weight. Gameplay-wise, it was the most polished entry of the original trilogy. Four-player co-op made the campaign a blast with friends, Horde mode 2.0 became a fan-favorite, and new enemy types like the Lambents shook up the combat.

Gears 5 (2019)
The return of the franchise
Credit: Gears 5
With Gears 5, The Coalition finally stepped out of Epic’s shadow. Rather than focusing on J.D., the game shifted its narrative toward Kait Diaz, exploring her mysterious connection to the Locust and the origins of the Swarm. This gamble paid off, with Kait emerging as one of the franchise’s strongest protagonists. The campaign was more ambitious than ever, featuring semi-open world hubs that encouraged exploration and side objectives. While not everyone loved the pacing shift, it gave the series a much-needed breath of fresh air. Gameplay refinements like Jack the robot companion, new weapons, and environmental variety added depth. Meanwhile, Horde and Escape modes gave fans almost unlimited replayability. Gears 5 wasn’t flawless, but it successfully brought the franchise into modern times and onto modern consoles.

Gears of War 2 (2008)
The most impactful story
If the first Gears of War laid the foundation, Gears 2 built the house. This 2008 sequel expanded everything: larger environments, more cinematic storytelling, and some of the most memorable moments in the franchise’s history. The story dove deeper into the toll of war on humanity, with standout moments like Dom finding Maria, a devastating sequence that remains one of gaming’s most emotional cutscenes. Gears of War 2 proved that Gears wasn’t just about big guns and monsters; it could also tell a story about humanity and loss. On the gameplay front, Gears 2 pushed the Unreal Engine to its limits with massive set-pieces like the Riftworm level. Multiplayer was a massive success and stayed popular well after launch. For many fans, it remains the high point of the series, and over a decade later, its legacy still looms large.​​​​​

The story continues in Gears of War: E-Day
Every Gears of War game has contributed something to the series’ DNA, whether through new characters, fresh gameplay twists, or unforgettable stories. While not every game has reached the same heights, Gears of War remains one of the most important shooter franchises in gaming history. With The Coalition continuing to push the series forward, and with Gears of War: E-Day on the way, there’s little doubt that the best may still be yet to come.
