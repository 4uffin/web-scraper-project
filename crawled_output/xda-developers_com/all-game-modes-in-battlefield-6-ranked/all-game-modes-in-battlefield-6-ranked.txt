Few shooters have a legacy as strong as Battlefield, and Battlefield 6 looks set to carry that weight with confidence. DICE has confirmed a robust lineup of multiplayer modes coming to Battlefield 6. With a mix of returning classics and some entirely new modes, here’s every mode in Battlefield 6, ranked from worst to best.

Lock & load for the ultimate all-out warfare experience. Fight in high-intensity infantry combat. Rip through the skies in aerial dogfights. Demolish your environment for a strategic advantage. In a war of tanks, fighter jets, and massive combat arsenals, your squad is the deadliest weapon. This is Battlefield 6.

Battle Royale (Portal)
An unofficial game mode
Battlefield 6 does not have a built-in battle royale at launch. Instead, the Portal mode lets players build custom maps and modes. This means fans could use Portal’s editor to create a large free-for-all mode like a battle royale. In practice, Portal can let the community design their own Battle Royale modes. So, while there’s no official battle royal mode, players can fight in a makeshift battle royale using Portal’s tools.
8
King of the Hill
Hold the point
In King of the Hill, two small squads (eight per side) fight over one capture point on the map. When your team holds the points alone, you score points over time. After a fixed time (one minute), the point is won, disappears, and then reappears elsewhere. This happens up to six times per match. The maps are infantry-only, no vehicles, so expect fast action in close quarters. Victory comes down to holding the points longer than your opponents, creating a cycle of attacks and counterattacks.
7
Domination
Capture the Flag
Domination is like a mini-conquest. Two teams battle over three flags (A, B, C) on a small map. Teams earn points by holding flags. The more flags your team holds, the faster your score goes. If your team has two flags, you score quicker than if you had one. In essence, you capture and defend these three points as fast as possible to reach the score limit and win.
6
Team Deathmatch
A staple in the FPS genre
Battlefield 6
Team Deathmatch is a straightforward mode where two teams (roughly eight players each) enter the battlefield with one goal: rack up more kills than the enemy team. There are no objectives beyond eliminating the enemy. You play on smaller maps, no vehicles, just close-quarters FPS action.
5
Squad Deathmatch
A variation of Team Deathmatch
Squad Deathmatch is a variation of Team Deathmatch, but with more chaos. Instead of two evenly matched teams, there are four squads (each consisting of four players, totaling 16 in all) competing in the same arena. The winner is the team that racks up the most kills by the end of the match. This means more unpredictability: you can get flanked from any angle by any number of other squads. Coordination is key here, and it's always better to have a dedicated group or at least use a microphone to communicate with your teammates.​​
4
Rush
Plant and defuse
Rush is another classic mode returning in Battlefield 6. It takes the Counter-Strike formula and adds some Battlefield magic. The mode is essentially terrorists vs. counter-terrorists, with one team required to plant a bomb somewhere on the map and the other team having to defuse said bomb. Attackers have limited lives, so if they run out of respawns, the round ends. Then the roles switch, and they try again, or until a team wins more rounds.
3
Escalation
Battle royale meets capture the flag
Escalation is Battlefield 6’s newest addition, and it promises to shake up the formula. The mode builds on the DNA of Domination, but with a twist: objectives disappear over time, constantly forcing players to stay on the move. As the available capture points dwindle, the battlefield shrinks, funneling players into increasingly smaller areas until only one area remains contested.
2
Breakthrough
Invasion
Battlefield 6
Here, one side plays as attackers, tasked with invading parts of the map, while the other team has to dig in and defend their territory. Matches in Breakthrough can stretch up to 40 minutes, as defenders attempt to choke off every advance while attackers throw everything they have into pushing the front line forward. The game ends when either team has conquered all the territory or if they successfully hold off the enemy's attack.
1
Conquest
Battlefield bread and butter
Battlefield 6
Conquest is Battlefield’s flagship mode for a reason. It represents the very core of the series’ design: massive open maps, multiple capture points, and battles that ebb and flow over time. Conquest is massive open warfare: it features full infantry battles plus heavy vehicles like tanks, helicopters, and jets. Squads spawn at bases or captured flags. The goal is to work with your squad to capture and defend flags.
Battlefield has something for everyone
Battlefield 6 offers a range of modes for different play styles. The official eight modes at launch cover everything from all-out warfare to quick infantry skirmishes, and Portal now adds even more variety by letting players create custom modes. So, if you haven’t already, make sure to preorder your copy of Battlefield 6 so that you can get into the action at launch.
