Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I‚Äôm 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Compared to expensive PCs and server hardware, Single-Board Computers are an inexpensive means to tinker with DIY projects. However, most of the popular SBC series, including the all-powerful Raspberry Pi series, aren‚Äôt as budget-friendly as they used to be a while ago. Although microcontrollers are an entirely different product than SBCs, there‚Äôs a surprising amount of overlap between the projects you can build with them ‚Äì especially when it comes to circuitry-related ideas. In fact, if you‚Äôre not willing to shell out extra money on a Raspberry Pi but still want to tinker with cool projects, you could turn your attention to the ESP32 family. While projects involving computational workloads are out of the question, there are certain projects you can bring to life with just an ESP32 microcontroller instead of shelling out extra money on a mainline Raspberry Pi board.
Weather station
Be sure to grab the right sensors
If you live in the middle of nowhere like I do, you might have a hard time getting the right temperature, humidity, and pressure statistics. The last one may not be all that consequential, but the temps and humidity are pretty essential when your Home Assistant automations require precise stats for their trigger conditions. That‚Äôs where a self-hosted weather station comes in handy, as it can not only record accurate values, but also refresh them frequently. Thanks to the official environmental sensor HAT, a Raspberry Pi makes for an easy weather station, no doubt about it. But if you‚Äôre willing to put some effort into it, you can build it with just an ESP32 and some sensor modules. Better yet, since ESP32 works well with Home Assistant, you can even configure your DIY weather station to sync its readings with the smart home management platform.
Wi-Fi scanner
Simple, but pretty useful
The Raspberry Pi is great for networking projects, whether you‚Äôre planning to create a simple reverse proxy hub + local DNS server combo or even something as complex as a firewall setup. But if all you want to put together is a simple Wi-Fi scanner that lists all the details of the local networks, you can even go for an inexpensive ESP32. Plus, you don‚Äôt have to be a microcontroller maestro to get the Wi-Fi scanner up and running. The all-powerful Arduino IDE includes an example script for this project, and it works pretty well even on ESP32 boards. It may not be all that breathtaking, but it‚Äôs a great beginner-friendly project where you don‚Äôt have to spend hours creating scripts or attaching obscure sensors to your tinkering companion.
DIY dashboard
Bonus points if you opt for E-Ink displays
Custom dashboards are great for any setup. If you‚Äôre into gaming, a DIY dashboard can showcase the temperature and utilization values of your PC‚Äôs hardware. Alternatively, for folks who love creating cool UIs for their essential smart devices on Home Assistant, putting together a DIY dashboard can help you display your magnum opus. An ESP32-powered dashboard doesn‚Äôt consume too much energy, and since the microcontroller has a tiny footprint, you can hide it fairly easily. Tiny E-ink displays, in particular, mesh really well with ESP32-powered dashboards, and if you‚Äôre into the arcane art of 3D printing, you could put together some beautiful setups with them. Or, you could go for dazzling LED matrix displays, though those require a little bit of elbow grease to configure.
Cheap time-lapse camera
With an ESP32 CAM module
A time-lapse camera is one of the first projects you‚Äôll make with a Raspberry Pi camera module. But if you don‚Äôt want to spend extra on an SBC and are willing to deal with slightly lower quality images than what you‚Äôd be able to capture with a premium camera module, you can go for an inexpensive ESP32 CAM board. Unlike the standard ESP32 microcontroller, the CAM variant includes a camera module and a microSD card slot built into it. Heck, if you‚Äôre willing to write long lines of code, you can create a makeshift security camera from your ESP32 CAM module, one that can display its footage inside a custom web server, no less!
Macro keypad
A great way to increase your productivity
Being able to map frequent key combos to dedicated buttons is quite useful when you‚Äôre into content creation, and that‚Äôs where macro keypads come in handy. On the budget-friendly end, you‚Äôve got tiny keyboard-like devices with keycaps, which aren‚Äôt very intuitive if you keep changing the bindings very often. That‚Äôs when you can look into devices like the Stream Deck and MasterHUB, which use customizable LED buttons. But if you‚Äôre willing to deal with some circuitry components, you can just build macro keypads or Stream Decks with your ESP32 instead of spending hundreds of dollars on these gizmos.
Still, there are reasons why you might want to go with a Raspberry Pi instead
Although an ESP32 is lighter on your wallet for these projects, it has some issues. Like other microcontrollers, you‚Äôll have to deal with a steep difficulty curve when tinkering with an ESP32. Depending on your components, you might have issues finding the right documentation or code libraries for them. Projects like the time-lapse camera (and especially the surveillance camera) can feel somewhat sluggish at high resolutions, as there‚Äôs only so much firepower that can be crammed inside a microcontroller. So, if you value simplicity in your projects or simply want something more versatile, it might be a good idea to forget about everything I said and stick to a Raspberry Pi instead.

Or: wait about two months and buy an entire Pi kit on sale and not have to deal with all of this extra nonsense.

As for the macro keypad (which is great), I
found it useful to remap the numerical pad on my keyboard. AutoHotkey is a beast for this;

Curiously, your article on the time-lapse camera has a link to setting one up using a Raspberry Pi but no link on how to set one up using ESP32 Cam Board. Could the reason for this be that there is much more helpful documentation for Pi projects than for ESP32 projects? Yes, I believe so. Even flashing MicroPython to ESP32 hardware involves a non-standard process and is a headache. No mistake, ESP32 boards are great once you get them up and running, but I would not label them as 'beginner-friendly'.
