Virtual Boy games are coming to the Switch 2 and I am losing my mind
Nintendo has just held its latest Direct showcase going over numerous upcoming games for the Switch and Switch 2. There were some great announcements in there, but none shocked me more than the addition of Virtual Boy to the Nintendo Classics library on both Switch and Switch 2.
The Virtual Boy is infamously Nintendo's worst selling console hardware, recorded at 770,000 units sold worldwide, though the hardware was never launched in Europe. This addition to the Nintendo Classics library is also going to require an add-on that pretty much replicates the look of that original hardware, and it'll be available in all major markets, meaning it's more than likely it will sell more than the original hardware.
I'm just absolutely befuddled that this is happening now, when Nintendo had a perfect opportunity to re-release these games on the 3DS and never did it. But there's no way around the fact that this is at least interesting.

I wish Linux were better on tablets
I've been trying a lot of different things lately when it comes to Linux and operating systems, and earlier this week, I went hands-on with FydeOS on an old 2-in-1 laptop. Suffice it to say, it's easily the best experience you can get on a tablet-like PC, with great, smooth interactions and gestures.
I had a lot of hope that more mainstream Linux distros would have developed better support for tablets, but with the market being relatively small to begin with, I can understand why that's not the case. But with Microsoft fumbling the bag so hard when it comes to... everything, I wish there were more alternatives. That being said, FydeOS is fantastic and I highly recommend it.

Is it a good idea for Linux distros to try to mimic the look and feel of Windows?
Some may argue that making Linux distros resemble Windows can make it easier for users to transition from Windows to Linux, providing a familiar interface. However, others believe that mimicking Windows goes against the open-source ethos of Linux and can lead to security and privacy concerns, as seen with distros like Winux. Ultimately, the decision depends on individual preferences and priorities, but trying something new can feel more liberating.

A virtualization-optimized version of Windows 11 would be awesome
Recently, I found out about a project called WinApps that attempts to run Windows apps on Linux in a seamless way, making them appear integrated into the native desktop. This relies on a full Windows VM paired with a remote desktop tool, but Windows is a hefty OS to run in the background for a setup like this.
It got me thinking it would be a cool idea if Microsoft made a Windows ISO image designed for tinkerers who want to use lightweight VMs or containers, where you can still run all the Windows apps, but without the usual background processes Windows comes with. It would make it way easier to ditch full Windows installs for good.

How far have you progressed into Nightreign's new mode?
It has been a while since Elden Ring Nightreign added the Deep of Night difficulty to the game, with the new mode bringing more powerful enemies, extra relics, and more weapon parameters to the table. It also brings a progression system, where each successful run will net you some rating points. Once you've acquired enough of these points, your depth level will rise, with each successive level increasing the difficulty of the game. In my experience, Depth 1 is fairly easy, while Depth 2 is quite a difficulty curve — even more so when you end up facing the Everdark Sovereign variants of the Night bosses. I've made it to Depth 3 by playing with my friends, and I'm only a two hundred points away from hitting Depth 4. But that's just me. What depth level are you at in Nightreign?

I finally applied a skin to my Switch 2, and it's so much nicer than a grip
When I reviewed the Dbrand Killswitch a while back, I noted that it seems to do its job well, but I just don't find this kind of product that appealing. I would much rather use a typical travel case, and more recently, I even noticed how I didn't even want to play with the grips, either.
However, I was starting to worry that my hand grease would wear down the plastic on my Joy-Con 2, so I finally bit the bullet and bought a skin from Dbrand. And it turns out, I was right, I like this way more than using a grip. I do already find the Joy-Con 2 quite comfortable, and the skin looks really cool on it. I will say the measurements seem to be a fraction of a millimeter off, and aligning with + button means that the skin is just a smidge too high for the other buttons, particularly B, Home, and the C button. But so far it still seems totally usable, and it looks great.

What's your favorite Linux distro?
As you may know, I've become a very big fan of Linux over the past few months, and my primary laptop now runs Arch linux with KDE Plasma. I love using it and find it much more fun than Windows, but I also know there's a huge world of distros out there for all kinds of people.
So I'm curious what your favorites are. Do you use Arch? NixOS? Maybe something more user-friendly like Ubuntu or Linux Mint? I'd love to hear your thoughts!

Do you prioritize network security over raw speed when it comes to your home network setup?
People's priorities may vary, but for those running home labs or concerned about the security of their network, investing in a custom firewall with advanced security features could be more valuable than simply increasing bandwidth. However, for average users focused on streaming and browsing, speed might be the primary concern. Do you value speed over security, or is it the other way around?
