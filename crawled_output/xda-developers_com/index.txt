Virtual Boy games are coming to the Switch 2 and I am losing my mind
Nintendo has just held its latest Direct showcase going over numerous upcoming games for the Switch and Switch 2. There were some great announcements in there, but none shocked me more than the addition of Virtual Boy to the Nintendo Classics library on both Switch and Switch 2.
The Virtual Boy is infamously Nintendo's worst selling console hardware, recorded at 770,000 units sold worldwide, though the hardware was never launched in Europe. This addition to the Nintendo Classics library is also going to require an add-on that pretty much replicates the look of that original hardware, and it'll be available in all major markets, meaning it's more than likely it will sell more than the original hardware.
I'm just absolutely befuddled that this is happening now, when Nintendo had a perfect opportunity to re-release these games on the 3DS and never did it. But there's no way around the fact that this is at least interesting.

I wish Linux were better on tablets
I've been trying a lot of different things lately when it comes to Linux and operating systems, and earlier this week, I went hands-on with FydeOS on an old 2-in-1 laptop. Suffice it to say, it's easily the best experience you can get on a tablet-like PC, with great, smooth interactions and gestures.
I had a lot of hope that more mainstream Linux distros would have developed better support for tablets, but with the market being relatively small to begin with, I can understand why that's not the case. But with Microsoft fumbling the bag so hard when it comes to... everything, I wish there were more alternatives. That being said, FydeOS is fantastic and I highly recommend it.

A virtualization-optimized version of Windows 11 would be awesome
Recently, I found out about a project called WinApps that attempts to run Windows apps on Linux in a seamless way, making them appear integrated into the native desktop. This relies on a full Windows VM paired with a remote desktop tool, but Windows is a hefty OS to run in the background for a setup like this.
It got me thinking it would be a cool idea if Microsoft made a Windows ISO image designed for tinkerers who want to use lightweight VMs or containers, where you can still run all the Windows apps, but without the usual background processes Windows comes with. It would make it way easier to ditch full Windows installs for good.

Is it a good idea for Linux distros to try to mimic the look and feel of Windows?
Some may argue that making Linux distros resemble Windows can make it easier for users to transition from Windows to Linux, providing a familiar interface. However, others believe that mimicking Windows goes against the open-source ethos of Linux and can lead to security and privacy concerns, as seen with distros like Winux. Ultimately, the decision depends on individual preferences and priorities, but trying something new can feel more liberating.

Multiple cheaper GPUs vs. flagship GPU?
On one hand, using multiple cheaper GPUs can provide a balance of performance and cost savings, especially when leveraging older hardware. It also offers some redundancy in case one GPU fails. On the other hand, a single high-end GPU may offer better overall performance and simplicity, without the need for complex configuration and management of multiple cards. The choice ultimately depends on budget, specific requirements, and the value placed on performance versus convenience. Which camp are you in?

Should annual Windows features include new updates, or be boring?
I recently wrote a very personal piece on why Windows 11 updates are boring and how I much prefer the Apple approach of adding notable new features with the majority of annual updates. Microsoft's strategy is more about rolling out new features whenever they're ready, which makes it a little less interesting to follow the developments.
However, I'm sure many people don't care about updates at all and just want a functional computer. Are you someone who enjoys getting big new feature updates, or do you prefer the more boring and upredictable pace of Windows 11 releases?

Borderlands 4 might have issues, but it has me hooked
Whelp, Gearbox has done it again. Another Borderlands release, hang on one sec, another broken Borderlands release, but it doesn't matter. The looter shooter has got its claws into the dopamine factories in my brain, and it won't let go. I'm not sure if I like the vault hunters on offer this time around (although two unknowns are coming in DLC, so maybe I'll enjoy one of those as much as I loved Krieg the Psycho from BL2), but damn, if the guns don't feel great, the writing (for the side-quests anyway) is spot on, and the dopamine hits from every green glowing container when I pop it open. I'm sure there's a main storyline somewhere, but all I can see is containers to open, shinies to pick up, and cel-shaded baddies to stomp.

I have to go back to Windows and I'm not happy about it
Recently, I was offered a chance to review a product ahead of its launch (I'm not at liberty to share what it is yet), and unfortunately, the vast majority of its features are only available on Windows. I've been using macOS as my main OS for a good while now, and I'm not looking forward to going back to a Windows machine.
That being said, this is also a good opportunity to test Raycast for Windows more extensively, seeing as it just recently became available and I haven't had as much time with it as I would like. Still, the idea of using a Windows PC full time isn't particularly exciting.
