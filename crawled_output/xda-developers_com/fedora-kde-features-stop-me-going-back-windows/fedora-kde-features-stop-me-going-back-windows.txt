3 Fedora KDE Plasma features that stop me going back to Windows

Simon is a Computer Science BSc graduate who has been writing about technology since 2014, and using Windows machines since 3.1. After working for an indie game studio and acting as the family's go-to technician for all computer issues, he found his passion for writing and decided to use his skill set to write about all things tech.
Since beginning his writing career, he has written for many different publications such as WorldStart, Listverse, and MakeTechEasier. However, after finding his home at MakeUseOf in February 2019, he has been working with it and its sister website, XDA, to bring the latest and greatest in Windows, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity topics.

Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like Iâ€™m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
People migrate from Windows to Linux for a multitude of different reasons; for me, it was to give my aging PC a second lease on life after the Windows 10 end-of-life date arrives. Yes, I could force an upgrade to Windows 11. Yes, I could extend my Windows 10 security license another year. But I'm not a fan of Windows 11, and I don't want to be stuck on an operating system that won't receive any new content updates ever again. So, I decided to give Linux a try, with the worst-case scenario being that I return, tail between my legs, and grovel at Microsoft's feet to be let back in. Fortunately, after a few months, that hasn't happened; I've been sticking to Fedora KDE Plasma and really enjoying it. So, here are some features I really like in Fedora KDE Plasma that make me want to use it instead of Windows.
The updates are actually exciting and fun
Remember, looking forward to updates?
For me, Windows updates are at best boring and at worst, a downgrade. I'm really not a fan of Microsoft pushing Copilot into every area of its ecosystem, and with every iteration, the AI assistant manages to sneak into another area of the operating system. They have Copilot in Notepad, for crying out loud! I can't speak with utmost authority, as I've only been using Linux for a few months now; however, from what I've read and experienced, different Linux distros have different update schedules. Some distros get updates at a glacial pace, which may be boring to some, but makes them ideal for people who prefer to stick with a specific OS version for weeks or months on end. Others are far quicker and are better-suited for people who want the bleeding edge of what Linux can do. From what I've seen, Fedora is in the latter camp. I want to say I see system-based updates every other day, on average. Now, for a Windows user, that sounds like a nightmare; however, Fedora is very polite about how it handles updates. It doesn't auto-download updates if you don't want it to, and once it's done, you're not nagged to restart. Fedora has somehow created an OS that receives frequent updates without being annoying whatsoever. Microsoft, take notes. And I haven't even gotten into the KDE half of Fedora KDE Plasma yet. If you're unaware, "Fedora" is the distro, and "KDE Plasma" is the optional desktop environment bundled with Fedora. You can get Fedora without KDE, which uses GNOME, but I honestly really like KDE. KDE itself receives updates that introduce new features, so it's essentially a two-for-one deal when it's time to update your system.
I can uninstall the apps that the OS came with
I know! It's wild!
Stop me if I'm talking nonsense: I think people should have the option to uninstall the apps that come pre-installed on their devices. And I don't mean using a third-party tool or a registry hack; I mean going to the uninstallation page, selecting the app you don't want, and removing it. While Fedora KDE Plasma comes with a few apps pre-installed, you can easily remove them if you prefer. There was an email client I wasn't using that came with the system, and it kept generating dialogue boxes, so I removed it. It felt weird to uninstall a default app, given the years of having to make do with them.
Fedora KDE Plasma does Windows better than Windows
Why use something that's less effective?
One of the big reasons I dislike Windows 11 is that it scraps features that have been a part of the operating system ecosystem for decades. Worst of all, there's no real reason why the features are gone. Why can't you resize the Start menu? Why can't you move the Taskbar wherever you want? Why can't you add widgets to the Taskbar? It's odd. Fedora KDE Plasma (more specifically, the KDE side) doesn't have that issue. I can resize the Start menu, move the Taskbar around, and even add custom widgets to the Taskbar. Pretty much all the stuff I got used to in Windows 10 that went missing in Windows 11 persisted in Fedora KDE Plasma, so it feels like it does Windows better than Windows itself.
I think I'll stay right where I am
What started as an experiment to see if I could wean myself off Windows became my daily driver, and honestly, I don't want to go back to Windows anymore. Fedora KDE Plasma ticks all the boxes for me, and going back to Windows 10 or upgrading to Windows 11 would feel like a downgrade.

I made the switch myself. My distro of choice is Garuda Dr460nized KDE.I have been a fan of Linux for a long time now. I started exploring it back in the mid-late 2000s with Ubuntu. However, the one thing that always brought me back to Windows was gaming. Gaming on Linux before the Steam Deck was anemic.Ubuntu used to be pretty good, but I ran into a number of issues with it this go round, such as Steam not wanting to let me set one of my secondary drives (which are installed specifically for installing games on), that made me go in a different direction.Despite some issues with the initial setup process at first that would brick the OS on reboot (something I discovered is only partially user error, partially dev error for not forcing a necessary reboot after kernel updates), I have come to really enjoy Garuda. The only reason I have to keep Windows installed now is to update the firmware on my Wireless Elite Series 2 controller.Until I get an Xbox.

It should be called Microsuck Windows in my opinion.
Nobody in their right mind should use it.
NASA and airlines use Linux because it's a mission critical operating system with freedom of desktop choice.

Automated background updates will be enabled by default for Fedora Atomic 43 desktop editions. This includes Budgie, Kinoite, Silverblue, and Cosmic. This means that the core OS updates will be automatically downloaded and staged in the background. In the same manner as ChromeOS, the user will only be notified that a reboot is required to apply the update after it has been fully staged in the background. The updates are applied during the next reboot.

I'm not a fan-boy, but I do appreciate that when I need to use someone else's computer Win11 computer, everything is right where it's expected to be.
Standarization sounds bad but it has its advantages.
Unfortunately, MS creativity is slow, but it has to be to work without subjecting users to the CLI.
I've changed my start menu with Winhawk, but not in any meaningful way.

ImChipBrown KDE Plasma has something super-smart called K-Runner and GNOME has something similar called Activities Search. While the desktop is selected, you just start typing what you wan to do, and K-Runner pops up, figures out where that action is, shows it on a dynamic dropdown menu, and takes you directly to the place that you select from the menu. I'm not saying that Windows doesn't have some of that same functionality. But Linux desktop environments offer pretty much everything that Windows does. Windows is NOT missed at all.

Now that you have played around with Fedora, treat yourself to EndeavourOS or CachyOS both Arch Linux distributions.
