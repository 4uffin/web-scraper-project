Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like Iâ€™m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Outside quick questions, I often don't turn to Google or even AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini when I need real answers. More often than not, I end up on Reddit. Now, here's the issue with Reddit: it's extremely easy to get sidetracked and fall into a rabbit hole of endless threads. Before you know it, you've spent hours and hours scrolling through random Reddit posts, even when the original question that brought you there was solved long, long ago. So, I was looking for a way to solve that problem. Given that I've paired NotebookLM with pretty much every productivity tool I use on a daily like Slack, Excel, Google Docs, and even my daily browser, Perplexity Comet, I wondered what it could do with Reddit â€” one of the platforms where I lose the most time? So, that's exactly what I decided to do.
First up, hereâ€™s how I set it up
Myndo makes it quick and effortless
When I typically pair NotebookLM with productivity tools, most of them produce a neat export file that I can drop right into NotebookLM. With Reddit, I had to take a different approach since there really isn't a built-in option to move posts or comments over in one click. My next option is usually using a Chrome extension to quickly import sources to NotebookLM, but that unfortunately didn't work out with Reddit. For some reason, all of the Chrome extensions would only import the usernames of the Redditors who posted and commented, along with a bunch of random metadata, but none of the actual post content. Not exactly useful when what I really needed was the discussion itself. Thankfully, I knew just the extension I needed to avoid this problem: Myndo. Though this extension isn't specifically designed for NotebookLM, it's built to make feeding data to any AI tool as smooth as possible. Myndo lets you clip any content you come across online into Markdown, which makes it easier for Large Language Models (LLMs) to process. The Chrome extension also takes it one step further by adding tags and instructions that allow AI tools to prioritize certain sources, and it lets you add Custom Instructions, AI-specific notes detailing how your clipped content should be treated. All the data you clip is structured in a way that allows AI tools to prioritize the right information and focus on what matters. What Myndo does is add the sources you clip to a Google Docs document. Every time you want to clip new data, you can either append it to the same Google Doc or create a new one. From there, it's just a matter of importing that document into NotebookLM. The reason why Myndo is perfect for importing Reddit posts is because it lets you manually select just the content you'd like to add. When you're adding a source to a Myndo notebook, you'll notice a Selection option that lets you hover over a paragraph and selectively clip just that section. With Reddit posts, hovering your cursor right below the first comment on the post tends to select the entire comments section. Just make sure you click the Load more comments button. Otherwise, NotebookLM will only see the first batch of replies and miss out on the rest of the discussion. Once everything is loaded, though, Myndo grabs the whole thread cleanly, strips away the clutter, and drops it into your Google Doc.
I instantly drop Reddit posts into NotebookLM and dive deeper
The easiest way to save time
Whenever I come across a Reddit post I'm even remotely interested in, I don't spend time reading the entire post and comments. Instead, I use Myndo to add it to NotebookLM instantly. This way, I know I won't fall into the rabbit hole of endless threads and waste hours on Reddit. Since I tend to browse through Reddit a lot for work as well, there are times when I come across posts Iâ€™d like to dig deeper into later. In those cases, I simply use Myndo to add it to a NotebookLM notebook and explore it when I have more time. Once the post has been added to NotebookLM, I use prompts like the one below to quickly get a gist of what the post is about â€” from both the Redditor who made it and the commentersâ€™ point of view:
Give me a clear, structured summary of this Reddit post. Start with the original posterâ€™s main point, context, or question. Then break down the key themes and perspectives from the comments, grouping similar opinions together. Highlight any disagreements, useful insights, or unique points of view. Finally, explain how the overall tone of the discussion shifts between the OP and the commenters, and what the general consensus (if any) seems to be.
I don't use this exact prompt every time, and instead tweak it based on the context of the Reddit post I'm adding to NotebookLM. Whatâ€™s great about pairing NotebookLM with Reddit is that getting a quick summary of a post I want to explore isnâ€™t all it can do. Once I have an idea of what the post is about, I ask targeted questions to dig deeper into specific parts of the discussion. My personal favorite, though, is converting lengthy Reddit posts I donâ€™t want to read into deep dive discussions. While you can choose from different formats like Debate and Critique, my go-to is the default Deep Dive, since itâ€™s structured in a podcast-style format. Two hosts discuss the sources you upload in an engaging way, breaking them down so it feels conversational rather than like a dry summary. I canâ€™t count the number of Reddit posts Iâ€™ve consumed this way while on a bus ride or working on something else. It turns content that would normally demand my full attention into something passive and enjoyable. NotebookLM also has other features you can use to engage with content better, like Mind Maps, which are perfect when a Reddit post branches off into multiple directions.
Iâ€™ll never scroll Reddit the old way again
I'm not exaggerating when I say this â€” pairing NotebookLM and Reddit has helped me save hours and hours. If you're like me and are tired of falling into endless rabbit holes, this combo makes it so much easier to get the answers you need without wasting your day away.

So if I understand you correctly you have one notebook where you add the file as source, then get insights and remove the thread/source again..? If you keep dumping different Reddit threads into the same Notebook (and keep them) I would like to understand how your prompt knows which thread you're referring to..?

Reddit already has an AI section now doesn't it? Where it parses information from all subreddits?

Old.Reddit still has related posts on the side plus if you see an interesting comment from someone, you may want to look at their profile.
