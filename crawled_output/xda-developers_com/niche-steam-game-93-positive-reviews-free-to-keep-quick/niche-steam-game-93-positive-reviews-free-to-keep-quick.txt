Press Any Button returns to normal pricing
Press Any Button's free window has now expired, but you can still grab it from the link before for just $2.
Free giveaways on Steam can come in all shapes and sizes. Sometimes they'll be free to claim for a week, and sometimes they'll only go on a 100% discount for 24 hours. As such, if you want to snag some free games, it's always good to keep your eyes peeled for them. Well, if you're feeling fast, you can pick up a little-known yet well-received game for absolutely nothing. Press Any Button is now free to claim, but you have until 12 pm EST on September 17th to claim it before it's back to full price.
Press Any Button is free, if you're fast
On Steam, Press Any Button is now free to claim for 24 hours. It was released in January 2021, and since then, it has garnered 193 reviews, with 93% of them being positive. So, it's clearly doing something right. Here's how the developers describe the game:
PRESS ANY BUTTON is an arcade-style game. It has a big emphasis on story, but it will also put your reflexes to a test!
The game introduces a weird but sweet character named A-Eye. He is an artificial intelligence created to process data for important scientific research. When he gets bored with this assignment, he decides to turn the research into a video game. The fact that he can't draw game assets or compose music and knows nothing about game design is not going to stop him.
A-Eye will be extremely glad if you become an impartial critic for him. Make your own opinion on the game he's been working on and find out his story full of life, death, rain, and dandelions.
The developers also claim that the game will last approximately an hour. If you want to give it a go, head over to the Press Any Button Steam page and claim it before time runs out. And if you missed out on the deal, the game is only $2, so it's still worth grabbing if you like the sound of it.
