A keyboard that's great for all uses, and compatible with pretty much any device with a popular following. The feature that makes this one stand out is its Qi wireless charging, and it's newly discounted price that drops it to just $36.

Zagg is probably best known for its screen protectors, but also offers a wide range of accessories for mobile devices. And while you can find keyboards from plenty of other brands, the Pro Keyboard 12 features a nice perk of being able to charge the device using Qi wireless charging. Of course, you also get a keyboard that's comfortable to type on, along with compatibility with a number of high-profile devices. And perhaps what makes this accessory interesting at this particular point is the huge discount we're seeing from Amazon, knocking nearly 50% off the original retail price, falling to just $36 for a limited time.
Compact, feature-packed, and Qi wireless charging

When it comes to the design, you're getting something that has a little more character. But the important thing here is that the typing experience is quite comfortable. The Pro Keyboard 12 works with Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, iOS, and Android. So no matter what device you have, you can feel confident that this keyboard will work with it.
The great part is that you can pair up to three devices at one time with this keyboard, making it easy to switch from one device to another. You also get excellent battery life, with up to three months of use before it needs to be charged. Again, you'll have two options here, with wired charging via USB-C, and wireless using Qi.
The latter is a bit more novel to find on a keyboard and could make charging this keyboard as easy as sliding it onto a charging puck when you're done for the day. Not a bad keyboard to have for home, office, or on the go. So, if you've been looking for something new, this keyboard might be just what you're looking for.
