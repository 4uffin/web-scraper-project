Summary
Hardware YouTubers are convening in Seattle near Valve HQ—Steam Frame reveal looks imminent.
Many visitors are VR creators, making a Valve headset announcement likelier than a Deck 2.
Social posts, winks, and "emergency" videos point to an arranged, possibly exclusive hands-on event.
If you've been keeping up with gaming hardware news, you'll know that Valve has been working on a project called the "Steam Frame." We don't know a great deal about the project, only that Valve is working hard at it right now. Well, I don't mean to alarm anyone, but several popular hardware YouTubers have suddenly, collectively decided to either take a trip over to Seattle (where Valve's HQ is) or take some time off for tomorrow specifically. It could just be nothing, or it could be absolutely everything.
A Steam Frame reveal may be imminent as YouTubers hint at something happening tomorrow
Over on the Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit (thanks, PC Gamer!), people are collating a list of PC hardware YouTubers and influencers who have seemingly either dropped everything to go to Seattle or suddenly opened their schedule for Wednesday. For example, we have this post by @NathieVR, who recently touched down in Seattle:
@CasandChary made a post on X about not attending Meta Connect, and when someone subtly hinted that they might instead be checking out the Steam Frame, they simply replied with a wink:
Plus, Habie147 made this post on their Discord, where they discuss the first-ever Wednesday video they'll ever upload:
I am busily editing tomorrow’s emergency Wednesday video so there is no stream tonight. See you all tomorrow on the…. (REDACTED)
So, if we assume they are travelling to Valve HQ to check out the Steam Frame specifically, what can we expect? You may already be familiar with some of the names I mentioned above, as they are prominent VR users. As such, if Valve really is corralling VR content creators to its home base all at once, there's a good chance that it's about to reveal a headset of its own. It's also a sign that it's probably not a Steam Deck 2 or some other hardware the company has been working on. If it really is the Steam Frame and it ends up being a VR headset, I'm really curious as to how Valve can make its own product stand out. The company isn't known for just releasing products "just because" and will only do so when it feels it can make a significant advancement in certain areas. As such, there's a good chance it'll be standalone like the Meta Quest, but surely there'd be more. In the meantime, check out these VR games you've never heard of.

Could it be like a giant 65" steam deck that you'd have in your living room, and be able to play games on it and watch movies and shows?

I'd rather have my living room display and console be separate unless Valve nails the idea.
