Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Windows 11 comes with a wide range of obscure features you might never know about. One of those is Dev Drive, a new type of storage volume designed for developers that can be very helpful to speed things up. If you're a developer, either professionally or as a hobbyist, a Dev Drive is a great potential addition to your Windows install. If you're not familiar, and you're wondering why that is, let me explain.
It's faster
Some notable improvements
Dev Drives are a different kind of storage volume compared to the typical drives on your PC. They leverage the new ReFS file system created by Microsoft, and they include a set of targeted optimizations to improve performance for the files stored in that drive. It supports features like copy-on-write (though in a limited fashion compared to ZFS or Btrfs) to speed up write performance, too. What's more, Dev Drives have the ability to be trusted by Microsoft Defender, the anti-malware solution built into Windows 11, which enables "performance mode". What this means is that Microsoft Defender won't consume resources trying to scan every file on the drive repeatedly, and thus, writing and reading from it is significantly faster. Microsoft has shared some of its own testing on this, and across different types of development projects, Dev Drives can deliver up to 41% faster performance.
For a git task like cloning the NodeJS repo locally, the performance difference is 41%, but even where the percentage difference is smaller, it's noticeable. When building OrchardCore with DotNet, you get a 22% improvement, but on the hardware Microsoft used for the comparison, that's roughly a full minute shaved off the build time. It's a pretty big deal for a developer since it will save you a ton of time and help you be more productive.
It's secure
As long as you know what you're doing
You may have read the above and thought it's risky for Microsoft Defender to stop scanning your Dev Drive to the same extent as your main drives, and while that could be true, it shouldn't be. Dev drives aren't meant to replace your main hard drive, and you shouldn't use them to store your typical files downloaded from the internet. Microsoft recommends that you use your Dev Drive to store your source code repositories and project files, package caches, and build output along with intermediate files. Essentially, the Dev Drive should only contain files created by you or someone you trust during development. It's not meant to have installed apps such as Visual Studio or anything else. If you stick to Microsoft's guidelines, there's no notable security risk. You do need a bit of extra care compared to a typical drive, but as a developer, you should already be aware of security best practices.
Flexible and portable
Choose your preferred approach
Dev Drives are a flexible tool, too. You can create a Dev Drive in two ways, favoring either performance or flexibility. If you choose to create a Dev Drive on a physical partition on your hard drive, you can get slightly improved performance as the drive directly interfaces with the disk without any virtual layers. However, this approach is less flexible, as the drive is physically tied to the disk and can't be moved. Thankfully, Windows also gives you the option to create a Dev Drive on a virtual hard drive, or VHD. This is essentially a file that acts as a drive, and it's often used for things like virtual machines, but it can also be used in cases like this. Because of the virtual disk layer, using a VHD file is slightly slower for a Dev Drive, but you have additional flexibility because the VHD file can dynamically resize depending on how much storage you're actually using (instead of always taking the maximum size), plus the VHD file is portable, so you can take that drive and move it to another PC to continue your work elsewhere.
Microsoft does advise against moving a Dev Drive and then continuing to use it as a Dev Drive on a different PC, but the simple fact that you can move your data over is a notable benefit.
Just be careful what you use it for
As cool as Dev Drives are, they're designed with a specific purpose, and you shouldn't try to use them for other purposes just for the sake of faster speeds. Disabling additional protections from Microsoft Defender is a risk you shouldn't take on a drive you use to store downloaded files and installed apps. That will expose you to a lot of potential dangers that could seriously compromise your security. In theory, if you're absolutely sure you can trust the files you put on a Dev Drive, you could potentially use it for faster performance overall, but it's a major risk for the vast majority of scenarios. If you're a developer, though, Dev Drives make a ton of sense and could make you much more productive. Microsoft has played around with a few different developer-oriented features, including Dev Home, but while that app was recently discontinued, there's a reason Dev Drives have stuck around.
