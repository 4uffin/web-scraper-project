Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
We've covered many budget and mid-range gaming builds on XDA, but non-gaming PCs haven't gotten any attention lately. Well, this build guide intends to do just that. Non-gamers either build a no-nonsense starter build for a home office and casual gaming, or a workstation for professional needs. I intend to take the former as a foundation and tweak it accordingly for a performance-oriented rig, recommending components for each of the two builds.
CPU and graphics card
Budget 6-core or powerful 8-core
Starting with the, well, starter build, I've picked an affordable CPU that's more than enough for any budget rig. The Core i5-12400 might be old, but it hasn't lost its charm yet. Priced at only around $140, this 6-core, 12-thread chip is great for any budget gaming PC, but even for non-gamers, it brings decent performance and integrated graphics. You can always upgrade to, say, the Core i7-12700K or Core i9-12900K on the same motherboard for a massive performance boost. Adding a discrete graphics card for heavier productivity workloads is also simple, considering the power supply and case I've picked for this build. For performance-oriented users, I'd recommend swapping the 12th Gen, 6-core chip for the Core Ultra 7 265K. For just $300, this Arrow Lake processor provides you with Core i9-14900K and Ryzen 9 7950X levels of performance in most workloads (it suffers a bit in Adobe Photoshop). Most users don't need to spend close to $450 on a 14900K or 7950X for top-notch productivity performance; the Core Ultra 7 265K is quite potent. The graphics card for this build should ideally be one with ample VRAM, but in the Nvidia camp (which is generally recommended for productivity), that will cost you at least $750 (for the RTX 5070 Ti). Hence, I've recommended the RTX 5070 for around $530 — its 12GB VRAM and decent performance for the price make it a good pick for most productivity applications. The RTX 5060 Ti has 16GB of VRAM, but it's in a different performance league than that of the RTX 5070.

The Intel Core i5-12400 is a solid entry into the budget space. It's still a great processor for a budget gaming or non-gaming build.

Motherboard, RAM, and storage
All the performance without the premium
For the starter build with a $140 CPU, I can't recommend anything other than a budget motherboard. The ASRock B760 Pro RS is an ATX motherboard with three Gen4 M.2 slots, capable VRMs for future CPU upgrades, and a Gen5 PCIe slot for any discrete GPUs you want to install later. The I/O isn't too bad either, and you get a heatsink for the primary M.2 slot. In the memory department, a 16GB stick would be right at home, but you'd eventually need 32GB RAM (sooner than later), and mixing DIMMs has the potential to create issues down the line. Besides, a 32GB kit doesn't cost much more than a 16GB DIMM, so the Crucial Pro Overclocking DDR5-6000 32GB kit is what I finally picked. Besides the 32GB capacity, it also provides 6,000MT/s of transfer speed, more than enough for most applications. The Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB SSD is my pick for the storage drive — you can add more storage later using the spare M.2 slots. Coming to the performance-oriented rig, you'll need a stronger motherboard for the Core Ultra 7 265K. Hence, the Gigabyte Z890 Aorus Elite WiFi7 is my pick, thanks to the value it provides for just $200 — excellent construction, superior VRMs, four M.2 slots, including one supporting PCIe 5.0, Thunderbolt 4, Wi-Fi 7, 2.5Gb Ethernet, and screwless slots. Since performance is the focus of this build, the Teamgroup T-Force Delta RGB DDR5-7600 32GB kit would be the sweet spot, considering the transfer speeds and price. The Samsung 990 Evo Plus 2TB will be the main drive this time around, complemented by the 4TB Seagate Barracuda hard drive for secondary storage.

PSU, case, and cooler
Keeping the priorities straight
The starter build doesn't need a beefy power supply, but we also need to account for future upgrades. To balance that need with affordability, I picked the MSI MAG A750BN PCIE 5 power supply, an affordable 750W, Bronze-rated unit with enough chops to handle reasonable CPU and GPU upgrades down the line. The Zalman i3 Neo is a fantastic case for the price, considering the four pre-installed fans, great airflow, and impressive looks. The Core i5-12400 works perfectly fine with the stock cooler, so you don't need an aftermarket cooler for this build. The power supply for the performance build doesn't need to be overkill; the MSI MAG 850GL is sufficient. It's an 850W, Gold-rated, modular PSU with ATX 3.1 and PCIe 5.1 support, and a 10-year warranty. The case I've picked is the NZXT H9 Flow due to its spacious interiors, striking design, top-tier airflow, and support for almost any future upgrades. Finally, the Core Ultra 7 265K can work with a decent air cooler, but if you're overclocking it or planning to upgrade to a beefier CPU later, the Thermaltake TH360 V2 ARGB Sync is a 360mm liquid cooler that provides plenty of cooling for an attractive price.

Non-gaming builds come with different priorities
The difference between building a gaming and a productivity PC lies in only a few choices. Where the focus in the former is on the graphics card, the CPU shines in the latter. Of course, faster storage, more memory, and better cooling also matter more in a productivity build, since you need the maximum performance and want to push the components to the limit. Gaming builds also require quality components, but you can often enjoy the same performance with a strong GPU and value picks in the other departments.

RTX 5070 for a non-gamer???
Negative...
Just get an AMD CPU with the integrated graphics.
This recommendation doesn't make sense to me at all.

Don't bother with Intel. Sure you can save
20-40$ now, but there is no upgrade path, and AMD typically have better options for around the same cost. I'd recommend a 7600X or 9700X instead of the Intel parts recommended here. Also check the applications you intend to use. It's common for the layman to just think Nvidia is better for productivity (such as the author), but a lot of applications support acceleration on AMD (like adobe, davinci, and photography studios). You can save some money and get more vram or better performance by considering a 9000 series.

Generally I agree, but if you are aiming for any AI/ML things, Nvidia is still the way to go. More expensive, less vram... But you can't compare Linux drivers, AMD is still far behind in that aspect

Zoran that hasn't been the case for years, now. AMD's drivers are much better on Linux these days.

I get that intel needs to be saved for the long term benefits of consumer to provide a competition to AMD, but frankly, buying an intel cpu makes little sense unless they mend their ways. They provide no upgrade path, lock bios features, limit overclocking and many such little irritations that make them a bad choice for anyone capable enough to read this article and assemble his/her own PC

Want cheap and don't game? Forget building. Buy one of those micro pc SOC boxes. I replaced an ancient i3 box with an N100 Adler Lake one. It runs rings around my old i3 ssd upgraded box. 16gb DDR4, 512gb m2 pci stick, wifi, 1gb ethtnet, 2 HDMI, USB2, 3, 3.1 ports 2 front 3 back) for... choke... $139.00. UHD graphics, supports 3 4k monitors, Win 11 pro. Sorry, but no moreI've been building since my first computer. Anyone remember SW Tecnical Products? A 6800 DIY Smoke Signal Chieftan. Yeah, I'm an old dude but when you put together a 32" 4k monitor ($169.00 a bit more for a 120 hz refresh one if you do end up gaming in the future) N100 box above, add a logitech wireless keyboard/mouse (K310, M310 $30,00 or so, haven't bought a new one in years AND it's touch type able). $450.00 bucks all in, and if at some point you do pony up for a gaming rig, it's all reusable except the $139.00 box. Even if you do, keep that setup use to hook to the big screen and use it for a stream box. It has the extra 2280 M2 sata III slot inside, so add in a big cheap sata stick to hold your media. Need more? Get a cheap SAN box and go crazy. I was so impressed, I replaced my ancient i7 box with an i9-8950hk micro box. 16 GB ram, 1tb M2 stick, etc, etc. for... choke... $239.00. Again, comes with Win 11 Pro, so no future software breaks from forcing my old i7 to run 11. I ran a few older and new lighter weight games on it with neighbors kiddo and it worked a bit better than his gamer box, which pissed him off. My game of choice of game? Zork of course. I started on adventure running on a CDC cyber and Cray 1 service bureau. The ultimate game! GOOOO super cheap!

I don't agree with some of this, having built a non-gaming machine not so long ago.I'd rather buy the rtx4060ti 16GB over the 5070 12 GB, even for the same money. Vram is all that matters. And 4060ti is cheaper.Ddr5 is a waste of money, for most people. Both for the ram and mbo. I've made this mistake myself.i5 12400 comes with the UHD730 iGPu. For fractionally more money get a CPU with the UHD770. iGPU can come in handy to offload the GPU (e.g. Frigate object detection). It's not worth cheaping out for a few bucksFlashy white case with disco lights, and an equally flashy aio cooler are totally needless... for any build. That is for kids who want to show off, not for workstations. A proper workstation has zero rgb nonsense.Also quoting better WiFi in MBO specs is ridiculous. It should even be mentioned. WiFi is for laptops, not desktop rigs, even less for workstations. Better to suggest a MBO with 2.4 or 10G NIC, or a pcie NIC for that price difference.

Cant understand the hate towards intel. Im happy with my i7-14700k. Enough cores for everything and boost is 5.5 or something like that. Talking about upgrading feels stupid. Amd4 new cpus arent that magical compared the original am4 cpu's...why to even upgrade to old socket...am6 comes in next year...
