If you're thinking about building your first NAS, or just need to upgrade the storage space for the one that you already own, these Seagate Barracuda drives are going to be right up your alley. They are reliable, durable, and more importantly, on sale for a very limited time, which is going to save you some money. While Seagate has a long list of options, this promotion is going to be for the 16TB and 24TB models, as they drop to their lowest prices.
Can't go wrong with Seagate
It can be intimidating to build your first NAS, with so many different hardware options, and each part being a vital component that will need to carry its weight for a long time. Luckily, when it comes to HDDs, you'll get a pretty good experience sticking with major brands like Seagate. It's important to note that while Seagate and other drives are fairly reliable, they will all eventually go out at some point. So, whatever you can get your hands on at the time will be crucial to keeping your budget in check in the long run. When it comes to the specifications of the Seagate BarraCuda, you're looking at drives that spin at 7,200RPM with a 512MB cache and performance that reaches up to 6Gb/s. These drives are built for sustained access, which is what makes them different from normal HDDs. As far as discounts go, the 24TB HDD is now $60 off, coming in at $240, which is the lowest price we've seen from Newegg. The 16TB model is $20 off, falling to $190. Just be sure to grab these drives quickly because the deals won't be around for long.
