Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
It's that time of the year again! September is here, and with it comes IFA, one of the biggest trade shows in the tech industry, bringing us tons of new announcements and products to gawk at. And of course, that's exactly what we did, so we're here to show you the best of what we saw at this year's IFA show in Berlin. From laptops with a rotating display to unbelievably thin smartphones, here are some of the very best products coming out of IFA 2025 — many of which you may be able to buy in the next few months.
Lenovo ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept (Project Pivo)
Did F.R.I.E.N.D.S. trademark 'Pivot' or something?
I'd just like to say that I love tech expos like IFA and the wacky concept ideas that companies from startups to established segment leaders come out with. But we all know many of these prototypes never make it to production runs. Lenovo seems to be bucking that trend lately, with the rollable screen ThinkBook Plus Gen 6, and I really hope that Project Pivo, aka Lenovo ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept, makes it to a similar stage. Instead of a rollable OLED screen, Project Pivo has a 14-inch rotating display that can go from landscape to portrait mode instantly, making your laptop more versatile in the process. Spin it vertically for coding, split-screen video calls, or reading through documents, and you can tether your smartphone simultaneously for screen mirroring and other uses. Then spin it back for editing photographs or browsing. It's just wacky enough to be a hit, and I really hope this lands on my desk to review sometime in the near future. — Joe Rice-Jones, Senior PC Hardware Author
Acer Swift Air 16
I have no idea how they made a 16-inch laptop this lightweight
We don't often get 16-inch laptops outside a few gaming-focused models, but they're rarely close to 1 kg in weight, let alone underneath that number. But that's what Acer has managed with the Swift Air 16, weighing in at 2.18 pounds, while providing Copilot+ PC experiences thanks to a selection of AMD Ryzen AI 300 processors. That low weight is enabled by a magnesium-aluminum alloy chassis, which comes in four color options, and either an AMOLED WQXGA+ (2880x1800) with 120Hz refresh rate or a WUXGA (1920x1200) IPS display with 60Hz refresh rate. We're not quite sure if this particular model will make it to our side of the pond, but the EMEA region will be able to pick one up starting in November, from a competitive EUR 999. — Joe Rice-Jones, Senior PC Hardware Author
Glacier White Lenovo ThinkPad X9
We're not often this excited about a color
Starting this off with a new color of an existing product may seem silly, but you have to remember, this is Lenovo's ThinkPad lineup. Typically, these laptops only know of two colors: black and not-as-black (grey). Seeing a white ThinkPad is kind of surreal, but we mean that in the best way possible. We already loved the ThinkPad X9 when we reviewed it a few months ago, and it did a lot of first for the brand, including removing the controversial TrackPoint. It was a fantastic laptop by basically every metric, and this new colorway is probably the best a ThinkPad has ever looked. This new model will be coming in October, but I'm already crossing my fingers to see more white ThinkPads in the future. — João Carrasqueira, OS and Devices Segment Lead

Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514
50 TOPS of AI power in an affordable kit
It doesn't feel like that long ago when the hottest new tech boasted 50 TOPS of AI processing power. You used to shell out a lot of money for such hardware, but with how fast the AI scene is advancing, you can now tap into that amount of power for a lot less. Take, for instance, the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514, which features a Kompanio Ultra processor that lets you run AI-based tasks locally on your hardware. Acer is also bundling in 12 months of Google AI Pro plan so you can get using your new hardware on day one. At $699.99, this is an affordable yet effective way to give local LLMs a shot. — Simon Batt, Senior News and Features Reporter
Lenovo Legion Go 2
From CES to IFA, it's now a reality
Well, that was quick. We last saw the Lenovo Legion Go 2 as a prototype at CES 2025, and now it's officially here nine months later. Which is excellent news, because we had a lot of positive things to say about the original Lenovo Legion Go, and there's a good chance that its second iteration will be just as influential. Packing up to an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, up to 32GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of SSD storage, this handheld console might just outdo some people's low-end gaming rigs. Right now, it seems there will only be a Windows 11 version, but I have my fingers crossed that a SteamOS variant will come soon. — Simon Batt, Senior News and Features Reporter
Tecno Megabook S14
An incredibly light laptop with powerful specs
Tecno may not have much of a presence in the United States, but the company puts out some pretty impressive hardware across categories, whether that's phones or computers. And the latest of those is the MegaBook S14, part of what Tecno calls its "Slim duo", which the company claims is the industry's lightest OLED AI laptop, weighing a staggering 899 grams, or 1.98 pounds. Indeed, this is a 14-inch laptop with an OLED display, and the "AI" term comes from the fact that you can get it with either a Snapdragon X Elite chipset or go for the Intel Core Ultra model with up to a Core Ultra 9 processor. It also comes with AI features like Meeting Assistant, but really, we're just impressed by the hardware on display here. Don't expect this one to come to the U.S., but it's certainly great to see more great laptops on the market. — João Carrasqueira, OS and Devices Segment Lead
Tecno Slim
Truly matching its namesake
I really like a slim phone. There's just something about a near-flat phone that still packs a punch with its hardware that makes me wonder how they squish everything into such a thin shell. If you share my sentiment, then you'll want to check out the Tecno Slim. This phone is under 6mm thin, yet it features a 5G adapter, a 3D-curved AMOLED display, and even a 5160mAh battery with 45W fast charging and a battery life of 28 hours. So, if you're on the hunt for something slim but you don't want to buy into the bigger manufacturers, Tecno may just have what you're looking for. — Simon Batt, News and Features Reporter
Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 series
Still the best Android tablet
Android tablets aren't known for being particularly good most of the time, but Samsung has consistently been delivering the best possible experience for years now. The new Galaxy Tab S11 is yet another fantastic entry in the family, delivering better performance than ever thanks to the latest MediaTek processors. Of course, there are a lot of new AI features, as has become the norm in recent years, but one of the cooler things at play is the addition of Extended Mode for Samsung DeX, which lets you use an external monitor as a second screen for your tablet. This is the closest most Android tablets come to being proper laptops, and it makes for a unique selling point. — João Carrasqueira, OS and Devices Segment Lead

Anker Prime Power Bank
Super-fast charging
It's hard for a power bank to make a huge impression, but Anker's latest model manages to pull it off thanks to its incredible charging capabilities. The 26,000mAh capacity is decently large, but what's really impressive is the fact that this little brick can output up to 300W of power at once through a combination of its three ports. Two USB-C ports support 140W charging each, making it ideal for even powerful laptops like the MacBook Pro, and a USB Type-A port provides up to 22.5W for a phone or tablet. If you're in a pinch and you need a lot of juice right now, the new Anker Prime Power Bank may just be for you. — João Carrasqueira, OS and Devices Segment Lead
Soundcore Work
Let AI take notes for you
Look, there's no escaping AI at a tech convention, so how about setting the AI to something it's good at like taking notes? Soundcore's Work is a portable AI-powered voice recorder that transcribes your meetings, noting who's speaking, structuring things for future minutes and other uses. While the cloud powers the transcription for more processing oomph, Soundcore says those recordings are deleted once the processed data is sent back to your device. While many of these devices are fairly hefty, Work has a coin-sized microphone that stays out of the way, whether that's on your collar, necklace or on the desk, that connects to a MagSafe compatible base unit. I'm all for AI when it actually fills a purpose, and taking notes is one of my least favorite activities. Having an always-ready recording device with up to 8 hours charge means being able to focus on meetings instead of spelling, enabling more productivity and fewer mistakes. — Joe Rice-Jones, Senior PC Hardware Author
Technology is amazing
That's all for our top picks out of this year's edition of IFA, but the fun never stops in the tech world. These products will hit the market in the coming months, and before you know it, it will be time for CES early next year, with a whole other round of incredible tech to admire. You may not want (or be able) to be buy all of these, but it's always fun to see what's coming up in the world of technology. If you saw anything else you loved at IFA, let us know in the comments!

I don't understand the fascination with making phones thinner and/or out of plastic, congratulations you've made something that'll burn you even 10 minutes after it's finished charging

I don't have a problem with plastic, it's a better material for a phone than glass or metal, the latter of which interferes with signals.
Some plastic is very strong.
I think it was maybe the Samsung S4 that had a removable battery and a removable back, and the plastic back was extremely thin, but also extremely strong.
I might be thinking of an LG phone though, but it was about that era.
