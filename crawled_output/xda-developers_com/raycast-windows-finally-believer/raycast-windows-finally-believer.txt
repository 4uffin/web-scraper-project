I've been using Raycast on Windows, and I'm finally a believer
By
Adam Conway
Published 3 days ago
I’m Adam Conway, an Irish technology fanatic with a BSc in Computer Science and I'm XDA’s Lead Technical Editor. My Bachelor’s thesis was conducted on the viability of benchmarking the non-functional elements of Android apps and smartphones such as performance, and I’ve been working in the tech industry in some way or another since 2017.
In my spare time, you’ll probably find me playing Counter-Strike or VALORANT, and you can reach out to me at adam@xda-developers.com, on Twitter as @AdamConwayIE, on Instagram as adamc.99, or u/AdamConwayIE on Reddit.

Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
I've been a long-time user of Alfred on my MacBook, and as someone who tried out Raycast before switching to
Alfred, it never really clicked with me. To be honest, it was so long ago that I can't even remember why Alfred fit my workflow more than Raycast did, I just know that it did. However, like Raycast, Alfred was a Mac exclusive, and even though Windows alternatives such as Flow Launcher exist, they never really felt the same.
A good friend of mine is a Raycast user, though, and he was recently telling me how much he loves it. He had been invited to the
Windows beta, and was able to send me an invite to try it, too. I was curious to give it a try, so I installed it, set it up, and he walked me through some of the ways that he uses it for work and what works on Windows.
Since then, I've been hooked. The Windows version isn't as full-fledged as the Mac version, but I've been converted to a Raycast believer, and I'm already using it every day on my Windows PC. The beta is fantastic, and even though the AI features it packs will be locked behind a paid subscription once it launches, I haven't even found a use for them yet.
Raycast on Windows isn't too far from Raycast on Mac
It feels like a similar experience
Credit:
Raycast on Windows has had quite a long development process so far, but the result is that even the beta application is quite polished and easy to use. Some of the features include the following:
Extensions
Shortcuts
Clipboard history
Calculator
Currency conversion
File search
Quick links
Emoji picker
I've personally been using the currency converter and clipboard history extensively; both naturally fit my workflow, and even the file search can find applications, too. Instead of pressing the Windows key to launch applications, I now press Alt+Space to search.
What's especially incredible about the currency converter is the fact that I can press Alt+Space, type a value in another currency, and immediately get a currency conversion to my local currency. The emoji picker is also significantly faster than the built-in Windows search, and allows you to paste, copy to clipboard, or copy the unicode. The clipboard history is incredible, too. Windows does technically have a clipboard manager built-in, but it feels clunky and limited compared to what Raycast offers. It's a small thing, but it absolutely saves time during the day. As for other features, the built-in calculator is instantly accessible by just typing an equation, and file search feels massively ahead of what Windows offers. All of these little utilities add up to be a better experience than what you get on Windows out of the box. It's not just a hub for launching apps or a simple start menu replacement, and it feels a lot more native than the likes of Flow Launcher or Wox ever have.
Raycast extensions are the best part
The integrations are incredible
Extensions are my favorite feature of Raycast and the sheer number of options are mind-boggling. These are essentially small add-ons that expand what Raycast can do, and the beta for Windows already has quite a few useful ones. Not every extension is supported on Windows, and the extensions store will tell you which ones are macOS only.
Some of the ones I've installed already are the
Home Assistant extension, Obsidian, Google Translate, and GitHub. These are all integrate quite seamlessly with Raycast, and for example, the Home Assistant extension can list all of my buttons, sensors, cameras, automations, and more. It can control them too, so I can quickly use Raycast to turn on or off a light if I want.
The other extensions I installed are great as well. The Obsidian one allows me to search my vault or create a new note, Google Translate, well, translates, and GitHub allows you to search repositories, manage branches, and search discussions. Raycast essentially simplifies everything that you could do with a combination of AutoHotKey and PowerToys, and while it's been a slow development process, it's nice to see it done slowly in a polished way. I've been using it consistently for over a week, and it's been incredibly stable the entire time. The only real downside I've noticed is that many extensions are still macOS only, especially ones I'd want to use. These are ones like the Spotify extension, which I'd love to be able to use on my computer.
Why I'm sticking with Raycast
I might even switch on my Mac

The biggest takeaway for me is that Raycast has finally given me the Alfred-like experience on Windows that I've been missing on my desktop. It's still in beta, and I'm sure the features will evolve while extensions are updated to support the platform, but even without them the platform feels strong enough for daily use. Even when AI tools become part of the paid tier, I doubt I'll feel like I'm missing anything given that I still don't even use them now. Who knows, maybe I'll switch to Raycast on my Mac as well? I've been loving it on Windows, and while I'm not fully set on making the switch on my Mac just yet, I finally get it. On Windows, it feels like a massive leg-up over not just the built-in Windows search, but any other application that's tried it, too.

Everything old is new again. There was this DOS terminate and stay resident app on the IBM PC called sidekick that seems remarkably similar to this.
