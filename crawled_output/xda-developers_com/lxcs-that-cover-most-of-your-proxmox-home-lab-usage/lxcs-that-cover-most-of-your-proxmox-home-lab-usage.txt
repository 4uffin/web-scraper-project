6 LXCs that can cover 90% of your Proxmox home lab usage

Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Capable of running apps, packages, and distros inside isolated environments, containers and virtual machines are the crux of self-hosting and experimentation workloads. Although both have their own neat perks, there are plenty of cases where you may want to run containers over VMs. If you’re using an old, computationally-challenged rig as a server, you might want to switch to containers, as VMs tend to have significantly higher processing overhead. Heck, I recently converted an old laptop into a Proxmox host, and after some performance issues with virtual machines, I started using LXCs exclusively with this underpowered PVE node. Having turned it into a reliable self-hosting workstation, I can confirm that you’ll only need a handful of LXCs to run essential home lab services.
Debian
Quite versatile with the right add-ons
Call me basic if you want, but I adore Debian. Sure, it may not have any fun (read: weird) quirks or an experimental package manager with the largest number of tools, but it excels on the stability and compatibility fronts. As such, there are plenty of ways you can put a Debian-based LXC to good use. If you’re willing to tinker with Docker and don’t have enough resources to assign to your virtual machines, a Debian (or other stable distros, for that matter) VM is what you’re looking for. Likewise, you can arm your vanilla-flavored LXC with a host of add-ons, ranging from Tailscale setups to Code Server-hosting workstations. Speaking of dev environments, the Arch Linux LXC template works just as well for coding-related packages, and it’s worth checking out if you’re not fond of the king of vanilla distros.
Cosmos/CasaOS/Runtipi
To run the bulk of your container suite
Nested containerization may seem like a terrible idea, but having tinkered with a handful of container platforms inside LXCs, I can confirm that it’s a lot more reliable than you may think. Better yet, containerization platforms tend to feature simple yet aesthetically-pleasing web UIs, making them a better choice for beginners or casual home labbers who don’t wish to deal with the added difficulty of managing containers via terminal commands. As for the platform itself, you’ve got plenty of choices. I’ve been using Cosmos as of late, and between its customizable app repositories, simple network (and storage) management, and built-in cron scheduler, it’s a terrific option for container enthusiasts. Its mouth-watering UI is just the cherry on top. That said, CasaOS and Runtipi have their own strengths and are worthwhile alternatives. The former has a file explorer built into it, allowing you to use your container-hosting platform as a file-sharing server, while the latter has a sleek interface that’s perfect for folks who love minimalist UI designs. Regardless of your choice, you can deploy most of the productivity, creativity, maintenance, and media server apps using the containerization platform.
NextcloudPi
An LXC-powered Microsoft 365 alternative
A quick disclaimer before I talk about NextcloudPi: I switched to a virtual machine-based Nextcloud instance after the container variant started feeling too sluggish due to all the documents I'd uploaded to it. That said, the NextcloudPi LXC template is far from terrible for most workloads, and it’s a solid option if you don’t have enough system resources to run a dedicated VM for the personal cloud. Without any tweaks, NextcloudPi is great for storing personal documents and sharing them with other users. However, its utility goes through the roof once you start arming it with the right packages from the built-in app store. My favorites are the Collabora Online and Nextcloud Office apps, which let me work on spreadsheets, text documents, and presentation slides directly on NextcloudPi. Throw in the Notes, PDF Annotations, Tasks, Forms, and other utilities, and you can turn a NextcloudPi instance into a full-fledged Microsoft 365.
Home Assistant
That said, the container variant has one major flaw
Ask the smart home community about the platform they use to control their paraphernalia, and you’d hear an overwhelmingly positive response about Home Assistant – and this praise is well warranted. After all, Home Assistant is compatible with a ton of smart devices, has simple yet robust trigger-action automations, and works well with community-created blueprints – all while helping you monitor and track your IoT products from neat, customizable dashboards. That said, the LXC version of Home Assistant has an Achilles Heel that needs to be mentioned. The Add-on Store is another killer feature of Home Assistant, as it lets you deploy useful self-hosted services on top of your HASS instance. Unfortunately, the Home Assistant LXC doesn’t feature it, so you’ll have to run these apps on a container platform (or even a Debian-based Docker/Podman setup) and connect them with your HASS instance.
Pulse
To keep an eye on Proxmox
While it may seem excessive for a mere home lab, I’ve deployed a handful of services just to maintain my server nodes. Most of them, including my dashboards, network scanners, and uptime trackers, ship with my containerization platforms. Pulse is an exception, and that’s a real shame, because this neat utility deserves more recognition. Designed for Proxmox, Pulse can not only keep track of the resource consumption and uptime of my PVE nodes, but it can also do so for the VMs and LXCs running on them. The LXC can also connect to Proxmox Backup Server and pull records of recent snapshots. And I haven’t even mentioned its gorgeous UI, the ability to add links to each virtual guest’s web UI, and built-in alert provisions.
OpenMediaVault
For basic NAS tasks
If you’re looking to quickly share files between multiple users, a NextcloudPi LXC is more than enough. But for folks who need dedicated network shares for their home lab, a NAS-oriented distro is what you’re looking for. OpenMediaVault is light enough to run on weak devices, but in case your home server can’t handle a separate VM, you can deploy this niche OS as an LXC. The reason why I haven’t mentioned it until the very bottom is that the LXC variant of OpenMediaVault becomes a pain to use once you step into complex workloads. Adding extra drives requires numerous config file tweaks, and you might even run into weird issues and bugs when using a containerized OMV instance. Nevertheless, it’s worth checking out if you need a simple data archival platform or an SMB/NFS-powered file sharing server that consumes fairly minimal resources.
You’ll also need a couple of VMs, though
So far, our LXC suite can satisfy most of your demands. But if you’ve got some resources to spare, you might want to run a few virtual machines as well. For hardcore computing projects, you’ll want to deploy Debian, Arch Linux, Fedora, or other full-fledged distributions inside virtual machines rather than LXCs. Likewise, I’ve already mentioned the drawbacks of using NextcloudPi (or rather Nextcloud), Home Assistant, and OpenMediaVault inside containerized environments, with OMV being significantly more useful (and less troublesome) as a dedicated VM.

Can OMV really run NFS in an LXC? My understanding is that because NFS runs kernel modules you can't run it in an LXC. Kernel stuff runs on the Host. Would be interested to hear more if you got that working.

I wrote a native plug-in for proxmox to deploy smb shares on network fast instead of needing for lxc or VM like omv. Working on getting it to use ceph pools and distributed file systems now. Open source and free.
