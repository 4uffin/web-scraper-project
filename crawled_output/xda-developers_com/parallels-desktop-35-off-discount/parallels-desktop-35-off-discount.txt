Parallels Desktop
35% off any subscription tier
Parallels Desktop is the software to use if you want to run virtual machines on your Mac. That means you can run Windows, Linux, and other macOS instances in one place.

Parallels is the go-to solution if you're looking to run Windows on Mac. It's easy to set up, powerful, and offers a seamless experience. The only catch is that it's quite expensive, with even the cheapest option costing $100/year as a subscription or $220 if you're looking to own. The good news is that Parallels is celebrating the release of their latest version, with new features and compatibility with macOS Tahoe, by offering a huge 35% discount on all its Parallels products. So if you've been looking to give Parellels a try, now's going to be the time.
The premier solution if you want Windows on your Mac
Parallels has always been one of the best solutions to get Windows running on your Mac. It's easy to set up, seamless to run, and delivers new features that are genuinely useful. While the brand has continued to evolve its software, we were able to take a look at it just a couple of years ago with Parallels 19 and it really blew us away. While the Standard version is great for basic use, there are higher tiers of Parallels that are built to handle more intensive apps. Of course, we recommend you check out all the latest features coming with version 26 in order to see if this update will be right for you. And if you're not sure, the brand does offer a 14-day trial. So whether you're looking for the Standard Edition, or need to upgrade to the Business Edition, this promotion is going to be able to save you quite a bit. But this promotion won't be around for long, so grab the 35% discount while you can.
