Give me a lighthearted recap
While many automation tools promise to connect your apps, they often come with limitations. Enter Activepieces, a powerful, open-source automation suite that serves as a modern replacement for services like Zapier and IFTTT. What sets Activepieces apart is its unique integration with your local LLM. Whether you are a developer looking to build a customized solution or a business user seeking to streamline operations without compromising on data sovereignty, Activepieces provides the perfect combination of flexibility, power, and privacy.
The issue with current automation
There are several
I have worked with various automation tools. I have come to realize a few recurring problems that have always made me uneasy. The biggest one for me is privacy. With popular automation services, I’m forced to trust them with my data. Every time I set up a workflow that links my email, CRM, and internal documents, sensitive information is being passed through their servers. I can’t help but wonder who has access to that data, and how secure it really is. Another major issue is cost. Most of the pay-per-task model becomes a huge burden, especially when I want to experiment or run high-volume automations. Finally, there is the issue of vendor lock-in and a lack of control. Once I have built dozens of complex workflows on a platform, I’m essentially stuck. I can’t easily move my automations elsewhere as the ecosystem is mostly closed. It’s this feeling of being trapped that led me to search for a better way to automate, and that’s when I ran into Activepieces.
What exactly is Activepieces?
Let’s go over the basics first
Activepieces is a powerful, drag-and-drop platform, much like the ones I’m used to, but with two major differences. First, it’s self-hosted. This means I don’t sign up for a service and trust some company with my data. Instead, I download and install Activepieces on my own server. It could be a cloud VPS or even a simple machine in my home office. This gives me absolute control over where my data lives. The most exciting part for me is that it’s powered by my local LLM. I can connect it to a large language model that runs locally. All of the AI-driven logic and data processing happens right on my machine, with no data being sent to a third party.
An intuitive interface
Ideal for everyone
When I first started exploring Activepieces, I was a little skeptical. A powerful, self-hosted tool can often mean a steep learning curve and a clunky interface. But I was surprised by how quickly I got the hang of it. I was able to create a complex workflow with branching logic in just a few minutes without even needing to consult any guides or YouTube tutorials. I’m a technical user, but I felt that this wasn’t just built for developers. The entire experience feels clean, logical, and friendly. Also, when I saw how Activepieces handles its connectors, all my worries disappeared. The fact that all of the pieces are open-source and available on npmjs.com is quite handy. I don’t have to wait for the company to build the integration I need. I can look at the code myself, or even build my own and share it.
Activepieces has an AI-first design
Built with AI in mind
Activepieces isn’t just for developers. The most impressive to me is how the platform’s Copilot helps even non-technical users. It’s built right into the workflow builder, which provides suggestions and makes it easier to connect pieces and define logic. It’s like having a smart assistant guiding you every step of the way. I can even use the ‘Ask AI in Code Piece’ function to describe what I need in plain English, and the AI handles the rest.
Activepieces has a powerful builder
With template support
Activepieces offers an easy-to-use builder. I’m used to other platforms that can get messy, but this one is clean. It supports advanced logic like loops, which let me process a list of items, and branches that allow me to create ‘if-then’ logic to handle different scenarios within the same flow. It’s the kind of flexibility I need without having to write a line of code. As much as I love building flows from scratch, I don’t always want to. That’s where the template support comes in, and I found it to be a huge time-saver. I can browse a library of pre-built workflows designed for common use cases, such as automating Google My Business review replies with AI or transcribing YouTube videos into a Google Sheet.
Beyond the cloud
Overall, Activepieces stands out by delivering true ownership and control. By combining the power of an open-source platform with the intelligence of your local LLM, it moves the automation from the cloud onto your own hardware. This means your data stays private, your workflows are fully customizable, and you are no longer dependent on a third-party service. What are you waiting for? Go ahead, try Activepieces, build complex AI-powered automations, and gain control over your workflow in no time.

Hi, as Argyrios pointed out, you should compare it with other competitive self-hosted products like n8n.
