Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Building a Network Attached Storage device does not have to involve a heavy box humming in a closet. With a Raspberry Pi 5 and a compact NVMe SSD, I assembled a pocket NAS that travels easily and feels snappy on my network. The footprint is small enough to toss in a backpack without fuss, yet the experience is closer to a real NAS than a novelty. That blend of portability and performance is what makes the project worth sharing.
The same hardware can be a simple SMB share today, a lightweight media cache tomorrow, and a personal cloud next month.
The Pi 5 changes the equation by exposing PCIe, which unlocks native NVMe instead of relying on slower workarounds. Pairing it with the official M.2 HAT+ keeps the build tidy, reliable, and well supported. The result is a tiny box that serves files, syncs notes, and moves media at respectable speeds. It is simple, practical, and surprisingly capable for a device that can sit in a jacket pocket.
Why you might want to build a pocket NAS
Portability, privacy, and flexible personal storage needs
A pocket NAS is about taking your working set of data along without juggling cloud accounts. I can plug in at a hotel, a relative’s house, or a coworking desk and keep the same folders available with consistent paths. That continuity helps with projects that span devices and locations, especially when internet quality is unpredictable. Local access remains fast and dependable even when everything else struggles. Owning the storage also means tighter control over what is shared and when. Subscriptions and shifting terms are not part of the equation, and access can be pinned to a private network when needed. I can expose only the services I intend to use, and everything else stays dark by default. That posture reduces surprises and keeps maintenance focused on my own priorities. Flexibility is the other reason to try this build. The same hardware can be a simple SMB share today, a lightweight media cache tomorrow, and a Time Machine backup server next month. Switching roles is mostly a matter of software, not new equipment or service tiers. That adaptability stretches the value of the hardware and keeps the project useful after the novelty wears off.
Hardware that makes it possible
Raspberry Pi 5 with official M.2 HAT+
The core of the build is the Raspberry Pi 5 and its single PCIe lane, which is enough to drive an NVMe SSD responsibly. The official M.2 HAT+ integrates cleanly with the board, avoids cable clutter, and keeps power and thermals within a known envelope. NVMe removes the drag of microSD and many USB enclosures in sustained transfers. It is the difference between a neat demo and something you will actually use. I chose a single NVMe drive for simplicity and to keep the footprint small. Capacity is a personal choice, though I find that staying within the drive’s efficient performance tier helps thermals and battery life when powered off-grid. If I decide to expand later, I will look for a HAT that supports two NVMe devices, either for additional capacity or redundancy. The tradeoff will be a taller stack and closer attention to cooling and airflow. Stable power matters more than people expect with compact storage builds. The Pi 5 and NVMe together can draw enough current to stress a marginal supply during heavy writes. Using a quality 27 W USB-C supply keeps the system stable and prevents odd throttling behavior. A low-profile heatsink and a quiet fan keep temperatures predictable without ruining the pocketable vibe.
Setting up your pocket NAS
Software choices and initial configuration steps explained
Raspberry Pi OS is a sensible base because it is well supported and easy to maintain. From there, you can add exactly the services you need instead of inheriting a full stack you will never use. I prefer Samba for broad client compatibility, while NFS makes sense for Linux-heavy environments and lab scenarios. If you want remote access and sync features, Nextcloud turns the same box into a simple personal cloud. Before installing services, prepare the storage carefully. Format the NVMe drive with a file system that suits your workflow and backup habits, and mount it with explicit options for reliability. Place your shares on that mount so the system never falls back to the microSD card. A few minutes spent on fstab and permissions prevents headaches when power is interrupted or the device is moved. Networking deserves equal care because it defines the day-to-day experience. Assign a reserved IP and a hostname that is easy to remember, then verify name resolution from your clients. Enable the firewall with only the services you intend to expose and keep the rest closed. Document the choices in a short readme stored on the device so that future you knows exactly what is running. Suggested setup steps:
Flash Raspberry Pi OS, boot the Pi 5, and apply updates.
Install the M.2 HAT+ and initialize the NVMe drive.
Create the filesystem, mount it with fstab, and verify persistence.
Install Samba, NFS, or Nextcloud based on your use case.
Create users, set permissions, and define shares or data directories.
Reserve an IP in your router, test name resolution, and validate transfers.
Once the basics are in place, you can layer on quality-of-life improvements. Snapshotting with btrfs or scheduled rsync jobs helps protect against accidental changes. WireGuard or Tailscale provides encrypted access without opening broad ports to the public internet. Small touches like smartd monitoring and log rotation keep the system predictable over long runs.
The limitations to keep in mind
Where a tiny NAS will fall short
The Pi 5 provides only a single PCIe lane, so NVMe here is faster for sustained work but not comparable to desktop-class bandwidth. You will feel that when copying very large files or pushing many clients at once. For a working set of documents, photos, and project assets, the performance lands in a comfortable place. Treat it like a compact tool, not an enterprise filer. Thermals and power are the next constraints to respect. Continuous writes warm up even efficient NVMe drives, and a small fan can be the difference between consistent performance and throttling. Portable power banks that support proper USB-C PD can run the stack, but spiky workloads will empty smaller packs faster than you think. Planning around heat and power keeps the device pleasant to use. Networking defines your ceiling more than synthetic disk numbers do. Wired gigabit Ethernet offers reliable throughput, while Wi-Fi trades speed for convenience in crowded environments. If your main use is bulk media shuffling, you will still want a bigger NAS on your primary network. The pocket build shines as a companion that travels well and fills gaps gracefully.
What this little pocket NAS actually gets right
It is simple, practical, and surprisingly capable for a device that can sit in a jacket pocket.
This build demonstrates the significant advancements in small, affordable hardware for personal storage. It is not a replacement for a full rack or a four-bay tower, yet it delivers real work without drama. The combination of Pi 5, M.2 HAT+, and NVMe lands in a sweet spot of speed, size, and cost that encourages daily use. For anyone who values control, portability, and clear upgrade paths, it earns a place in the bag.

The footprint is small enough to toss in a backpack without fuss.... the fuss comes when your backpack is stolen containing your laptop and portable NAS with all your recently updated data and synced notes... I obviously don't understand exactly what this solution is trying to achieve?

But why not a portable SSD? It has speed, relatively good thermals (usually), and doesn't need an external power source. If you are running software on it, then either run it on your laptop or on some other hardware at home. Just trying to understand what this project has over a portable SSD, other than looking cool.
