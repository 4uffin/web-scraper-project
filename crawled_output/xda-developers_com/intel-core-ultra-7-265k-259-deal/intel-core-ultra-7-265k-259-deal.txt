Thinking about building a new PC from the ground up? Well, Intel's latest chip might be just what you're looking for, especially when you can grab it for its lowest price yet at just $259. With this promotion, you're getting Intel's Core Ultra 7 265K, which's a very powerful CPU, and perfect for someone that's looking to start something new.
A fresh new start
For the most part, we really liked this CPU when we reviewed it, offering impressive power, and a fantastic integrated GPU that was also more efficient than the previous model chips. However, since this CPU is built on a new platform by Intel, it will require you to purchase a new motherboard and maybe even grab some new RAM as well.
These don't necessarily make this CPU a deal-breaker by any means, but it is something to be aware of, especially if you're someone that's on a budget. For the most part, its performance is quite good, and is suited to handling a variety of tasks, whether it's content creation, playing games, or just surfing the web.
But if gaming is your main focus, it might be better to go with something from AMD. At its usual price of $400, the Intel 265K is a decent purchase, but with this new discount that drops it down to $259, we think this becomes a no-brainer if you've been looking to build something new. Just be sure to pick up while it's still on sale.
