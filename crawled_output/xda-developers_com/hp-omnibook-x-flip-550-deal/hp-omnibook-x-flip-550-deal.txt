If you're looking for a laptop with a large screen that's also powerful, versatile, and affordable — the HP OmniBook X Flip is going to be the one. It's one of HP's top-rated laptops, and it's now down to a fantastic price thanks to a steep $350 discount from Best Buy. At $550, this laptop delivers fantastic value, and it's the best time to pick one up since it's down to its lowest price yet.
You can't go wrong at this price
This HP laptop has just the right set of specifications to take on pretty much everything you can throw at it. It has a large 16-inch 2K touchscreen display and Intel Core Ultra 5 processor that's paired with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. It also features an Intel Arc GPU, which is actually pretty powerful for being an integrated solution.
So with this laptop, you'll be able to play games, surf the web, punch up some documents, and so much more. Connectivity is also pretty good as well, with two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, HDMI, and a 3.5mm audio jack. You also get wireless connectivity as well with support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. There's also a 5MP camera for video calls and HP claims that you'll get up to 23 hours of battery life on a single charge. As stated before, the reviews for this machine are pretty solid, with lots of folks praising the overall package you get. And at $550, we think this is definitely one worth taking a look at if you're looking for something new.
