Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Networking is the foundation of every home lab. Whether you’re running virtual machines, self-hosted services, or tinkering with clusters, stable connectivity is essential. When your network becomes unreliable, everything else begins to fail. That’s why your choice of hardware, even down to the type of Ethernet adapter you use, matters far more than most people expect.
When the core of your network stack is fragile, everything built on top of it suffers.
USB-to-Ethernet adapters are inexpensive, convenient, and widely available, making them an attractive option for hobbyists. Unfortunately, they introduce more problems than they solve, particularly in terms of long-term stability. If you’re serious about your home lab, relying on these adapters can cause performance issues, compatibility headaches, and even outright downtime. Let’s break down why they’re a poor fit and what you should use instead.
Why USB-to-Ethernet looks appealing
Convenience hides long-term problems
The biggest draw of USB-to-Ethernet adapters is their simplicity. Plug them into a free USB port, and suddenly you have wired networking without any configuration. For devices that only ship with Wi-Fi or have limited Ethernet ports, the promise of instant expandability is hard to resist. Add in the fact that they cost only a few dollars, and it’s easy to see why many hobbyists use them as a quick fix.
Home labs aren’t about one-off connections. They’re about long-running services, clustered environments, and the kind of uptime you can trust. When it comes to network reliability necessary for those essentials, you almost always get what you pay for.
They also appear to solve short-term needs in situations where speed isn’t your top priority. If you’re setting up a test device, experimenting with a new single-board computer, or connecting an old laptop, these adapters can bridge the gap. On paper, they support gigabit speeds, which makes them seem comparable to built-in network ports. For beginners, that can feel like a win without any drawbacks. The trouble comes once you start relying on them for workloads that demand reliability. Home labs aren’t about one-off connections. They’re about long-running services, clustered environments, and the kind of uptime you can trust. That’s where the weaknesses of USB networking begin to show, and those weaknesses only grow more evident over time.
Performance and reliability issues
Dropped connections and limited throughput
Despite the promise of gigabit speeds, USB-to-Ethernet adapters rarely deliver consistent performance. Under sustained load, many of them throttle or overheat, leading to sudden connection drops. Even when they maintain a link, throughput can fluctuate dramatically depending on the quality of the adapter and the USB controller it’s connected to. For anyone hosting services, this becomes a ticking time bomb. USB itself adds another layer of bottlenecks. The bus was never designed to handle continuous, high-throughput networking in parallel with other tasks. If your device also manages storage, peripherals, or power delivery over USB, network traffic competes for bandwidth. This leads to packet loss and latency spikes that can make services feel sluggish or even unreachable. For workloads like virtual machines, containerized apps, or self-hosted services that require stable access, these issues are disastrous. A single dropped connection can mean interrupted backups, corrupted transfers, or failed deployments. While a desktop user might tolerate the occasional hiccup, a home lab environment cannot. The entire purpose of building a lab is to learn and test in conditions that mirror production, which means reliability has to come first.
Hardware and driver compatibility risks
When updates break your lab stability
Another hidden downside of USB-to-Ethernet adapters is driver support. Many rely on chipsets from Realtek or ASIX, which are infamous for inconsistent drivers across operating systems. Linux kernel updates, in particular, have been known to break compatibility with certain adapters. That means an innocuous system update could leave your server without a working network connection. Even when drivers are available, they aren’t always optimized. Some adapters draw more power than your device can reliably supply over USB, leading to unstable behavior. Others misreport their link speed or duplex settings, causing hard-to-trace performance issues. The end result is a device that works one day but fails under pressure the next, creating frustrating downtime. For a home lab that thrives on stability, this unpredictability is unacceptable. Every time you have to scramble to troubleshoot an adapter after an update, you’re taking time away from learning, experimenting, or running services. When the core of your network stack is fragile, everything built on top of it suffers. A single misbehaving adapter can undermine an entire cluster.
Better alternatives to consider
Build stability with the proper hardware
If you need reliable wired networking, there are better options. First, use onboard NICs whenever possible. They’re designed and tested with the system in mind, and they receive long-term driver support. For desktops or servers with expansion slots, dedicated PCIe network cards are inexpensive and deliver far superior performance compared to any USB alternative. Single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi can also benefit from dedicated accessories. Many Pi models support HATs or expansions with multiple Ethernet ports, providing stable connectivity that doesn’t rely on USB. These expansions often come with strong driver support, since they’re designed with Linux in mind. This ensures you won’t be caught off guard by a sudden kernel update. For more advanced setups, using a managed switch with VLAN support allows you to segment and control traffic properly. This approach provides flexibility while maintaining the stability and predictability of your hardware. The key is to plan your network around components built for reliability. The upfront cost may be slightly higher, but it prevents downtime and makes your home lab a far more effective learning environment.
USB-to-Ethernet will let you down far too often, so look to better options
USB-to-Ethernet adapters might look like an easy win for your home lab, but they come with trade-offs that will eventually catch up to you. Performance bottlenecks, unreliable drivers, and fragile stability all make them a poor choice for systems meant to run continuously. Investing in proper networking hardware ensures your lab is reliable, resilient, and capable of handling the demands you place on it. In the long run, stability is worth far more than the convenience of a quick fix.

USB 3.0 adapters on a USB 3.0 port works great in my experience.
I have one on my secondary RODC and have had zero issues in the 2+ years running it.

Using USB 3.0 adapter with 1Gbps LAN connected to USB 3.2 port on KVM switch and this works perfectly about one year now. Reliable and with full speed.

Great idea. Now tell all laptop manufacturers to add Ethernet ports again. Good luck y'all.

The usb to rj45
adapters work fine in my experience. No issues, the system self corrects when needed. Its a stop gag solution until a better network setup and HW is available. The idea is to go about your homelab in small steps, experimenting with your 1st machine and proxmox. then adding another machine and form a cluster. Experiment with migrating VM's and CT's. Adding a 3rd machine and create HA cluster. Adding a PBS and testing. Upgrading the network HW. Upgrading storage. The bottleneck moves and changes after every upgrade in this path. eventually, when the load is big enough, the usb to rj45 becomes the next bottleneck and changing and upgrading the network setup becomes the next step.

I have a couple of different unbranded adapters that worked fine in two mini pc’s using windows but had the incorrect speed and duplex settings when used with Proxmox v8. Reliability OK, but performance was dire. When I moved to single onboard only with VLANs the problem got fixed.
I have now tried the same adapters using Proxmox v9 and, fingers crossed it is working (for now). Like the other user I was running OpNsense and wanted to use physical separation.
Mini PC’s are great but I will always look for dual ports in future.

Xda actually wrote an accurate article. Usb Ethernet adapters work but I think most of you realize ethernet cards are the size they are for a reason and USB is inherently unreliable as it is usually on a shared bus.

"The entire purpose of building a lab is to learn and test in conditions that mirror production". If you have "production" at home, it's not a home lab. My home lab is fun. Evidently yours isn't.

USB Ethernet adapters are disappointing because of the variances of quality of the hosts USB 3 port. 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2 Gen 2 all handle loads differently. They last and perform better based on the higher spec port because the chip in the host that governs timing is better.When you place these in a lesser or cheap USB host port your experiences will be different. Bad timings lead to disconnects and poor performance and excess heat.

My NAS sadly only came with 1 Gbit ports. However a 5GBit USB ethernet port greatly increases throughput and doesn't suffer any of the problems you suggest.
Maybe don't use free ones that come in breakfast cereales, but buy pepper ones.

Sounds like this guy is buying cheap, no name Chinese USB to ethernet adapters rather than from reputable brands. I have a 2.5Gbps USB 3.0 adapters on several Dell OptiPlex systems and they all deliver 1.9Gbps over a 2Gbps WAN connection. They easily deliver just under 2.5Gbps over the 10Gbps LAN connections to my file servers.

We tried something similar at work.
Had some extra laptops that we wanted to receive org. pushed updates.
Thought we could just plug them into some unused network ports with these things. Ugh, the headache with these things wasn't worth the benefit of having a couple extra machines around.
