I finally applied a skin to my Switch 2, and it's so much nicer than a grip
When I reviewed the Dbrand Killswitch a while back, I noted that it seems to do its job well, but I just don't find this kind of product that appealing. I would much rather use a typical travel case, and more recently, I even noticed how I didn't even want to play with the grips, either.
However, I was starting to worry that my hand grease would wear down the plastic on my Joy-Con 2, so I finally bit the bullet and bought a skin from Dbrand. And it turns out, I was right, I like this way more than using a grip. I do already find the Joy-Con 2 quite comfortable, and the skin looks really cool on it. I will say the measurements seem to be a fraction of a millimeter off, and aligning with + button means that the skin is just a smidge too high for the other buttons, particularly B, Home, and the C button. But so far it still seems totally usable, and it looks great.

Grip cases for the Nintendo Switch 2 feel more like a problem than a solution
I received a couple of grip cases for the Nintendo Switch 2 when it first launched so I could test them, and they did improve my comfort. Recently, I picked the Dbrand Killswitch back up because I noticed my hand sweat/grease was quite visible on the Joy-Con 2 and I want to preserve the look of the plastic.
But it's not really a matter of comfort for me, and frankly, in terms of protecting the console, I worry that using one on these grips cases causes more damage than it prevents. Applying them is fairly difficult, and I worry that I'm going to scratch something. I recently ordered a Dbrand skin instead, but I can't even remove the Killswitch case because I'm worried about removing and reinstalling it potenitally causing more damage. At the end of the day, I'd just rather use skins than grip cases.

The Switch 2 Pro Controller is... actually not worth it?
I always try to avoid becoming a snob when it comes to the devices I own, and I take some solace in knowing that I don't need to invest even more money in add-ons to get an experience that I consider pleasant. However, my collector brain couldn't resist buying the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, and while it's an incredibly comfortable and satisfying controller to use, I feel like Nintendo has kind of put it in a rough position.
Because the Joy-Con 2 are already so much better than the ones on the original Switch, upgrading to the Pro Controller feels less necessary than ever. On top of that, you have to give up the option for mouse controls while using it, so I think the Joy-Con 2 are overall a better option unless you really don't care about parting ways with an extra $90.

The leaked Xbox Handheld prices have me worried
Microsoft might have excited Xbox fans with the promise of "an Xbox you can hold in your hands", but they're scaring me after seeing leaked prices. The two consoles, the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X, made a brief appearance on the European Asus store for €599 and €899, respectively, which is insane. That's $1,050 for the X version and $700 for the base model, and I'm not entirely sure what Microsoft is up to here. The normal console cycle is to sell at or just below cost, so you get people on the hardware to buy your games and services. Maybe that doesn't translate to the handhelds as they run Windows 11 and gamers can use any storefront they want, but I feel this is going to become a handheld for diehard Xbox stans, and not for anyone else.

Nintendo really doesn't want to use established standards
While we anxiously awaited our Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders, our minds started wandering, and we thought of all the things we could potentially plug into the USB-C ports to test. Things like capture cards, headsets, controllers, docking stations, and webcams all made the list, but imagine our surprise when almost nothing worked. The reason seems to be an intentional locking of the ports with new encryption schemes, which means that the universal USB-C port is universal in name only, and doesn't use established protocols for communication.
I expect the EU will have something to say about this, since the USB-C common port laws are in effect and cover not just communication to devices but also charging, something else the Switch 2 doesn't do in an established manner. It's disheartening to see what should be an easy-to-use port being subverted like this, and it's a bad move by Nintendo to lock out an existing ecosystem of USB-C devices.

I'm glad I haven't bought a Switch 2 ... yet
Seeing some of the issues people have had with their Switch 2 consoles, I'm sitting comfortably on the sidelines with my bucket of popcorn. The launch didn't captivate me, nor did it entice me to upgrade from my original Switch. With everything that's going on, I reckon I'll continue holding out for the eventual Switch 2 OLED or keep tabs on when MSI will finally launch the lime green gaming handheld beast.

It seems some Nintendo Switch 2 units have subpar screens
The Nintendo Switch 2 has been a runaway success in sales, as the fastest-selling console ever. However, it's possible that in the rush, Nintendo may have overlooked something, as reports of the 102Hz-capable LCD screen experiencing excessive blurring and slow transitions are emerging. Hardware Unboxed tested their unit at a 33.3ms gray-to-gray transition time, which translates to approximately 30 FPS. With almost any budget LCD monitor measuring an average of 6.3ms, the Switch 2 display is lagging behind, hard. At 120Hz, it takes 8.33ms to render a frame in time, but the Switch 2 takes 4x that time to show the next frame. Then again, each game seems to have different targets, with Mario Kart World achieving 1080p and 60FPS in handheld mode and up to 1440p and 60FPS when docked, but not reaching 120Hz at all. Until we see a game that supports 120Hz, I have to wonder what the launch marketing was referring to.

Nintendo's Switch 2 launch lineup isn't actually bad
I've seen some discourse online about the Nintendo Switch 2 launch lineup and how it's lackluster or some people are even bored of the system already, and I have to say, I don't truly get it. 25 games were available at the launch of the Switch 2, and out of those, five are exclusive (though one of these is a remaster of a 3DS game). Comparing that to the PlayStation 5, you're looking at 28 launch games, and out of those, only three are truly exclusive. Meanwhile, the Xbox Series X|S consoles launched with over 30 games, but none of them were really exclusive to the latest console.
Sure, a lot of games from third-parties on the Switch 2 are ports of older titles, but is that much different from a game having a simultaneous release on a new console and an old one? Not to mention, at least Nintendo has a truly major exclusive in Mario Kart World, while even the PlayStation 5 only had Demon's Souls as its heavy hitter at launch — a remake of a PlayStation 3 game.
Console launches don't d

I've never seen any other console turn off rumble automatically
Redditors have been reporting that the Nintendo Switch 2 turns off the rumble function on its own after prolonged vibration. From reading through the replies, it appears that this issue can occur in most games with vibration, particularly those that heavily utilize rumble, which may trigger it more quickly. I don't remember this ever happening on the Switch 1, or any other Nintendo controllers, so maybe it's unintended behavior. Not the protection, that's probably intended, but how easily it gets turned on. What's the point in having rumble in the controllers if it'll just get disabled once it starts being used? Any Switch 2 owners reading this noticing the same notification, or any other odd quirks?

Nintendo Switch 2 grip cases have made me realize I don't really like grip cases
Since getting the Nintendo Switch 2, I've also received samples of a couple of grip cases from Dbrand and Genki. While I appreciate what these grips try to do, the biggest takeaway I've gotten from testing these grips is that I don't really like grip cases. The fact that they snap so strongly around the console kind of makes me worry it will get scratched up, and in terms of protection, I still prefer using a travel case.
I will say Dbrand's Killswitch uses slightly softer materials that give me more peace of mind when installing them, but it's still not worth sacrificing the ability to easily put the console in a travel case, so I never really use it.

If you have a Switch 2, check your TV's HDR settings
Ever since I got my Switch 2, I was confused as to why HDR didn't seem to work as well on my TV as it does on the console's own screen. I've never had an easy time figuring out HDR, so I just thought my TV had a poor implementation of it. As it turns out, though, there's an easy fix for HDR that Nintendo didn't make clear, and it's greatly improved the experience.
As seen in the video I linked, HDR on the Switch 2 requires a TV compatible with HGiG, a special tone mapping mode for gaming. Only with this feature enabled can you properly calibrated your TV's HDR for the Switch 2, and once you do, it looks fantastic. I started using it last night, and I had a way better time in Mario Kart World. This does mean some TVs may not properly support the Switch 2's HDR, but hopefully HGiG support helps ensure a more easily consistent experience.

Most webcams should work with the Switch 2 — but mine didn't
With the Nintendo Switch 2 out on the market, GameChat was one of the things I was most curious to check out. Nintendo makes an official camera for the console, but it's also said that any webcam should work, and if you look around the internet, you'll find that some pretty crazy setups are functional.
However, as luck would have it, I have a few review units of AI-powered webcams from brands like Obsbot and Insta360 — and none of them worked. Well, the microphones built into them were recognized by the Switch 2, but the actual camera just wouldn't show up. I've gotten in touch with companies to try and learn why, but my guess is that the AI features in these cameras either require a lot more USB power or rely on some kind of special driver that the Switch 2 doesn't support. Hopefully I get a definitive answer soon, along with some kind of fix or workaround.

Yes, Switch 2 cartridges still taste horrible (and it's for your safety)
Nintendo Switch game cartridges are coated with a bitter agent to (hopefully) avoid some choking accidents, and the cartridges and game cards for the Switch 2 are also similarly coated. That's a neat safety feature, and I have to wonder if more things should be treated this way. Some button-cell batteries have a coating that makes your saliva blue if swallowed, but it's better if they're not swallowed at all. MicroSD cards should have the same treatment, especially if they're designed for the Switch 2. After all, kids often put weird things in their mouths, and pets chew everything—the more preventative measures taken, the better.

How do you feel about the Switch 2's battery life?
We're one week into the Switch 2 era, and millions of people around the world are already playing it. While the system seems to be largely well-received, I've seen some criticism of the battery life online. My own experience, while limited, has been pretty solid. I've been getting close to three hours of playtime in games like Mario Kart World and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Nintendo Switch 2 Edition.
That's not amazing, but a PC gaming handheld running a similar title at similar performance levels would last significantly less than that, so I think that's acceptable. What about you? Have you tried playing on the Switch 2 until it dies? How long does it take? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

The Switch 2 is finally here — what do you want to know?
Finally. After months of excruciating wait for launch day, I ended up getting my Switch 2 delivered at 5PM, and I've spent the last few hours setting everything up. Now, I'm ready to start gaming.
What would you like to see us cover or talk about the Switch 2? Are there specific games you'd like us to test? I have a lot of things in mind already, but let me know what you'd specifically like to hear about.

It's finally time: The Switch 2 has begun launching around the world
It's been a long, long wait for a new generation of Nintendo consoles. Fans have speculated on a successor or major upgrade to the Nintendo Switch almost since the launch of the original hardware. With a smaller revision in the form of the Switch OLED model in 2021, we had to wait until May 2024 to get any official confirmation of a Switch successor, and even longer to get confirmation of the console's name earlier in January 2025.
But this is it, the final reckoning. At the time of writing this, the Nintendo Switch 2 has officially launched in a few markets already, including New Zealand, Australia, and Japan, and many other people have received their units of the console ahead of the official launch. For my part, I am anxiously and excitedly awaiting my own pre-order, which should arrive tomorrow. I have never been this excited for a console launch, and I can't wait to get my hands on it. Did you pre-order a Switch 2 yourself? What would you like to know about it once I have it?

The lack of day one Switch 2 reviews isn't as problematic as it sounds
Nintendo has been making a lot of little weird decisions with the Switch 2. From not communicating the price during the Switch 2 Direct in April, to poor explanations of things like Game Key Cards, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster that paints the company in a worse light than it really needed to be. And now, that's happening again, as outlets have confirmed they won't be publishing reviews of the Switch 2 on release day due to Nintendo not providing review units this time around.
But in reality, how much does it matter? Switch 2 pre-orders were flying off the shelves in the US, and the extra stock available at launch is probably going to be swooped up by die hard fans. Neither those who pre-ordered the console (myself included) nor those lining up this Thursday are waiting for that review on day one. The likely truth is everyone who wants the console at launch is buying it regardless. Waiting a week or two for reviews won't influence the decision of many consumers.
Is it still a ba

We are one week away from the Switch 2, and I can hardly wait
It's been a long time coming, but we're now in the final stretch — the Nintendo Switch 2 is set to release in exactly one week, and I am counting the days. For the past few days, I've been nervously checking my order status in hopes that something will move and give me a sign that I will get my unit on launch day. I also received my pre-order bonus earlier this week, which was unexpected and similarly exciting.
From the improved build quality to the magnetic Joy-Con, to mouse controls, there's so much I can't wait to experience, and that's even before we get into the games themselves. Are you also getting a Switch 2 at launch? What are you most excited for? And what kind of coverage would you like to see from XDA?

I really hope the Switch 2's Joy-Con are more stable
I love my Nintendo Switch, but I have my fair share of issues with it, too. One of the smaller annoyances that I've had to deal with over time is that the Joy-Con tend to become a bit more lose and slide a tiny bit along the rail, but I've heard many stories of users whose Joy-Con just slide right out without pressing the release button.
For me, this has resulted in me often holding the Switch in a weird way. Typically, I place my pinky fingers under the main body of the Switch so as to hold it up, so there's less pressure pushing the Joy-Con upward and potentially wearing out the lock mechanism. With the new magnetic system, I hope this is no longer a concern and I don't have to worry my fingers cramping as much.

I didn't want a new gaming handheld until I saw the MSI Claw A8 in lime green
Take my money already, MSI! My first vehicle was a lime green Seat Ibiza FR in 2016, and seeing the MSI Claw A8 with an AMD Ryzen Z12 Extreme brought back so many pleasant memories. I've steered clear of gaming handhelds since purchasing a Nintendo Switch that I didn't play as much as I should have done ... at least until I bought myself and my wife Diablo 3. But there's something about the lime green MSI Claw A8. It looks the part, has the performance, and while it runs Windows, it would also make for quite the package for testing some things out.
