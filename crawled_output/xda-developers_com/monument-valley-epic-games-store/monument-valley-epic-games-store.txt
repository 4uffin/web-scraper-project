Did you grab Silksong today? Nah, me neither. I haven't even gotten around to beating the original Hollow Knight yet, so I still have that on my plate before I join the hordes of players adventuring with Hornet right now. But that's okay, because while everyone else is tucking into Silksong, we've got a cool puzzle game we can claim for free. It's called Monument Valley, and as part of the Epic Games Store End of Summer Sale, you can snag it for the low, low cost of nada. Once you've claimed it, it'll stay on your account forever; however, you only have a week to click the button, so be sure not to dawdle.
Monument Valley is free to keep on the Epic Games Store for a limited time
If you've never heard of the game, Monument Valley was originally a mobile exclusive, released back in 2014 for iOS and Android. However, the game finally made the jump over to Windows in 2022, and consoles in 2025, so now everybody can give it a go. The game is all about trying to navigate around terrain that uses illusions and impossible spaces to make things difficult, but all of them have a solution; you just have to find it. Here's how the game describes itself:
Discover Monument Valley - A quest for forgiveness in a strikingly beautiful and mysterious world.
Embark on a journey of forgiveness along with Ida, the silent princess, through impossible environments and illusionary puzzles. Experience this meditative and calming puzzle game by manipulating monuments and creating evolving paths to explore new, surreal, and mysterious worlds.
Interested? Well, if you head over to the Monument Valley page on the Epic Games Store and click the "Get" button before September 11th, you can add it to your account at no charge. And who can say no to a free game?
