Give me a lighthearted recap
Third-person shooters are a special breed, aren't they? They let you see your hero, your weapons, and your chaos, unfold all at once, and in the process, end up giving us some of the most iconic moments in gaming history. The greatest TPS games have nailed the story, over-the-shoulder gunplay, their narrative, or they have introduced mechanics to the medium that have since become a staple of it. Sometimes, they've checked all of these boxes, carving a name for themselves in the annals of third-person shooter history and defining entire eras. To this day, their influence can be seen and felt in modern third-person shooters, and in the way we think about shooting, storytelling, and what the medium itself can be.
Grand Theft Auto III (2001)
Changing the 3D world as we know it
The first PlayStation gave us fully 3D graphics, and it was definitely one of the greatest generational leaps between consoles, ever. However, it wasn't until Grand Theft Auto III came along in 2001 that it truly showed the world what a real 3D third-person shooter could be. Why? Because it gave us a proper third-person shooting game along with a fully open-world sandbox that heralded the arrival of open-world games. From then on, GTA III became the template for open-world games, and we all have Rockstar to credit for that.

Max Payne 2 (2003)
I'm never getting over this tragic love story
Max Payne 2 holds a special place in my heart, and the fact that it revolves around one of the most traumatic love stories in gaming is perhaps why I'm picking this over Max Payne 3. When it comes to sheer gunplay, Max Payne 3 is definitely the best entry in this unforgettable trilogy, which isn't surprising. But 2003's Max Payne 2? It can still hold its own today, and has aged insanely well. The voice acting, atmosphere-building, storytelling, and the moment-to-moment gameplay — everything from start to finish was perfect in Remedy's masterpiece, and 22 years later, I can't wait to see how the upcoming remake pushes the genre forward.

Resident Evil 4 (2005)
The genre-defining masterpiece with two decades of influence
Every time a discussion about the greatest third-person shooter games comes up, it's impossible not to discuss 2005's Resident Evil 4, and for good reason. It's regarded as one of the most influential games of all time, both in the TPS genre as well as survival-horror, and it deserves every bit of that praise. The perfect survival horror game that introduced incredibly polished inventory and traversal mechanics, along with its revolutionary over-the-shoulder aiming, Resident Evil 4 stands among the very best of games that changed the medium forever. The RE4 remake from 2023 is, unsurprisingly, one of the greatest remakes ever made, and for what it's worth, has replaced the classic game as the definitive way to experience Leon Kennedy's experience in the plague-infested Spanish village full of bingo enthusiasts.

Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory (2005)
This was when we all experienced perfect stealth mechanics
Source: Steam
The Metal Gear Solid games had been defining (and redefining) stealth in games, until 2005's Chaos Theory perfected it. This was the peak of this legendary franchise, and it showed us all how third-person shooters didn't always need to be loud to be spectacular. Dynamic lighting, sound-based stealth, and open-ended level design, all in 2005? That's what Chaos Theory gave us, and it wasn't a proof-of-concept, either. The game worked, the mechanics worked, and we all experienced perfect stealth in gaming. Cutting through tents, turning on night-vision goggles, and whispering interrogations will never feel this good again, and I wish Ubisoft revived this franchise sooner rather than later. It's been 12 years since we saw a Splinter Cell game, and that's just a damn shame.

Gears of War (2006)
Cover-based third-person shooting became the norm after this
Before Gears of War on the Xbox 360, cover-based shooting had always been more of a... suggestion rather than a system. Then, this absolute powerhouse landed on the Microsoft console, and suddenly, everyone and their dog began snapping to cover. The "roadie run" that shook the whole frame, the weighty chainsaw gun, and the tactical reload which tested your timing every time you reloaded — Gears of War introduced so many new mechanics, and absolutely every single one of them was a boundary-pusher in the TPS genre. Every firefight felt like a struggle for survival, and it's no wonder that, over the years, we've seen multiple remasters of this beautiful, timeless game that refuses to stay down, two decades after release. With the latest Reloaded version, Gears has finally made it to PlayStation as well, marking a milestone in gaming history where PS players, too, can now join Delta Squad.

Army of Two (2008)
Rough around the edges but an honorable mention nevertheless
Source: Electronic Arts
Army of Two might not be the most polished third-person shooter ever (let's be honest — it's not), but it sure as hell carved out something unforgettable. It introduced co-op as the centerpiece of a tactical military shooter. Black Ops 7 might be trying to do the same to pass off a multiplayer-only game as one with a campaign, but in 2008, Salem and Rios featured in a game where partnership was built into every single game mechanic. Between the aggro meters, back-to-back shooting, and the co-op sniping, Army of Two was designed to make you rely on your buddy, and it demanded teamwork instead of encouraging or appreciating it. Did it have rough edges? Absolutely. But is bold focus on co-op gameplay made it unique in a sea of tactical shooters from the time that have faded into obscurity.

Mass Effect 2 (2010)
This incredibly unforgettable RPG also had some of the most polished over-the-shoulder gunplay
One of the greatest RPGs of all time, Mass Effect 2 also holds a special place in the TPS hall of fame. Shooting finally felt tight and satisfying in ME2, and that's what separated it from the first game, elevating this sequel into third-person shooter territory, and that too, with honors. It still has one of the most brilliantly-designed finales in gaming, weaving together play choice, loyalty, and tension into one unforgettable climax. This sci-fi RPG with guns is one of the finest third-person shooters of its era, and arguably the crown jewel of Bioware's legacy (although KOTOR comes pretty close).

Dead Space 2 (2011)
An ageless classic that blew the first game out of the water
The first Dead Space game managed to hold off against an increasing tide of survival-horror games during its time that kept veering too far into the action side of things. Dialing things back down to the basics, it gave the world one of the most terrifying space-based games ever made, complete with a gripping narrative and fantastic moment-to-moment hair-raising gameplay. However, it was the sequel that really polished up the whole formula and became a flawless survival-horror game that still holds up today. Dead Space 2 transcended its sequel, with bigger setpieces, scarier encounters, tighter corridors, and... a talking protagonist. 14 years later, it remains one of the best third-person shooter games ever, and very much deserving of being discussed in the same breath as Resident Evil 4 for its takes on the TPS survival-horror genre.

Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (2009)
I'm still picking this over A Thief's End
Good god, the PlayStation 3 era gave us some of the most unforgettable classics ever made. Naughty Dog's Uncharted in 2007 took the best parts of Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider, and gave us Nathan Drake — "that two-bit thief, risking it all for some piece of treasure". This time, too, we saw a sequel absolutely demolish the first game with a level of polish only maturity can bring, and that is what made Uncharted 2 one of the greatest games of all time, both as a third-person shooter, and as a PlayStation exclusive game. It blended high-octane, cinematic action with fantastic moment-to-moment over-the-shoulder gunplay, and that made Uncharted 2 a timeless masterpiece that remains a breathtaking journey even today.

Grand Theft Auto V (2013)
Generation, culture, and genre-defining – all in one
There's a reason Rockstar's name keeps popping up on this list. When GTA V dropped in 2013, it was a cultural reset the likes of which we'd never seen in gaming. We got one of the most amazing open-world maps ever in the form of Los Santos, along with not one, not two, but three playable protagonists, a groundbreaking narrative and gameplay structure expertly interwoven into each other, and the character-switching mechanic that remains one of the most awe-inducing game mechanics ever made — all on seventh-generation hardware, somehow. The game was (and remains) so much more than just its gimmicks, too. GTA V pushed third-person gunplay to new heights, blending tight mechanics with physics-based chaos, all coming together brilliantly under one of the best-written and performed scripts in the medium. With GTA Online still thriving and then some, it's clear as day that GTA V gave the world one of the best third-person shooters ever, hands down.

Agree with a few here & you can't go wrong with GTA. For me though it'll always be The Phantom Pain that leaves a lasting memory. Loved it...& I swear I didn't google the actress who played Quiet...who was originally approached to play Fragile in Death Stranding till she never heard anything back...That's another story!
