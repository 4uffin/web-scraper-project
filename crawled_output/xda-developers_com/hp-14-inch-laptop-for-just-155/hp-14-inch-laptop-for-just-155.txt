You can't really ask for much more here, especially when the price comes in at just $155. But when it comes to the specifications, you're getting an Intel N150 processor that's paired with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. This combination can power through the basics, allowing you to surf the web, pay some bills online, author some documents, and more. The laptop also features a 14-inch screen, large keyboard, trackpad, along with plenty of connectivity options like USB-C, two USB-A, HDMI, SD card slot, 3.5mm audio jack, Wi-Fi 6, and Bluetooth. The battery life is pretty good too, with HP stating around 7 hours of use with a single charge. For the most part, the reviews from Best Buy are pretty solid, which is a good thing considering how cheap this is.
While there are better laptops, they cost a lot more. We don't think you'll be able to find anything that matches this setup for the same price. So if you've been looking for something cheap, get this HP laptop while you can. It's a limited-time deal that's only around for the day, so get it while you can.
