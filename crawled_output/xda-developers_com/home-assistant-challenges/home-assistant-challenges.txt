Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Since I started self-hosting, Home Assistant was at the top of my list of services to try out. The main reason I delayed implementing it is due to my lack of always-on hardware that could host a VM with Home Assistant. Home Assistant OS is my preferred method to host the service, since it supports add-ons. However, I eventually decided to create a container with Home Assistant on my NAS so that I could at least get started with learning how to use the service. Although getting it up and running was extremely easy, I eventually encountered several challenges I hadn't expected.
Broken integrations
The integration I was most excited about didn't work
When I first started considering Home Assistant as a home automation solution, I checked whether it supported an integration with Xiaomi Home. This is because the majority of my smart devices, from my TV box to my bedroom fan, are from Xiaomi. That said, I do have a few devices from other brands. So I wanted Home Assistant to act as the service that can connect them, especially since Google Home has been unreliable for me lately. But when I tried to add my Xiaomi Home devices to my Home Assistant instance, the built-in integration didn't work. At the start, every time I tried to sign in, it rejected my credentials. I tried alternative solutions, like manual configuration and using an open-source app to extract my device tokens. However, this also didn't work. Eventually, I realized that I had overlooked the fact that the supported list of hardware is actually quite short. Instead, I installed Home Assistant Community Store (HACS), then added Xiaomi Home as a custom integration using the company's GitHub resources. This finally allowed me to integrate the service into my instance. However, this required days of troubleshooting, research, and eventually stumbling upon a solution. Ultimately, though, I am happy that I installed the HACS integration, as it expands the possibilities of what I can do with my Home Assistant instance. I may have never tried it out if the built-in Xiaomi integration hadn't been confusing. Given that it's also called "Xiaomi Home," I was confused why it didn't work.
The complications of changing APIs
API changes can also break automations
While I was still figuring out a way to integrate my Xiaomi devices, I decided to at least set up a weather automation so I could get more use out of the Home Assistant app on my smartphone. I settled on the AccuWeather integration to do this as a result of several articles and forum posts that recommended it, since it would allow me to pull data for tomorrow's forecast and send notifications for specific variables. This is a relatively simple automation, but it relies on there being a weather service that provides a free API with support for the required data. I've set it up across different services, including IFTTT and Zapier, but the results are always mixed. My IFTTT automation stopped working, and Zapier doesn't support multi-step automations on my free account. I managed to set up the AccuWeather integration and pull the data I needed to trigger a push notification on my phone. But not long after, AccuWeather retired its free API, meaning the integration no longer worked for me. As I explored other possible integrations, I saw that other weather services have had similar changes. OpenWeatherMap still has a free plan, but this requires you to register a credit card with the service. I'm not really comfortable with this, both in terms of sharing my financial details and concerns that my integration could use more of the free quota than expected, resulting in unexpected charges. Instead, it's recommended to switch to Meteorologisk or PirateWeather. Eventually, I managed to get an automation running with the help of a colleague, which I wouldn't have been able to figure out myself due to my lack of familiarity with the syntax for Home Assistant templates. Which brings me to my next point...
The technical knowledge required
It's more complicated than it seems
One of the things I wish I had known about Home Assistant before using it is the technical knowledge required. While it's easy enough to set up a container, things become a lot more complex when it comes to custom integrations, templates, and scripts. I knew that I would likely have to deal with different variables when setting up automations, but I didn't realize that you sometimes need to write scripts to pull the data you want. That weather notification I managed to set up? It required a template to pull the data I needed, because this data wasn't included as an entity I could use to add to an automation. This differed from the AccuWeather integration, which included a variety of entities I could use or disable. I am planning on taking my time to explore what Home Assistant can do, but I realize it will take longer than I expected because of my lack of familiarity with template syntax. Blueprints could simplify this somewhat, but I like to understand the different variables before implementing them.
The overwhelming amount of data
My default dashboard had too much information
Despite not having many devices and integrations, I found that my default dashboard had an overwhelming amount of data when I first started adding services. For example, when I first added AccuWeather, it pulled a large number of entities that took up most of the dashboard. At first, I didn't realize that you weren't supposed to use this dashboard. Similarly, when I got my Xiaomi devices working with Home Assistant, there were so many fields available that I struggled to figure out things. I do realize that this kind of extensive data is needed to create powerful, fine-tuned automations. But at the same time, I wish the default dashboard would let us choose what to surface before adding it to the dashboard. I plan to get around this by setting up a new dashboard and only including the data I want surfaced at a glance. But this does take time, especially since integrations like Google Calendar require fiddling around with Google Cloud APIs. I later came across the automatically generated Home Assistant dashboards that you can use, but their existence didn't feel obvious at first.
My Home Assistant journey will take time
I honestly should've expected to come across more challenges when I set up Home Assistant, especially since I'm aware there are many things people oversimplify about self-hosting. After all, most self-hosted services involve a lot of troubleshooting and unexpected complications. That said, I'm still excited about Home Assistant and everything I get working right feels like a win. If you're considering trying out Home Assistant for yourself, I recommend taking it slow and not putting pressure on yourself to get to grips with everything straight away.

For your 4th issue, they are creating new default dashboards that don’t just throw everything on it. When you onboard a device, you choose what room or area it’s in, and it then creates a nice dynamic dashboard with the relevant entities for each room displayed. You can choose what does and doesn’t show up too. It’s very similar to apple homekit.

You could have solved all of this just using chatgpt. In less than 1 hour all would have been solved. Even better as I am doing, install cursor IDE pay 20 eur. And than ask it to load your config file. It will do so through sshpass without issues. Than you just tell it what doesn't work and will solve all your issues within minutes. I dont understand it when someone mentions something isn't working and taking days to resolve it, while in days I let sonnet or gpt reprogramming entire integrations from native HA to python with is by the way far more reliable to do light sequences especially.I dont know anything about how HA works, yet I have a full hotel running it, with custom dashboards, automate everything up to watering the plants, have 10 HA instances running and one general HA controlling all from reception have several appdaemon apps, reprogrammed the mushroomcards to suit my needs reliably, and it has taken me 3 weeks on cursor IDE and 450 eur of token usage. Its ridiculous what you can do in such a small time, and I did it all while being on a holiday remotely. seriously use the tools at your disposal! Nothing is impossible anylonger. You are a senior high level software developer if you just use AI

I've had some family and friends ask about my HA setup. My home is very automated and I have spent about three years now learning and learning something new.... constantly with HA. When they ask me if they should us HA if I can help them set it up ...my default answer is ..no. I don't think so. Unless, I know they have some tech or even geek background. This is because, I'm a communications engineer. I work from home and ....I work ...a lot! I've also been involved with IT related stuff for nearly 35 years. To really use HA....to really enjoy the power and freedom that HA offers....well, ya gotta be able to "fix the clock on a VCR!" LOLThats a old joke...for us old timers. It was a way to gauge someone's abilities with tech stuff. Most of my family....I was the guy that had to fix their VCR clock...lol. HA is kind of like 3D printing. You have to be willing to spend time learning. You may need to ask for help. Often. From forums or Discords. But....you have to put in some work. People get a 3D printer, maybe as a gift. But, they don't want to learn about her leveling or filament types. How to fix issues with prints and on and on. So, it becomes a treadmill or exercise equipment in the corner of the office. The only time you use it...is to dust it...lol. So ..if you're willing to learn...it's not crazy hard. If you aren't afraid to ask for help when you need it. I say ..sure.... go for it. But ..my Ex....her Mother! No way in hell .. would I install HA for them. Just nightmare fuel....that is! ;-)I absolutely LOVE HA!!! Don't get me wrong. I'm currently learning LVGL on ESPhome and Cheap Yellow Displays. I've had to do a lot of reading, asking for help
and got some great tips....right here from a XDA article! Ryan Ewen's GitHub, provided in the article, got me over the hardware/pin settings in the YAML! Huge help! I'm getting there. Can't wait to have 3.5" displays all over the house....lol.
