Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
When we think of increasing performance with existing components, we often think about strategies like overclocking, increasing power limits, and replacing an existing cooling solution. While overclocking does have its merits, there's a far easier way to increase performance without potentially sacrificing the longevity of your parts: undervolting. Instead of pumping more voltage through your CPU, creating more heat and shortening the effective lifespan of the silicon, undervolting does the opposite. I've undervolted all the parts in my system, but my CPU undervolt breathed new life into my system. So much so, that it felt like I upgraded my CPU is a more powerful SKU.
What is undervolting?
Less power, more performance?
Undervolting is the practice of decreasing the voltage supplied to a component while maintaining (or even increasing) clock speeds. CPU manufacturers ship a CPU set at a specific, stable voltage that they apply to all units they ship. This "one-size-fits-all" approach works for them because they know the silicon will be stable at that voltage, but many CPUs in a given SKU can run at a reduced voltage just fine. There is an element of the silicon lottery at play here, just as there is with overclocking. Some CPUs won't be able to maintain stability at lower voltages, and some may be able to dive far below spec. It really depends on the quality of chip you received, and there's no way to tell until you start trying it for yourself.
How it helps real-world performance
Feels like an upgrade all on its own
Undervolting makes your CPU use less power, which also reduces operating temperatures significantly. Furthermore, this reduction in temperature has a direct knock-on effect on performance, often enabling the CPU to boost clocks higher and for longer. For workstations, this means render or compile times are reduced, and for gaming, it means more stable performance. Reduced temperatures also mean your cooling system doesn't have to work as hard to keep temps down, lowering overall noise. All of these benefits apply to laptops, too.
It's a super simple process
It's not akin to overclocking
Overclocking can be simple, but it has a connotation of being a complex undertaking. There are a few different moving parts, but with undervolting, there's really only one, and it's voltage. For AMD processors, undervolting can be done through Ryzen Master, reducing all-core values in the Curve Optimizer. I started small, on my Ryzen 7 7800X3D, with steps of -5. I settled around -20, as anything lower started to affect stability in a few select applications. You can verify your values aren't going to instantly crash by using the "Validate Offset" function within Ryzen Master, but really, if you want to really ensure stability, you should stress test using Prime95. For Intel-based machines, undervolting can be done through their Intel XTU utility, where you can adjust core ratios and voltage offsets directly. For either CPU vendor, monitoring temps using something like HWmonitor or Core Temp is a good idea. In my case, my CPU was capable of a significant undervolt, and while my idle temps didn't move, my core temps under load dropped by 10+ degrees. I also noticed the boost clocks being maintained for longer while under load. Perhaps the most noticeable effect was my framerate in Counter-Strike 2. Before, it would routinely dip below 240, especially with a lot of action on screen, but the undervolt kept my minimum FPS high and reduced stuttering significantly.
There are downsides
Stability can be shaky
Undervolting wasn't all smooth sailing for me. I was fighting weird instability with very specific games after applying lower voltages, though things were stable with Prime95. The type of workload does matter, and while lowering voltage doesn't pose any kind of danger to your hardware, weird things can happen, so creating restore points and backing up important data is always a good idea before making any kind of changes. I didn't see any kind of issues even when crashing, and it's rare, but data loss can occur.
Undervolting is always worth experimenting with
Not every system can handle a deep overclock, and not everyone has the budget for premium cooling, but undervolting is available to just about anyone. With only a little patience, you can reclaim performance, reduce noise, and even extend the life of your components. It’s proof that sometimes the most effective upgrade isn’t new hardware, but simply using what you already have more efficiently.

Good article.
Burned through two i7-13700Ks due to Intel microcode issues (too much voltage at spikes).
Undervolting is the way to go.

As far as undervolting amd cpu's goes stability really comes down to how your operating system kernel handles p-states.This is my experience from undervolting via UEFI and using Linux.I use an AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D on a B450 chipset with a negative pbo tune of 30 on all cores. I never experienced any instability. When the Linux kernel was defaulting to using p-states in passive mode performance was only slightly better performance as in boosted clock speeds would be active for longer and thermal temps weren't as eradic.It wasn't until I explicitly instructed the kernel to use p-states in active active mode that I really saw an increase in my performance. Boost clock speed was not only active for longer but higher as well as having less thermal output. I went from having temps of 50-60c on a full load to 45c. Boost clock now reaches 4401mhz and stays active until the load comes down. My cooling method is a tower style quad-pipe heatsink from deepcool.

You tend to get instability when the load changes, because as the frequency goes up and down, the requested voltage goes up and down, but the problem arises because the voltage overshoots and bounces back to the actual required voltage...The most typical reason for a crash is when going from high load/frequency/voltage to low load/frequency/voltage, the voltage will overshoot downwards, so you end up with not enough voltage for just a few microseconds.
But that's long enough...As a result, high load tests like prime95 aren't actually that good for testing undervolt stability, because they go to high load and stay there.
The system is plenty stable at full load forever, but when you stop P95 and just open a web browser - bsod.Games which load different world areas are often very susceptible to undervolt instability...
In Atlas (the pirate game), for example, my slightly too aggressive undervolt crashed the system the second I traversed a game square.
Every other game I played was fine, and so was Atlas as long as I didn't leave the world segment...
So, my point being - if you have undervolted and install a game that seems buggy and crashes frequently, then your first diagnostic should be to lessen your undervolt...
In my case, I had a -105mV undervolt on an Intel CPU and going to -100mV instead fixed it.
I then actually set it to-95mV to allow for seasonal variation (it might be stable at -100 in winter, but what about summer when it's 30C ambient)...
On the plus side, once you adjust it for that case, you're unlikely to need to do it again for anything else because that was probably your worst case scenario.

The line is superb, should be in movies — sometimes the most effective upgrade isn't new, but simply using what you already have more efficiently and my dad also taught me today.

Prime95 wasn't reliable for me to test stability other than for finding the lower voltage limits for heat sensitive voltages like VDDCR SOC. Neither was OCCT. For stability testing on Ryzen it's much preferred to use lighter load tasks that don't necessarily hit the CPU PPT but is enough for the CPU to boost max for all cores like Aida64, it works much more reliably than P95 for me. Also I ironically found TM5 absolut to be a very heavy workload of that type and is even more reliable for finding CO instability for me, even though it's a RAM test. The downside is that you will have to completely make sure the RAM is stable first, otherwise you might be confusing CO with RAM instability.Personally I use CO -34 all core, I haven't had any random shutdowns/restarts or any issues for a week. Worth monitoring Event Viewer WHEA + Security and Maintenance reliability reports to find minor instability, if I find patterns (like apps crashing due to ntdll or some other Windows component) I'll lower the CO bit by bit. I used to have a 10700 that was only minorly unstable at low load, not unstable enough to cause BSOD, restart or corruption but is enough to cause weird apps to crash while closing, like Snipping Tool somehow. Games also often crash while closing and dumps cores, never while playing. It was quite hard to diagnose since 10th gen Intel appears to have error correction capabilities (like Ryzens do), unlike previous gens where CPU instability could be confidently identified with variable workloads like Linpack. Switched from an offset to an AC LL undervolt and it seems to have solved it. In AMD you can do this through curve shaper, though I don't use it and will just play with CO because that seems more convenient.Another stability and temperature trick is to simply use an Fmax offset (max boost) of -100, instead of the PBO +200 people usually recommend. 1-2% single core loss for big voltage reduction (sometimes even 50mV) and might even allow better CO results.

I would say it's pretty much a must on the Ryzen 7 5800X3D , OC is locked anyways , it's awesome performance the CPU flies ahead still with -25 to all cores undervolt,combined with the RTX3080 ROG Strix 10GB OC gaming

I completely agree. I screwed up and started playing right away when I installed my 58003D. Didn't even check temps for like 6hrs. I was running 96... so bad.I got a lucky silicon, got a stable -30 across everything. Hottest temp now is 74, its fantastic

JAMES No James , I would highly recommend updating your motherboard to the newest bios. , then undervolt to -30 on all cores, I have yet to see a 5800X3D fail to run , longer boost and much better temp , GPU OC is optional

No, upgrading your CPU is one of the best upgrades you can do. Upgrading you're GPU is one of the best upgrades you can do. Undervolting is somewhere in the middle.
