Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
If most of your viewing is on OTT platforms like Netflix, Max, or Hulu, you probably don’t need anything extra. But if you are someone like me who still watches a lot of live TV, you know the experience feels fragmented and limited even with a smart TV running Google TV. You often need separate apps or subscriptions to access sports, news, or local channels, and the built-in TV tuners are slow with minimal guides and little flexibility. Recording or pausing live broadcasts is either not supported or tied to proprietary restrictions. I almost gave up on live TV until recently (well, I am a little late to the party) when I discovered Tvheadend. Tvheadend is an open-source TV streaming server that takes regular broadcasts from an antenna, satellite, cable, or even IPTV, and turns them into internet streams you can watch on any device in your home. It adds a proper guide, recording, time shifting, and makes all your live channels available in one place.
Setting up Tvheadend
It takes some effort to set it up
Getting Tvheadend up and running is not as complicated as it might sound. The software is flexible and can be installed in several environments. People often run it on a Raspberry Pi with a USB tuner, inside a Docker container on a NAS, or on a dedicated Linux server. I will quickly go through how to install it on your Linux desktop. I tried installing TVheadend directly from the Ubuntu repositories, but that didn't work. A better way is by pulling the tool from a PPA (Personal Package Archive) that provides more up-to-date builds than the official repos. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mamarley/tvheadend-git -ysudo apt install tvheadend -y During installation, the system will prompt you to set an administrative username and password. These credentials are what you will use to log into the web interface, so make sure you save them. Tvheadend installs as a service that runs under a system user called hts, which is created automatically during the setup. After installation, you need to make sure this service user has permission to access your tuner hardware. Run: sudo adduser hts video Then restart the service with: sudo systemctl restart tvheadend With the service running, open a browser and go to http://localhost:9981 on the same machine. This will bring up the Tvheadend web interface. Log in with the credentials you created earlier.
Why it beats built-in smart TV features
Tvheadend makes live TV smart, too
Smart TVs today come loaded with streaming apps and even basic live TV tuners, but they are often limited by vendor restrictions, storage constraints, and region-specific features. Tvheadend, on the other hand, acts as a dedicated backend server that gives you full control over how you watch and record content. Instead of tying recordings to a single TV, Tvheadend streams live channels and stored shows across your entire home network. It works seamlessly with smart TVs, Android TV boxes, tablets, and phones, so every device can access the same library of channels and recordings. You also get advanced features that TVs rarely offer, such as scheduling recordings on a NAS, running multiple streams simultaneously with multi-tuner setups, and using flexible protocols like HTTP, HTSP, and SAT>IP to serve content. Paired with front ends like Kodi or lightweight Android TV apps, Tvheadend transforms a simple broadcast feed into a whole-home media service. Most importantly, it puts you in control. There are no ads baked into the interface, no restrictions on where you store your recordings, and no risk of a manufacturer dropping support for a feature in the next software update.
Tvheadend vs Plex and Jellyfin
It pairs well with Jellyfin
Of course, Tvheadend is not the only way to handle live TV and recording. Plex offers its own DVR functionality, but it requires a paid subscription. While Plex’s interface is polished and user-friendly, tuner support is limited, and the best features are locked behind Plex Pass. Tvheadend is free, supports a wide range of hardware, and does not limit what you can do with your own recordings. Jellyfin, on the other hand, is a completely free and open-source media server that many people use as an alternative to Plex. It can handle live TV, but usually relies on tuners like HDHomeRun or IPTV streams. To get the same flexibility you would with a dedicated DVB tuner, most people pair Jellyfin with Tvheadend. In fact, Jellyfin has an official plugin for Tvheadend integration, which lets you use Tvheadend as the backend and Jellyfin’s interface on the frontend. If you prefer Kodi, you can use the Tvheadend PVR add-on instead, which brings live TV and recording management right into Kodi’s familiar interface.
Tvheadend
Tvheadend is the leading TV streaming server and recorder for Linux supporting ATSC, DVB-C/C2, DVB-S/S2, DVB-T/T2, ISDB-T, IPTV, SAT>IP and HDHomeRun input sources. Tvheadend outputs HTTP (VLC, MPlayer), HTSP (Kodi, Movian) and SAT>IP streams, and can ingest multiple Electronic Program Guide (EPG) formats including over-the-air (OTA) broadcast data for DVB and ATSC, and OpenTV extensions like XMLTV and PyXML.

Take control of the content you watch
It’s very easy to take control of what you watch. You can create a powerful media center with an SBC or even host something like Plex on an old Windows PC. If you own a Raspberry Pi, you might want to check out ways to watch live TV using it with TV tuner hardware.

Why is it that there's so much self-hosting content on this site but no categories at all for self-hosting, homelabbing and more?We appreciate the content, but man, it's hard to scour to find it all.

What you described is really cool and opens a lot of possibilities. Trouble is if I
watch live TV then it's mainly sports. As a kid I used to record movies on VHS then later DVDs but since the rise of torrents and now streaming there's no need for me at least to record any live TV anymore. With sports if I can't watch the live thing I'll just catch the highlights. But once it's in the past most of the magic is gone. It's really good to know that such an advanced option exists though
