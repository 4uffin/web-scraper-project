6 ways WSL2 replaced virtual machines in most of my workflows

If you've ever had to work in a Linux environment, but still needed quick access to Windows-based tools and features, it's likely you've turned to virtual machines. They were (and still are, in some ways) a great way to create a bridge between the two operating systems, but have been largely replaced by Microsoft's Windows Subsystem for Linux. WSL2 is Microsoft's attempt to develop an extremely lightweight way to run Linux within a Windows environment, and it has largely trounced my need for bulky virtual machines.
Complete file system integration
No shared folders needed
One of the huge downsides of ever working inside virtual machines is the huge hassle of shared folder setups. Any time you want to pass long files to your VMs, it requires setting them up, and while sometimes it works as intended, whenever it doesn't, it's a huge drag. WSL2 makes this a moot point entirely, because it exposes Linux file system paths to Windows directly, allowing you to share configuration files, develop and test code instantly, and even transfer larger media assets, all within a native environment. It can sometimees be even more convenient than having a dedicated Linux OS installed on your system, as sharing files between operating systems and their different file systems can be made difficult because of settings like fast boot, or the lack of certain packages on the Linux side of things. I used to try and maintain a synced folder between my VMs and my host machine, but now, WSL2 solves pretty much all of my file sharing woes.
Dynamic resource sharing
No more pre-allocation
While VMs pre-allocate resources like CPU cores, RAM, and storage, WSL2 only uses resources as needed, like any other process on your PC. Any time you're running something intensive, the performance scales automatically, and when it's dormant, it releases memory back to the main system as needed, just like Windows does (most of the time). For me, this is super convenient. As someone who fills a lot of different shoes, I'll often have different Adobe apps open, games being launched after work, and of course, my unhealthy number of browser tabs. WSL2 does what I need it to do, then ensures resources are properly distributed back to my system.
Easier software management
Package managers make software less clunky
While you can get similar experiences natively on Windows or by dual-booting a Linux OS, nothing quite matches the software management that package managers offer you. apt, pacman, zypper and dnf can all be ran directly inside WSL2, which means you get direct access to the Linux package ecosystem. I can use them to install anything from OpenSSH to specific versions of Node.js if I need them, without having to deal with the clunk of Windows and being pigeonholed into GUIs.
Docker integration
Incredibly convenient
Docker itself is already extremely powerful and robust, even if you run it directly on Windows. But running it inside of WSL2 is simple, and gets rid of a lot of the overhead that Docker Desktop brings along with it. Docker Desktop already hooks into WSL2, but running it without the GUI means you're that much closer to native Linux behavior. For me, this is way simpler and more efficient than firing up a Linux VM, then running Docker inside of that.
Networking simplicity
No need for a ton of separate virtual adapters
One of the most annoying parts of working with VMs, to me, was networking. Between all the NAT configuration, bridging adapters and tweaking firewalls, I've had it up to here with networking VMs. WSL2 integrates directly into my existing network stack, so all localhost ports, firewall rules, and other settings apply.
Hardware acceleration support
GPU compute is right there for you
WSL2 supports GPU acceleration through CUDA and DirectML, which means any kind of AI training or rendering workloads can be run directly in a Linux environment. Sure, it's possible to get this working through VMs, but it's not always seamless. Among all the other benefits, if I choose to dabble in any kind of ML, it's nice to know I can run something like TensorFlow directly on my GPU through WSL2, removing the need for any kind of VM.
Virtual machines still have a place
Just not in my workflow. I'm not testing anything with the intention of deploying it into a production environment, so spinning up a ton of virtual machines just seems like added bulk and hassle that I don't need. WSL2 is incredibly light, runs fast, and is way more closely integrated with Windows, which is still my main OS for the foreseeable future.

I am very grateful for what Microsoft have done for us here. I use it with VS Code and various extensions for linux development work, as well as running various linux tools and scripts. I am still reliant on VMs however for snapshots and UDP networking.
