Please stop using your ISP's DNS

Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
The internet can be a pretty scary place, and while we use privacy-focused browsers, know what phishing attempts look like, and
use password managers to keep our secrets safe, another piece of information gets siphoned off every time you navigate to a new webpage. At least, if you're still using the
DNS servers that your ISP or cellular provider set up when you first got service, because those plaintext queries get stored and sold to advertisers and anyone else who might want to get their hands on the information they hold.
If you care about your online privacy, it's time to stop using your ISP's DNS servers. You don't have to self-host a DNS server if you don't want to, but take a little time to research an external DNS provider that uses encrypted methods, and switch to that on all your devices. Every little piece of data you can claw back from your ISP and other data hogs is worth the effort.
The problem with your ISP's DNS
Okay, problems, plural, because they're not your friend
There are many reasons you'd not want your ISP resolving your DNS queries, but most of them boil down to one thing — privacy. ISPs are lousy at this, whether it's not enabling DNSSEC to ensure DNS responses are authentic and untampered with, or bundling your browsing habits into nice packages to sell to advertisers as supposedly anonymous data. In a world where all data is for sale, sending out unencrypted DNS records is another way for you and your habits to be tracked. The other thing that your ISP does is network-level DNS blocks of any resources or websites that they deem unsafe, potentially cutting off access to chunks of the open internet. That could be a good thing, if they're blocking known malware sources, but it doesn't take much of an imagination to see it potentially used for blocking adult content, tools for video game preservation, or anything that the ISP decides to block (or gets a legal notice from the government to do so). By moving to another DNS provider, you sidestep any ISP-level blocks. It doesn't guaranteed your new DNS provider doesn't have its own blocks, but these are generally more forthcoming about what and why they're blocking certain content, and it's mostly for the user's benefit and safety.
You don't have to self-host DNS
Many of the commercial alternatives are safe and secure
There are plenty of private DNS providers worldwide to get encrypted DNS set up with the minimum of fuss. You don't have to self-host anything to use these options; instead you change the DNS server on every device you want to use it on, from your router to smartphones and more. That gives your devices better security, circumvents any ISP-level blocks to DNS resolution, and helps you stay more private when online.
While encrypted DNS will keep your ISP from seeing your DNS queries, it's not going to keep your browsing private. You'll need a VPN or other securely encrypted method of accessing the internet for that.
You'll want to make sure the DNS provider you choose supports DNSSEC, QNAME Minimization, and also either disable or anonymize EDNS Client Subnet (ECS) if it's available. Also, you don't want it to log personal data to disk, and it should support anycast or geo-steering. In no particular order, each of these DNS providers will be more secure and private than your ISP's:
Cloudflare (1.1.1.1): Runs a large chunk of the internet, known for not blocking sites unless known as a threat
Quad9 (9.9.9.9): Encrypted DNS, also known for not blocking sites without them serving malware or other threats
Control D (76.76.2.2): No logging, various encryption methods, and works on Apple devices
AdGuard Public DNS: Anonymized, uses some filtering, has Apple profiles.
These should all also support various encrypted options, including DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS, or DNS-over-Quic. And with how often DNS goes wrong, it's always a good idea to use a trusted DNS solution for the best and most secure option.
But self-hosting gives you more control
You get ad-blocking, locally resolved domains, and more
Self-hosting a DNS server is deceptively simple to do these days, whether you choose from any of the options, including Unbound, AdGuard Home, PowerDNS, or my personal favorite, Technitium. You'll still want to have some queries sent to an external DNS server in an encrypted manner for fallback, but having your own local DNS server making its own encrypted requests will increase the security and privacy of your home network and the devices using that DNS server. You get all the bonuses of using an existing DNS provider, like ad blocking at the source, plus you can set up zones, split horizon DNS so that different devices on your network get different DNS results, and local domain rebinds, which are very handy for home lab use. Add in dnscrypt-proxy as a local frontend (if needed), and your DNS requests are unreadable by your ISP. Finally, block port 53 to force every device to use your new local DNS server via encrypted egress, and you're in (relative) control over your DNS queries.
Whatever you choose, it's time to stop using your ISP's DNS servers
Using the DNS servers your ISP defaults to might be easy, but it's not good for your online privacy. Plus, your DNS data is likely being sold for advertising use, along with any other data that the ISP can sniff. Using an encrypted DNS provider means your ISP is cut out of the loop, so while it doesn't make your browsing private, it does reduce the exposure of your online usage. And it's not just your browsing habits, because your location can be triangulated with DNS queries, and that's possibly more worrisome.

NextDNS is amazing, and by far the best DNS solution. Has all the logs, white list, black list, everything. I have it set up on each of my devices individually, so it's on even when I'm outside.

I also use nextdns because it gives me a lot of controls over what I can do. Whitelist any false positives and blacklist anything I want blocked.

I have been using the Cloudflare DNS servers since COVID-19, both 1.0.0.1 and their IPV6 one, but for the past 3 to 4 months, their DNS server has failed to reach some websites. Also, I faced downtime, but I didn't know that then. Some days earlier, an official Cloudflare release was an article about a certificate issued to an unknown entity, posing a risk to the system. Then I changed my DNS servers to Google Public DNS from yesterday. Can you suggest how much it costs to host a DNS service for your Home Server?

If you face downtime because of DNS, then remember to use DNS from two different sources.I use from Cloudflare and Google because of latency.

Can you use a custom DNS on your mobile device and be connected to a VPN at the same time? Doesn't this cause leaks? I use a paid VPN connected to a country outside of the U.S. most of the time, unless the content refuses to load from a non-US location then I'll turn it off for a minute. So I'm wondering if I need to change my DNS settings. I'm running android 15 on a Motorola power 5G 2025.

Yes. I use AdGuard DNS and use either Express VPN or Nord on my Pixel 9 Pro XL. It's great.

Samsung Galaxy has a setting to make Secure DNS automatic, with a default roll back to the carrier's DNS if private is unavailable. However, it doesn't let you specify your own choice of private DNS servers.

That’s not “secure DNS”, that’s Samsung DNS, which is arguably worse

Samsung Galaxy most certainly DOES allow you to specify your own choice of private DNS servers.

23 ads to read this article.
I guess the theory is if you keep adding more ads eventually people will have to pay you to remove the ads. Nope I'll just stop reading articles here. They were floating ads, three of them at the same time. All of this on the tiny phone screen it's crazy. I understand that you have to make money but it's hurting your credibility

No ads for me. Then again, I use Control D DNS, where my network profile blocks ads among other things. I only point it out for irony, as this article is extollong the benefits of using your own DNS, and gives Control D as an example. In so doing, I've essentially followed the advice of the article (not really since I have been using some variation of the approach for years), which has resulted in a loss of ad revenue for this site. "Thanks for the tip, XDA!"

Some ISP's resolve customer portals only via their dns resolving from their IP's. And best not to use foreign DNS resolvers. I found Paramount streaming would occasionaly say my video was not available in my region until I dropped a European DNS server in the US.

Also, depending on your country, government-mandated bans (let's say for pirate website for instance) may be enforced through your ISP's DNS servers.

This article is very misleading. It's sensational for the clicks. As a network engineer working for many regional ISP's
I can tell you first hand 80% of them already give you DNS ips for CloudFlare and or Google. I've not worked on any that store DNS records to the degree of personalized per user. Not only that but to keep those kind of records would be substantial and costly! Therefore the majority of ISP's not only forego hosting DNS but can't justify the expense let alone storing a customers personal DNS records!!.Secondly in North America were required to store customer browsing records for 1 year according to our governments. If a law enforcement agency contacts us regarding illegal activity they provide a time, day and port number we have to lookup so as to locate the customer responsible. But this isn't done using DNS at all. It's literally watching all Layer 3 traffic. Again it's also expensive to do. For a company with 500 subscribers they need to store 16tb of Netflow data to meet govt requirements. Even then the data is only used for law enforcement. It's
difficult to build profiles for specific customers .Where much of the tracking happens is Facebook, Meta, Google. Tracking cookies, Google adsense. Facebook even when closed logs keywords and conversations on personal devices.

North America being.. Mexico? The United States (or Canada for that matter) has no laws stipulating data retention by ISPs, it's done on a voluntary basis by the ISPs and then handed over to law enforcement and federal agencies as requested. That doesn't sound very consumer-friendly to me.

Majority of ISPs don't host DNS? I've had at least a dozen ISPs, in three countries, and not found one that didn't use their own DNS, yet.

I have found that enabling secure DNS on my pixel 7a causes over 50% of my page loads to fail on first try due to not finding the server. Reloads eventually go through. It is as if the dns doesn't respond fast enough. I've tried both cloudflare and Google as DNS providers with similar results. My impression is that perhaps Verizon slows the responses.. problems go away if I turn it back off and use Verizon's DNS. Are others having similar issues?

I am using Pi-hole as my DNS with Unbound. Been using Pi-hole for a long time but with Unbound for a little over a month. It works great, blocks a lot of ads and trackers. Highly recommend. It is also super easy to set up.

Actually it's a bad idea, what about the local CDN hosted in your ISP, it might bypass the CDN and select the slower CDN

Learning code for a my own gif/screensaver websites sales department
has been challenging. My fears have been going to all the trouble of being an independent
Content creator only to have all my work tampered with or customers data stolen has always been on my mind. I recently tried Quad 9 but I got redirected to the Google Pkaystore which presented
what appears to be a fake Quad 9 site which instantly wanted a considerable sum for the use of the fake Quad 9 it was suggested to be by Googles playstore...I have yet to proceed with any serious attempts @ getting the phantom Quad 9 as my host
because the
Google playstore scam has me spooked. If you can't trust Google who can you trust...? Bill Gates lol...

Whatever happened there wasn’t exclusively their fault, every other dns provider share the exact same risk. At least cloudflare reported the problem - I’m more concerned about the silent ones that claim everything is fine with no hiccups anywhere.

I've been using NextDNS and Adguard for my phone and at home DNS servers. Highly recommended.

If you like NextDNS, you'll love Control D. I say this as someone who was a happy NextDNS paid customer for years and didn't have any complaints.

This article is stupid. There is no manner to secure your data because the person who holds the decrypt keys. Even if you know how to write your own encryption algorithms, either the data is still leaked, or someone else has it. What is to prevent them from selling the information anyways? Being paranoid doesn't protect you, it makes you waste time and money for paper walls.

Sure, Quad 9 could sell your data, but it would be the end of Quad 9 if they did. Otoh, Google's whole business plan is based on selling user data, so I can't see trusting them. Meanwhile, I'm certain that EVERY ISP is seeking my data
