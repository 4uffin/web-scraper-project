Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Thanks to certain beginner-friendly distros, Network-Attached Storage systems are easier to set up than ever, and you can get a budget-friendly backup server without shelling out wads of cash on the hardware. However, the complexity of these storage servers goes up a notch once you step into the nitty-gritty of NAS services. And I don’t mean virtualization or snapshots either – there’s a ton of cool services that can elevate your NAS experience, provided you’re willing to put in some extra effort to configure them. SMB multichannel is one such feature that’s not only locked behind a barrage of menus, but also needs some convoluted pre-requisites. But if you’re good with home networks and have a semi-decent storage server with spare network interfaces, it’s a service worth checking out.
What’s SMB multichannel, anyway?
A way to boost your transfer speeds
Let’s say you’ve got a couple of spare Ethernet ports on your NAS and at least two such connections on your PC. Well, SMB multichannel lets you combine all the ports between a client PC and a NAS server in a single SMB connection. While fault tolerance is an obvious advantage of such a setup, the biggest draw of SMB multichannel is that you can bolster the file transfer speeds between the server and a (single) client. As such, it’s pretty effective when your workloads involve heavy SMB transfers where you can put multiple 1G or 2.5G Ethernet ports to good use.
And no, it’s not link aggregation
Before I read all the documentation on SMB multichannel, I figured it was similar to link aggregation. Technically, link aggregation and SMB multichannel can improve your NAS’ fault tolerance by leveraging a couple of network interfaces, but they serve entirely different purposes. Link aggregation involves combining the network ports on your NAS into a single logical link, and provides increased throughput to all the clients (emphasis on all) in your home network. So, rather than increasing the transfer speeds of your NAS by turning 2x 1G ports into 2G connections, it boosts the amount of bandwidth that can flow into the storage server, making it better when you’ve got multiple devices attempting to read/write data to it. Meanwhile, SMB multichannel is ideal for setups where you need high-speed file transfers between a single client-server pair. Not to mention, you’ll need more than one network interface on both the NAS server and your PC (or whatever device you’re using as the client). Both services are also mutually exclusive for your home network, and you’ll have to disable link aggregation before configuring SMB multichannel. Then there’s the other, more complicated pre-requisite…
You’ll need two subnets, though
VLANs are your best friends
TrueNAS requires you to configure at least two different subnets for SMB multichannel, and although you can use a couple of workarounds, using the same subnet can land you with some performance issues. Essentially, your setup will require distinct subnets, with each one featuring a pair of client and NAS network interfaces. Take my setup, for instance: Subnet 1 has 192.168.0.1 as the gateway, with 192.168.0.71 being the IPv4 address of the NIC on my PC and 192.168.0.97 belonging to one of the two network interfaces on my TrueNAS workstation. Likewise, the other subnet has 192.168.8.82 as the NAS IPv4 address and 192.168.8.198 as the NIC on my PC, with 192.168.8.1 being the gateway. Unfortunately, setting up the subnets can be a bit of a challenge if you’re not accustomed to tinkering with home networks. I used my Zyxel managed switch to create separate VLANs for each pair of PC-NAS network interfaces. Afterward, I headed to the VLAN section within my OPNsense router and created two VLANs featuring its LAN port as the Parent interface and the same VLAN tags as the VIDs on my Zyxel switch. After enabling each interface, I set a Static IP for them and configured DHCP to assign the IPv4 addresses to my NAS and PC interfaces.
Setting up SMB multichannel
It’s a piece of cake in TrueNAS
Once I’d gone through the process of setting up different VLANs, the rest of the procedure was relatively simple. I clicked on the menu button inside the Windows (SMB) Shares section on the TrueNAS web UI and chose Configure Service. Tapping the Advanced option inside the SMB settings columns revealed Multichannel, which I promptly enabled before restarting the SMB server.
With SMB multichannel configured on TrueNAS, I signed in to the network share on my PC and opened the Windows terminal. I quickly ran Get-SmbServerConfiguration | Select EnableMultichannel and Get-SmbClientConfiguration | Select EnableMultichannel to enable the facility on my PC before executing Get‑SmbMultichannelConnection to confirm whether it's working.
Take your NAS game to the next level with some neat features
Besides SMB multichannel, there are a couple of cool options you can tinker with in a NAS. My favorite is RAM (and to a lesser extent, SSD) caching, which can grant a significant boost to HDD speeds. If you value backups as much as I do, TrueNAS and fellow compatriots of the NAS landscape include dedicated snapshot utilities to safeguard all the data stored on your storage server.

As if AFP, NFS,SFTP is any better.. SPOILER ALERT. its not . and subletting IS NOT THE ANSWER. SMB 1.0 is perfectly fine. the so called vulnerabilities are unlikely to be exploited.. i can also say the same for bluekeep.

Why? Why would I do 2 different subnets for that? I want to connect 2 cables from NAS to PC and use 4 IP addresses total (same network) to do the 2 channel. Why do they hav to complicate things.?

also don't understand why it is required by truenasI do host smb server on windows server host machine. connected with two 1G NICs , both have same subnet, and Samba multichannel works fine. speed is multiplied

I've done it before,
not really worth the effort. You much better off upgrading fiber ports and cards and going RDMA instead. Problem with SMB is it's single threaded so RDMA is about best you can do.

I dont see the benefit in this if your like me and use your nas mostly has a media server. SMB multi channel really only helps if you got multiple files in transfer. For me this does nothing unless it's for backups. and im copying like multiple files for the sync or transfer. I only see this as a benefit for someone working with many open files or using like a home open source thing simular to 1 drive and your keeping your PC files synced to the NAS.
And agree 10g networking has drop a large amount. That's it doesn't take much. Just need to make sure your using a 10gig switch with some mounting and management to take advantage of a 10gig unlink subnet and gateway. If you stick that to the 1gig router your backbone is still in 1gig.

Since this is a direct connection, why not just set the IPs/subnet directly on the nics and skip the VLANs. This how my servers are connected to my NAS. No need for routing for a direct connection.

One correction: Hosts can use multiple member links in a Link aggregation connection for data transfers, but the protocol used will need to use multiple layer-4 ports (multiple connections). But the LACP load-balancing hash will need to be configured to something like a four tupple based hash like src-dst-ip-port. To state that it's not possible is simply not true. A client will obviously need to be connected to the network with enough bandwidth to saturate an LACP member to see any benefit.Note that not all vendors support hashes which take the source address and port into consideration, YMMV.As for single threaded SMB, it cannot generate multiple connections per session. However other protocols, like nfs with nconnect set to something higher than 1 will.

Seems much simpler to switch to fiber instead. 10g hardware is dirt cheap.

Julian for $5 I'm not even sure you could buy the 2nd network cable, lol. To be able to do the multichannel, you either need a really fancy setup (expensive) or a second direct connection between the PC and the server (cheap). To do the latter, you need a 2nd network card/port on each machine. In which case... you may as well get 10g fiber. 10g fiber cards are $10-15 each, a cable is another $10.
