We love mini PCs. Not only are they great as desktop PC replacements, but they can also be used in a variety of projects that sit outside the realm of normal use. Of course, pricing is also why these devices are flying off the shelves, and we've managed to find a pretty good deal on this GMKtec M3 Ultra, which is now seeing a steep $200 discount, thanks to a special coupon promotion from Amazon.
It's compact, has tons of power, and lots of ports
This mini PC is powered by an Intel Core i7 12700H processor that's paired with 32GB of DDR4 RAM and 1TB of SSD storage. The good news here is that there's also room to upgrade, with the device handling up to 64GB of RAM and 4TB of SSD storage. This is something you don't see with a lot of mini PCs, and it is something that can easily extend the life of the PC for years.
In addition to the above, the mini PC features Intel Iris XE graphics, along with plenty of connectivity. You get four USB-A ports, one USB-C, two HDMI, and a 3.5mm audio jack. There's also wireless connectivity with Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2. In total, you'll be able to connect three 4K monitors at one time, which should be plenty if you're looking to expand your screen real estate.
Again, this mini PC can be used as a desktop replacement, making it perfect for use in the home or office, or you can make it the heart of your home lab, or a makeshift NAS. Regardless of what you choose to use it for, the possibilities are endless for the most part, especially with this unit since it comes with so much power right out of the box. The $200 discount also helps too because it's not a bad price for all that you're getting.
