Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:

Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
The scourge of counterfeit hard drives is showing no signs of stopping. After reports of hard drives used for Chia cryptocurrency mining being sold as new came out, Seagate recently seized around 700 counterfeit hard drives in Malaysia. Counterfeiters are using intricate methods to pass off used desktop drives from Seagate, WD, and Toshiba as high-capacity surveillance drives. With fake drives permeating all sales channels, here's what you can do to protect yourself.
Avoid deals that are too good to be true
And always buy from trusted sites
The easiest thing you can do to avoid counterfeit drives is avoid listings that seem unusually enticing. If a 20TB Seagate IronWolf drive costs around $350 on Amazon, you can be sure that that $200 listing on a random marketplace is fishy. This is what was going on with the counterfeit drives seized in Malaysia. Sites like Lazada and Shopee were being used to sell used hard drives as new ones using cheap listings. It might be best to stick to authorized sellers and reliable websites when buying all your hard drives. This might not be an airtight solution to a complicated problem, since even trusted partners have inadvertently sold counterfeit drives. The supply chain has been compromised, but you can at least minimize the chances of being scammed by buying only from trusted sellers instead of relatively unknown platforms.
Inspect the packaging
Look for the original sticker and production date
Let's say you've bought a new (supposedly) hard drive from Amazon or other trusted retailers. You should still inspect it for signs of counterfeiting. It might be a basic check, but you might be "lucky" and find that your drive packaging has the original manufacturer sticker missing, or the serial number fails the verification check on the manufacturer's website. The other thing you can do is check the manufacturing date on the box. If it's over 6 months older than when you bought it, chances are that it's a counterfeit drive. Genuine new hard drives usually make it into consumers' hands a few months after production. If the one you bought has a pretty old manufacturing date, there might be some tampering going on.
Compare S.M.A.R.T. and FARM logs
Not a fool-proof method anymore
While consumers used to rely on a drive's S.M.A.R.T. data to check parameters like power-on hours, counterfeiters have long been able to manipulate that data. Seagate's proprietary FARM logs, which you can access using SeaTools, can be compared to the S.M.A.R.T. logs to check if a drive is counterfeit. If there's a significant discrepancy between the two, you can be sure the drive is fake. While this method works only for Seagate drives, there's a far worse limitation. Counterfeiters can now tamper with the FARM logs, too, making the entire exercise mostly pointless. It might have become harder to spot a counterfeit drive, but as a consumer, you need to do what you can. Seagate and other manufacturers are working on providing consumers with more tools to identify fake drives, but until then, caution is your best ally.
Confirm drive capacity with ValiDrive
Many counterfeits are falsely sold as having larger capacities
Inadvertently buying a drive that's been used for thousands of hours isn't the only thing you need to be wary of. Counterfeiters also routinely pass off smaller drives as having a much higher capacity. The drives report the advertised capacity in tools like CrystalDiskInfo since the scammers can easily fake the firmware. And copying a few GBs of data to the drive doesn't raise alarms, since you can see that data in File Explorer. What you can do instead is use ValiDrive to run a spot-check on the drive. The tool picks random sectors to write and read data, which can easily uncover a drive that has a far lower capacity than advertised. ValiDrive chooses sectors across the entire reported capacity of the drive, so it's almost guaranteed to uncover a 4TB drive posing as an 18TB one.

Counterfeit drives are getting harder to spot
It's unfortunate that buying a genuine hard drive has become an obstacle course. Counterfeiters have managed to replace drive labels, packaging, S.M.A.R.T data, and even proprietary logs. What you can still do to protect yourself is stick to trusted and authorized sellers, avoid listings that are unusually cheap, check the packaging for obvious signs of tampering, and inspect the drive's power-on parameters to spot a counterfeit drive.

f3write and f3read are tools that can fill your drive. I've found a few bad SD cards this way. It takes a while for a large drive, but I find it worthwhile.They're on Windows and Mac, and a Linux version has even more tools.

An actually good article from XDA here. I recommend never going for that awesome drive deal from Shady McShadyface. Or even from a seller that looks good. At the best, you're gonna get a high hour drive repackaged as new, at worst, you're gonna get a dead drive, or one with hacked SMART info that fails in a week. At this time, I recommend only ever buying drives directly from the manufacturer, or from established stores with good return policies. Even if you don, check the drive. Sometimes people buy a good drive and swap a dead one, then the returns department just restock it without testing. (Amazon is not trustworthy due to the above.)

As Veijo, said, “Real HDD are also made in China”.
Just be vigilant when purchasing a new drive.
Make sure who you use has a return policy, and check the reviews that they honor their policy.

I remembers, already in the '90's, a company in Taiwan was editing the firmware in older 120meg hd's into 1gig drives(average price for real 1gig drive was around $1200). Eventually the data was written over by the new data and programs would fail. This was a full size 5.25" unit weighing at least 5lbs. The name of "manufacturer" was Magtron.

This will probably continue to happen especially in the used market but remember to buy from marketplaces or sellers that offer a warranty or money back guarantee. To be honest I haven't been in the market for a massive hard drive I was a few years back purchased a new 12tb MDD HDD on ebay not sure if they are new players or just a smaller HDD manufacturer they sell Nas and enterprise drives for great cost and you can also buy used. I also got a 16tb Seagate IronWolf used for a great deal and it's still working to this day to be honest I have only ever had a few drives go bad as long as you don't shock them they live fairly long. Again the drives that failed where the WD Caviar Black 1tb varient I had 2 out of 4 go bad but again the others still work.

There are brands who just change smart and farm logs and sell a scrap drive as brand new drive.
