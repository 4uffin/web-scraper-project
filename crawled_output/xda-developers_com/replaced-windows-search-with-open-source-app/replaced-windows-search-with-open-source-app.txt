Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
If there are a million haters of Windows Search, you can be certain I’m one of them. And if somehow nobody else feels that way, I guess I’m on my own. It’s sluggish, cluttered, and wastes so much time that you’d rather look for things manually. On top of that, the search tools sometimes just stop showing results for no clear reason. I’ve been using a Mac for a long time, too, and even Finder combined with Spotlight Search feels better than Windows Search. I decided to do something about this. At first, I thought it was the Bing search results that made things worse, so I replaced it with Google. But that didn’t help. So, I’ve now replaced Windows Search altogether with an open-source app called DocFetcher, and I’ve noticed a serious jump in my productivity.
Setting up and using DocFetcher
It's fast and easy to use
DocFetcher is an open-source desktop search tool that works like Google for your local files. Instead of relying on Windows’ inconsistent indexing, it builds its own database from the folders you choose. Once indexed, it can surface results instantly, even from inside file contents. Unlike Windows Search, which tries to act as a launcher, settings finder, and Bing portal, DocFetcher focuses on one job and does it well. It works across Windows, Linux, and macOS. Since it is licensed under the Eclipse Public License, there is no adware, nagging, or hidden data collection. It supports all kinds of file formats, including but not limited to docx, xlsx, pptx, docm, xlsm, pptm, MP3 Metadata (mp3), FLAC Metadata (flac), JPEG Exif Metadata (jpg, jpeg), Microsoft Visio (vsd), and Scalable Vector Graphics (svg). Installing and setting up DocFetcher is simple. After downloading the app, you select the folders you want, such as work documents, research libraries, or your downloads folder, and create indexes for them. Indexing may take a few minutes initially, but once it’s done, searches that would have dragged on or failed in Windows feel instant. Updating the indexes later takes only seconds. The difference from Windows Search is clear. Where Windows often stalls, returns incomplete results, or fails to find files, DocFetcher consistently delivers accurate results. As mentioned above, it can even find specific text inside documents with ease, which makes it easy to find files even if you don't remember the file name.
DocFetcher beats Windows Search any day
Windows Search got nothing on DocFetcher
Windows Search has always tried to be a catch-all tool. It looks for apps, settings, documents, emails, and even web results. That broad approach means it rarely excels at the one thing most people actually need it for — finding files. Too often, it feels like the operating system is second-guessing you, surfacing web snippets or system settings before the actual file on your hard drive is accessed. I’ve noticed much better results after disabling web search in Windows Search. There’s no built-in option to do this in the settings, but it can be done with a bit of Registry tweaking. DocFetcher takes the opposite approach. It is narrow and precise, concerned only with documents, and it searches them thoroughly. Where Windows Search might miss text in a PDF or ignore content inside an archive, DocFetcher surfaces results from Office files, PDFs, text documents, source code, and even compressed formats such as .zip and .rar. Because you choose which folders are indexed, results stay relevant to your workflow rather than being cluttered with random system files. And since everything happens locally, there is no sense that your queries are being sent to Bing or anywhere else. The first thing I noticed after switching was speed, but the way it handles results was just as impressive. A built-in preview pane lets you see the text inside a document immediately, with your keywords highlighted. This saves you from opening multiple PDFs just to find the right one. Filtering by size, file type, or location makes it easy to zero in on what you need, which is especially useful when working with a large archive. DocFetcher also handles advanced use cases with ease. Old email archives in Outlook PST files can be indexed and searched. Developers can point it at a code repository and search across thousands of files instantly. Even compressed archives aren’t a barrier, since the program can look inside nested .zip and .rar files.

You don’t need Windows Search
Windows Search has only gotten worse over time, and I don’t expect it to improve. There are plenty of alternatives you can use to ditch it and get results faster. DocFetcher is a solid choice if you want an open-source option, but if you’re open to any tool, you might want to try Everything, which is a popular favorite. Another good pick is PowerToys Run, which brings Spotlight Search-like features to Windows. And if you’d still rather stick with Windows Search, there are ways to make it a lot better and more effective.

Everything can search file contents. Here's a tip:On the search bar, type the word "content" then your search string, like this:content:"strings to search"
(be sure to use quotes, and no space after the column!)Another more precise example:content:"keyword" ext:docx folder:"C:\Work" will only search for the keyword inside .docx files in the Work folder, skipping all other files.

Useful. Maybe it's because this is the first time I've tried to use Everything to query content, but I asked it to search for a surname, went downstairs, made a coffee, came back up, drank the coffee, and it was is still "querying".

I've been using the app "Everything" and sometimes Launchy to get around Windows Search. Everything in particular has been handy for my huge, shared Google Drive for work. Should I try DocFetcher instead?

Everything cannot search the file content. It only searches for the filenames. While, Docfetcher can do search on the file content as well.

Since many of the comments mention Everything, I too use Everything (for Windows, not available on Linux to my knowledge). It is a great program that I use regularly when using Windows. I will practice with the for searching within files for strings as mentioned by XDA_Replier. I just installed DocFetcher on my Linux machine, and had it index the local docs folder as well as one of the docs folders I have on pCloud. It took a while, but was a few minutes, actually very quick, indexing over 60,000 files, going back to 2013 (and probably older). I searched for a couple of relatively obscure people and places and the hits were listed "in the blink of an eye". Impressive performance! I will have to tinker with the program to filter for a more focused subset of the files indexed. One thing that eludes me is figuring out what is the cost for the pro version? The free versions performance is impressive. If I like the program, the cost information would be of interest because I do like to support the programs that I use. A bit later. I installed it on my Windows machine and indexed a lot of non-doc files, and it took a long time, I think close to two hours. But still impressive.
