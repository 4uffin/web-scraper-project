Depending on where you live, power outages can be a serious problem. However, I think we can all agree that when it happens, it's not a pleasant experience. They happen at the worst times, and there's always the possibility that some of your gear can get damaged. Of course, there's no way to know when you're going to have issues with power, which is why having some protection is the best way to go.
Sure, surge protectors are good, and most of us have them already, but an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) is an even better option, providing power when you need it most. While there are different options, we think this one from APC is going to be a good one to go with. Not only will it provide power for your most important electronics, but it's also not going to hurt your wallet.
It's time to protect your gear

The APC BE600M1 is rated for 600VA/330W and features seven AC outlets and one USB port. Five of the outlets will deliver power in the event of an outage, while also protecting against surges. The remaining two outlets will protect against surges, but will not have any additional properties. Now, it's hard to say just how long this backup will work after you lose power, since it depends on the devices you have plugged in, but this particular backup should be able to handle laptops, PCs, and accessories. But at max load, which is 330W, you can get around 3 minutes of usage from this backup. And at 100W, you can expect to get around 23 minutes out of it.
If you're curious, you can always check out the power calculator on the APC website to see just how long this power will last. The good thing is that this should allow most to safely shut down their devices in order prevent damage. And if you're not even around, the APC battery can shut down your Windows or Mac computers automatically.
This is one of those tools that many often skip because power interruptions don't always happen. However, it only takes one incident to cause a huge headache or potentially damage your gear. So if you've been looking for a good reason, we think now's the perfect time to pick one up while it's one sale for $69.
