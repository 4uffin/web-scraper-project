Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Tired of paying for cloud storage every month, I decided to host my own instance of Nextcloud on my home network. I replaced OneDrive and Google Drive with what’s essentially a free platform that allows me to store all my files. Nextcloud is an alternative to cloud storage for those who either don’t want to pay to store their files in the cloud or are concerned about privacy. Whenever you upload something to the cloud, it’s sent to remote servers, which always involves some amount of risk. With Nextcloud and other such self-hosted instances, all your data stays completely on-device, which is a safer option if you work with sensitive information and files. The upsides may tempt you to make the switch right away. That’s exactly what I did, too, after my colleagues at XDA raved about Nextcloud. However, there are some points you should know beforehand so that you’re not surprised after moving all your data out of cloud storage. When I look back, I wish I had known these facts before setting up my first instance of Nextcloud, so I could have optimized it for a more polished experience. If you’re a beginner and planning to migrate your life to Nextcloud, here are some key factors to keep in mind.
Picking the right hardware is important
Go beyond the minimum requirements
Technically, Nextcloud isn't the most demanding self-hosted service out there. It can run on modest or even underpowered hardware, which is why I first set it up on an old laptop that I had lying around. It only had a dual-core Intel CPU from a decade ago and 4GB of RAM, which I thought would be sufficient. While it seemed usable for the first few days, the performance consistently worsened over time. Lots of lag when navigating through the interface, slow uploads and downloads, and using collaborative features for documents was a nightmare. Owing to this, it's best to pick hardware that's decently capable, even if the minimum requirements are low. A quad-core CPU and 8GB of RAM are the sweet spot, in my experience. Additionally, avoid SD cards if you're deploying Nextcloud on a Raspberry Pi, since they can slow down the performance. Opt for an SSD instead.
Backups are non-negotiable
You can lose your data in a matter of seconds
Let me admit — I've never taken backups seriously, irrespective of whether I'm working with local files or those stored in the cloud. However, when you're hosting your own storage solution, you simply cannot ignore backups because you never know what's going to go wrong and when. Even a simple configuration file can lead to data loss, so it's best to stay prepared. For starters, back up components such as the Nextcloud data directory, configuration files, and database. You can also use tools like rsync for regular backups. Set your desired frequency, and your data will be automatically backed up to an external drive or even the cloud. It's also advisable to test your backups regularly to make sure they're working.
Security is of prime importance
Don’t expose your files
While self-hosting gives you complete control over your privacy, you have to tackle security completely by yourself, which means you have to be extremely careful about your data not getting exposed on the internet. So, a simple password or a poorly configured server can lead to catastrophic damage. Use a trusted SSL certificate to enable HTTPS on your instance. Then, configure a firewall to only allow the necessary ports on your network. Set up two-factor authentication for all accounts to prevent unauthorized access and keep all the important components up to date. This includes Nextcloud itself, your OS, and dependencies.
Apps can slow down your server
Choose wisely
Apart from the privacy and cost advantage, Nextcloud is the primary choice for many users when switching to a locally-hosted solution, thanks to support for several useful apps. The ecosystem is excellent, allowing you to host your own calendar, recipe book, video conferencing tools, and even a full-blown Office that can compete against Google's Workspace suite. While these apps certainly add to the functionality and even increase your productivity, some of them can end up consuming significant resources. You don't want that if you're already running Nextcloud on an underpowered machine. So, it's advisable to start by installing one app at a time and testing the impact on performance. If you don't see a considerable difference, you can try installing other apps as well.
Configuring your network can be tricky
It’s harder than it sounds
The biggest drawback of self-hosted services is that, by default, they can only be accessed on your local network. I mean, that's the whole point of hosting something on a local network, but it's limiting for those switching from cloud services. That said, you can make your Nextcloud instance accessible over the internet when you're away from home. It just involves quite a bit of extra effort. Initially, I faced issues with DNS and port forwarding. Then, I found it challenging to set up a reverse proxy like Nginx for tighter security. It's advisable to carry out some research in this area to determine all the required security protocols to keep your data safe. Do not compromise on this aspect, as it can lead to your data being accessible to anyone on the internet.
Don’t jump the gun
Knowing what to expect before signing up for something can always save you time and effort in the long run. Simply switching to Nextcloud because of its advantages over traditional cloud storage without learning about the challenges isn’t advisable — regardless of whether you’re a newbie or a veteran tech nerd. If you ever face hiccups, the official documentation and Nextcloud’s community forums are the best ways to find solutions to your problems. There’s a good chance someone else has already faced the issue you’re experiencing and has received a fix for it. Checking your logs and browsing forum pages for similar questions can go a long way in fixing issues.

I have Nextcloud running in my local kubernetes. I didnt Expose the service to Internet at all. I just VPN to my network over wireguard. Safe and not complicated. All you need is just a router that support it.

I'm a complete newbie to self hosting. I've just gotten a Synology DS223 NAS and trying to understand how to get it up and running. Nextcloud is on my todo list. However, my ignorance is blinding. I'd appreciate it if someone could point me to a "dummies" guide to get started. I've read several XDA articles but don't think I'm getting the whole of it. Sorry if this post is inappropriate. Thanks for any help. Michael

Docker would be the easiest to deploy if you are familiar with using docker.You need to have a webserver setup like Apache, MySQL, and php.While I have next cloud, and I already had web services running, I manually downloaded and installed. I rarely use it tbh, but I'm also using a hosted server vs home NAS.If it's just backing up, I personally use Syncthing.

If you are already running a Synology NAS, there is probably little point in installing Nextcloud as Synology's DSM already provides you with excellent file storage capabilities.
