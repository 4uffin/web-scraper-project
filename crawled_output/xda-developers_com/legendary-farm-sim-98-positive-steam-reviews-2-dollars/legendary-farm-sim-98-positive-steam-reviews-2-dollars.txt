If you haven't given Slime Rancher a try yet, you really owe it to yourself to give it a go. I'm not a huge farming games fan, and even I found the game really delightful to play. It's just something about how it presents itself that scratches an itch that no other game has managed before. The good news is that you now have no excuse not to play Slime Rancher. And yes, that is good news. The game is currently 90% off at the low, low price of $2, so do yourself a favor and throw a few bucks over for this amazing game.
Slime Rancher is just $2 on Steam for a limited time
It's a good day to be a Slime Rancher fan. The sequel, Slime Rancher 2, has just broken free of its early access phase with a shiny 1.0 release version. To celebrate, the developers have applied a 35% discount for the game, which is very nice of them. However, the celebrations don't stop there. It turns out that the devs also went back to the original Slime Rancher game and gave it a whopping 90% discount, knocking the price all the way down to $2. The last time we saw it go that low was during the Autumn Sale in 2024, so it is unlikely to get that cheap again for a while. Just be sure to grab it before September 29th when it'll return to full price. Here's how the devs describe the game:
Slime Rancher is a charming, first-person, sandbox experience. Play as Beatrix LeBeau: a plucky, young rancher who sets out for a life a thousand light years away from Earth on the ‘Far, Far Range.’
Each day will present new challenges and risky opportunities as you attempt to amass a great fortune in the business of slime ranching. Collect colorful slimes, grow crops, harvest resources, and explore the untamed wilds through the mastery of your all-purpose vacpack.
Despite being released back in 2017, the game still holds up to this day. It has 97% positive recent reviews and 98% lifetime ones, so people still love it (including me). Plus, if you really love Slime Rancher, you have a whole new sequel to play that has just been fully released. Sounds like a good time to me.
