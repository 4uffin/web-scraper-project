3 things I never got as a Windows fanboy that Linux users have had for years
By
Simon Batt
Published Sep 5, 2025
Simon is a Computer Science BSc graduate who has been writing about technology since 2014, and using Windows machines since 3.1. After working for an indie game studio and acting as the family's go-to technician for all computer issues, he found his passion for writing and decided to use his skill set to write about all things tech.
Since beginning his writing career, he has written for many different publications such as WorldStart, Listverse, and MakeTechEasier. However, after finding his home at MakeUseOf in February 2019, he has been working with it and its sister website, XDA, to bring the latest and greatest in Windows, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity topics.

Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like Iâ€™m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
For the past few months, I've been using Linux seriously for the first time in my life. My only other foray was a decade ago, when I tried Ubuntu for about two days and then decided to go back. Now,
I've actually forgotten that I even have Windows installed on my dual boot, as I've fallen in love with Fedora KDE.
Some features really surprise me about Linux. And when I try to discuss them with my friends and coworkers who have used Linux distros for decades longer than I have, they laugh and tell me that Linux has always had those features. I imagine it's like listening to someone who's shocked that Windows comes with, well, windows. So, here are some things that I never got during my years as a Windows fanboy, which I now appreciate having with my Linux distro, which is also old hat for Linux vets.
3
Demos of operating systems
Microsoft isn't a fan of free samples
This feature is the one that inspired me to write this article in the first place. Our resident Linux enthusiast and 3D Benchy wrangler, Jeff Butts, DMed me about my article when I
tried out Linux Mint as a Windows fanboy. It was my gateway into Linux, and while I'd eventually migrate to Fedora KDE, Linux Mint taught me that these distros aren't as complicated or intimidating as they may initially seem.
Jeff had a laugh about my shock that Linux distros had demos. "Theyâ€™ve been around in Linux for a while," he told me. However, it was surprising to me because the concept of trying out an operating system was foreign. Windows is pretty sparse with its "demos;" the only one I can really think of is the 10-day grace period after you upgrade from Windows 10 to 11 that lets you revert to how things were. After your 10 days are up, that's it; it's Windows 11 time, baby. Linux does things a lot differently. Not sure if you'll gel with a distro? Copy it to a USB stick and boot from it. Your PC will load a "demo version" of the distro for you to explore. Yes, it'll be slow due to the USB data transfer rates, and you can't save stuff on it, but it's more than enough to give you a taster of how the distro works. Don't like it? Turn off your PC and scrub the USB. Take a liking to it? Access the installation tool in the demo version and get it onto your system. Easy as that.
2
Officially supported desktop environments
A fresh lick of paint with none of the hassle
I also really adore Linux's desktop environments. If you're not sure what they are, they're entire suites that change how your desktop looks and feels. You can install a few and cycle through them on your login screen, which is great if you just want to test them out or you want to use specific environments for specific tasks. I also want to mention that when I say "desktop environments," I don't mean something like Windows' themes, which change the color of your system menus, and that's about it. We're talking about picking between two environments that look entirely different from one another, to the point where it's easy to believe they're actually different distros. Desktop environments are really powerful, and while you can crowbar apps into Windows to give your OS a makeover, it's so nice to have them officially supported and embraced by the Linux community.
1
An automatic backup of previous versions after each system update
An easy way to return if things go wrong
Now, I'll admit that I'm not sure if every Linux distro does this, but I do know that Fedora definitely does, and it's honestly such a nice feature. When you update Fedora, your system won't erase the kernel you're upgrading from. Instead, the system will hold onto it for another two more updates before erasing it. You can see your past versions of Fedora pop up in the GRUB boot system every time you turn on your PC, and booting into them is as simple as scrolling down and selecting them. The idea is that, if an update breaks something, you can always boot into a previous kernel where everything worked fine. It's leaps and bounds ahead of Microsoft's solution for a dud Windows update, which is to get people to uninstall the update manually. Having the option to revert back to an older kernel is such a nice failsafe to have on hand in case an update borks something up.
I've missed out on so many years of freedom and convenience
While it's disappointing that I've missed out on these excellent features for so long, I take solace in the fact that, at the very least, I eventually discovered them. There is an alternate timeline where I remain a Windows fanboy for life, and I never experience the joy of installing a new desktop environment and booting into what looks and feels like a brand-new operating system, and I'm just glad I'm not in that one. Now, if you'll excuse me, I want to demo some distros.

While not official, you can easily install a bootable version of windows onto a USB stick using Rufus and demo it for a while. And Windows creates restore points when you update so you can easily restore to a previous state. Neither of these are terribly new things you can do with Windows.

Windows restore points haven't been on by default on my last few installs. I had to force them to turn on, and also force on volume shadow copies.

Windows To-Go is official, though. You could make a bootable USB without rufus and try windows right from the environment, itself.

Another absolutely GREAT feature of linux is their update procedure. In windows only the kernel is updated. But linux updates EVERYTHING that was installed from the repository in addition to the kernel! In other words if you have firefox and say, Libre installed THEY get updated as well. AND in fact IF you install chrome (which is NOT in most repositories) IT gets an update whenever they become available as well. Finally YOU get to control all updates (as to who, when). For example I always install kernel updates separately thus I hold those back if other updates are also integrated into a normally, single update.

Devil's advocate position: In all fairness to Microsoft, only the last five years, roughly, have been so remarkably transformational for both Windows and Linux distros. Linux distros have on the whole become dramatically more user-friendly while Windows has become exponentially more intrusive and fraught with privacy, security, and commercialization concerns. The amount of very high quality software available to Linux, for gaming in particular, has exploded. Containerized applications, especially because of FlatPaks, AppImages, and Distrobox, have finally made access to software packages less of a maze. And people interacting with their kids' Chromebooks has opened a lot of people's eyes to the incredible simplicity, reliability, stability, and security of an immutable OS with atomic updates, which is increasingly becoming a trend, if not mantra, in Linux distro development.

After 19 years windoze free. My favorite event was replacing a friend's router, connected the printer to the router. In windows changed IP address for printer. Nope. Spent 45 minutes with the printer setup command.. After success. I turned to my Mint 8, (yes this happened years ago). Clicked on add printer. Mint asked this printer? Yes. I need to download additional software. OK. Do a test print? Within 2 minutes after tapping add printer I was printing and scanning docs.

Also stuff like using you phone as a hot spot is so much easier. Its just a single click and it will turn my phones Bluetooth hotspot on and then connect to it. You can also play your phones audio on that device. Really nice when you get a call and don't have to take your headphones off or anything

Windows doesn't really do the whole demo thing becsuse they don't need to becsuse of being a ubiquitous experience and not this potentially wildly different experience distro to distro. Linux also has supporterd desktop environments because they officially need to embrace them.By the by there are more than 2. You have KDE Plasma, gnome, once,xqt, lxde, cinnamon, mate, pantheon, and budgie.That said again this is partially why Linux requires demos. Windows outside of 8 has largely been the same overall UI/UX with some tweaks since Windows 95 and XP so it just yeah. Also different linux distros come with different defaults and stuff that can massively differentiate them. Like PopOS from system76 heavily relies on a flatpak app thing vs traditional install apps found in say Ubuntu or the like Also as I was trying to say if Linux didn't officially support desktop environments
as no one other than people doing server based work would bother using it for anything otherwise since it'd just be terminal/command line based at that point and no one would bother with that.And addressing the third thing you csn do settings > Windows update > update history find the problem update in the list and uninstall it.If the update is not allowing you to boot 8lin properly force your computer to shut down and restart 3 times in decent succession from the manufacturers logo (,before the windows loading screen completes) qnd get yourself into the windows recovery environment and the go to troubleshoot > advanced options > uninstall updates .

I've been using Linux for years, and before that it was MacOS. Never seen the attraction in Windows: it just looks naff to me.

Win 2000 was the last version I ran. Tried booting it one day and got OS not found. My drive had 4 partitions, boot, OS, Data, temp. With no worries about loosing documents, I installed Linux on the OS partition.

Linux isn't as scary as people think. If others would describe you as "good with computers" then it won't be an issue for you to figure out. Omarchy takes less than 5 minutes to install and has great manuals and support, give it a try!

Yeah, the problem is that most of us share workplaces and/or households with people who would not fit that description. Linux feels now where EV's were a decade ago: good for something like 90% of the needs of 90% of the people, but only good for 100% of the needs of 10% of the people (and for 10% of the needs of the remaining 10%). While almost certainly better for everyone in a long view, there were still too many deal breakers even as walls were coming down and more people decided to make change a part of future plans. Microsoft has made their bed, and Linux is better for more people than ever, but it's also just not going to win until whole small companies can truly walk away from Microsoft and anything that needs Windows to run and be done with them, and actually save time, money, and security concerns in the process. When it becomes cheaper, including worked hours, to switch instead of upgrade, THEN Linux will take off.

I was using Ubuntu for a long time and I can tell you kernels where kept for a long time, I had to manually clean up old kernel versions(keeping the last 2-3 versions) even back in 2010..(demo versions of Linux are way older than that..

For those of us who remember the Pre-Windows years were DOS was the main access point, Linux command line clearly wins.
The beauty of Linux is that my old hardware still works.

I switched to Linux Mint when Microsoft stopped supporting Windows 7.
I never dual booted with Windows, it was a straight dive in.
These days, i have Linux Mint, Manjaro and Ubuntu Studio on my hard drives.
I am tying this while on Manjaro

1st & Last options are just as easily accessible as in Windows as in Linux. Have dabbled in Linux but refrained from converting full time as not hard core computer user even though I am on computer most of the day.... Desktop environment can also be had in windows too just the same way it's there on Linux. Both OS systems are pretty interchangeable these days..

I have left windows behind and switched to Linux about a year ago. Dabbled with Linux in dual boot setups for years but finally just dumped windows all together.
Yes Linux has problems, but so does windows. For me, the problems with Linux are not as bad as my problems with windows. MS is getting very shady in terms of privacy and forced AI and data mining. Linux feels like my windows systems many years ago felt, like they were mine and under my control. Windows is always doing shady stuff in the background to use your data to get richer and dictate to its users what they should like. Linux doesn't make me wonder to who and where my data is going which is a main advantage.

You like what you like.
EVERY OS has it's failings, EVERY OS.
Many ofbthe things Linux and Mac fanboys hate about Windoes or claim it "doesn't have/ do" is just fanboy BS, and vice versa.
So just use what makes you most productive and STFU.
I'm a musician, amd have used all 3 OSs, Linux is a VERY distant 3rd (if Android and iOS kÃ·p pushing, Linux will probably be 5th).
If you wanna code Linux wins.
If you want an overpriced proprietary OS on overpriced proprietary hardware that is stable but too beloved by snobs to ever see mass adoption Mac wins.
Windows has all the software, you CAN build a stable machine (YES YOU CAN) and every piece of recording studio hardware made just works.
Mac can't say that, Linux can't say that.
But they do (as I stated) have their uses.Until Linux can compete on the aoftware and hardware (which they have promised for decades but NEVER come close to delivering) it will never be a daily OS for most people. Who want to do more than code, surf the web, and read email, will fimd Linux infuriating.So grow up amd stop the Fanboy BS.

Sorry dude, but take a look in the mirror... You've become the fanboy.Saying "Linux NEVER came close on the software and hardware" just shows your fanboy ignorance. Hardware hasn't been an issue in over 5 years. Software is hardly an issue in the past 2 years, mainly thanks to the advances in gaming brought by steam. So, yeah, get your head out of the sand.

TechnoJohn chose tontell me I'm wrong about hardware issues (I'm not, not as far as music peripirals go for certain. Not ome of the periphirals I run has a properly configured driver in Linux, and limited functionality is NOT functional). Why he chose to prohibit comments is telling as to his lack of genuine knowledge on the topic.
Linux is also still behind on software too bub!
The Induatry standard DAW, NOT on Linux.
The nextb3 leading DAWs - 1 is on Linux - ONE.
The rest of the top 10 DAWs - 1 -ONE more.
That is behind.I'm no fanboy.
I'm a pragmatist.
And, pragmatically speaking, Linux is NOT the answer for musicians, no matter how much you want to argue that it is.

A lot of software does work on Linux now, and my household is having trouble finding something we cannot do on Linux lately. What makes you think it has no software now? There's a variety of choices for most tasks you would want to do.

Why is XDA suddenly promoting Linux so much? I agree Windows 11 is terrible, and I'm also switching to Linux on my gaming laptop. But is the sentiment so widespread now, or is some company paying for this campaign?

What company would pay for it?
Linux is on the ascent because it's a much more flexible and powerful system if you take the time to figure out how to apply it.

There is simply a lot of interest in Linux precisely because Windows is bad.I switched to nobara and I haven't looked back.

Yes, of course.
The Linux Corporationâ„¢ has paid for this story.
How clever of you to have sorted that out.

Probably because Windows is dropping support for version 10.

Yes, the sentiment is widespread now. Mainly thanks to two things: 1- Microsoft pulling the switch on consumers and admins with "Windows 10 is the last OS ever!" And then "oh wait, nope, 11! Oh and throw out all that hardware that works fine! You're welcome!"2- SteamOS with Proton. Gamers have been the hold out until now. Well, they are ready to switch and Proton works great.These things have been building more slowly than some Linux fans thought they would. But Microsoft just kept doing dumb stuff to encourage the slow build. So you're witnessing the beginning of the shift, it's just been in slow motion.
