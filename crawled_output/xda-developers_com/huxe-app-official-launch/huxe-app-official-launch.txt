Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like Iâ€™m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
While many are familiar with Google's AI-powered research assistant, NotebookLM, thanks to its viral features like Audio Overviews and Mind Maps, not many know about the people who made the tool possible. If you fall into that group, let me give you a quick rundown. NotebookLM was launched as an experimental Google Labs project under the code name "Project Tailwind" in 2023, and the team behind it included Raiza Martin as the product lead, Jason Spielman as the design lead, and Stephen Hughes as a software engineer. Despite the viral success of the tool, the three ended up leaving Google in December 2024 to launch their own startup, Huxe. The reason I brought all this up is because the startup just dropped its very first product, and one thing's for certain: the minds behind NotebookLM just launched their first tool since leaving Google, and it already feels like a hit.
Huxe is now available to download on the App Store and Play Store, and itâ€™s completely free
Today, the team behind NotebookLM launched their first product, which carries the same name as their startup: Huxe. Huxe is an AI-powered personalized audio service built on the same core idea as NotebookLM. Itâ€™s designed to help users cut down the amount of time they spend scrolling on a screen, and it aims to achieve that by creating an AI thatâ€™s made just for you. And the way Huxe is doing that is through the incredible (and unique) features it offers. The flagship feature of Huxe is Daily Briefings, which, similar to NotebookLM's iconic Audio Overviews, creates a real-time podcast tailored to your schedule, inbox, and interests. Huxe connects and securely accesses your calendar and email, and then uses them to create a personalized audio briefing. Itâ€™s designed to replace the time you spend in the morning scrolling through overnight emails, half-read newsletters, and your upcoming calendar events. Instead, you get a quick five-minute rundown that tells you exactly what matters that day. When you first download Huxe and create an account, you'll be asked to select a couple of your interests. Huxe then uses those preferences to personalize your Daily Briefings even further by including relevant news, updates, and insights tied to the topics you care about most.

Huxe also has a feature called DeepCast, which, in my opinion, is a smarter on-demand version of NotebookLM's Audio Overviews. The feature lets you create a personalized, interactive podcast-style discussion on any topic of your choice. All you need to do is tell Huxe what you'd like to hear about, and you'll have a comprehensive podcast within seconds. The tool researches multiple sources, synthesizes information, and then generates a podcast that aligns with your knowledge level. But the AI doesnâ€™t stop at Daily Briefings and on-demand podcasts. It actively learns from your habits and preferences, curating fresh, personalized content while you go about your day. The tool even works while you sleep, meaning youâ€™ll wake up to fresh updates, insights, and recommendations waiting for you each morning. Now, this isn't the first time people are hearing about the tool â€”Huxe has been in early access since June 5th, 2025. I even went hands-on with the tool and talked about my experience not too long ago. For a few weeks, the app ran on an invite-code basis, with the team sharing codes via Discord and their social media channels. Since I first tried the tool out, itâ€™s become one of my favorite AI tools, and Iâ€™m beyond thrilled more people will finally get the chance to experience it for themselves without waiting on an invite code. Huxe is now available on the App Store and Google Play Store, and is completely free to download.

I tried it and so far don't see the use case for me, especially since I'm not the user of one email and calendar which the app only allow. Also in terms of T&C there is great potential for potential problems in terms of data protection etc.. However, I agree, the app might have the potential as shown in the article.

I disagree. It's uninspiring.

Installed it. Glitchy. S25 Ultra. Has promised but access to mail and calendar when we hardly know each other is too forward for my tastes. Uninstalled.

I uninstalled it after two minutes. UI was too janky on my SD Elite phone ðŸ™„. Looks like it needs a few more months in the oven.

Requires too much data and doesnâ€™t seem to prioritize keeping it private.

Wrote an entire article about it, but didn't bother to include links to the app.

Huxe's ability to pull data from email and calendar doesn't seem right to me since those 2 sources sometimes contains private materials such as banking data and default password or reset links from various sources.How do we know that Huxe AI won't misuse those things ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

I think they are are a solid team and hope to see more from them. What they did with Notebook LM was incredible and I use it constantly. I was invited to try Huxe and Iâ€™m just not the target audience. For me, I feel uncomfortable letting AI just have access to my calendar and email. My first usage was something personal was broadcast across my phone speakers. Notebook LM is push whereas this is pull. Iâ€™ll stick with the push model for now: prompts I type and materials I choose to push. Iâ€™d love to see what this team could come up with on a push model instead.
