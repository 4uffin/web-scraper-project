Are you looking for a new RPG to pour a ton of time into? If so, then do I have the games for you. Back in 2019, Square Enix shook up the JRPG scene with Octopath Traveller, a game that combines 2D sprites with 3D worlds. It did so well that Square Enix would go on to make Octopath Traveler 2, which kept the unique art style. If you've had your eyes on both of these games for a while now, they're both currently at the cheapest price they've ever been on Steam. In fact, with both of them undergoing a 60% discount, you can buy both titles for under the price of one, which is a great deal for RPG fans.
Octopath Traveller 1 and 2 are 60% off on Steam for a limited time
If this is the first time you've heard of the Octopath Traveler series, it combines retro 2D graphics alongside modern-day effects and shaders to create a really unique-looking game. It gets its strange name because you're not experiencing just one story; in fact, you play through eight different ones, each one hailing from a different area and with different backstories. Here's how Square Enix describes Octopath Traveler 2:
The story takes place in Solistia, a land comprising an eastern and western continent divided by the sea.
It is a bustling era, wherein large vessels navigate busy sea routes and the power of steam gives birth to new technologies.
Some people thrill to glamorous stars of the stage and industry, while others are brought to tears by war, plague, and poverty.
In this faraway realm, eight travelers hailing from different regions venture forth for their own reasons. Step into their shoes and explore the land as you see fit, using their unique talents to aid you along your journey.
Embark on an adventure all your own.
They've both been well-received by the Steam community, albeit one is more loved than the other. At the time of writing, Octopath Traveler 1 has 86% positive reviews, and Octopath Traveler 2 has 94%, so if you end up enjoying the first one, rest assured that you'll have an even better sequel to look forward to. Both titles are 60% off right now, but don't delay; you have until September 29th before this deal goes away.
