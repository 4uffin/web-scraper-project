Give me a lighthearted recap
The Nintendo Switch 2 has been getting a lot of classic games added to the Switch Online classic console sections. The most recent addition was Forsaken 64, a sci-fi shooter that was brought to the Nintendo 64 mature games sections of Switch Online. As of now, there are only four games accessible within the library of titles on the app, with more possibly coming in the future. But with so many mature Nintendo 64 games that were released back in the day, there's no shortage of great games that could be added to Switch Online to build up its selection of classics. Some of the mature games that were for the N64 have not had a chance to be re-released on modern day platforms. A lot of this was due to licensing deals running out, as well as diminishing interest in titles over the decades. But with Switch Online providing an outlet for classics like Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, Shadow Man, and Perfect Dark to be reintroduced to new players, there are many options of games that could also be added to the service. The mature section of the Nintendo 64 classics can be a truly special part of Switch Online for those who grew up owning the console and playing the ensemble of titles that were around. Here are some mature N64 games that should come to the Switch Online Nintendo 64 classics mature app next.
Turok: Rage Wars
The game left behind
Currently, there are two Turok games on the mature section of Switch Online: Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Turok 2: Seeds of Evil. And while it seems obvious that the third game in the series, Turok: Shadow of Oblivion, should also be added to the service, there's one game in the series that definitely needs to be. Unlike all three other Turok games, Turok: Rage Wars has never been re-released or remastered in any capacity. All three numbered games in the series have since been remastered by companies like Nightdive Studios, which combined their PC and N64 console versions together for a remastered release. But this interim Turok game was left out of the mix, which development shifting over to remaster Turok 3 instead. With Switch Online actively adding more mature games from the N64 library, this would be a perfect time to reintroduce players to this forgotten entry in the series. The game was originally released in 1999 after Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, and uses the same engine for its gameplay. Turok: Rage Wars had a stronger focus on multiplayer than its predecessors, despite having single-player content that was an offshoot of the multiplayer modes. Up to four players, with or without bots, can battle in deathmatch and objective modes, using weapons from throughout the series up to that point. Multiple playable characters could be unlocked by finishing single-player trials, which can be taken into multiplayer afterward.

Seeing the entire series from the Nintendo 64 era in one spot would be a great thing for Turok fans. And with two entries in the Turok series already on it, there's nothing stopping Nintendo from having the whole saga for Switch owners to play through. Too bad there couldn't be true online play for the multiplayer of it outside the Switch Online connection.

Conker's Bad Fur Day
That Rare attitude we love
Source: Rare
When it comes to edgy and mature games, Rare was one of the undisputed kings of it on the Nintendo 64. The company had a great reputation with players for their releases of Diddy Kong Racing, Donkey Kong 64, and Jet Force Gemini. But the developers went full throttle with their creative prowess with the release of Conker's Bad Fur Day in 2001. To many people, Conker's Bad Fur Day is one of the best 3D platformers on the console because of its crude humor and willingness to go far over the line on a Nintendo console. Although some have argued that its gameplay was no different or more special than some of the other beloved N64 platformers, it remains a highlight for people who grew up playing Nintendo 64 games. While Jet Force Gemini is already part of the main N64 Classics section for Switch Online, none of the other beloved Rare titles from that era have made it onto the service. With some aspects of their licensing making things complicated, it would still be a great thing to see Conker's Bad Fur Day on the service. The game has plenty of memorable moments that, despite how crude and boundary-breaking it was, showcased some of the best creativity from Rare games. To this day, players still remember the musical number during the encounter Conker has with the Great Mighty Poo.
Source: Rare
It was arguably THE mature game to own for the Nintendo 64 in the early 2000s, despite other mature action games pushing the limit on what was tolerable on the console. Rare's approach to jokes and cultural references made this title stand out in ways that few other N64 games were able to achieve. Whether Nintendo is willing to bring it to the Switch Online mature section is anyone's guess, but it would definitely bring a lot of attention to the service from everyone.

War Gods
A rip-off we remember
Source: Midway Games
Fighting games didn't have a strong presence on the Nintendo 64, but they were still around. The biggest fighting franchise to release on the console was the Mortal Kombat series, which had three games released for the N64. At the same time, Killer Instinct from Rare also made a big splash, which became a classic in its own right. But if you didn't play any of those games on the Nintendo 64, chances are you heard about another fighter that blatantly took its inspiration from the Mortal Kombat series: War Gods. Many of the games that end up being added to the Switch Online service are sometimes pretty obscure releases, which are heavily present on the NES and Super Nintendo sections of the service. War Gods is one of those games that is obscure enough for most people to not remember clearly, but was niche enough for fighting game fans to recall playing. Those who played it could instantly see the inspiration, and almost straight-up copying of design choices from Mortal Kombat. The reason why War Gods was so similar to the Mortal Kombat series was because Midway Games released both titles at the time. Many of the special moves and finishing moves were comparable to the Mortal Kombat games, which drew a lot of criticism from fans and critics during its initial release. The cast of characters was also not as interesting as Midway's other fighting game, which failed to catch fire with audiences back then.

While War Gods isn't the most beloved mature game in the N64 library, it's still an obscure and unique title that would make Switch 2 owners curious enough to play it. Games like Forsaken 64 have the same level of mystic to them when they were added to the service. Most people would want to have all the Mortal Kombat titles that were on the Nintendo 64 on the service as well, but it wouldn't hurt to see this niche fighting game show up too.

Resident Evil 2
An iconic horror release
Capcom and Nintendo had a legendary partnership throughout the 90s. Many classic and iconic Capcom titles were on Nintendo platforms, such as the Mega Man and Street Fighter series. But few of them would start elsewhere and come over to a Nintendo console like the N64, as was the case with Resident Evil 2 in 1999. The original game became a classic on the PlayStation, but also had a version that fans enjoyed on the Nintendo 64. The main differences between both versions of the game are the resolution of the graphics, but the majority of the gameplay is the same on both consoles. However, some extra features like alternate outfits, violence options, and a randomizer are exclusive to the Nintendo 64 version. Other things like bonus documents can also only be found in this version and not in the PlayStation version. Resident Evil 2 on the N64 is one of the few titles to have FMVs that play during the experience. It was hard for other games to do something similar because of the storage limit on cartridges for the console, but development of the game found ways to get everything onto the cartridge. At the same time, Resident Evil 2 also took advantage of the Expansion Pak for the N64, which smoothed out the animations and had an increased resolution for the graphics. It's one of the best horror games for the console, and a true classic for Capcom fans, regardless of where they played it. With how good Capcom and Nintendo's relationship has been with other game additions to Switch Online, something like this can definitely be possible in the near future.

Nightmare Creatures
Fighting off horrors of the night
Source: Activision
While Resident Evil may have been the biggest survival horror game released on the console, it wasn't the only one. Nightmare Creatures is a survival horror game that originally was released on the PlayStation, but was also ported over to the Nintendo 64 and Windows PC. The game has players fighting off monsters with magical spells and weapons, while maintaining their survival by getting into fights. While Resident Evil focused on mondern day zombies and biohazard monsters, Nightmare Creatures had a greater emphasis on gothic style horror, with more fantasy-focused items and settings. The plot of the game takes place in the 19th century, and follows two characters on a quest to stop a villain from achieving immortality. Unlike the PlayStation version, the game didn't have any FMVs in the Nintendo 64 version, which were replaced by text scrolls. This is something similar that was done for the release of Hexen: Beyond Heretic for the N64, which also removed its original FMVs during story sections to fit within the storage space on an N64 cartridge. Most critics praised the game back then for its creepy atmosphere and scary monster designs, which were just as scary as what was seen in Capcom's Resident Evil series.
Source: Activision
Nightmare Creatures is a pretty niche game that many people didn't get to experience, much like other mature horror-themed titles for the console, like Shadow Man, which is already in the mature section of the N64 classics for Switch Online. With only a handful of survival horror titles for the Nintendo 64, this would be a great addition to the service for those who never got to experience it. And it would be interesting to have it around if Capcom's Resdient Evil games also come to Switch Online, giving players a chance to compare and contrast both styles of horror.

More mature content for Switch owners
There are plenty of great mature games that the Nintendo 64 had within its library. And while most of them never achieved the classic status that other titles for the console have, they had unique experiences that pushed the boundaries of what could be done on the N64. The Nintendo 64 mature classics section is a great place for people to rediscover these games. If Nintendo plans on building up the Switch Online classics apps even further, then having more of the unique mature releases that were on the N64 would be a great place to focus on.
