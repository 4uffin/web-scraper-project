S11: Wi-Fi 6, 8,400mAh, up to 12GB/512GB; S11 Ultra: Wi-Fi 7, 11,600mAh, up to 16GB/1TB.
Galaxy S25 FE: 6.7in 120Hz FHD+ AMOLED, 50MP main, 3x optical tele, 4,900mAh, 8GB/256GB.
Well, it's that time of year when we get to admire all the nice hardware companies are showcasing as part of the IFA event. Fortunately, Samsung wasn't about to disappoint its fans, as it arrived at the event with two of its newest Galaxy devices in tow: the Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 series and the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE. As such, regardless of whether you're a fan of tablets, phones, or both, Samsung has something for you to check out.
Samsung shows off the Galaxy Tab S11 series and the Galaxy S25 FE
First, let's take a look at the tablets. Samsung has two to show off: The Galaxy Tab S11 and the S11 Ultra. There's a significant jump between the two, with the regular S11's screen spanning 11 inches and the S11 Ultra's reaching an impressive 14.6 inches. The Galaxy Tab S11 features Wi-Fi 6 compatibility, while the Ultra takes it a step further with Wi-Fi 7. While both models can be equipped with 12GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage, only the S11 Ultra offers a variant with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. The Ultra model also features a stunning 11,600 mAh battery, compared to the regular model's 8,400 mAh. Still, there are some similarities. They're both running Android 16.0 with One UI 8, and under the hood is a MediaTek Dimensity 9400+ processor, a 120 Hz, Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen, and an S-Pen ready for use. As such, regardless of which model you pick, you're going to get that same Samsung goodness. Now, let's take a peek at that Galaxy S25 FE. There's just the one model, with a 6.7-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X display that can output up to 120Hz. The Galaxy S25 FE comes with a comprehensive array of cameras, featuring a 12MP Ultra-Wide camera, a 50MP Wide camera, an 8MP Telephoto camera with 3x Optical Zoom and up to 30x Digital Zoom, and a 12MP Front camera to complete the package. You'll also get 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of internal storage, alongside a 4,900mAh battery that works with Wireless PowerShare. Samsung also details its new "Now" apps, which seem to make getting the information you want at a glance a lot faster:
Now Bar surfaces helpful information at just the right moment, right from the lock screen. It shows relevant updates, and can even be customized to display live notifications, music, modes, routines, and more. Now Brief provides personalized daily updates including traffic, reminders, calendar events, and fitness summaries.
So that's the lot. We'd love to get out hands on this new tech, and we hope they manage to match the hype.

A (diagonal) screen size measurement is a good start, but doesn't tell the whole story.
Full dimensions are better, along with pictures including a reference object.For larger tablets, a sheet of A4 paper would be good. For phones, A5 might be more appropriate.
