This top-rated keyboard has everything you need, with plenty of customization options, solid build quality, excellent feel when typing, and so much more. And while it's usually priced at $200, we're now seeing a steep discount from Amazon that knocks nearly 70% off for a very limited time, with the price plummeting down to just $64. This is the best price we've seen on this keyboard, so we suggest picking one up.
This is a no-brainer at this price

It's tough investing a ton of money in a new keyboard, but this HyperX model makes it easier thanks to the price, and what you're getting. You get a swappable top plate, badges, and rotary knobs, which means you can really get the look you want that fits your personality.
And of course, the swtiches are also swappable as well, which means you can customize the typing experience to your liking. They're also gasket mounted, which means you're getting the best comfort possible, plus up to 10 custom profiles to really fine tune your experience.
There's also RGB lighting on the keyboard, plus ambient RGB lighting as well. The latter is something you don't often see and is nice added touch to change things up a bit. Both are fully customizable and add a pop of color when you need it.
The keyboard also has dedicated media controls, along with a rotary knob to control the volume. Everything gets powered via a single USB-C cable. For the most part, this is a simple mechanical keyboard that's priced right. And if this isn't quite what you're looking for, check out these other mechanical keyboards.
