There are so many video games set in a galaxy far, far away that most people will never be able to play them all. But whenever a remastered version of a classic Star Wars game gets released on modern platforms, it gives fans a chance to either revisit something they love, or discover something they missed out on before. And yet, some of the games that Star Wars fans want to see be remastered for new consoles have yet to happen. It's gotten to the point that despite many of the great remasters we've seen for popular Star Wars games, some fans still note how we're missing a few beloved classics. These Star Wars games that have yet to get re-released in a big way were titles that many grew up with playing alongside their fandom for Star Wars media. Whether it was something based off one of the movie releases, or a completely original tale set in the universe, these Star Wars games resonated with players in a big way. It's long past due when we should have seen them revisited by Lucasfilm. Here are the three missing Star Wars game remasters that fans desperately want to see Lucasfilm release on modern consoles.
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith
Missing an anniversary of greatness
The release of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith was massive. Not only did the movie make a big splash in theaters by completing the saga, but the video game gave fans a quick peek at what to expect in the final chapter of the prequel trilogy. Since its initial release, the Revenge of the Sith video game has often been viewed as one of the better Star Wars games to be based on one of the theatrical films. It was a fun brawler that had co-op multiplayer, while also including a Duel Mode that let fans play as their favorite Jedi and Sith characters from the film. But it was more than just that for some fans. The game was emblematic of a time when Star Wars was at the apex of popularity in the public eye during the early 2000s. This is even more of a reason why many fans were confused and disappointed at the lack of a remastered release for the game on platforms like the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. The year of 2025 marked the 20th anniversary of the film's release back in 2005, which would have been the perfect time to re-release the game in some capacity. However, neither Lucasfilm nor Disney made any attempts to do so at all. Even with companies like Aspyr Media re-releasing many classic Star Wars video game titles on different platforms for a number of years. Absolutely nothing about it was done in time for the anniversary of the movie.

Even now past the milestone for the movie, Star Wars fans still want to see the game get remastered for modern platforms. Other games that were released in the same era, such as Star Wars: Bounty Hunter and Pandemic's Star Wars: Battlefront 2, have been remastered and released on digital storefronts. Why that has yet to happen for Revenge of the Sith is anybody's guess, but it's something that fans still want to see done. Hopefully, in the near future, a company like Aspyr Media can do the same thing they did with Bounty Hunter Remastered and give this game the remastering it deserves.

Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire
Overlooking the best Expanded Universe tale
Anyone who has followed the Expanded Universe or Star Wars Legends stories is very familiar with Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire. It was a multimedia event that told a story through multiple mediums, and had a massive brand campaign that drew together elements of classic Star Wars that people loved. The release of the video game based on the interim story for the Nintendo 64 was a big deal, which helped sell a number of units of the console back in 1996. Fans who owned the console back then were seeing the adventures of Dash Rendar during a time in-between two beloved Star Wars films. As a game, Shadows of the Empire had a lot of variety with its gameplay, offering third-person action and on-rails and flight shooting. Despite its various flaws, people loved seeing the story of Shadows of the Empire unfold, which was also told through the novel and comics of the same name. It wasn't a straight-forward adaptation, but a variation of the same story told through a different lens. It was an original trilogy-era plot, but with new details that enhanced both The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi in ways that fans loved.

Unfortunately, this Star Wars game has not been remastered in any capacity. While the PC version of the game was re-released on Steam and other digital stores, it remakes the same version of Shadows of the Empire from the PC release in 1997. With so many classic Star Wars titles getting remastered for modern hardware, one would hope that one of the biggest game releases for one of the biggest events in the franchise's history would also get some love. Fans have desperately wanted to see Dash Rendar, Prince Xizor, and other parts from Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire cleaned up and released on new consoles.

Star Wars Trilogy Arcade
Taking it back to the arcades
Star Wars and arcade gaming have gone together very well for a long time. Some of the greatest and most popular arcade games from the 80s have been linked to Star Wars. But one of the most interesting and fun arcade releases comes from the late 90s. Star Wars Trilogy Arcade is what some would consider a greatest hits compilation from the original trilogy of films, but through an on-rails shooter for arcades. It was a fun, fast-paced, and challenging game that took players through some of the biggest battles of the first three movies, but with more control over where the blasters were firing at. The game came out around the same time that the original trilogy of films were being re-released in theaters with the Star Wars Special Edition branding, which included new changes to the films from their original releases. Most of the Star Wars games released in arcades have not been remastered, but instead were included as bonus inclusions for other releases. The classic arcade titles for The Empire Strikes Back and the original Star Wars were unlockables in games like Star Wars Rogue Squadron 3: Rebel Strike, but they were never given their own separate compilation for consoles. The company Arcade1up released an arcade unit that had these arcade games in it, as well as the Return of the Jedi arcade game, but Star Wars Trilogy Arcade was notably absent from it.

So far, Star Wars Trilogy Arcade has never gotten a re-release or remastering of any kind. While it was a very popular game played when it released in locations in 1998, the game has never appeared on digital storefronts or any compilations like other arcade games. Eventually, this should be one of the first titles to be remastered next, especially when most other Star Wars console games have already been covered. It would be interesting to see a collection of these classic arcade releases together from a company like Digital Eclipse, which could be a great way to see just how far Star Wars games have come since they first began releasing in arcades.

Using the Force to remaster
Star Wars fans love to play their video games, especially ones they grew up with over the years. While we have been seeing many classics get re-released on current-day platforms, there are still gaps that fans want to see filled up. Many iconic Star Wars games that are beloved have been revisited and introduced to a new generation of fans, which is why these classic games should also be given the same treatment. New fans of a galaxy far, far away should be able to see and experience all the games that many of us played throughout our younger years. Because, like a love for video games and great sci-fi adventure stories, the force will be with us, always.
