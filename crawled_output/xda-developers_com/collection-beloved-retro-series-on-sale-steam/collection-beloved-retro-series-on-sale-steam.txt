Say whatever you like about Capcom, but they make it very easy to explore some of its most famous series. For instance, if you want to explore the history of Mega Man, the company has several collections related to the different storylines and series it created over the years. One such series is the Mega Man Battle Network, which takes the familiar blue robot away from the platforming genre and puts him in an RPG. And if you want to give it a go, it's currently at its lowest price on Steam.
Mega Man Battle Network Volume 1 is just $12.79 on Steam (and so is Volume 2)
If you've never heard of Mega Man Battle Network, it's a good pickup for fans of RPGs. Many people grew up on the Battle Network series, and with Capcom compiling the games into a collection and adding it to Steam, it gives fans both new and old an excuse to dive back in. Here's how Capcom describes the game:
The Battle Network is back! Get ready to jack in to the net to face off against deadly enemy programs in electrifying grid based battles, and search the net for rare and powerful BattleChips to build the ultimate deck of special moves!
In 200X, the rapid advancement of Internet technology has created the “network age.” People have come to enjoy the benefits of network technology through portable exploration devices called “PET” and personality simulation programs called NetNavi. As the network world expands and life becomes more convenient, however, network crime is raging. Main character Lan Hikari and his NetNavi, MegaMan.EXE, join forces to confront these incidents.
The collection is divided into two parts. Part one contains Mega Man Battle Network 1, 2, and 3 Blue/White. Part two features Mega Man Battle Network 4: Red Sun/Blue Moon, Mega Man Battle Network 5: Team Protoman/Colonel, and Mega Man Battle Network 6: Cybeast Gregar/Falzar. Both collections are currently 68% off on Steam, marking their biggest discount yet, with pricing at $12.79 per collection. You have until September 29th to grab them, so be sure to pick them up before this deal goes away again. And be sure to check out the platforming Mega Man collections too, especially given how one classic Mega Man game threatened one of our writers' sanity.
