Summary
SoulCage: an ESP32 pendant with animated trapped souls—great spooky Halloween gadget.
Two selectable souls are available via the side button: the male is furious and frantic, while the female is calm and patient.
Project needs ESP32, 3D printing, and gluework—start early to finish before Halloween.
Well, Halloween is just over a month away, and tinkerers far and wide are devising new ways to scare and creep people out. I'm sure our resident SBC enthusiast, Jeff Butts, will find a way to spice up October with a new gadget or two. He always likes a good excuse to solder something. If you have a spare ESP32 lying around and want to create something spooky for this year's Halloween, this cool "soul pendant" seems like a perfect fit. Not only is it the perfect fit for a witch, warlock, or necromancer costume, but it's animated, too.
The SoulCage is a creepy ESP32 project that's perfect for Halloween
This cool project, called the SoulCage, comes to us via VishalsoniIndia on Hackster.io. Turns out, they get all kinds of ideas for cool Halloween-themed gadgets around this time of year, but they promised themselves they'd finish one project before starting another. A good call, I'd say; I don't want to admit how many half-completed projects I have sitting around my place. While the SoulCage's concept of looking like someone's eternal spirit has been stuffed inside a necklace is already creepy enough, VishalsoniIndia found a way to make it even cooler:
This pendant doesn’t just look scary; it contains animated souls inside. The soul is always moving, always trying to escape from the pendant. To make it even more interesting, there are actually two souls: one male and one female. By pressing the side button, you can switch between them. The male soul is aggressive and furious, he bangs at the glass as if he’s desperate to break out. The female soul is calmer, quiet, and patient, as if she is waiting for the right moment to be released by the owner. Together, they make the pendant feel alive in a creepy yet fun way.
The end result is a wearable pendant you can put around your neck with the small soul trying to hammer its way through the screen. It's a really cool effect, and it'd definitely turn heads as part of a Halloween getup. It takes quite a bit of tinkering, 3D printing, and gluing to get it working, so it's best to get started now so you have plenty of time to get it finished before you hit the streets in your best costume. And if that's not enough engineering for you, Jeff Butts posted an article about building a Raspberry Pi-powered haunted house last year, which must make him a hit with trick-or-treaters.
