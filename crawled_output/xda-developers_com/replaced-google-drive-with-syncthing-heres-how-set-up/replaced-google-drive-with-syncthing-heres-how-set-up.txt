Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
My family and I used to rely on a well-organized Google Drive for everything. It was convenient, but I always worried about our most important files, like family photos, legal documents, etc., being stored on a company's servers. What if there were a data breach? I wanted the convenience of a shared, synced folder but with the peace of mind that comes from owning your own data. So, I switched us to Syncthing. It’s an amazing open-source tool that lets you create a private, offline syncing network. We got all the benefits of the cloud without the cloud itself. Here’s how I set it all up for my family.
The central hub — setting up my Syncthing server
Creating our central sync hub
When I decided to set up Syncthing for my entire family, my first step was to create a central hub for all our data. My personal Windows device was the perfect choice because it's always on, and I could manage everything from a single place. The setup was a breeze.
Installation
First, I went to the official Syncthing website and downloaded the Windows installer. I ran it using Windows PowerShell, for which I chose the option to install for all users. During this installation process, it gives an option to change the port, auto-upgrade intervals, and other configuration settings. However, I kept the default settings as they are. This set up Syncthing to run as a Windows service. I opened my web browser and navigated to http://localhost:8384 to access the control panel of Syncthing. The first thing I did was click "Actions" in the top-right corner, then "Settings," and set a strong username and password for the Web GUI. This keeps Syncthing secure on my computer.
Set Folder Permissions
Since Syncthing is now running as a service, it operates under a special system account, not my personal user account. The installer automatically created a folder in the Users directory named SyncthingServiceAcct for this purpose. I had to give this service account permission to access my sync folders.
Right-click on the folder I wanted to sync (e.g., C:\Users\patel\Documents\Work\Sync).
Select Properties from the menu.
Go to the Security tab and click the Edit button.
Click Add to open a new window.
In the text box, type SyncthingServiceAcct and click Check Names. The full name should appear underlined. Click OK.
Back in the permissions window, select the newly added SyncthingServiceAcct user.
In the permissions list below, check the box for Full control under the "Allow" column.
Click Apply and then OK to save the changes. This granted the Syncthing service the necessary read and write access to the folder, preventing any "access denied" errors.
Bringing the family onboard — connecting devices
From solo sync to family team: the connection phase
After setting up the central hub, the next step was to install Syncthing on each device to get everyone on board. I helped each family member install Syncthing on their device. On the other family's Windows PC, I followed the same steps as on my laptop. For the Android phone, I downloaded the Syncthing-Fork app from the Google Play Store. Once the app was running on each device, I opened the web interface or the app to find its unique Device ID. This long, secure code is how Syncthing devices find each other on the network. On my main laptop, I clicked Actions -> Show ID. A QR code instantly appeared on the screen. On the Android phone, I selected "Add Remote Device" and used the camera to scan the QR code on my laptop's screen. For the Windows PC, I just copied and pasted the Device ID. After they scanned my laptop's QR code, a notification popped up on my screen asking if I wanted to connect with their device. I clicked "Add Device" and gave it a recognizable name, like "Family PC" or "Android Phone." I repeated this simple process for every device in the family. In just a few minutes, we had a fully meshed network of devices all ready to share files securely and privately.
Setting up shared folders for the family
Building our shared family library
Close
With all our devices connected, the final, and most important, step was creating the shared folders. The entire point of this setup was to have dedicated spaces for different types of family data — photos, documents, and more. This process is a two-way street: create the folder on the central hub and then share it with the devices that need access. The process is straightforward.
Create the shared folder on the hub
On my central laptop, I navigated back to the Syncthing web interface at http://localhost:8384.
I clicked the Add Folder button. This opens a new window with a few options.
I gave the folder a clear Folder Label like Family Photos. This is what everyone will see on their devices.
For the Folder Path, I entered the location on my laptop where I wanted these photos to be stored (e.g., C:\Users\patel\Documents\Family Data\Photos).
Share the folder with family devices
After creating the folder, I clicked on the Sharing tab in the same pop-up window.
This showed a list of all the devices I had previously connected. I simply selected the checkboxes next to the devices that should be part of this folder.
I then clicked Save.
Accept the folder on each device
Within a few seconds, a notification popped up on the web interface of each device I shared the folder with. The message asked if they wanted to Add the new folder called "Family Photos."
On each device, either I or a family member clicked Add.
This opened a new screen where we had to choose the Folder Path on their local computer or phone. For example, on the Android phone, I chose the designated folder so that all new photos would be automatically synced. On the Windows PC, I created a new folder in the E: drive called "Family Photos."
We clicked Save on each device to complete the process.
The folder then began to sync automatically. The files started flowing from the central hub to the other devices, creating a perfect, up-to-date copy on every single device that needed it.
Our digital lives, now effortlessly in sync
With everything set up, Syncthing's real power comes to life. If I add a new photo to our shared folder, it instantly appears on my family's devices. No more personal data on Google’s servers. The app handles everything automatically, so our photos are always shared and backed up, and our important documents are always ready on any device we need them on. Beyond this basic setup, I also have the flexibility to explore other Syncthing features down the road, like selective sync for specific files or ignoring certain folders if needed. This system is a perfect way to keep our digital lives in sync without any extra effort.

Home cloud on Windows? With SSD disks? SSD-Death soon will be your guest :)BTW seriously, the main purpose of internet clouds like Amazon, Google, Mega, Dropbox etc. etc. are security, reliability, redundancy and .... to be not in your house (in case of fire/flood/tornado). And I'm in doubt home user will made RAID60, double PSU, triple network and double clima with dust protection and remote monitoring.

Every single study I've seen shows SSD average lifespan to exceed HDD. And if you're referring to the recent Phison news, that's been debunked and likely a hoax. I've personally ran over 5TB thru two of my SSDs and nothing happened. The real issue is heat management, so keep em cool.But yeah, the promise of cloud infrastructure is hardcore redundancy. I have lost data using something like this local setup before when drives crash, even using RAID and having a local backup. Best bet is to use cloud storage and keep local and remote offline copies. I used to keep a be all failsafe backup drive in a safe deposit box for work and I needed it exactly once. And verify your backups regularly.Ps RAID60 is very sketchy. Poor write performance and takes forever to rebuild
after a disk failure which can put enough load on the other drives to raise the risk of failure during the rebuild. Has to do 6 IOs for every write. I prefer simple RAID10 or separate RAID6 arrays.

There is nothing to stop you having a machine at another site that is also synced. If you really want to be redundant, you should be running onsite, offsite and offline backups.

You say syncthing gives you all the benefits of the web. So if the home is destroyed, syncthing is there with copies of your data safely off site, or this article pure drivel?I don't use Google drive to share data so much as I use it make sure there are copies of my information not at my home.Do you use a commercial web cloud service to keep your information safe? Is syncthing good for that? Nope. More clickbait

You do know you can use synching to securely sync across multiple sites, don't you? i.e. all you need is a friend or family member machine somewhere else and you can setup your own "offsite" backup that will work as long as you want it to.

Hi, so if I accidentally delete something on one device, it will delete it on the others? If one device gets compromised by malware, the others may get affected as well? In this case, it would be important to have a solid backup strategy, on-site and off-site.

Been there. Now I syncthing two celphones, two laptops, several PCs and two Raspberries to a central server, and THAT takes care both of versioning and of syncing important files to Dropbox and GDrive.

I don:t want to maintain IT. Hardware break down and need to replaced. Let Google or other providers take care of that.

As much as I am an avid user of Syncthing myself (love the capabilities it provides), as others have alluded to, this article is misleading if you think this setup is a viable replacement for Google Drive.
The configuration described in this article is lacking so many redundancy and data protection mechanisms, that people are definitely going to lose their data if they are rely on this setup as the sole means for keeping their data.
No disk failure tolerance, no offsite storage, no cold/offline storage, no versioning - the list goes on...
It's also important to understand that 'sync' and 'backup' are two very different things.
This setup is really just handling sync, but there is virtually no backup happening here.
One mistake or deletion on one device will 'sync' that same mistake to every device.
Syncthing is a great tool but understanding how to use it appropriately to protect your data is critical!

I agree with everyone else that Syncthing is not a backup tool, but it is a 2nd drive like OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox etc, because I have 4 computer I bounce around to, and takes off of the mental notes to know where my data is because it is on all of them all the time.Where I do like Syncthing, is that my data is only on my devices.
I use a mostly hub and spoke topology where 1 computer has everything that I sync, to all the other device, and use Backblaze to backup my hub, so I know that if it gets into the Syncthing data set, it will get to the hub, and then be backed up.For me, I keep most of my created and scanned documents, in using Syncthing directories, and not with a cloud service, because I can not know 100% every second that a TOS would use my documents as a source for LLM training.
Don't really care if big tech know that I have ISO and EXE's on their cloud services.

Using Syncthing as a backup tool is not a good idea. Syncthing is a tool to copy files from one device to another, and it's a great tool for this purpose. It is not intended to be a backup tool—the developers themselves say not to use it this way. What it does is sync the contents of the shared folder, i.e. it keeps the contents of the folder the same on every device. What this means is that anything added to the shared folder on one device will show up in the sync folder on all of them. It also means that anything removed from the sync folder on one device will be removed from the folder on all devices. If no copy exists somewhere outside the sync folder, that file is gone. You could use Syncthing to copy files to a backup device, but once there it's essential that they be copied to another folder to ensure that they weren't wiped out by deletion elsewhere.

Multiple questions:Where is the emergency backup? What happens if your personal device dies or if your house burns down? What happens in case of a malware attack and your data get encrypted? By not having the cloud you're losing the benefits of the cloud! How do you duplicate the benefits of the cloud while removing the disadvantages?

That was interesting.I'd like to try it, since I have accumulated tens of thousands of photos and videos.The problem is I might need help along the way.

Sadly, the Syncthing team is starting to give up on the efforts they have to do to keep publishing Android apps and other stuff. I don't think it's a viable alternative to almost anything except for some niche cases.

And backup, versioning, ... ?
I hope you have backup.
I hope no family member will accidentally delete a photo.

Isn't a big reason for cloud storage that I can save space by syncing with the cloud? This setup means every file exists everywhere.

No, it's not "a big reason", but just one of many potential reasons you might prefer cloud storage. Just as there are many reasons you might prefer this.

Absolutely NOT a breeze to set up. Resilio Sync is like a tenth of the effort that was required here.

Isn't Resilio paid, closed-source software? You do you, but I take a bit of a complication in the name of self-hosted FOSS any day. Not that Syncthing is difficult at all.
