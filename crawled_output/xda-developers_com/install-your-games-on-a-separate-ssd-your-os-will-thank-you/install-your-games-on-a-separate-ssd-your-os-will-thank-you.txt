Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
The average size of a video game has increased substantially over the years, so it's just as well that storage upgrades aren't anywhere near as expensive as they used to be. But if you've only got one
SSD in your PC, even if it's a
PCIe 5.0 version, you're courting disaster on the daily. While it's true enough that Gen 5 SSDs are fast, and the capacity for NVMe SSDs has increased to respectable levels, keeping all your data on one drive is never a good practice.
I always use a second SSD for my game installs (although technically I have three other SSDs with games on, because I hate re-downloading them), and I think everyone should. It's not about performance, but there are plenty of other reasons that putting game installs on a second SSD makes sense.
We used to do this when SSDs were new
Except Windows went on the SSD, and games went on a HDD
When SSDs first hit the mainstream around a decade ago, they were space-constrained. It wasn't uncommon to have a 120GB SSD as your boot drive, and have a secondary HDD for data and games to go on. Sometimes you'd put a few of your favorite games on the SSD and swap them back and forth according to what you were playing, but for the most part, you used the SSD for Windows as the speed benefits for the tiny files the OS reads made more sense than game loading screen times. Then SSD prices dropped, capacity increased, and before you knew it, people were using a single SSD for their system that had Windows and their games on. Some people partitioned their drive to seem like several SSDs for organizational reasons, but it wasn't necessary. I'm here to ask people to go back to the days of having a second drive to install games on and use it for their documents folder, download folder, and any other data they want to keep. It's not really for performance's sake, although it can probably help in some edge cases, but it makes sense from organizational and data safety perspectives.
Even a Gen 5 SSD can get slowed down
While the newest NVMe SSDs are fast for straight data transfers, that only counts during game loading screens. Most of the time, most of the game's data is in RAM, or your graphics card's VRAM, so the necessary computations can be done from quickly accessible data. Games try not to pull data from the SSD installation while you're actively playing, although that's not always possible, and that could become an issue depending on several other factors. Windows habitually does things in the background, even when gaming mode is on. That could be swapping RAM data into the cache files on your C: drive, moving junk data around, or performing any small tasks on the SSD on which the OS is installed. When smaller files are being read, it's all about the IOPS performance of the SSD, and even Gen 5 drives can be overwhelmed in this way.
Games are getting even bigger
I wonder when games are going to need their own drive, each
I just looked at the installed games on my SSDs, and four of the top ten (size-wise) are from the Call of Duty franchise. The largest is Call of Duty WWII at 141GB, larger than the first SSD I owned, and ranging down to a more sedate 68.9GB for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, but I know that one is smaller because I didn't install multiplayer or anything really except for the campaign. I've installed my Steam library on a second hard drive or SSD for a decade now, because it's easy to reinstall them from a second drive without downloading them over again. It took a while, but Epic Games, EA, and Ubisoft can do the same reinstallation of existing game files from a second drive, making things much easier when (not if, this is a given constant) I have to reinstall Windows. And whether it's because Windows has become corrupted, the SSD I use for my C: drive has failed, or any other reason, I have long learned only to use the C: drive for my operating system and the programs I use for productivity. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and essential data should live on a second drive.
Not everyone can easily download games again if they lose data
I count myself fortunate to have fiber internet with no data cap, so I could easily download the thousands of games I have spread across multiple game stores. I don't want to do that, because it would still take forever, but I could. But it takes long enough downloading and sync'ing OneDrive and Dropbox when I reinstall Windows, and I'd rather not have to download anything I already had on a drive. And I know that isn't the situation of most computer users. Whether it's slow ISP plans, restrictive data caps, distance to Steam servers making downloads sluggish, or any of the dozens of reasons that digital ownership of games is annoying, having to download your game library when moving to a new PC or reinstalling the OS on your existing one is a pain. Having those games installed on a second SSD makes sense because you can reuse that drive, and not have to worry about downloads.
And most apps default to installing on your C: drive
The other reason I put games on a second drive is that most Windows apps will default to installing on the C: drive. While some let you move parts, some programs will not work if installed on a secondary drive or won't let you install them. Those apps are things like Adobe's suite or other productivity and creativity apps that I need daily for work.
They take up a significant chunk of my boot drive, and if I had games on it as well, I'd be getting close to the limit for leaving 10% or so free on the drive for peak performance.
Giving your games their own SSD makes sense
The SSD that you install your operating system on has a finite lifespan. Putting games on a second drive makes sense for your computer's longevity, organizes your files better, and ensures data integrity in case the OS drive gets corrupted. I'd caution against using partitions on a single SSD because that still works the controller and NAND, and having a second SSD for games means your gaming isn't competing with the same storage resources when you're trying to click some heads.

One thing that you didn't mention is how easy is to mod a game, instead of digging around your C drive, you can just click on the secondary drive and grab the games that you want. I will buy a cheapo 120gb SSD for my windows install and use my 2tb NVMe for the games

I haven't had to reinstall Windows for literally over a decade. My current install is 2 years old and runs exactly the same as when the laptop was new. And I've installed a lot of stuff since then. Even if I had to reinstall Windows, replacing my game installs from steam is literally just a few clicks. Not sure I see the big deal TBH.

I have been doing this before SATA SSDs were a thing and putting HDDs in raid 0 arrays were all the rage. Right now I three cheap low 256gb NVMEs in a software raid 0 for my OS and two higher capacity NVMEs in a JBOD for my Steam folder. I'm stuck on a older PCIE 3.0 system so I wanted the extra speed boost with the software raid 0.Not sure if I would still do software raid if I was able to upgrade to PCIe 4.0 or 5.0.I would probably just have a single NVME for my OS but still combine one, two or three higher capacity NVMEs in a JBOD or something else. When it comes to NVME it makes sense to have the best speed, so if you can use PCIE 4.0 or 5.0 having that as your OS drive would be best. But for your extra storage you load your steam games off of? I'd say just use whatever highest capacity NVME you can get your hands on, regardless of what generation it is. For everything else? Your photos? Movies? Downloaded stuff you gotta put someplace? Just use a high capacity SATA SSD or even a HDD.

Sounds like this is a Windows problem rather than a drive problem; lots of unknown processes doing things in the background you don't know about and can't control.Me, I'm set up like this: First, Linux. Complete control, no mysterious background processes or in-OS advertising. Second, an SSD, 1 TB. This has an OS partition and the rest is reserved for cache space (more on that in a moment). Next, an actual, honest-to-God hard drive. In this case, 8TB. Logical volume management is employed so I can add another drive later and have it appear as one logical drive if I run out of room. I have logical volumes for music, movies, TV Shows, and my home (general data) volume. And by golly, this is general volume is CACHED via the SSD! All the speed of SSDs, all the massive storage space of hard disk drives, no wasting all the money on large capacity SSDs. The cache automatically holds the most recently and frequently used data from the general hard drive volume - the latest files I'm using, the game(s) I'm playing, etc. If and when this usage pattern changes, the cache will toss out the oldest and least used data to make room for the new files being used. Putting my music and media on different volumes prevents them from being cached (no need to do that). There you go. No need for a special game SSD. I've got more capacity than my SSD-only friends, more speed than my HDD-only friends, and arguably better performance without the need for manual management of those who install their OS and certain games on their SSD and put the rest on a HDD and swap files back and forth as their usage changes. If one insists on using Windows, there are Intel and AMD programs available for caching HDD data on SSD, but I can't speak to how well they work. I haven't heard anything bad though. This is REALLY the way to go, regardless of OS. For reference, my cache is reporting right now that **92.2%** of my HDD reads are found in the cache instead!

I've been doing this since I built my first computer back in the 90s. From a storage space perspective, it just makes sense. Let Windows gobble up its own drive with lots of overhead and store the games on a separate drive. Not to mention with steam if it and it's games are installed on a separate drive and you have to do a clean install, all you have to do is reinstall steam with zero fuss.

Done this for a long time, I also have all my personal folders on a separate partitioned drive.
