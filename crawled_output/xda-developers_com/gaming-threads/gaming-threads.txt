Borderlands 4 might have issues, but it has me hooked
Whelp, Gearbox has done it again. Another Borderlands release, hang on one sec, another broken Borderlands release, but it doesn't matter. The looter shooter has got its claws into the dopamine factories in my brain, and it won't let go. I'm not sure if I like the vault hunters on offer this time around (although two unknowns are coming in DLC, so maybe I'll enjoy one of those as much as I loved Krieg the Psycho from BL2), but damn, if the guns don't feel great, the writing (for the side-quests anyway) is spot on, and the dopamine hits from every green glowing container when I pop it open. I'm sure there's a main storyline somewhere, but all I can see is containers to open, shinies to pick up, and cel-shaded baddies to stomp.

How far have you progressed into Nightreign's new mode?
It has been a while since Elden Ring Nightreign added the Deep of Night difficulty to the game, with the new mode bringing more powerful enemies, extra relics, and more weapon parameters to the table. It also brings a progression system, where each successful run will net you some rating points. Once you've acquired enough of these points, your depth level will rise, with each successive level increasing the difficulty of the game. In my experience, Depth 1 is fairly easy, while Depth 2 is quite a difficulty curve — even more so when you end up facing the Everdark Sovereign variants of the Night bosses. I've made it to Depth 3 by playing with my friends, and I'm only a two hundred points away from hitting Depth 4. But that's just me. What depth level are you at in Nightreign?

How do you feel about roguelike games?
After the Nintendo Direct presentation last Friday, I quickly bought the DK Island & Emerald Rush DLC for Donkey Kong Bananza, mostly because I love the base game and figured I'd have fun with it. The DLC contains a rogue-like mode where you have to collect as much emerald ore as possible in a limited time.
I find the concept intriguing, and it's decently to fun to play in the moment, but I've found it hard to stay invested in the game as it feels like there's no real progress being made. It could also be that I'm bad at the game, but I've felt similarly about games like Dead Cells, which has me thinking I might just not like this genre. Do you like roguelike games, or do you prefer games that have a more defined path to progression?

It's been 40 years since Super Mario Bros. came out and the titular plumber is still going strong
Seriously, 40 years is a long time, and Mario has been curbstomping Goombas for every minute of it. Whether he's running around with his brother Luigi or pairing up with dinosaurs, talking hats and more, Mario has been a part of the gaming landscape for young, and the young-at-heart. I can't wait for the next outing (and his first on the Nintendo Switch 2), because I've played every game to date and Nintendo's first-party titles are always worth picking up. Is Mario your favorite or is another Nintendo character in that top slot?

Virtual Boy games are coming to the Switch 2 and I am losing my mind
Nintendo has just held its latest Direct showcase going over numerous upcoming games for the Switch and Switch 2. There were some great announcements in there, but none shocked me more than the addition of Virtual Boy to the Nintendo Classics library on both Switch and Switch 2.
The Virtual Boy is infamously Nintendo's worst selling console hardware, recorded at 770,000 units sold worldwide, though the hardware was never launched in Europe. This addition to the Nintendo Classics library is also going to require an add-on that pretty much replicates the look of that original hardware, and it'll be available in all major markets, meaning it's more than likely it will sell more than the original hardware.
I'm just absolutely befuddled that this is happening now, when Nintendo had a perfect opportunity to re-release these games on the 3DS and never did it. But there's no way around the fact that this is at least interesting.

Nintendo has another hour-long show coming this week
Nintendo has just announced its first "general" Nintendo Direct since it launched the Switch 2 over three months ago, and suffice it to say, it feels like it's going to be a banger. Partly because Nintendo skipped its usual June showcase, which means we're overdue for a deluge of Nintendo news, but also because Nintendo is kind of promising exactly that.
According to the company, this will be a roughly 60-minute long show, which makes it the longest general Direct ever, if we exclude the April showcase that was exclusively focused on revealing the Switch 2 and its launch lineup. There are no expected hardware announcements this time around, so it's all about the games (and maybe the sequel to the Mario movie), which makes it all the more exciting.

I can't wait to play Nightreign's Deep of Night mode next week
Now that it has been a few months since Elden Ring: Nightreign dropped, we've had quite a few bosses added to the game (even though they're technically just the enhanced versions of their base-game counterparts). If you're even remotely as into Nightreign as I am, you've probably beaten everything the game has to offer and are itching for something new to fight. Well, Fromsoftware will add a hard mode starting next week, and I can't wait to try it out. Named Deep of Night, this mode will apparently add random bosses, buffed enemies, and a progression system, wherein the game gets progressively harder the deeper you go into the mode. Me? I just want to equip more relics and create the most broken builds possible. Leaks revealed Deep of Night allows up to six relics for each Nightfarer, and I'll probably spend the first couple of days farming the relics exclusive to this mode.

A virtualization-optimized version of Windows 11 would be awesome
Recently, I found out about a project called WinApps that attempts to run Windows apps on Linux in a seamless way, making them appear integrated into the native desktop. This relies on a full Windows VM paired with a remote desktop tool, but Windows is a hefty OS to run in the background for a setup like this.
It got me thinking it would be a cool idea if Microsoft made a Windows ISO image designed for tinkerers who want to use lightweight VMs or containers, where you can still run all the Windows apps, but without the usual background processes Windows comes with. It would make it way easier to ditch full Windows installs for good.

Are you playing Kirby and the Forgotten Land on the Switch 2?
Nintendo just released the Switch 2 Edition upgrade for Kirby and the Forgotten Land earlier this week, and as a huge Nintendo fan, of course I'm already all over it. So far, the new campaign seems like more of what we saw before, and that's not a bad thing considering the game was phenomenal from the start. I do think the new levels are beautiful, too, but maybe I'm just simple-minded and love sparkly things. Plus, everything runs more smoothly and at a higher resolution, so that's nice.
What I'm currently most curious about is the new boss rush difficulty that's introduced in this new edition. I remember beating the ahrdest difficulty in the base game, but it's been a while and I'm a little rusty. Have you already beaten the new content? What are your thoughts? I'd love to hear them!

Be honest, how many wins do you have against the Everdark version of Libra in Nightreign?
When Fromsoftware announced the Everdark variant of Libra, Creature of Night, I was itching to fight the Equilibrious Beast. And between the never-ending army of invaders, random madness-inducing AoEs, and ocassional "deals" from Libra, the boss fight exceeded all my expectations.
Truth be told, I loved the boss fight, even though I've only beaten the Everdark Sovereign twice. The first win was due to my team finding Marais Executioner's Greatswords (yes, we found more than one) during the first day in Nokstella and grinding several enemies to buff the weapon. The other time, it was all thanks to a skilled Ironeye carrying us through the fight. What about you? How many wins do you have against this challenging boss?

I got 100% completion in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, but I'm not sure I recommend it
Over the past weekend or so, I hit a few gaming achievements: 100% completion of Donkey Kong Bananza, followed by finishing the original Donkey Kong Country on the SNES (through the NSO app), and finally, I achieved 100% completion in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
I had already beaten the game after it came out, and tried to do as much as I could within it without any guides. But with the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of the game available, the Nintendo Switch App provided guidance to achieve full completion of the game, and that's exactly what I did. Every Korok seed, every voice memory (also a Switch 2 Edition exclusive), everything. And while I'm glad I did that, I do think this portion of the game is much less interesting. The navigation feature turns the game into a waypoint game, where you just head to the next thing on the map every time, and it takes away the magic of the title.
If this is your first time playing the game, I actually recommend playing it without look

I love fighting the newest Everdark Sovereign in Nightreign
When Fromsoftware announced the next batch of Everdark Sovereigns for Nightreign, I was really excited to test my mettle against Libra. Fighting the Equilibrious Beast was already a challenge in the base game, and I wanted to see how they'd enhance the boss. And well, the new boss fight exceeded my expectations in every way.
The summoned enemies add more chaos (pun-intended) to the fight, and the random "deals" that Libra can activate in the middle of the battle make everything even more frantic. I've only beaten the boss once so far, and I'd credit that win to the Marais Executioner's Swords we found on Day 1 in Noklateo. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable fight, even though it can get a little too challenging at times.

I finished Donkey Kong Bananza's story, and it's amazing
After multiple weeks, I've finally reached the end credits on Donkey Kong Bananza, and all I can say is it's incredibly impressive that we're only two months into the Switch 2's lifecycle, and the console already has two absolute killer titles. Bananza is one of the most freeing and fun-filled experiences Nintendo has ever made, and the basic concept of destroying everything never stops being satisfying.
Donkey Kong Bananza is filled with unique level designs and interesting environments, fun characters (with the protagonist duo being particularly great), smooth controls, and satisfying feedback that make the game fun all the way through. It's not absolutely perfect, but it comes very close.

What do you hope to see in tomorrow's Nintendo Direct?
After a few months of silence, Nintendo finally announced a new Direct presentation is taking place tomorrow, Julky 31st, but this time, it's a Partner Showcase — meaning all the games shown will be developed or published by external companies.
Some fans are definitely eager to see more games from Nintendo proper, but with the Switch 2 making it possible to bring over games from current-gen platforms with relative ease, it's obvious that a focus on third-party games is more important than ever. And I imagine there's a lot to look forward to. Release dates for Elden Ring Tarnished Edition and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade are two likely candidates, but it's also about time we saw some first showings for other titles. What would you like to see the most? And please, don't say Silksong again.

The Switch 2 has finally made me enjoy Pokémon again
I've been a Pokémon fan my entire life, yet as time has gone on, my interest has waned somewhat. To be honest, it's not even the typical growing-up-related loss of interest that got me; it's been the technical issues of the games themselves. I really liked Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and I loved the Gen 4 remakes, though I know that last one is unpopular. However, I found Sword somewhat monotonous, and the performance issues of Scarlet and Violet instantly put me off.
With that said, the launch of the Switch 2 and the Scarlet and Violet patches for that console gave me pause. I had heard great things about the game otherwise, and seen others share their opinions that the game itself is fantastic once you can get over those hurdles. I eventually bit the bullet and went for it, and you know what? I'm loving it. I clocked three hours in the game on my first day, and I've been hooked. The Switch 2 has given some older games a new lease of life, and it's been so nice to get to enjoy playing a

Pokémon Violet is better on Switch 2, but it's still not good
After this week's Pokémon Presents showcase (which was fairly boring, might I add), I've picked up Pokémon Violet once again to participate in the latest Tera Raid Battle event. I had already spent a few minutes with the game when I reviewed the Switch 2, but now that I'm participating in these online battles, it's become even more obvious that the game was terribly optimized for the original Switch.
Everything runs so much more smoothly on the Switch 2, at 60 frames per second and no frame drops I can distinguish. It's such a better experience, but it also shows how poorly these games were made in the first place. The Switch 2 may fix the performance, but visual glitches were still abundant in my experience, with animations not playing properly and some weird communication delays playing online. I really hope Pokémon Legends Z-A won't suffer from these issues.

I can't wait to fight the next batch of Everdark Sovereigns in Nightreign
I've been playing Nightreign ever since the game dropped in May, and have beaten everything the game has to offer. While the first phase of the Everdark Sovereign variants was good enough, I'm itching to fight the next set of bosses - especially since it has my favorite madness-inducing "Creature of the Night." The only caveat is that they're recycled versions of pre-existing bosses, and it would've been a lot of fun if FromSoftware added entirely new bosses this time around.

Donkey Kong Bananza is a true next-gen experience
The Nintendo Switch 2 is just over a month old, but with the launch of Donkey Kong Bananza, Nintendo has already shown it has what it takes to make a true next-gen game experience. I've only had the chance to play it for about one hour, but it's amazing how quickly this game gives you a sense of "I don't know how they would ever have done this on previous hardware".
Sure, Mario Kart World's interconnected world would need a lot of sacrifices on the original Switch, but the sheer amount of destruction you can cause in Donkey Kong Banaza is incredible. The entire world is yours to smash, crash, and bash as you please, and it all responds perfectly. Making use of voxel technology in such an ambitious way really elevates this game and shows off the hardware's capabilities in a way you might not immediately think of. Plus, the game looks gorgeous, too.

Donkey Kong Bananza reviews are in — are you getting it at launch?
Nintendo's next flagship game for the Switch 2, Donkey Kong Bananza, comes out tomorrow, and as per usual with a Nintendo release, I'm extremely excited to play it. In the meantime, reviews for the game have just gone live from multiple outlets, and they're overwhelmingly positive, with the game sitting at an impressive 91/100 score on OpenCritic.
The colorful environments, hectic gameplay, and seemingly lovely soundtrack all have me hyped, and I still do feel like this would have been a better launch title for the Switch 2, but what do you think? Are you picking up this game? Are you finally convinced to buy the Switch 2 itself with this launch? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

I finally "finished" Mario Kart World, but there's a big problem
It's been over a month since Nintendo launched the Switch 2, and I've spent as much of my free time as I could trying to achieve completion of the game, by which I mean getting three-star rankings in every single Grand Prix and Knockout Tour in the game. I finally achieved this last night. Of course, I'm still missing one big component — the Free Roam collectibles.
The thing is, though, I don't really understand how Nintendo messed this aspect up as much as it did. How is it that, on the same day, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom get patches that basically add a GPS to the game by connecting your phone, but Mario Kart World — the game with cars — has no way to track most of the collectibles spread around the world. It makes no sense. There are systems for this provided by third parties, but I don't want to rely on them too much, so I may just wait and see if Nintendo will improve this with future updates.
