When the fall season draws near, it brings with it a new season of basketball for fans to get excited about. But as people wait for the first tip-off of NBA basketball to usher in the new season, there are tons of great basketball video games to keep them busy. Over the years, many consoles have featured classic and iconic games that highlighted the appeal of basketball as a sport. But not every game that featured basketball tried to simulate what fans watch on television. Sometimes, they went above and beyond what we know about the game. Some basketball games take the flair of the game to exaggerated heights. Whether it's the massive dunks at the basket or literally putting players on fire when they're on a hot streak, those games make being a fan of basketball a lot of fun. These are five classic basketball games that are perfect to play and get ready for the upcoming NBA season.

When it comes to covering sports in all of its facets, there's no bigger network than ESPN. Which is why so many people were surprised when the NBA 2K series underwent a name change for its fifth entry. However, the name change didn't just signify a shift in branding; the game also featured several unique and special elements that would inspire other basketball games. ESPN NBA Basketball on the PlayStation 2 was also the second-to-last game that was made by the same development team for the NBA 2K series before being sold off by Sega. The game tried to steer closer to being more simulation than arcade-style basketball, with a greater focus on emulating what fans would see on an ESPN broadcast of a real game. Every player in the lineup would have their own unique look, unlike other games that had more uniform visuals for players. Things like dribbling and bringing the ball down the court could be more difficult than other titles, but it felt more authentic at the time. In addition, ESPN NBA Basketball stands out for its 24/7 Mode, which lets players create their own character and grow them into an NBA legend. This includes customizing their physical look, jersey, and other aspects of their appearance. Playing games and finishing challenges against well-known NBA players can increase stats and unlock new moves, featuring more dynamic and flashy animations.

ESPN NBA Basketball also featured online multiplayer, as well as multiple game modes to change the way they played basketball. Everything from street ball games to playoffs in the NBA was possible, as well as franchise mode to manage a team and its personnel. For many basketball fans, this was one of the final releases during an era of sports games that were beloved by everyone.

Barkley: Shut Up and Jam!
A little different, but still fun
Following the release of NBA JAM in arcades, many other developers tried to emulate its success. Some games went as far as to be inspired by the look and gameplay of Midway's hit, but didn't always have the same reception from players. One successful copycat of NBA JAM was Barkley: Shut Up and Jam! for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo in 1994. While it looked and played very similar to Midway's basketball game, it had a very different approach to most of its presentation and core gameplay. NBA legend Charles Barkley was the cover athlete for the game and was the only official NBA player in it. The rest of the 15 playable characters were original to the game itself. The controls are similar to NBA JAM, with its three main buttons, where players can run around and boost their speed while passing and shooting on the court. Instead of simulating the official rules of the NBA, the game has more of a street basketball approach, with looser rules and more action. Even though players aren't lighting the ball on fire or dunking to flashes from an NBA arena, Barkley: Shut Up and Jam! does have players jumping high into the air for a dunk. The courts are also in multiple locations around the United States, not just within a random NBA arena, and have a variety of background visuals. A port of the game was planned for the Atari Jaguar system in the early 90s, but it was never officially released when the console was on the market. It was later shared online in beta form when Hasbro put the Jaguar license and patents into the public domain.

NBA Street Vol. 2
Turn it up more
Credit: Source: (YouTube) xTimelessGaming
The first NBA Street game is a classic among basketball fans, showcasing arcade-style basketball with a street culture theme as its main focus. The sequel to it was even more beloved. NBA Street Vol. 2 goes further with street-style basketball and improves upon the original game in different ways. The core gameplay was still 3-on-3 basketball with street rules, but it also featured 29 playable NBA teams to pick from. On the court, NBA Street Vol. 2 added more dunks and flash moves to do while dribbling, as well as a new Level 2 game breaker that could really impact the outcome of games. For basketball fans, it was more of the best aspects of the first game, but with some added flavor to make it feel new and exciting. Completing matches and winning also rewarded players with points to unlock new items and extra content, including NBA legends like Larry Bird and Wilt Chamberlain. NBA Street Vol. 2 was also one of the first games to feature multiple versions of NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan that were playable. As an alternative to the many simulation basketball games that were out at the time, the NBA Street series always appealed to fans who just love the fun of the sport.

NBA JAM
A legendary title to everyone
There is no arcade sports game that is bigger than NBA JAM. It inspired numerous other games that followed, and has never been surpassed as one of the best sports games to play in arcades. The appeal of NBA JAM comes from its total disregard of the official rules for NBA basketball games, and instead keeps the focus on the exciting parts of the sport. While it features all the official teams that were part of the NBA in the early 90s, NBA JAM doesn't spend too much time trying to be like the actual sport of basketball in every facet. It wasn't just a basketball game for die-hard basketball aficionados; it was an arcade game that everyone wanted to get into. The controls are simple to use, but the action is always at full speed when in the middle of a game of NBA JAM. What makes everything sweeter for basketball fans is the commentary that spouts out statements that were catchy, especially when a player makes a massive dunk. Seeing players fly through the air while the basketball is on fire became an iconic aspect of the game, while also further ushering in the phrase "he's on fire" into the public lexicon. And while the roster of players for NBA JAM may be heavily outdated now, its gameplay is timeless and will never be irrelevant.

NBA 2K12
The greatest rules
There have been many NBA 2K games that have been released across different platforms, each with its own changes and gimmicks to stand out at the time of release. What makes NBA 2K12 an interesting entry in the series is how much it focused on celebrating the legends of the sport. The cover of NBA 2K12 had multiple variations that featured different NBA Legends on them. The three covers had Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird as the cover athletes for the game. Because of the 2011 NBA lockout, the game originally did not have rookie players who were drafted for that upcoming season, but were later added as downloadable content when the NBA reached an agreement with the NBA players' union. Like previous titles in the series, NBA 2K12 is a simulation-style basketball game with very detailed visuals. The presentation of nearly every NBA 2K game always manages to look great, but NBA 2K12 had the pressure of making sure that beloved NBA legends looked perfect. The game includes a mode called NBA's Greatest, which focuses on championship teams from different eras. Some of the legendary teams featured on the game's covers included championship rosters for the Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, and Boston Celtics. On the court, the presentation of basketball games is close to real NBA broadcasts, with commentary that was done by Steve Kerr and Kevin Harlan. Sports announcer Doris Burke also does sideline and halftime reports during games, giving an extra layer of realism and authenticity.

While the game was on both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on release, it also had ports to other systems, including the Nintendo Wii and PSP. NBA 2K12 was also the final installment of the series that was released on the PlayStation 2, with a focus on future games shifting to newer platforms. At the time, many critics and fans praised NBA 2K12 as being one of the best basketball sims ever released, leading to the game selling over four million copies worldwide and winning multiple awards.
