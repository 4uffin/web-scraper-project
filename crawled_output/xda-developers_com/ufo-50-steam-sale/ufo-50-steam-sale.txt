Give me a lighthearted recap
Have you ever bought one of those games that advertise themselves as multiple games in one? If so, you've probably discovered the hard way that the included titles...aren't so great. But what can you expect? When developers have to squeeze a ton of games into one big collection, something has to give. Well, it turns out that there's one game out there that does it right. It's called UFO 50, and you'll find that each and every one of its 50 games is made with love and care. And if you don't believe me, UFO 50 is down to its lowest price on Steam, so you can give it a try for less.
UFO 50 is now 25% off on Steam
If you've never heard of UFO 50 before, it's a collection of 50 different games, and you can play every one. UFO 50 adds a little bit of additional spice by acting as a collection of games released by the fictional developer UFO Soft between 1982 and 1989. In this alternate timeline, UFO Soft releases three consoles, the LX-I, LX-II, and LX-III, and you'll notice that the games within the collection get more graphically intense when you play games intended for later consoles. I want to reiterate that the 50 included games aren't just a large number of shovelware titles created to inflate the collection count. In fact, here's how the Steam page describes them:
50 BRAND-NEW GAMES - These are NOT minigames or microgames! Although the size of each game varies, every one is a complete experience, from its opening title screen to its ending credits. Some are small arcade-style games but there are also larger open-world adventures and a JRPG that could take many hours to beat.
My personal picks are Party House and Porgy. Party House is a cool deckbuilder-esque game where you try to arrange the perfect house party. There's a lot of balancing resources, building your deck to fit the current objective, and negating any noise your party makes; if things get too loud, the police are called! Meanwhile, Porgy is very much a Metroidvania but underwater. You play as a submarine exploring the depths around you, and there are a ton of secret passages and obstacles to get around. Some of them you can do right away, while others require you to plunder the sea for power-ups and upgrades so you can dive even deeper. If you'd like to give it a shot yourself, UFO 50 is currently 25% off, the lowest we've seen it go on Steam.
