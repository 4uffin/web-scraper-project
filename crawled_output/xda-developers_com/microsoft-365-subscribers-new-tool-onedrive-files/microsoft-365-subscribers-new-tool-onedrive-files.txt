Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Summary
Right-click OneDrive files in File Explorer to run Copilot analyses.
Copilot can summarize, create FAQs, answer questions, and compare up to 5 files.
Requires Microsoft 365 Personal/Family and OneDrive storage; images/videos are unsupported.
It's no surprise at this point that Microsoft is rolling out Copilot to pretty much every product it's maintaining right now. Recently, we saw Excel introduce a ton of features that utilize the AI assistant, such as
explaining formulae in Excel and even
generating them based on plain English prompts.
Now, it seems that OneDrive is getting a little Copilot-based boost. Microsoft has confirmed that you can soon sic Copilot on your OneDrive files and let it do all the digging for you while you do other stuff.
Copilot can now go through your chaotic OneDrive file system for you
In a post on the Microsoft Community, the Redmond giant broke down what you can expect from Copilot integration with OneDrive. To use this feature, all you need to do is right-click a file in OneDrive via File Explorer, hover over the OneDrive entry, and then pick a Copilot feature you want to use. Here's everything Microsoft says you can do with this new tool:
Summarize: generate a concise, easy-to-understand summary of a document’s content. Perfect for when you need a quick refresher or want to decide which file to review in detail.
Create an FAQ: puts together a list of “Frequently Asked Questions” related to your document.
Ask a question: have a specific question? Just ask Copilot and it will return the answer from your file.
Compare files (File Explorer only): creates a concise table highlighting differences between multiple files (up to 5).
I'm really curious as to how that "FAQ" feature works. I guess Copilot identifies the most common elements of a document and summarizes them as if someone were asking questions about them. Or perhaps it attempts to locate parts where the document explains the reasoning behind specific choices and works from them instead. Either way, it should be interesting to try at the very least. Regardless of what you use, Microsoft says that you'll need a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family account and be an active subscriber. On top of that, you'll need to store your files in OneDrive to use these tools. Once you tick those two boxes, you can right-click a supported file type and use Copilot on it. Right now, the feature lets you use Copilot on "Microsoft 365 documents (DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, XLSX​, FLUID, LOOP​), Universal formats (PDF, TXT, RTF​), Web files (HTM, HTML​), and OpenDocument formats (ODT, ODP)," with images and videos being left out for the time being. Maybe in a future update? Here's hoping.

Yeah, privacy alarm bells ringing for personal stuff... Enterprise OneDrive users not so much, but how will the executives enjoy having corporate data exposed to AI? Employees might be taking action on data at the instruction of an LLM. Not good... Yet.
