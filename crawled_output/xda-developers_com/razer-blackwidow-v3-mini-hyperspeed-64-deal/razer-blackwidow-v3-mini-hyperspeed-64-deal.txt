If you're looking to upgrade your current keyboard, the Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini HyperSpeed is going to be one to consider. Not only are you getting something that looks good, but it also delivers an impressive typing experience as well. It's compact, feature-packed, and now down to its lowest price at just $64. It's a great keyboard, especially at its current price, delivering impressive value on a budget.
You can't go wrong with this one
You probably don't really think about it much, but a new keyboard can make a world of difference, especially if you're someone that's on their computer all day. And while there are plenty of different options, we think this one from Razer is a solid choice, especially at its current price.
You get a compact 65% form factor, but plenty of room for comfortable typing. The keyboard can be used wired or wireless, with the latter utilizing Bluetooth and can also connect using Razer's HyperSpeed technology. HyperSpeed is going to be great when you need the most responsive experience, which is an absolute must for gaming.
This particular model comes with Razer's green mechanical switches, which provide a tactile typing experience. You also get doubleshot ABS keycaps, but can always upgrade to something different if you'd like. In addition, you get customizable RGB, along with up to 200 hours of battery life. Razer also backs its product with a two-year warranty, just in case you need support.
Overall, not a bad way to spend $64 if you're looking for some new accessories for your PC. Razer has been making some pretty high-quality products for some time, and this keyboard is no exception. Grab it now for its lowest price and save big.
