While many people prefer to use wireless connections for their devices, wired connections still play a crucial role — especially when reliability is key. With a wired network, not only are you able to achieve faster speed with increased stability, but you can also power devices through the same cable, which is essential for building out a robust smart home. And if you're someone that's considering wiring up their location, that's where a solid PoE switch comes in. While there are plenty of different brands to choose from, we think Netgear offers some great solutions, with this 16-port PoE+ switch delivering everything you could want at a fair price. For a limited time, you can score a substantial discount on this model that knocks 32% off the retail price. It's an absolute must-have, so get it while you still can.
Plenty of ports, plenty of power
As far as what you get, this switch features 16 Gigabit Ethernet ports, with 183W of total power. Now, there are going to be some restrictions on the power here, with each port providing a maximum of 30W. Of course, that shouldn't be much of a problem considering that most devices won't draw that much, unless you're utilizing products that are for commercial use.
Like many of Netgear's products, this switch is simple to install and easy to use, and doesn't require any additional software. The hardware is solid, plus you also get fan-less operation, which makes the switch silent during operation. In addition to the above, Netgear throws in a three-year warranty just in case anything goes wrong. And you can also find all the fine details about the switch on Netgear's website. Overall, not a bad device to get your home lab up and running. So if you've been thinking about taking the next step and want something reliable, this Netgreat switch is going to be just the thing.
