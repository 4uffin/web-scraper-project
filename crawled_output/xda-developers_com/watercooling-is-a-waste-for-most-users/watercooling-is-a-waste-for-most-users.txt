Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
The choice between air and liquid cooling comes down to several factors. Most users pick one or the other based on esthetics or price, unless they're using the highest-end CPUs. In that case, performance is often the deciding factor. For the majority of PC users, however, air coolers are predominantly the smarter choice. Liquid cooling is not only unnecessary for most modern CPUs, but also comes with additional concerns around installation and longevity.
Most people aren't buying power-guzzling CPUs
6 cores are enough for most use cases
Some people are surprised to know that air coolers can perform as well as liquid coolers, sometimes even better. Many new PC builders assume that they need a 360mm AIO cooler for their 6-core or 8-core CPU, despite all evidence to the contrary. Today's 65W and 105W processors are small fry for even the cheapest air coolers, such as the Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 SE. Many air coolers can easily handle 200W of CPU load, making them ideal for high-end chips as well. If you're building a gaming PC, you don't need a high-end CPU anyway. Unless you have an RTX 5090 or RTX 5080, a high-end chip like the Ryzen 7 9800X3D won't make a tangible difference to your FPS. That makes high-end liquid coolers pointless for the majority of gamers. For non-gamers who aren't chasing professional-grade performance, entry-level or mid-range CPUs are the best choice. The only consumer that really needs high-performance liquid cooling is the one who's regularly pushing their top-tier chip to the limits.

Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 SE
Thermalright's Phantom Spirit 120 SE is a bigger version of its acclaimed Peerless Assassin 120 cooler. It has seven heatpipes compared to the six on the Peerless Assassin and is a bit bigger, which means better cooling capacity.

Overclocking isn't as popular anymore
No liquids necessary
Speaking of pushing one's CPU to the limit, CPU overclocking has lost its sheen. Once coveted as the ultimate tool to maximize CPU performance, it's relegated to a niche community chasing records or views. The thing is, modern CPUs are essentially factory overclocked, tuned nearly to their limits to cater to an increasingly mainstream PC market. Most people don't like to tweak their hardware to extract its true performance. Without overclocking, the need for liquid cooling has diminished significantly. The gains from overclocking have been reduced to the point that the time and effort it demands are not worth it anymore. PC users are happy with using PBO on their AMD CPU and relying on Turbo Boost on Intel chips. Stock settings with a bit of automated overclocking are something that air coolers can easily handle. They're also equipped for minor overclocks if you're curious about what your CPU is capable of.
Liquid coolers don't make sense on budget builds
Not quite the right "fit"
When we're talking about the majority, it's obvious that budget PCs constitute most of the builds in question. If a consumer is trying to maximize performance per dollar on a sub-$1,000 PC, they're probably not looking to spend a lot on cooling. This rules out expensive liquid coolers from consideration. Granted, you can get some 360mm AIO coolers for around $50, but quality air coolers are even cheaper. Budget builders are likely to stick with a CPU like the Ryzen 5 7600 or Ryzen 5 5600X. These entry-level chips don't need massive cooling hardware; a budget air cooler is more than enough. Even if they upgrade to an 8-core chip later, they won't need a new cooler. Some budget cases don't even support 360mm radiators, and instead of making do with a 240mm AIO, it's better to get a powerful air cooler instead.
Many AIOs suffer from performance or reliability issues
Not worth the hassle
You might think that you get what you pay for when buying an expensive liquid cooler. Sadly, that's not always the case. Many cheaper AIOs are known to underperform when compared to similarly priced air coolers. I've seen this in action on my Cooler Master ML240L V2 — upgrading from an air cooler to this AIO wasn't the upgrade I expected. It failed to keep my Ryzen 7 5700X below 50℃ under idle conditions. Then there are the reports of prematurely failing AIOs, where the pump fails or the liquid starts leaking. Besides being a major annoyance, such incidents threaten to kill other components inside the PC. There are multiple points of failure in a liquid cooler. If it's not the pump or the tubing, the radiator can get clogged up, especially on the cheaper models. Air coolers are simpler in construction and more reliable for long-term operation. Not all AIOs will fail, but enough do that you should consider this a downside.
Air coolers are easier to work with
Most people like to minimize the effort
Air coolers might win in the longevity department, but they're also easier to install when you first put your build together. Since you only need to install a heatsink and attach the fans to it, it's a straightforward job that barely takes any time. Installing liquid coolers isn't rocket science either, but it's more complicated for the average user, and takes more time. Plus, there's a lot more that can go wrong — you might dent the radiator fins when screwing it to the case, bend the tubes a little too much, or mess up the orientation of the radiator vis-à-vis the heatsink. This difference might not sound like a lot to the experienced builder, but it can be the deciding factor for a newbie.
Go air or go liquid — what do you choose?
If you've built multiple PCs, you have probably used both air and liquid coolers. Which one feels better over the long term? I'm curious how many people have gone back from AIOs to air coolers, especially when building a new PC. Many of us are tempted to spend a few more bucks on a liquid cooler and call it a day, but some users stick to air coolers on all their builds. For the average user, air coolers are the smarter choice, be it in terms of performance, price, convenience, or longevity.

This is part of the you get what you oay for. A cheap watercooler is actually louder than most aircoolers. You need to shell out more for a larger watercooler at which point it only matters if you have a really high end cpu and doing heavy cpu loafs

This article seems to be written by someone who has never owned a real gaming computer or seriously had a high end CPU.
Everyone knows liquid cooling is quieter and keeps temperatures more stable.
Air cooling can be more effective under a heavier load than liquid cooling, but definitely produces more heat and noise, this can be migrated by better quality fans, more fans, and a good quality PC case.
This article I didn't even finish but like I said written by a non-gamer, doubt there was mention of under-volting or over-volting the CPU which makes a world of difference in a CPU temperature.
You can under-volting your CPU & still overclock for higher GHz speeds for a higher speed with a lower average temperature & have a more stable running gaming PC at the same time preventing any sort of lag.

I beg to differ with this, I have a budget cpu (Ryzen 5 7600X) paired with an RTX 5080. And it crashed everytime I played Star Wars Battlezone II. With my budget aio (Gamdias E4 360). It doesn't anymore. And also I was able to have a higher level of PBO undervolting using Ryzen Master auto tune and a higher benchmark on Cinebench R23. Previously I was using Cooler Master AK620 dual tower and was also dead set against aio. But now I can see the difference. Full load temps never exceed 85 C (ambient ~30 C).

OK so here's the thing. I liquid cool my GPU and CPU. I have for the last 2 builds I've built for myself and liquid cooled just the CPU for 3 builds I've done for other people. With the low cost and ability to squeeze more out of chips with AIO liquid cooling I don't know why more people don't do it. But people still buy off the shelf rigs and overpay by 200% and I don't understand that either.

This is stupid, of course you should buy an AIO for a "weak" CPU, of course you should buy one for a budget build.That's just plain common sense, not something XDA should being paying a writer for in an article, just pathetic stuff

Maybe I'm one of the few but I agree with the author of this article. I once had a Raijintek Triton set on an AMD fx8320, a chip known to run hot. The water cooler needed topping up once every 6-8 months despite no visible leak was ever discovered. And to do that I had to unmount the water block from the CPU every single time. The fans were loud and their speed could not be adjusted automatically by the motherboard. In general the radiator was gathering more dust (although the fans were pushing air out of the case.and was more work to maintain.After two years I ended up replacing it with a beefy 2fan cooler from AliExpress and never looked back since. I swore never to mess with water cooling again.Maybe I was unlucky or maybe systems have improved but I'm not looking to make life more complicated than what it has to be

All about the noise. Shop for a closed system and liquid is just so quit. Simply love it on my dual processer board

Seriously. Less noise is #1. #2 is even though they may reach the same temp the arc in aio is so much slower meaning less expansion and contraction stress on the cpu. #3 cleaner more open case.. As for longevity, keep track of the stats and use a top tier paste.

And then you have to buy 3 extra fan to fill the space that the liquid cooling would have used~40$An then buy 1-2 fan splitter or a fan controller which will cost 20-30$So yeah it will cost the same as a liquid cooler 👌

There are so many reasons to use an AIO cooler over an air cooler besides cooling high end cpus or overclocking. This article is written by an author that has pretty much proven to not know what he's talking about.XDA really needs to get rid of Singh.

Omg your Ryzen 7 didn't get below 50° in idle? My 3800xt doesn't either unless it's winter and cold as hell. Might be because that's the standard idle range for those CPU's.

I thought I was being cool by running the liquid freezer III on my 7600X3D. Not only is it like, 65W or something low like that, but I had such constant stress about even running to the bathroom because of the fear of spontaneous leaks. Swapped that sucka out for an Assassin 120 I believe. Like the article states, I get better temps with the air cooler, probably (just a guess) is that my CPU probably doesn't get hot enough for the air to properly do it's job. I could be totally off base on my assumption; that's simply the most straight forward explanation that I can think of. So I have a liquid freezer III just sitting in a drawer, with nobody who needs it in my life.

There is absolutely no reason to think your AIO is going to spontaneously leak.
That’s like worrying about leaving your car idle because it might leak coolant somehow or your phone might explode while charging. Like sure, I’m sure it happens, but the chances of that are so minuscule there is no reason to worry about it.

They talk about a high end CPU not making a significant difference for gaming but say nothing about GPU where the real gaming experience and heat are produced.

Not bragging, but I went from a 3700x to a 5900XT and while the temps weren't dangerous with an air cooler, they hovered close to 90° C when doing rendering workloads.
I've tuned my rig to run the CPU and GPU at nearly 100% in those workloads and the CPU was feeling the heat.
So I bought a mid-range AIO on sale and it has really helped.
I still see temps in the low 80's, but never any throttling and the PBO boost is nice.

I would have agreed until about a month ago. Recently finished building my 5th rig; my previous 4 were air cooled and it was always a challenge getting decent temps. Large heatsinks and big fans or several of em. Let's not even mention the coil whine and overall annoying fan noise but air cooling barely gives enough headroom for overclocking even on todays ever decreasing nm... Went with a 360mm AIO for this setup and I would never go back. AIO guves much better consistency on temps. Much quieter and definitely pulls out more heat. Also it takes the heat out of your case via the radiator blowing topside and out. I've noticed a much cooler overall computer from icy memory and ssd to north bridge but most importantly it keeps my beefy 9070XT very cool. This way I don't need 7 case fans which sound like a jet engine to keep all my other components cool. Yes you can use all air today but with that being said you always could. I've had some seriously impressive CPU coolers from Noctua to be quiet but non of them come close to exfiling heat as this 360 AIO... My cpu temps under extreme use are easily 10C cooler and don't fluctuate nearly as much as with air cooling. They are not equal in any way whatsoever. If you want to air cool go ahead but not why this article is even necessary lol.
