Logitech MX Keys Mini
We loved this keyboard when we reviewed it. Not only does it have a sleek look and reliable build, but it also feels good too. The keys might not offer a lot of travel due to the design, but it's still comfortable to type on for hours on end. The keyboard also features backlit keys that react to the environment and only light up when your hands come near. Plus, you get compatibility with multiple platforms, which means it's great to use with a variety of different products.

The important thing to note with this sales promotion is that all products are new, but you will only have a 90-day warranty on most of the devices. So there is a small trade-off here with getting the discounts, but we don't think that will be a problem, considering that all the items are coming direct from Woot. You can get free shipping if you're an Amazon Prime member, or you'll pay $6. If you don't like what you get, you can always return it.
