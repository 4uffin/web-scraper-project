Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I‚Äôm 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Unlike other virtualization platforms, Proxmox is extremely versatile ‚Äì to the point where you could mold your PVE setup to your liking. With all the community scripts floating around, it‚Äôs possible to fine-tune every aspect of your Proxmox workstation ‚Äì be it the LXCs and VMs or even the host PVE instance. Plus, since it‚Äôs fairly lightweight, you could install Proxmox on practically any setup and still expect reliable performance on container-heavy workloads. All these aspects considered, I came up with a terrible shower thought: what if I tried to run Proxmox inside a container? I‚Äôve previously configured a Proxmox VM running in VirtualBox using nested virtualization, but deploying it as a containerized environment seemed even more ridiculous. Turns out, Proxmox works surprisingly well inside a container, and while it‚Äôs not the ideal way to set up a PVE node, it‚Äôs still a decent workaround if you wish to tinker with the virtualization platform without relegating a PC to it.
Setting up Dockermox
It‚Äôs fairly simple if you‚Äôre used to Docker containers
The Dockermox repository by genius developer rtedpro-cpu lies at the heart of this project. It‚Äôs something I ran into while doomscrolling on GitHub, and it makes running the Proxmox container a breeze. First, I ran the ls /dev/fuse command to confirm whether the /dev/fuse module is operational on my system, as it‚Äôs required by Dockermox. Luckily, the terminal showed /dev/fuse, and it was time to deploy the Proxmox container. Since I‚Äôd already set up Docker on my PC, I used the sudo docker run -itd --name proxmoxve --hostname pve -p 8006:8006 --privileged rtedpro/proxmox:8.4.9 command to spin up the Dockermox instance. Unlike a typical Proxmox installation, where you‚Äôll have to create a user account inside the wizard, the PVE container already ships with pre-configured user credentials. So, I logged into the web UI by typing localhost:8006 into my browser and entering root as the Username and Password.
While the overall setup was complete, I still had to set up the Network stack. Dockermox doesn‚Äôt include a network bridge by default, and I had to configure it manually. First, I ran the following command to add a custom network to my Docker setup. sudo docker network create \ --driver bridge \ --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 \ eth2 After that, I ran sudo docker network connect eth2 proxmoxve to pair the newly-created network with the containerized PVE node. Then, I headed back to the Proxmox web UI, created a Linux bridge, and hit the Apply Configuration button to make the changes permanent. With that, it was time to test whether the Proxmox container lived up to a standard bare-metal PVE node.
Virtual machines run pretty well
You‚Äôll have to configure the network settings manually
Since I was curious about how the Proxmox workstation would handle VMs, I decided to spin a couple of virtual machines. I started my tests with Fedora, and after going through the usual VM creation wizard, I used the QEMU console to access it. Although a bare-metal setup is more responsive, the containerized Proxmox setup wasn‚Äôt bad by any means. In fact, I ran three separate VMs without running into any major performance issues or crashes. The only caveat (albeit a minor one) is that I had to assign a static IP to each virtual machine. I could technically configure a DHCP server to simplify things a bit, but the lack of a dedicated network stack made the container-based Proxmox setup less beginner-friendly.
LXCs require some modifications
But they work just as smoothly
While the virtual machines worked without a lot of hassle, LXCs required some config file tweaks before I could run them. First, I had to disable the ConditionVirtualization parameter by heading to the /lib/systemd/system/lxcfs.service directory and commenting ConditionVirtualization. I also ran the systemctl daemon-reload and systemctl restart lxcfs commands to reload the lxcfs service with ConditionVirtualization disabled. Afterwards, I ran nano /var/lib/lxc/container_ID/config (where container_ID refers to the identifier used by the LXC) and added lxc.apparmor.profile=unconfined to disable AppArmor, which is known for causing issues with LXCs in this setup. The only drawback is that I‚Äôd have to run lxc-start -n container_ID every time I needed to boot an LXC. But otherwise, the performance was surprisingly decent.
How feasible is a container-based Proxmox setup?
All things considered, it‚Äôs a solid way to tinker with Proxmox. Sure, I‚Äôd always recommend going the bare-metal route whenever you can, especially since PVE requires minimal system resources. But if you‚Äôre not willing to set aside an entire PC just for Proxmox or lack the sheer specs to run PVE inside a virtual machine (it does cause a lot of processing overhead), deploying the virtualization platform as a container can help you get accustomed to it. Heck, if you‚Äôre patient enough, you can even build a decent self-hosting workstation out of your containerized Proxmox node.

I found this article rather interesting. Although I have no real need for a ProxMox box I had been considering buying an SSD and installing it just to play with it, just for the fun of it. But I didn't really want to have to boot into a dedicated installation just to muck around and kick the tires, so-to-speak. This could be some fun. Thanks for writing the article.

Embedded virtualization is fun and absolutely worth it if you don't have too much hardware to dedicate. I'm running a highly available Windows server fail over cluster inside my proxmox cluster - which can also provide a benefit because you can pair mismatched hardware through emulation. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
