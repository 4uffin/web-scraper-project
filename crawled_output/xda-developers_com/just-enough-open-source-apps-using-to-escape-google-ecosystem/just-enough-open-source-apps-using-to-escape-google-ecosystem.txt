Give me a lighthearted recap
My relationship with Google was a long one. For years, I relied on their ecosystem for everything: my emails, documents, photos, web queries, schedules, and more. It was a comfortable all-in-one solution that just worked. But the comfort came at a cost. As my workflow grew serious with confidential files, I felt a growing unease about the amount of my personal data I was handing over. So, I decided it was time for a change. I discovered the ‘just-enough’ approach: a small curated list of open-source apps that could replace Google’s services without all the unnecessary baggage.
OnlyOffice
Replaces Docs, Slides, and Sheets
After a lot of research, I settled on OnlyOffice as my open-source replacement for Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. The transition felt seamless, mainly because its interface is so familiar. If you have ever used Microsoft Office, you will feel right at home with the ribbon-based design. And mind you, it’s not a stripped-down alternative; it’s a feature-rich suite that includes everything you would expect, from robust formatting tools to complex formulas. With the recent release of version 9.0, the entire setup is even better. OnlyOffice now boasts a modern UI, has a built-in diagram viewer, extended file format compatibility with Markdown files, macros, and a more powerful PDF editor. Additionally, unlike Google Workspace apps, OnlyOffice has native apps available on all major platforms, including Linux. It supports real-time collaboration as well as a variety of plugins to add extra functionality as needed.

Bitwarden
Ditch Google Password Manager
While Google Password Manager is a convenient starting point, I quickly found its features to be too basic. It’s tied to a single browser, and its security feels minimal. I wanted something more robust and transparent, and Bitwarden provided all of that and more. First of all, Bitwarden is a cross-platform solution that has extensions for all major platforms and supports additional features when adding entries to the vault. It also lets me store more than just passwords — I can save secure notes, credit card information, and even my identity details for easy form-filling. I have tried dozens of password managers, and I keep coming back to Bitwarden for these obvious reasons.

Syncthing
Sync files between devices
When it came to replacing Google Drive, I realized I needed to rethink my approach to cloud storage entirely. I wanted a solution where I hold the keys. That’s where Syncthing comes in. Unlike Google Drive, there is no central server. Syncthing works on a peer-to-peer basis. That means my files go directly from my phone to my laptop, and so on. It’s a continuous, real-time sync that just works in the background. My data is always encrypted in transit, and since it never passes through a third-party server, it stays under my control. While I’m sold on Syncthing’s core philosophy, I’m also toying with Nextcloud. It’s a self-hosted cloud platform, and it’s a bit more of a ‘full-suite’ solution. It offers a web interface, calendar, contacts, and even a photo gallery, which Syncthing lacks.

Proton Mail and Calendar
A capable, encrypted alternative to Gmail
Finding a secure, open-source alternative for both my email and calendar felt challenging. Many solutions focus on one aspect or another, or they lack the robust features I'm accustomed to. After a lot of searching and a few false starts, I finally found the perfect answer in the unified ecosystem of Proton Mail and Calendar. The switch was surprisingly smooth. Their built-in tools made it a breeze to transfer all my old emails and calendar events, so I didn’t feel like I was starting from scratch. But the real selling point for me is the end-to-end encryption. Every single email and calendar entry is encrypted. This provides a level of peace of mind that Google’s services could never offer. The list of features includes native apps for all major platforms, on-device AI, robust organization, an intuitive UI, and more.

Mozilla Firefox
It still packs a punch in 2025
Moving my browsing from Chrome to Firefox was another easy yet significant part of my journey. It’s fast, has a clean interface, and syncs across devices. Unlike many Chromium browsers like Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, and Opera, Firefox uses its own Gecko rendering engine. Instead of Chrome’s default behavior of tracking and profiling my activity, Firefox has powerful Enhanced Tracking Protection built in. And when it comes to search, I have switched from Google to DuckDuckGo. Firefox also supports the majority of web extensions I always use on Chrome. Besides, it has a neat Reader mode that removes all the distractions on a webpage with a single click.

Goodbye, Google
Making the switch from Google’s giant ecosystem didn’t happen overnight, and it wasn’t always a flawless process. There were moments of adjustment, like getting used to a new interface or figuring out a sync solution. But looking back, every step was worth it. A few focused open-source apps have proven to be more than enough. My digital life is now more secure, more transparent, and feels truly my own. I hope this list encourages you to explore the alternatives and build a digital home that works for you, on your terms.

Check out Zen Browser, which is built on Firefox. IMO, the vertical tabs feature alone make the switch worth it!
