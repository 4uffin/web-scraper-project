Summary
Microsoft is testing a shared clipboard between Windows 11 and Android via Link to Windows.
Sync is near-instant and keyboard-agnostic (works with Gboard and Samsung's offerings), making it handy for managing passwords and contacts.
The feature is now available in the Windows 11 Dev build; a general release will follow later, after any necessary bug fixes have been implemented.
When I got both a Samsung tablet and phone, I was really surprised when I copied text on one device and it automatically beamed over to the other. It made me wish that Windows had a feature like that, where I could copy text either on my PC or my Android device and have it appear on the other. I couldn't find anything that did it automatically, so I had to settle for mirroring apps that could handle it for me. Well, it turns out that Microsoft is working on a feature that does just that. And while it's not quite ready for release just yet, it's already looking very promising.
Microsoft is working on a shared clipboard between Windows and Android
Windows Latest spotted this cool feature within the new Windows 11 Dev build. Apparently, Microsoft attempted to launch the feature last month, but an issue arose, and it was subsequently removed until the problem was resolved. Now, the shared clipboard feature has made its glorious return, and if Windows Latest's tests are anything to go by, it's already shaping up to be a killer new feature. To get the feature running, Windows Latest had to have both devices connected via the Link to Windows app. Once done, it then downloaded the new Windows 11 Dev build and enabled a new feature in the mobile devices section called "Access PC’s clipboard." Windows Latest noted that it didn't have to enable anything on the Android side. Once the feature was all set up, the tests began. According to Windows Latest, the feature appears to be already implemented and performs surprisingly well. As quoted in their article:
Next, I copied a chunk of text from a webpage, and the text immediately appeared in my Gboard keyboard on my Android phone. I tried it a bunch of times, and the sync was instantaneous. In our tests, Windows Latest noticed that the clipboard sync is not limited to any specific keyboard app. It works with the Samsung keyboard too.
That last bit is especially important to me. I think if it only worked on Microsoft's own keyboard, SwiftKey, it wouldn't have been nearly as exciting. Making the feature keyboard-agnostic was an excellent move, and now I can see a ton of people using the tool to share complex passwords, move contact details, or just send a website from one device to another. Unfortunately, although the feature appears to be largely complete, it's still in the Dev testing branch and will take some time to reach the Release channel. After all, there's always the chance that some bugs will emerge and will need squishing before it's ready to go. Until then, you can always take the manual route.

I was using that on my old Samsung S21 Ultra 4 years ago. Definitely nothing new. Extremely useful feature.
