We'll never get tired of the huge discounts that StackSocial offers on some of Microsoft's best software. Right now, you can score huge savings on Windows 11 Pro, dropping the price to its lowest yet. Although it usually comes in at $199, it can now be had for just $10, which is a whopping 95% off. Just be sure to use coupon code "UPGRADE" during the checkout process.
An unbeatable deal
While most people never need to pay for Windows, that isn't the case if you're looking to build a new PC from scratch. You'll need to make the decision of which operating system to install, and for most, Windows is going to be the best choice. It's a necessary part to get your PC up and running, and saving as much as you can is important, because it means you'll be able to put more money into other parts of your PC build.
WIndows 11 Pro isn't necessary, but we think it's worthwhile considering that it can now be had for just $10. StackSocial also sells Windows 11 Home, but you're not going to be saving any additional money by going with the standard version. When it comes to Windows 11 Pro, you'll have access to more features, like Sandbox, Hyper-V, BitLocker, Windows Information Protection, Remote Desktop, and more.
Naturally, there's more to it than that, but if you want the full rundown, we recommend checking out our full comparison of Windows 11 Pro and Windows 11 Home. Otherwise, I'd recommend grabbing this Windows 11 Pro discount while it's still live. This is going to be for a license key, which means you will need to download the software online.
It's good for one device, so feel free to use it for a desktop or laptop. Remember, you'll want to use the code "UPGRADE" to get the $10 price. Otherwise, you'll be paying $13 for the software.
