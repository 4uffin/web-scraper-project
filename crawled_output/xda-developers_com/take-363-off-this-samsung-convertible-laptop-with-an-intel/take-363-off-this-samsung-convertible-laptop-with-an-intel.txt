This laptop has everything you need, and it comes in with a substantial discount that's well below its usual retail price. Samsung is best known for its phones and TVs, but it also makes some fine computing products as well, which is why we think this laptop is a good choice for someone looking for something new.
The Galaxy Book 5 360 not only looks good, but it also packs tons of power as well. It's also quite versatile thanks to its 2-in-1 design. But, as stated before, the real attraction here is going to be its discounted price, with Amazon knocking $363 off. You can now grab it for $987, which isn't exactly cheap, but it's definitely a good price for what you're getting.
This laptop is going to be the perfect fit for most people
When it comes to performance, you're looking at a laptop that can handle pretty much anything you throw at it. The Galaxy Book 5 360 features an Intel Core 7 Ultra that's paired with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD storage. In addition, you get a large 15.6-inch AMOLED touchscreen with stylus support, and a 2-in-1 form factor that makes it highly versatile.
It comes loaded with Windows 11 and also has access to plenty of powerful AI features like Copilot. Samsung claims the battery on this laptop will last up to 31 hours, and can charge from 0% to 39% in just 30 minutes. Connectivity is also quite good, with two Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, microSD card slot, HDMI, and a 3.5mm audio jack.
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.4 are also onboard here, along with a 1080p webcam for those important videocalls. The keyboard is spacious, along with the trackpad, so typing feels comfortable even after a few hours. Again, not a bad package here for the price. This laptop will do everything you need it to, unless you're looking for something more specialized for gaming or creative tasks.
