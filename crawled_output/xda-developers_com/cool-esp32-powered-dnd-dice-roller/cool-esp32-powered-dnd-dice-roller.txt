Summary
Retro-styled ESP32 dice roller with wireframe graphics and touchscreen in a 3D-printed case.
Uses a ~$10 premade board with built-in touchscreen—no soldering required; just flash and go.
Perfect for D&D: simple build—print the case, drop in the ESP32, flash the code, tweak to taste.
Digital dice rollers are really cool. Whether you use them for accessibility reasons or you're simply tired of rolling a D20 clean off the table for the thousandth time, they're convenient to have on hand. Best of all, because they're so easy to make, you don't need to purchase one if you don't want to, which opens up possibilities of tweaking and editing it to your liking. Take, for instance, this cool retro-styled dice roller. Not only does it let you roll a die with the touch of a few buttons, but it also shows the die rolling with a cool wireframe graphic. It somewhat resembles what people in the 90s thought playing D&D would look like in 2025.
You, too, can build this cool digital dice roller for your next D&D campaign
Over on the ESP32 subreddit, user vostoklabs took the time to showcase their latest project. It's a cool dice-rolling device that combines an ESP32, a screen, and a 3D-printed enclosure to make rolling dice a breeze. Additionally, it utilizes some visually appealing wireframe graphics to showcase the dice. Take a look:
Looks cool, right? Here's how vostoklabs describes their project:
This is retro styled DnD roller, based on CYD board with integrated touchscreen and 3D printed enclosure
Project was inspired by similar thing made by "Abe's projects" but greatly simplified, instead of creating whole thing from scratch I just used 10$ premade board from AliExpress
The style is inspired by old school Elite Dangerous games
If you'd like to make it yourself, you can check out all the details over on the creator's MakerWorld page. Because the project uses a touchscreen, it means you can print out the case without worrying about having to implement physical buttons. In fact, the specific board that vostoklabs picked comes with a touchscreen by default, so you don't even need to attach one manually. Plus, the instructions state that you don't need to solder anything if you don't want to, which is always good news. Other than that, it looks like the instructions are pretty simple: print the case, put the ESP32 board inside the case, flash the memory with the software, and you're good to go. If you'd like to make a dice spinner without all the electronic bits, you can 3D print one. We previously covered this excellent 3D-printed dice wheel that doesn't use any wires to work, which is really cool.
