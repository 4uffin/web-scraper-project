Summary
Judge rules Google can keep Chrome to avoid disrupting users and the Chromium ecosystem.
Google can't force pre-installing apps like the Play Store, Search, Chrome, Assistant, or Gemini on new Android phones.
Google must share search index data and user metrics with qualified rivals.
A year ago, Google came under fire after a judge ruled that it was holding a monopoly. While that was the easy part, the hard bit came next: how do you "de-monopolise" Google? The judge had a few ideas as to how it could cut up its iron grip on the market to make things fairer for its competitors, and as you might imagine, Google wasn't a big fan. The most interesting proposal the judge made was that
Google had to sell Chrome to another company. As you might imagine, there were
plenty of interested buyers for Chrome, but Google upheld that
nobody could maintain the browser like it could. Well, it seems that the judge has agreed, as Google was allowed to keep Chrome; however, while Google won a big victory for keeping its primary assets, it does have to make some concessions.
Google Chrome will stay in Alphabet's clutch, rules judge
As reported by Ars Technica, Google put on a stalwart defense to keep Chrome. It argued that, while handing over the reins to Chrome to another company would definitely reduce its monopoly on the market, it would spell disaster for the people who use it. After all, there are a ton of different technologies tied to Chrome that Google runs, and these would have to be pried off and replaced should another company take it. Well, it seems the judge agreed with Google, as it ruled that Chrome would stay with Google. This is obviously fantastic news for Google, but it's also a relief for people who rely on Chrome or Chromium browsers and don't want to see their daily driver get hollowed out as it's passed over to a third party. Unfortunately for the tech giant, it didn't escape entirely unscathed. However, it did have a say on what it gave up, so it's a half-loss in a way. To start, if a company wanted to release an Android phone, Google is not allowed to force them to pre-install any of its own apps on the device, such as the Play Store, Search, Chrome, Google Assistant, or Gemini. The company can still install them if it believes that it'll enhance its users' experience, but it's no longer essential. Also, rival search engine owners will be pleased to hear that Google must surrender "search index data and user metrics" to "qualified competitors." Whether or not this causes people to leave Google for other search engines is yet to be seen, but it's still a huge boon for services such as Bing and DuckDuckGo to peek into the inner workings of the search giant. Assuming it doesn't ask for a pause, Google has 60 days to implement the changes, and a committee will spend six years keeping an eye on Alphabet to ensure it does what it was told. As such, it'll be a while until we see Android phones without Gemini or improvements to rival search engines, but they will becoming. And, most importantly, Chrome isn't going anywhere.

Right, now can we PLEASE go after Microsoft next? Somebody has to stop them from this complete strangle-hold on the OS market. Forcing Edge, CoPilot and all the other 'gumf' upon us. Let us out. Remember the 90's they got done for shipping Internet Explorer with Windows? Can't we go back to that mindset?
