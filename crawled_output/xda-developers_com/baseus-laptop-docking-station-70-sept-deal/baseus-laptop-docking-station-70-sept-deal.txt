A docking station is one of the best upgrades for a laptop. It brings a wealth of additional ports, and makes connecting external devices easier. While there are a lot of different options, we think this one from Baseus is a must-have, thanks to its ultra-compact size and newly discounted price. For a limited time, you can save 30% off, bringing it down to one of its best prices at $70.
An accessory that goes a long way

Sometimes docking stations can be a bit clunky, but this one from Baseus is quite sleek, easily slipping under your laptop to provide a seamless way to connect all your accessories. Not only does it feature a ton of ports, but it also provides 100W of PD charging, and the ability to output to additional monitors if needed. When it comes to ports, you're looking at three USB-A, one USB-C, Ethernet, HDMI, DisplayPort, microSD and SD card readers, 3.5mm audio jack, and a 100W USB-C charging port. As mentioned before, you can connect additional monitors to this dock, with support for up to three at a time and up to 4K.
And while this is the perfect accessory for laptops, it can also be used with tablets, PCs, smartphones, and even PC gaming handhelds as well. It's one of those accessories that really makes life a lot easier, and it doesn't cost all that much when compared to similar models. Grab it now for its discounted price from Amazon.
