Summary
Walmart's GeForce Week drops RTX 50 cards to MSRP or lower, RTX 5090 at $1,999.
Some models are under MSRP—PNY RTX 5080 OC $929, RTX 5070 down to $499; sale ends this week.
That said, reviews are lukewarm—consider holding out for better deals or alternative GPUs.
For months now, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series has very rarely sold for the price Nvidia recommended they sell for, due to people snapping them up. Fortunately, if you've been wanting to grab an RTX 50 series GPU but didn't feel like overpaying for one, now's your chance. Walmart is holding a GeForce Week sale where the RTX 50 series has been reduced to their MSRPs or lower, which is a peculiar way to hold a "sale," but hey, it works for me.
Walmart's GeForce Week sale knocks the RTX 50 series down to MSRP or lower
You can see for yourself over on the Walmart GeForce Week page (thanks for the spot, Windows Central!). If you click that link, then scroll down a bit, you should see all the RTX 50s lined up and ready to go. The real eye-catcher here is the mighty RTX 5090 selling for its recommended retail price of $1,999. It wasn't that long ago that we saw scalpers push the price up to $9,000, so it's good to see that the market has cooled down around these GPUs. If you take a closer look, you'll notice that some GPUs are actually slightly lower than their MSRP values. For example, the PNY GeForce RTX 5080 OC comes in at $929, which is $70 less than its $999 recommended price. The RTX 5070 is down from $549 to $499, and the MSI Shadow variant fell from $639 to $549. That's far more digestible than how the prices looked at the start of this year, and people were snapping them up en masse. However, the sale is only for the rest of this week, so don't dawdle. So, the next question is: should you actually grab one? After all, you shouldn't buy sub-par hardware, even if it's on sale. Well, it seems that the writers here at XDA aren't too big fans of the RTX 50 series, so perhaps it's worth holding on for a bigger deal. Here are some of the things our writers have said about the series:
