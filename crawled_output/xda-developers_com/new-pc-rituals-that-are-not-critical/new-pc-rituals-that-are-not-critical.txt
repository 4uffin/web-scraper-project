Relax — these new PC rituals aren't critical

Published Sep 1, 2025
After a 7-year corporate stint, Tanveer found his love for writing and tech too much to resist. An MBA in Marketing and the owner of a PC building business, he writes on PC hardware, technology, and Windows. When not scouring the web for ideas, he can be found building PCs, watching anime, or playing Smash Karts on his RTX 3080 (sigh).

Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Building a PC and acing the first boot doesn't mean you've conquered the challenge. There are many things you need to do after the build to ensure you're getting the most out of your brand-new hardware. However, many first-time builders and even experienced ones make things needlessly complicated, forcing stuff on themselves that is all but optional. You don't have to listen to every single tech tip out there before giving yourself permission to enjoy your new rig. So, relax a bit and try to skip the following steps the next time you build a PC.
Award-winning cable management
You don't need to be a ninja!
A bit of cable management is necessary to avoid hotspots, dust deposits, and a bad-looking PC. However, you don't need to take things to the extreme and punish yourself for doing a less-than-perfect job at it. Yes, top-tier cable management always looks better, but most people shouldn't waste hours painstakingly routing every single stray cable and neatly tying everything with a bow on top. All you really need to do is ensure you don't force cables that are at risk of breaking, plan ahead instead of starting everything after installing the hardware, and use some of the cable management features your case manufacturer has conveniently provided. A single bundle of cables hiding away in your PSU shroud or jammed against your side panel won't be the end of the world. Diagnosing your PC gets easier the better your cable management is, but you won't have to do it often if you've built your machine right in the first place.
Running countless benchmarks
There's no end to it
Benchmarks help you ascertain the stability of your new PC and measure its performance against similar hardware by comparing it with other users' scores. That said, I've built many PCs where I never ran a single benchmark — not unless I had something specific in mind months later. Unless you're an enthusiast or PC content creator who needs the data, you can skip benchmarking altogether. If you really want the peace of mind that your CPU and GPU are not underperforming relative to similar models, go ahead and run Cinebench 2024 and some 3DMark tests. Don't get lost in the maze of PC stress tests, though; instead, enjoy your new build for gaming or whatever you built it for. PC users are notoriously obsessed with numbers, but the average user should just focus on buying the right hardware, assembling it the right way, and using the PC to the fullest.
Reducing idle CPU temps
Modern chips like it hot
While you might want your CPU running as cool as possible, higher-than-expected idle temps might just be in-spec behavior. Modern processors are designed to boost as high as possible, which directly contributes to higher power consumption and temperatures than you might be used to. While this is ideal under load, such as during gaming, it can be a source of concern when your system is relatively idle. On a new build, you have to set custom fan curves and ensure your cooler heatsink is installed correctly, but beyond that, you shouldn't stress over high idle CPU temperatures. Factors like ambient temperature, case airflow, thermal paste, and BIOS settings can impact your CPU's idle temps. And while you can control most of these factors, you'll have to make peace with your CPU temps at some point. Don't worry, though — unless your CPU is overheating, high temperatures are perfectly fine.
Obsessing over in-game graphics settings
Graphics presets are enough for most gamers
One of the great things about PC gaming is that the granular control over graphics settings allows you to strike the desired balance between performance and visuals. That said, this freedom can go against you if you spend hours tweaking every single setting, trying to reach that magic combination to maximize your gaming experience. Most gamers don't need to mess around with in-game settings as much as they think — graphics presets are all you need. Depending on your PC's capabilities, one of the presets, i.e., Ultra, High, Medium, or Low, will work for you. You shouldn't have to become a trial-and-error expert, or even refer to "optimized settings," to ensure you can play at 60+ FPS. If you enjoy the process, then go for it, but don't feel like you're obligated to do it just because you're playing on a PC and not a console.
Overclocking your CPU and GPU
Your hardware probably doesn't need it
There was a time when overclocking was all but essential if you wanted to run your CPU and GPU at their maximum potential. Today, however, overclocking isn't as relevant as it used to be. Manufacturers have been increasingly targeting the mainstream market for the last few years, which incentivizes them to offer the highest out-of-the-box performance they can. This is why most modern components run at their limits, with overclocking yielding negligible real-world gains. If your workload benefits from a minor frequency bump, overclocking might still be worth the effort. However, most people would benefit more from undervolting than overclocking. The latter has become even more of a niche today than it used to be. You often sacrifice power efficiency for an insignificant performance boost, wasting time and effort that could have gone into enjoying your modern hardware. Overclocking your old GPU or CPU to extend its lifespan is one thing; obsessing over pushing your new hardware is another.
Don't fall prey to peer pressure
The PC community can come across as pushy and unreasonable when recommending "must-try" tips to newcomers. You shouldn't feel compelled to take everything seriously, though. Once you've bought the components after sufficient research, and done a good job of building your PC, there aren't many strict DOs and DON'Ts to this game. Besides optimizing your BIOS at a basic level, and debloating Windows to remove performance bottlenecks, you don't need much else to enjoy your brand-new machine.

Overclocking GPU’s is so pointless nowadays. The margin for improvement is so slim that its not even worth it. With modern games being so unoptimized, unstable, and the market so saturated with “Early Access” games, potentially further decreasing stability sounds silly to me.

Agreed. Nowadays, save the overclocking for the end of the machine's life, to squeeze a bit more usability out of it before needing to replace it.

As long as the cables don't impede airflow I couldn't care less. My PC sits under my table and I can't see inside. Perfect for having less stress to worry about things that aren't important anyway.

Airflow restrictions was really an issue back in the ATA "strap" days where those cables were so wide, movement of air was restricted. Look at the cables these days, by comparison, they are pieces of "threads" and really pose no air flowing issue. And I know there are those who want to prove me wrong and show us your lousy1 to 2 degree difference, haha...let the mental anguish and sleepless nights for that minimal temp difference bother you to death. Not all of us have glass casings and like to show off electronics and lights. Once the cover goes on, its never to be seen for a very long time.

This was tested and it didnt even have 1 degree difference...when they filled the whole case with random wires then it affected few degrees...and you are right its the IDE cable what was solething else..i had forgotten those already :DI remember doing cable management with ide drives and i put thw wires so tightly and they broke 🤣

Airflow was never really a big deal back then, I don't remember anyone shouting it from the rooftops, like they do today. There was no cable management back in the IDE days. The IDE cables were too wide and awkward to do anything with (except for 1 set I purchased that were round and made out of silicone. They were also UV reactive like the rest of modding components back then). The PSU cables were so short that you had to go diagonal over the top of your motherboard to reach you floppy and hard drives. Also, I don't remember a single case back then accommodating for any sort of cable management.

The theme here is "be lazy".
Anyone who openly discourages good cable management shouldn't be allowed to use electricty.

All the kids love pretty colors and cable care.
Some guys amongst us want nothing but a capable PC that doesn't look like a 3rd of the cost was spent on esthetics.
You keep your eye candy, we want the protein.

Cable management becomes important when you need to add or remove components later on. If you have to unplug everything to get a new card into its slot then you perhaps should have done a better job to start with. This is probably less important in a PC build than it is in a network cabinet, where poor cable management can make it very difficult to swap out an end of life device without disconnecting everything else - which means you get a bigger outage than you would otherwise. The biggest problem comes from ad-hoc patching by people who only think of how to get their one user connected at their new desk rather than looking at the big picture and future proofing.
