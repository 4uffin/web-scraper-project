4 AM4 parts I'll upgrade before going to AM5

AMD's masterstroke of the AM4 platform has served the PC gaming enthusiast community with reliable performance that's also appreciated for productivity workloads over Intel's solutions from the same timeframe. Besides the inconvenience of factoring in the cost of a new motherboard with every CPU upgrade, Intel buyers also put up with poor thermal management and a host of other issues in recent years. If you're still on AM4, you made the smart bet. All that stands between your Ryzen 1000 series CPU from 2017 and a shiny new 5000 series is a BIOS update if it fits your budget. This long-term support builds loyalty, and frankly, it’s a level of respect for the customer’s wallet that is all too rare in the tech world. Sure, you can jump right to AM5, waving its shiny DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 support in our faces. But if you're strapped for cash, AM4 is far from dead. To me, it represents one of the single greatest value propositions in PC building today, just shy of rugged PSUs. If you're willing to upgrade gradually and stay on AM4, there are four components to max out your build for the next five years of 1440p gaming and all the productivity you'd need.
A new CPU goes a long way
The King of the Hill
Addressing the elephant in the room, yes, this is the singular most important upgrade on your AM4 machine if you want to weed out bottlenecks when swapping out other parts in the years to come. The AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D packs the singular most important feature that can level up your gaming experience—3D V-Cache. AMD's engineers figured out how to stack a whopping 64MB of L3 cache on top of the existing 32MB, for a total of 96MB of L3 cache. Games absolutely adore cache. It’s like giving a librarian a photographic memory. This feature gives the CPU instant access to data that directly reduces latency and boosts frame rates in a way that raw clock speed alone simply can't. Even today, it trades blows with much newer and more expensive AM5 and Intel CPUs, especially at 1080p and 1440p where the CPU is more likely to be the limiting factor. If you're coming from an older Ryzen 1000, 2000, or even 3000 series CPU, the difference will be transformative. Your minimum frame rates, which are arguably more important for a smooth experience than your maximums, will shoot through the roof. It’s a drop-in upgrade that delivers next-gen performance. The only real catch is that it runs a bit toasty and doesn't come with a cooler, but we'll get to that lower down in this list. If the 5800X3D is a bit overkill for the applications you have in mind, its slightly younger sibling, the Ryzen 7 5700X3D, offers about 90-95% of the same performance for a decent chunk less cash, making it a fantastic alternative in some markets.
Nothing uplifts gaming performance like a GPU
More frames for every game
A god-tier CPU is wasted if your GPU is still struggling to draw the pixels. With the 5800X3D handling the heavy lifting on the processing side, you’ve got a lot of headroom to slot in a powerful new graphics card. The GPU market is a wild place, but for our goal of high-refresh-rate 1080p or solid 60+ FPS 1440p gaming, the sweet spot is in the mid-range. You don’t need to sell a kidney for a flagship card to get a fantastic experience. What you choose will depend heavily on your budget and brand preference, but there are some clear winners. From Nvidia camp, something like an RTX 4060 or RTX 4060 Ti offers a great blend of raw performance, excellent power efficiency, and access to industry-leading features like DLSS 3 Frame Generation, which can be a tremendous boon in demanding titles. If you’re on Team Red, AMD’s Radeon RX 7700 XT or RX 7800 XT are absolute powerhouses for traditional rasterisation performance, often offering more VRAM and raw horsepower for your dollar than their Nvidia counterparts. For 1440p gaming, the 7800 XT is a monster. Don't be afraid to look at the used market, either. A well-cared-for RTX 3070 or RX 6800 can be a steal and will pair beautifully with a new CPU.
Keep it chill with a good cooler
Great for summer vacation gaming
It's an unfortunate shame that school and college-goers get the major chunk of their free time in the summer when it is too hot to do much outdoors. However, ambient temperatures can be unkind to your gaming PC as well. If that's the case or if you're set to upgrade to the 5800X3D, the stock cooler you’ve been using since 2018 won't cut it. For that gaming CPU, the extra layer of cache on the chip acts as a tiny insulator, making it a bit harder to dissipate heat. Any cooler you use will technically work, but it won't be as efficient as your needs demand, so your PC will experience thermal throttling, and you'll leave a ton of performance on the table. The remedy isn't a complex custom water loop, though. I'd argue that one of the best-kept secrets in PC building right now is that high-end air cooling is back with a vengeance. A Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 and its slightly beefier sibling, the Phantom Spirit 120 are dual-tower air coolers that blow the competition out of the water for just about $40. They offer performance that rivals or even beats coolers costing two or three times as much, including many 240mm AIO liquid coolers. With a design featuring multiple heat pipes and a large fin stack, they are more than capable of taming the 5800X3D at full boost provided your case has adequate filtration in a low-dust environment.
Justify that one upgrade
Aesthetics matter too
Speaking of cases, its an upgrade that's way down the pecking order. Desktop users quickly realize they'll repeatedly build in the same case, and a good one with clean edges and the right features makes the experience joyful. If you don't need additional performance on AM4, a new PC case might be a massive quality-of-life and performance improvement you need. Modern cases are designed with airflow in mind. Models like the Corsair 4000D Airflow or the Fractal Design Pop Air allow multiple intake fans to pull in a huge volume of cool, fresh air directly over your components, which is then exhausted out the back and top. Beyond airflow, you'll also get modern conveniences like better cable management options, proper dust filters, and a front I/O panel that has the ports you need, like USB-C. It’s the finishing touch that makes your old reliable PC feel brand new.
No, I left RAM out intentionally
You might be wondering why I haven't mentioned a memory upgrade. It's simple: AM4 is a DDR4 platform, and still more than fast enough for a high-end gaming rig. If you're currently running only 16GB, a simple upgrade to a 32GB kit is a cheap and effective way to improve performance in productivity tasks and some memory-hungry games. You could also look into a kit with the same capacity but tighter timings for a small, but measurable, performance bump. For most people, though, if you have 16GB of decent-speed RAM, you're probably fine, and the selection is greatly CPU-dependent anyway. AMD's AM4 platform is a testament to good engineering and a consumer-friendly mindset. You don’t need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. A few high-impact upgrades can unlock superior performance with minimal damage to your pocket for several years to come.

Equating the 4060 ti with the 7800 xt is crazy.

My 5600G and 32GB RAM does everything I need (non-gaming). When it starts to get laggy like my old six core Phenom did and my quad core Athlon before it, I'll just put in a 5700G. And then a 5900 (plus basic graphics card). And then a 5950. By then it will be so old that it will be dirt cheap and I will have retired anyway.

Those G CPUs are impressive I built a family member something cheap with a 4600g and they seem happy.. not a massive gamer though more of a 90s retro shooter come games.AMD has always been fantastic, I ran my Phenom9850 from 2009 to about 2018 before I built my first AM4. It saw a good number of video cards and was still solid late 2017 paired with my old 960GTX 4GB.Newer games demanded newer CPUs so I finally upgraded skipping AM3 completely. If I can skip AM5 I would be very impressed but I try not to think that far ahead lol.

This is really out of touch with reality. If you're going to spend the money on a 5800X3D, you might as well move to AM5 and get a 9600x. You can get a b650 for under $150 and a 9600x for $204 on Newegg, and you can find a 32gb DDR5 kit for $100. That's $450, which is probably close to what you'll pay for a 5800X3D since they're discontinued. Also, it really depends on your AM4 motherboard, if you've got an A320 or B450, I would not put a 5800X3D in there. The VRMs alone would hold it back. XDA really needs to hire someone who knows this stuff.

Ok but the 5800x3d is £260 drop in upgrade Vs approx double at least if you go to the new platform And the VRMs are probably fine unless you bought the cheapest of the cheap motherboards, if you bought with an eye on the future you'd have researched a Hardware Unboxed video or 2 where the do extensive VRM testing. If you didn't do any research you can at least see if they tested your board and if it was any good 👍

I can't make my 5950 any better.
A 5950x on MSIx570 with 7900xtx 24gb gpu and 128gb ram @ 3600 and 4.5tb nvme m2 @ 7000mb.
Stuffed in a corsair 6500D, with a corsair 360 titan AIO and a SB AE7 sound card.

I'm not one of those rich people that can afford to buy the latest computer parts for my rig. Needless to say I'm still rocking my new am4 based computer and do not intend to upgrade to am5 any time soon. Heck I JUST got upgraded to am4 6 months ago. The only upgrade I'll be thinking about in the near future is an affordable cpu. Maybe one of amds 3d cpus.

I upgraded last month to AM4, from AM2+ (which I built over 10 years ago). So no AM5 for me neither lol.

this article is crazy, the 5800x3d is discontinued its not easy to get and not cheap...7800x3d is the exact same msrp and you can get bundles for so cheap i got mine for 450 with 32gb of ram and a mobo, we got a 13% increase in performance with my old 3080
even crazier is the suggestion to upgrade your ram or cooler...those components are cheap enough you can get a decent one the first time you dont have to waste money on a new case or AIO if you made the proper choice not everyone knows how to build or upgrade a pc but this article is a joke. Do your research before you buy and if you cant learn what to do talk to professionals they will help with builds for free instead of talking about upgrading from ryzen 1000 or 2000if you didnt hop on the 3000 series when 5000 came out or the 5000 series when 7000 came out you wasted your money, wasted your power bill and lost efficiency for roughly the same price wow

I chuckled as well when I saw 5800X3d in here and it's not even an active CPU. Although I got the 5700X3d and it's been great. This article is just another nothing post by something not knowing much but receycling stuff they read.

AM5 is a complete waste of time and space for most users. The lack of performance advancement was embarrassing for AMD, and I say that as a fan (5700 + 9070)...

John Same I got my 5700x3d last December and it's been awesome. My only regret is not getting it sooner the price was always fair.5800x3d was a tad more expensive and eventually went out of stock, I grabbed my 5700x3d for $200 Black Friday and then watched the price hike up to about $270.If I had waited 1 month longer I would of been paying a lot more for the 5700x3d. Paired with my 3070 I am happy playing most new games in 1440p.I wish I had grabbed a 2nd as a backup or for my 2nd rig but oh well. I will upgrade to AM5 when I can't play anything new.

Tesseract I have heard that quite a bit. That and also the AM5 RAM for some users isn't as great as expected.One guy on Reddit said he was pretty let down after going fromnl his 5800x or whatever to AM5 7800x3d iirc. Not sure what he was playing or doing but he mentioned more then once he expected more.. idk I went from AM2 to AM4 in 2018 and yeah it was pretty noticeable lol.7+ years later and AM4 is still going strong. I feel like game developers will really have to think of something wild to deem us obsolete, or coerce with the CPU makers to get rid of us one day before 2030 rolls around lol.

I recently upgraded to a 5800XT which comes with its own cooler. The performance upgrade over my old 3600 is insane, double the performance in synthetic benchmarks. And I can play Hogwarts Legacy at Ultra settings now. I think this is now good to last another 5 years. The only limiting feature is my 3060...but I'll wait a few more years before upgrading that. For now, this combo along with 32gb RAM is working really well.

How long ago was this written? 5800x3ds are now very expensive as are 5700x3ds ....... So other 5 series processors are a better shout on a budget now, but it is still true how much better for gaming they are. My biggest question is why are you talking about 4060ti's and 7700xts when the newer 9060s and 5060s are better cards ....specially on AMDvside were Ray tracing performanceand FSR4 upscaling got massive upgrades.....

For the people reading it.. only the motherboard and processor make it AM4.. an argument could be made for ddr4, but that can be used with other sockets too.. did AI write this?
