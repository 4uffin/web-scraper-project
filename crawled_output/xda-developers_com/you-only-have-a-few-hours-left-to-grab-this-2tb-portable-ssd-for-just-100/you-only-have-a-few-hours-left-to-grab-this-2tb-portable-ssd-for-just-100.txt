Lexar is pretty well-known and trusted brand, which makes this promotion even better. B&H Photo Video is now offering a discount on SSD which brings it down to just $100 for the next few hours. A special $20 discount will be automatically applied to the cart, so be quick, and save big.

This is one of those drives that gets the job done and doesn't cost a lot of money, making it a no-brainer to pick up if you've been looking to get some affordable portable storage. The drive is relatively compact, while also having a ton of storage, coming in at 2TB. For most people, this is going to be enough to back up most of the important data you have.
If it isn't, it might be a good idea to grab a few more of these drives or just step up to NAS. When it comes to performance, you're looking at sequential read speeds of up to 1,050MB/s, along with sequential write speeds of up to 1,000MB/s. You also get 256-bit AES encryption, which can keep your files secure if needed.
The portable SSD is also durable, with the ability to survive drops up to 6.6 feet, and Lexar also packs its own Recovery Tool, which can help you retrieve deleted files. Overall, the Lexar SL300 portable SSD is an alluring product at this newly discounted price. But, as mentioned before, the deal's only on for a few more hours, so be quick.
