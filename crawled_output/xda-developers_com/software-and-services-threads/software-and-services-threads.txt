Beeper is still the best thing to happen to messaging apps
It's been well over a year now since I first wrote about Beeper and how much I loved it. Seeing as we've never covered it again, you might think that was something of a fluff piece, but make no mistake: Beeper has been an absolutely consistent presence on every device I use.
Beeper does require a level of trust, as you're technically signing into various messaging services on a remote device that isn't yours, but honestly, I've just been loving the convenience so much.¬† All of my messaging apps now live under one roof, so whether it's SMS, Facebook Messenger, Discord, or Telegram, I can use it all in one place, and it's so convenient.
The only downside is Facebook Messenger continues to be annoying and randomly disconnecting once every week or so, forcing me to login again. WhatsApp also disconnected me at first, but it only requires me to keep the app installed in order to prevent that from happening. That's not enough for Messenger, and I can only hope a fix will come at some point

I finally updated my Immich storage configuration
For the past few weeks, my self-hosted Immich server has been blocked from upgrading due to requiring changes to my storage configuration. For whatever reason, the project has made it so that your immich files need to be stored in regular folders rather than dedicated datasets for each type of data, which I don't really get.
This was quite annoying, too, because the warnings in TrueNAS did a terrible job at providing guidance on how to move my existing data to the new format, so I was experimenting for a bit and it wouldn't work. Thankfully, I found a proper guide last night and was able to follow the steps to make everything work correctly. It feels nice to finally have my NAS and its apps up to date. Did you have any trouble migrating your Immich storage?

Do you use any MCP servers?
I've been doing a bit of a deep dive into MCP, and the entire ecosystem is absolutely fascinating. There's an MCP server for practically every service out there, and I've come across them for Windows 11, Spotify, Docker, and so many other services. Are you using any?

Despite running dozens of containers, I refuse to self-host my own email server
I've been self-hosting services on local hardware for a long time, and have built an empire of containerized applications. However, the thought of deploying my own email server scares me. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind setting up DNS records, SSL encryption certificates, reverse DNS, and all the other grand-sounding components required for this project. But putting all that effort into an email server, only for other clients to report my emails as spam, makes it hard to justify spending hours behind a self-hosted mailing setup.

What LLMs do you self host?
I've been self-hosting a lot over the past couple of years, and I've experimented with self-hosted LLMs a lot. I played with some of the earliest Gemma models, Llama models, and anything I could get my hands on on Hugging Face. Nowadays, I have Gemma 27B IT QAT and Qwen 2.5 coder on my 7900 XTX, but I'm looking to see if there's anything I could better fit into my local processing pipelines. What are you running?

Microsoft already has the best handheld OS, if they're brave enough
Years ago, Microsoft had the perfect UI for gaming on handheld-sized screens: Windows Phone. Maybe the kernel of that isn't powerful enough. Still, using either the Windows Phone tile UI or that of the Start menu from Windows 8, Microsoft could turn the subpar Windows gaming handheld experience into something special. Something that isn't quite Windows, Xbox, or copying SteamOS, but a distinct visual identity that would stand out. We know they won't do that because AI is king and everything else is a secondary concern, so I fully expect the Xbox handheld to have an always-on Copilot to help you navigate when the touchscreen becomes unwieldy.

Home labbers out there, what's your favorite server management utility?
When I first ventured into the world of home labs with Proxmox, the PVE web UI was more than sufficient for my workloads. But now that I've got multiple devices running all sorts of¬†bare-metal Linux distros, virtualization platforms, and container-oriented distros, I've started using server management tools to manage my tinkering workflow. Cockpit is currently my favorite of the bunch, as it not only lets me manage my host machines, but it's also great for overseeing my arsenal of virtual machines and Podman containers. But that's just me. How do you manage your servers?

Container sprawl is real
As someone with a few Proxmox hosts at this point, I've realized that container sprawl is becoming a really big issue for me. I have containers I moved from one host to another yet the original still lies dormant on the host I started with, and I have services I've moved to OPNsense and the like still hanging on with the last few threads of life as I haven't completely finished migrating it yet. I have far too many self-hosted services, and I need to start cutting back.
I probably need to start tagging and organizing things effectively, but how do you keep your containers under control?

üìÖOn this day in 2022, Apple premiered iCal
Okay, launching a calendar app isn't a huge deal, but what's important here is how Apple premiered it and what resulted. I know, that's a little cryptic, but what if I said¬†üåéüòèüìÖüéâü•≥üéâü•≥üéâ? Yes, it's World Emoji Day, and it's on July 17 because Apple set the calendar emoji on its devices to display July 17 as a little easter egg for eagle-eyed fans. That's also why the iCal icon shows that date until you open it from the dock: Apple loves little nods to times or dates when things were launched. Like how 9:42 am is also commonly depicted as the time in Apple ads, because that's (or close enough to) the time Steve Jobs announced the first iPhone at MacWorld 2007. Anyway, Happy Emoji Day!

Are you still using Plex in 2025?
I used Plex for years before finally switching to Jellyfin. It wasn't an easy move since I loved using Plex and had a well-established library of movies, shows, and music. However, it had to be done due to the implosion of free streaming and other changes that only served to bloat Plex for me. I understand many others appreciate the direction the team is taking Plex, but it just wasn't for me. That's where Jellyfin came into play, effectively replacing Plex as my media cataloging and streaming platform. So, I'm curious, are you still using Plex in 2025?

What's the weakest device in your home lab?
Home labs are flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of devices, some less computationally powerful than others. While home labbers such as yours truly love to boast about the server rigs in our arsenal, we've all got some underpowered devices that perform their niche roles. If you discount all the ESP32 and Arduino microcontrollers strewn across my room, the original Raspberry Pi Zero is the least powerful system in my home lab.
However, it's still an essential part of my setup, as it houses my Pi-hole instance. Apart from that, I've got a couple of N100 systems, which double as amazing firewalls, monitoring stations, and backup solutions, especially since I don't want to host these mission-critical services on my primary experimentation server. But that's just me. What's the weakest system in your home lab?

Proxmox: Docker, LXC, or VM?
Which do you prefer to run all your software, and why? I usually go for LXC, if possible, falling back to Docker within an LXC, and then finally a VM if I require specific features or advantages offered by the virtual environment.

What software do you always open at boot?
There are those apps we always rely on when turning on our system. This could be Slack or Teams for work and Discord or TeamSpeak for keeping up with friends in the latest MMORPG. What are some of the apps you always configure to start at boot or open manually once logged in?

Moving my self-hosted empire to Proxmox was a breeze
Proxmox has received much-deserved praise from us here at XDA, and I managed to see it in action by moving everything I self-host to a single Proxmox instance on some server hardware. The process was streamlined, and everything went according to plan, replacing TrueNAS as a foundation for running everything to multiple Docker LXCs and virtual machines running in tandem with TrueNAS storage off to the side.

Go opt-out of Plex selling your user data
Plex has been steadily making it a service I no longer want to use, but one thing annoys me more than the in-app changes. That's opting you into all kinds of sales of your user behavior data to third parties, and that's not okay. Head over to the¬†Plex Vendors¬†page and see how many things you're signed up for without your consent. The only right choice on this page is to¬†opt out¬†of everything, and hope that Plex gets the message when we all say no to selling user data. When you're done, go check out Jellyfin or OpenMediaVault instead.

I set up Pi-hole on my NAS, but it's causing some issues
Now that things have calmed down in my self-hosting adventures and I have all the services I wanted, I've started experiementing a bit more, and last weekend, I decided to deploy Pi-hole on my NAS to filter out ads across the network. For the most part, it's been very helpful, but I've noticed a couple of issues.
It seems like Pi-hole and Tailscale don't play nicely together, so if I turn on Tailscale, a lot of pages would fail to load initially. Thankfully, i fixed this by disabling the option to use Tailscale DNS settings in my client apps. But one thing I still can't do is sign into my Immich account using the custom domain I created. This always worked before I set up Pi-hole, but I'm not sure why this problem would appear now. Have you experienced similar issues? What's the solution?

Building a PXE boot server is the most underrated use case for old PCs
From testing obscure Linux distributions to assembling a file-sharing server, there's a lot you can do with a spare PC. But if you're a hardcore home labber, you can stop your old computing partner from gathering dust by turning it into a PXE boot server. For the uninitiated, a PXE server acts as a repository of ISO files, allowing the rest of the devices in your home lab to access them over the network. All you have to do is add the ISO files for your favorite operating systems to the PXE server, enable IPv4/IPv6 PXE Support in the BIOS of your home lab devices, and viola; your PC will display a catalog of OS images to boot from. If you're as tired of fiddling with bootable drives as I am, you'll love the convenience of a PXE server.

What's your preferred method of self-hosting services?
Although Docker containers are the most common way to deploy useful apps and services on local hardware, there are plenty of other options in the home lab ecosystem. If you're a casual user who's not fond of working with long terminal commands, Runtipi, CasaOS, UmbrelOS, YunoHost, FreedomBox, and other containerization platforms are more than enough to satisfy your self-hosting needs.
On the flip side, you've got Containerd, Podman, and other container runtimes that, despite requiring a little more skill than Docker, bring their own set of useful features to the table. Running LXCs on Proxmox is also a thing, and you'll be surprised by the sheer number of TurnKey templates available for these containers.

I still don't see the appeal for Opera GX
It's not Opera, at least what I know Opera to be. It was a funky browser with weird standards support, and I loved using it, but since switching to Blink, it's yet another Chromium-based browser that isn't Chrome. Throw in the needless features, and I really struggle to see what the appeal is for Opera GX. It's like aggressive RGB lighting but within your browser, and although some features could be viewed as "cool," such as the resource management (a marvel for Chromium browsers), I don't see the need for Discord, Twitch, and everything else to be thrown in with the kitchen sink.

Self-hosting is a lot harder than I had hoped
Since I set up my NAS a week ago, I've been playing around with self-hositng more and more software. Part of it is me siomply wanting to learn, but there are also things I have to test for work, and if there's one thing I'm realizing, it's that this is way more complicated than I had hoped.
I started out with Immich and Nextcloud, and these were relatively easy to set up, so I thought it would all be relatively smooth sailking from there. And for some apps, it can be. Jellyfin, Pairdrop, KitchenOwl, with some effort and a lot of help from my colleague Adam Conway, I could figure these out.
But now that I'm exploring some self-hosted calendar options, things are getting rough. I have spent multiple hours trying to set up a few of these to no avail.
