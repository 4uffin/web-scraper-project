How many case fans does your PC have?
Besides dust buildup, high temps are easily the biggest nemesis of PCs, and you could end up lowering the longevity of your painstakingly-assembled rig if you take your fan placement lightly. Me? I've got an arsenal of fans attached to my PC cabinet. I've installed three 140mm fans as intakes on the front, with two 120mm fans at the top and another 120mm on the back acting as exhausts. That way, my cabinet has slightly positive pressure, which is ideal for folks like myself who want lower temps without too much dust accumulation. What about you? How many fans does your gaming machine possess?

It's been 25 years since the first ATI Radeon GPU
ATI was still its own company at the turn of the millennium, long before AMD folded them into its graphics division. The venerable ATI Rage line of graphics processors was getting long in the tooth and lacked hardware geometry acceleration and efficiency. And then, in August 2000, the Radeon R100 was unleashed on the world in a flurry of reviews. Those reviews are (mostly) gone from the net now, as is the ATI branding, but the Radeon name lives on as the graphics division for AMD. I've lost count of how many AMD GPUs I've used in those decades, how about you?

I'm kinda over my desire for a rackmount server
I've always wanted a rack-mount server for storage and home lab use, and now I finally have space for one. But I'm rethinking those plans, because recent Mini PCs I've used have shown me that I can run most of the things I want on power-efficient hardware. I'm sure I'll end up with a rack mount at some point because my NAS is running out of space and the next storage upgrade is going to need more bays, but until then, I'm going to host as many things as possible on Mini PCs and see how things go.

What's the one home lab device you refuse to part with?
I've armed my home lab with several gizmos, ranging from server nodes made from mini-PCs and SBCs to network-oriented devices like switches and routers. However, my Xeon workstation is the one component I refuse to part with, even though it has some glaring weaknesses. Its energy consumption is obscenely high, while the funky IOMMU support on the X99 motherboard reduces its utility in hardcore server projects involving GPU passthrough. Nevertheless, the 48 v-cores and 64GB memory (alongside provisions for four times as much RAM) make it the best rig for my primary server node. But that's just me. Do you have a home lab device you refuse to get rid of?

The MOS Technology 6052 is fifty years old this month
One of the best-known 8-bit microprocessors, the MOS Technology 6052, turns 50 this month. It powered personal computers from Commodore, Apple, Acorn, the NES, and more. It is still in production today as the WDC version, which uses less power while fixing a few issues and adding more instructions to the set. It has a special place in my geeky heart as it powered the Apple IIc on which I first learned to use a computer. It also powered the first console I used, the NES, like millions of other '80s kids. It was easier to integrate than the Intel 8080, but the main reason it had staying power was the lower cost of selling it to manufacturers. In some ways, it was the Raspberry Pi of its time, with just enough features for most users. I wonder if the Pi will last another four decades.

I should stop buying enterprise servers ... but I can't
There's just something about technology that always peaqued my interest, even as a child. I was more fascinated how everythign worked, as well as enjoyed the result of all the magic coming together. It's carried through to adulthood but now I'm slightly obsessed with used enterprise servers. How Dell, HP, Lenovo, and other brands manage to cram so much hardware inside such compact chassis. Sure, they're nothing in comparison to modern consumer-grade components, but there's something about having a few servers running in a cabinet that puts a smile on my face, especially when logging into the Proxmox cluster to see how everything is performing.

What's in your tech travel bag?
I'm on my way to Cologne for the Counter-Strike 2 IEM event, and I always have a hard time picking and choosing what to actually bring. I have a few go-tos, like my laptop, camera, and chargers that have swappable power outlet connectors, but that's about it. Depending on the event, I might bring a power bank, and I also have my Nintendo Switch 2 for relaxing during downtime. What do you normally bring?

I finally found a low-profile keyboard I love, and I don't think I'll go back to anything else
For a long time now, I've been wanting to use a low-profile keyboard I truly love, but the couple of review units I've received just don't quite cut it. The Cherry KW X ULP was too low of a profile for me, and the Keychron K1 just didn't sit quite right with me. Something about the way the keys sit on the board just didn't feel right to me and I couldn't get with it. Plus, it lacked a lot of the features I love about Keychron's premium keyboards.
But recently, I received a unit the NuPhy Air75 V3, and I think I've finally done it — I've found the perfect keyboard for me. This is a low-profile keyboard, but the design feels much more natural and in line with a typical mechanical keyboard. Plus, my review unit came with linear silent switches, which are easily my favorite, and it still has a volume knob, plus it supports both wireless (with a dongle) and wired communication. It's not as advanced or capable as the magnetic switches I'm used to, but frankly, I never use any of those featu

Google Pixel 6a owners! Check if you qualify for this battery-related payout
Google has announced that an upcoming software update might impact the battery on some Pixel 6a phones. The issue? Some devices' batteries are more likely to overheat and become a risk to their users. That's not a good thing, anyway you try to spin it. You've got the choice of a battery replacement (if you're in an eligible country), a cash rebate, or a slightly higher discount on your next Google Store purchase. It's not often that smartphone manufacturers take a proactive stance on issues, so kudos to Google for this, especially after its history with Nexus and Pixel devices. If you own a Pixel 6a, go to the link above and check your IMEI to get your battery fixed or a share of the payout.

Nokia leaves the US market, saddening dozens (including me)
Nokia might have been an innovator in the mobile phone market, but it never quite recaptured that spark in the post-Android era. HMD now owns the phone business, and after one interesting phone with more cameras than a spider has eyes, became a purveyor of mediocre midrange ewaste-to-be. The company isn't even selling phones in the US now, presumably because of tariffs, but it could be a sign of a broader issue worldwide. The US-facing webstore doesn't work, purchasing links on product pages have been removed, and now nobody will be brave enough to run Windows Mobile, even if Microsoft brings it back. RIP to another big name from many of our formative years.

I may have found my new favorite keyboard
A couple of days ago, I mentioned I received a new keyboard to review, which was the Lemokey L1 HE. While I'm still early in the process of testing it, I have to say, this thing is winning me over with its design alone.
I don't know if it's intentional, but the color scheme I received gives me strong SNES vibes (specifically for the American version), and I love it. Plus, it has one of the more exaggerated chassis designs Keychron has done, with exposed screws, indentations, and a big volume knob paired with a mode switch. It's unnecessary, and I love that about it. I'll have more thoughts on it soon.

What do you look for in mechanical keyboards?
I've gotten my hands on a wide range of mechanical keyboards over the past few years, and I've loved almost all of them, to the point where it can be hard to choose one to stick with. Just today I received what might be my favorite board yet, but I'm curious, what do you look for in a mechanical keyboard?
Do you prefer the super-silent switches, or the clicky kind? Do you go for a specific vibe in terms of aesthetics? Is it more retro or something cleaner? And in terms of layout and size? Tenkeyless, 75%, low-profile, standard height... there are a ton of possibilities, so I'm curious about everyone's preferences.

I can't stop buying old server hardware
"The home lab must grow" is a meme you'll find within the community. It's apt since once you start fleshing out a home lab with old server hardware, it can be difficult to know when to stop since there's always a good deal to take advantage of. You may not need another 1U Xeon server, but where else would you run a single instance of Homepage? I'm always checking classified sites to see job lots and other singular listings of used hardware that can work wonders in my own home lab, but I'm always having to weigh up the purchase against the vital question: Do I really need this?
Quite often, the response is yes.

Remember: More fans ≠ better cooling
PC cases tend to support a wide number of fans, some only one, while others can take 10 or more. It may be hard to resist the urge to install as many fans as you can, but going overboard can negatively impact the cooling performance of your system. Too many fans could cause more turbulence and roughen up the airflow to the point where its thermal capacity is lower than what you'd have with fewer spinning blades. What's the most you've installed inside a PC?

I finally upgraded my gaming and office chair, and I love it so far
I've been complaining about the chair in my office for a few months now. I'm fairly frugal, so when I last upgraded a few years ago, I got one of the cheapest gaming chairs I could find, which turned out to be cheap in multiple ways. The cushion gave out quickly and the chair was too hard, so I eventually added a pillow, but I still had poor back support, and I often find myself with back pain. More recently, the pillow add-on has been disintegrating under me as of late and making my office a mess, too.
So I decided it was time for an upgrade, and I bought the Alpha Gamer Galaxa gaming chair. This is far from the most premium chair out there, but for 230 EUR (on sale), I got fully adjustable armrests made of a nice comfortable material that seems durable, a nice dense cushion that hopefully won't flatten anytime soon, and built-in, adjustable back support, which has been keeping me much more straight throughout my first day of use. Time will tell how long-term comfort is, but right no

You've seen mice, and you've seen touchpads — but how about a roller?
I've used a few mice in my days, and of course, I've also used touchpads on many laptops. But it wasn't until recently that I got the opportunity to test the Contour Design RollerMouse Red Wireless, and it's pretty interesting. Instead of moving a mouse or swiping on a touchpad, it uses a rolling bar that controls the mouse, and it mostly works.
I also like that it doubles as a wrist rest, which has made my typing experience a bit more comfortable. Have you ever seen one of these? What would you like to know about it?

Are external GPUs finally leveling up?
Computex is now fully underway and there are a ton of announcements coming from all sorts of companies. But to me, one that sticks out is the Asus ROG XG Station 3, an external GPU dock that, to my knowledge, is the first one every to leverage Thunderbolt 5.
With the latest version of Thunderbolt 5 offering a lot more bandwidth, you can expect performance to increase very significantly and you should be able to make much better use of powerful desktop GPUs. It's especially exciting because the eGPU market seemed to have really slowed down for the past few years, with most solutions still based on Thunderbolt 3 and without internal space for the latest Nvidia and AMD GPUs. It's nice to finally a solution that makes sense in 2025 and isn't just a fully integrated product.

I love a good CPU die shot
We've been pretty impressed with Intel's Lunar Lake, which contrasts with Arrow Lake's missteps on the desktop chips. It's one thing to see the silicon's benchmark results and another altogether to see the silicon in all its complexity. Still, thanks to renowned enthusiast Fritzchens Fritz, we can see the inner workings. Two large black NAND chips at the bottom of the image hold the on-package GDDR5x, while the CPU cores and iGPU are on the larger of the three sections of the silicon, with the thinner rectangle housing all the I/O like USB, PCIe, and network controllers. It's gorgeous to see behind the usually covered top of the die, and I always look forward to Fritzchens' work to appear.

I'm ditching all RGB lighting inside my PC — It's time to glow up
I'm not saying RGB lighting is for kids, and you're immature for having it inside your PC. Actually, quite the opposite, I love seeing all the different builds on Reddit and social media. There are also some simply stunning systems showcased at Computex every year, and most of them have colored lights. But it's time for me to stop using them. We're combining our offices in the new house, and with the navy blue and wood panel look we're aiming for, RGB lighting simply won't do. That, and the Fractal Design North won't really work with light shining from within its mesh panels.

Nvidia DOOM code redeeming issue? I found a fix
Hey so if you bought a recent Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series card that came with a copy of DOOM: The Dark Ages, and you're having trouble redeeming it, the fix is staggeringly idiotic. Open your network adapter settings, and disable IPv6. That's it. Then go redeem the game code in the Nvidia app, and it should sync to your Steam account and give you the game. Once that's done, you can go and turn IPv6 back on, and go enjoy slash, tearing, and stomping on medieval demons as DOOM Guy.
