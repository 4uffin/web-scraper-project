Should annual Windows features include new updates, or be boring?
I recently wrote a very personal piece on why Windows 11 updates are boring and how I much prefer the Apple approach of adding notable new features with the majority of annual updates. Microsoft's strategy is more about rolling out new features whenever they're ready, which makes it a little less interesting to follow the developments.
However, I'm sure many people don't care about updates at all and just want a functional computer. Are you someone who enjoys getting big new feature updates, or do you prefer the more boring and upredictable pace of Windows 11 releases?

I have to go back to Windows and I'm not happy about it
Recently, I was offered a chance to review a product ahead of its launch (I'm not at liberty to share what it is yet), and unfortunately, the vast majority of its features are only available on Windows. I've been using macOS as my main OS for a good while now, and I'm not looking forward to going back to a Windows machine.
That being said, this is also a good opportunity to test Raycast for Windows more extensively, seeing as it just recently became available and I haven't had as much time with it as I would like. Still, the idea of using a Windows PC full time isn't particularly exciting.

After using Windows for decades, I barely touch it these days
I've mentioned before that, prior to getting a Mac Mini last November, I had only ever used Windows PCs. While the Mac Mini quickly became my main PC, I still used Windows on my laptops when I needed to be away from my desk. But these days, I rarely feel any interest in doing so.
It's true that I spend a lot of time trying different Linux distros because of work, but even if I didn't have to, I find myself preferring to use Linux more and more. There are some issues with app and hardware compatibility sometimes, but it's overall more pleasant and customizable experience, so I've started to lose a lot of interest in using Windows. I'd argue I feel more forced to use Windows for work than I do Linux.

Microsoft's latest layoffs have made me want to stop supporting the company
In recent times, I've already been moving away from a lot of Microsoft stuff. I moved to macOS instead of Windows, I've been dabbling in Linux, I'm self-hosting my cloud storage and an office suite, and I've never really cared for any Xbox games. But after the latest round of layoffs, I'm even more tired of Microsoft's strategy.
The company's products arguably keep getting worse while profits keep climbing, and workers get punished for it. As I've found that Linux is actually a great alternative, I'm now more encouraged than ever to help others make the switch. If you're not using Linux yet, I highly recommend it.

Even my wife wants to get rid of Windows
I never thought this day would come, but over the weekend, my wife has decided to abandon Windows 11 as much as possible in favor of Linux. Over the past few days, she's experimented with Arch Linux and Kubuntu, the latter of which seems to be her favorite distro right now, though she says she wants to try others.
Neither of us had used anything other than Windows until a few months ago, but it's become painfully obvious that Windows is not evolving in the way that it should, and the user experience is too frustrating for many to deal with. In a way, it's both concerning and fascinating that this discontent with Windows isn't limited to those of us who are in way too deep when it comes to tech stuff. Do you have any non-tech people you know of that have also switched to Linux?

My Windows PC is in dire need of a reset
I've (mostly) been using the same hardware configuration on my main PC for the last year, and in that time it's become a bit of an unresponsive mess. Virtual machines don't play nicely any more after a failed experiment in Hyper-V, boot times are terrible, there are any number of services running that I don't really want, and it's in need of a spring clean. I've been putting it off mainly because it works enough to get work done on, but I'm going to have to spend an afternoon on physical maintenance and probably another day on reinstalling Windows at some point, and I'm dreading it. At least I'll get the chance to put this 7800X3D in, and replace the AIO cooler that's not doing a great job of keeping the current CPU cool.

Are there any AI features in Windows you actually care about?
Microsoft announced a new set of Windows features earlier this week, and while some of them seem interesting, such as the new Start menu that looks way better than the old one, the bulk of what was announced was exclusive to Copilot+ PCs. Despite a clear lack of interest in AI features, Microsoft has continued to push more and more of them, and I wonder if anyone is actually interested in these.
I'll be honest, some of the newly-announced features do have potential to be interesting. The Relight feature in the Photos app could be a good way to enhance your photos in a more artistic way, and I could see a lot of potential for the Perfect Screenshot feature in Snipping Tool. Does that mean I'll actually use them? Probably not, which is why I suspect no one actually cares when it comes down to it.

Microsoft's latest Windows 10 change is shady
Microsoft is no stranger to controversial decisions, and the company has been pushing hard to get Windows 10 users to upgrade to Windows 11. But one recent announcement is making things a little too weird for my liking. Users have reported the loss of the ability to see seconds on the taskbar clock flyout, and it's odd to see that happen so late in the game.
But it starts making sense when you consider that Windows 11 launched without seconds on the taskbar clock, which upset a lot of users. So much so that Microsoft was eventually forced to bring the feature back in a later update. Now, seeing Microsoft remove this feature from Windows 10 truly reads as if Microsoft is hoping this will be a reason for users to upgrade to Windows 11, considering how big of a problem it was for users when it went missing.
I can't imagine this strategy working at all, and it just looks absolutely desperate, but I wouldn't be entirely surprised if Microsoft is actually hoping some users will move to Win

The new Start menu shows Microsoft is listening to Windows users — it's just too slow
Microsoft was recently revealed to be working on a redesigned Start menu for Windows 11, and it seems to incorporate a lot of the things I and many other fans have been begging for since the beginning. An always-visible All apps list, the ability to remove the Recommended section, and a larger area overall.
It's great to see that Microsoft is actually listening to fan feedback on these things. If it ends up rolling out widely, this new Start menu will be a huge improvement over what we currently have, and it shows that Microsoft does care about the user experience, when it wants to. It just seems unfortunate that it doesn't happen enough. Why did it take nearly four years for this change to show up? Why is there so much more user feedback that's still being ignored? How is Windows still so bad for gaming handhelds? I just wish Microsoft were more agile in making Windows the best it can be.

Gaming on Windows on Arm is getting pretty cool
Windows on Arm was one of the most exciting aspects of tech in 2024, and I stand by the fact that Qualcomm's Snapdragon X series is changing the game for Windows PCs. Gaming is, ironically, one of the biggest drawbacks of these chips, due to the lack of native compatibility for Arm hardware on Windows, but thankfully, things are seriously improving.
Just today, Qualcomm released a driver update enabling support and improving performance in additional games, but the real big news to me is what was announced a few days ago: Epic Games and Qualcomm are working together to bring Fortnite to Windows on Arm, and along with it, Easy Anti-Cheat technology. Easy Anti-Cheat is one of the most popular anti-cheat implementations on Windows, so having native support for it on Arm is going to be huge.
I'm not much of a PC gamer, but I can't help but be excited about the future of Windows on Arm if developers keep supporting the platform like this. Bring on those games!

PowerToys Run makes for a perfect Spotlight search on my Windows PC
I use Alfred on my Mac all the time, and I used Wox up until recently to achieve some similar features on my Windows PC. Now, though, I've recently become a PowerToys Run convert. It does what I need from a Spotlight search competitor, and has a ton of built-in features that aren't just searching my PC, either. I love it, and highly recommend giving it a try if you haven't already.

What do you do after installing an OS?
When setting up a new Mac or PC, what's the first thing you always do after setting up the operating system? Install your favorite app? Activate dark mode? Install Steam and play some games?

I'm so tired of Microsoft's invasive Windows ads
Many people have asked me why I keep using the Mac Mini since my review, especially when I've written and talked about many things that frustrate me. But the truth is every other time I use Windows for something, I'm reminded of how life on macOS is so much more peaceful.
Today, I installed an update on my Windows 11 PC I was using to grab some screenshots for an article. After installing said update, Windows 11 showed me a setup screen prompting me to enable features I've already disabled multiple times before. Setting Edge as the default browser, enabling OneDrive backups, subscribing to Microsoft 365... I saw at least five screens before I could get to my desktop.
macOS may have some weird limitations, but I haven't been stopped in my tracks so aggressively since I first set up the Mac Mini. It just needs to stop.

What would cause you to ditch your desktop OS?
Windows 11 has its fair share of problems, as do Linux-based distros and macOS, but what would cause you to ditch your current operating system? Is it the learning curve on Linux? Intrusive ads on Windows 11? How about the walled garden of macOS?

Microsoft removed one of the more interesting features in PowerToys and I don't get it
Earlier this week, Microsoft released PowerToys version 0.88 with a new feature called ZoomIt, which is taken from the company's own SysInternals suite. However, this update also removed the Video Conference Mute tool, and I have to say, I don't get it.
Video Conference Mute was added during the 2020 pandemic, and I get why it's not as popular anymore now that remote work is a little less common. But come on, it's still really nice to have the option to easily turn off the camera or microphone no matter what app you're using. I can't imagine keeping this feature in maintenance mode would take up such a significant amount of resources that it would be unsustainable to keep it here.
It's not like I even use this feature myself, I'll admit that I don't. But it's easy to see how it made things easier, so I just think this decision isn't that great.

Microsoft is at it again with shady ads
I just updated my testbench to see if Windows 11 had any Arrow Lake fixes, and it seems I'm out of luck for the moment. But the update did have a shady ad for Microsoft 365 with expanded OneDrive storage space, dressed up as a "do you want to back up your PC data" help prompt. You either say yes and get asked to subscribe to 1TB of OneDrive storage, then 100GB if you said no the first time, or you can say "Opt out of back up" to skip the sales pitch. This is peak Microsoft shady advertising, because nobody wants to opt out of backing up their data. The way it's presented is almost like you won't get any data protection if you say no, and this isn't the first time (or the 100th time) that the company has done this. To ambush users after a reboot for a normal OS update is reprehensible, and I hope it stops.

Flow Launcher makes me almost miss Windows
Ever since I switched to the M4 Mac Mini I haven't felt much of a need to go back to Windows, but recently, due to some articles I've had to write, that's changed a little bit. And it's all because of Flow Launcher.
Don't get me wrong, I still won't be switching to Windows full time anytime soon, but the extensibility of Flow Launcher is so cool that I kind of love just having all of those options. As much as I love Spotlight compared to Windows Search, Flow Launcher lets you get a Pokédex so you can find info about any Pokémon quickly. You can quickly set a timer, search for a YouTube video and download it, and more. I love Flow Launcher, and it kinda makes me want to use Windows just to have all those options available.

Third-party developers make Windows so much better
I've been writing a lot about tools that can customize or substitute certain Windows elements over the past few months and weeks, and while I love Windows in many ways, I've come to realize that a lot of what makes it good is the fact that it's so open and customizable. Sure, apps also enhance macOS in a lot of ways, but Windows has so many tools that change so many things.
Whether it's PowerToys with its fantastic advanced window management, Flow Launcher for quickly launching apps and other tasks, File Explorer replacements like File Pilot or OneCommander, and desktop customization tools like Windhawk, there's so much out there that can make Windows feel like a completely different operating system depending on who's using it. And trying out all these different apps is one of the things that still makes Windows exciting, even though I'm a macOS user now.

Are you still using Windows 10 in 2025?
Windows 10 may not have been a perfect operating system, but it had plenty of perks that made it a solid OS for everyday tasks and gaming. Unfortunately, Windows 10 is expected to hit its End-of-life stage in October 2025, after which Microsoft will cease providing free security and feature updates for the OS. Despite being a supporter of Windows 10, I ended up installing its successor on my daily driver last year. While I'm not a big fan of the AI features Microsoft forcibly shoves down its users' throats, I'll (begrudgingly) admit that Windows 11 provides a decent experience for most computing tasks. But what about you? Have you already upgraded your PC to Windows 11? Or are you an avid Windows 10 fan who won't switch ships until the last second?

Network driver issues are the worst
Have you ever had an intermittent issue with your PC that goes away every time you try to fix it? On this build, that's something to do with the Wi-Fi 6E adapter installed on the motherboard, which slows to a crawl every so often, but as soon as I try to look at settings, it goes back to working again. I can't figure out if it's my router (although every other device is fine) or a driver issue, or something physically wrong. Changing drivers fixes it for a few days, and so does uninstalling it, so maybe it is physically damaged, or it could even be something causing interference every so often. It's frustrating and has me figuring out where to route Ethernet cables to stop it forever.
