Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Wi-Fi is an ever-changing beast, and whatever is available right now will be supplanted by a new version in the coming months. This is how it's always been, and while the latest Wi-Fi routers are better than ever, do you really need them? I realize there's an aspect of hubris in that question because I've got Wi-Fi 7 access points, routers, and mesh nodes in my home, but it's my job to test these things, so I know what I'm talking about. Yes, the speed improvements are tangible, but there is a massive caveat: every part of the equation needs to support the full suite of Wi-Fi 7 features. Which is a problem, because most devices don't. Yes, it's like
HDMI 2.1, where manufacturers can still use the Wi-Fi 7 name even if they're not using every part. In short, it's a mess, and it won't get better in the short term.
I'm not saying don't get Wi-Fi 7, but...
It is impressive, but do you really need it?
At any given time, my home network is a mix of Wi-Fi 7 and Wi-Fi 6E broadcast radios, and while something feels different when connected to the Wi-Fi 7 ones, that could be a combination of placebo effect and having fewer devices connected. Without running speed tests, they both feel around the same for browsing and downloads. Both take advantage of my gigabit fiber internet connection and have similar wireless coverage range. The most significant improvement on both is the 6GHz band to avoid the congested airwaves that my neighbor's dual-band routers are putting out. Most of my devices support Wi-Fi 6E or earlier, with only a few having Wi-Fi 7. And of the few that do, most don't use the 320MHz channel, including the new iPhone 17.
While it's true enough that the iPhone is a primary driver of adopting new Wi-Fi technology, many users will buy Wi-Fi 7 routers and be disappointed that they're not seeing the promised speeds. Not a single client has more than 2x2 stream capability (yet), and the most powerful access points I've seen are all 4x4 on each of their three radios. The extra stream capacity of the broadcaster will make it a better experience when more devices are using it, but it won't increase speeds.
How old is your current router?

The general rule of thumb for replacing your router is five years, on average. Note that this is for ISP or consumer-level routers; enterprise and prosumer ones are built with better components and, more importantly, better cooling, so they last longer. So, if your current router is using Wi-Fi 5 or even older, it's about time to consider a change. That doesn't immediately mean you should pick up a Wi-Fi 7 router. If you've been using your ISP router for that long, and you don't want to manage your own router, see if the ISP will upgrade you (they probably will, newer hardware keeps their network safer). Wi-Fi 6E is the magic number to aim for right now because it will be a huge improvement over your current wireless network, and, again, you might not need Wi-Fi 7.
The current state of the market is in flux
And Wi-Fi 8 is just around the corner
Don't get me wrong, I'm excited about Wi-Fi 7 and its benefits to the market. But it's a half-step towards the features in Wi-Fi 8 that will benefit consumers more. It's also good that client devices are manufactured with Wi-Fi 7 now, but that doesn't mean you need a Wi-Fi 7 router. Wi-Fi 6E routers have the all-important 6GHz band, and the hardware is significantly cheaper.
Wi-Fi 6E is still a big deal
If I unplugged my Wi-Fi APs, I'm not sure I'd notice the difference because Wi-Fi 6E is already enough for most homes. Most of us don't have hundreds of client devices or heavily congested areas like stadiums or schools to contend with, and Wi-Fi 7 clients connect to the older version just fine. As I mentioned earlier, 2x2 streams are the most available for any client devices right now, and with few devices enabling the 320MHz channels, the 160MHz that Wi-Fi 6E also gives is your maximum speed anyways.
The near future will change things
Cheaper routers, better access points, and more multi-gig ISP plans are nearly here
Over the years, I've been an early adopter of Wi-Fi versions. I moved all my computers to Wireless-N for the 5GHz band, then again to Wireless-AC for dual-band connectivity, and so on up to Wi-Fi 6E. I've only ordered one Wi-Fi 7 adapter to replace a faulty one that came with a motherboard. I don't see the need to upgrade everything right now, and there's one big reason. Okay, two big reasons. One was that my wired network segments were limited to 1GbE and then 2GbE, which isn't enough bandwidth to feed a Wi-Fi 7 AP fully. I'm about to replace my main network switch with one that supports 10GbE and Multi-Gig, so the equation changes somewhat, but even then, I will add Wi-Fi 7 devices as they need replacing, not before. The other is that Wi-Fi 8 is coming, and while I can get excited about the speed benefits of Wi-Fi 7 as an enthusiast, it's the generation after that which will be more useful to everyone. That's because it is designed for how we use our devices,not to chase theoretical speeds in a lab. It'll handle congested airwaves better, work better near the edges of the range of your router, and hand off devices between nodes better. It's actually worth waiting for, and that's the bottom line. Because it focuses on stability and experience instead of speed, it shouldn't be as affected by 2x2 clients, which means you'll notice the difference. ISP speeds are also increasing, and there's less of an incentive to upgrade home networking until that happens.
If you've managed this long without Wi-Fi 7, you can wait a little longer
Wi-Fi 7 routers are still expensive. The budget versions you see on the market often drop the 6GHz band, making them pointless in my eyes, and it's this confusing state of affairs that makes me advise caution. You probably don't need Wi-Fi 7 on your router, especially if you already have one that supports Wi-Fi 6E.

Why would one replace their wireless hardware every 5 years?
If it's getting the performance you need, then I've kept it.
My AP is actually running wifi 5 (802.11ac), and I *should* replace it but it has solid coverage through my place, speeds that greatly outrun what my ISP gets, and when I do computer-to-computer file transfers now and then it probably is the bottleneck but if it is it's fast enough it's not noticeable.
I'd actually get 0 benefit from a newer AP other than saying I have a newer AP.

Why? Because the manufactor usually stops supporting them... meaning no more firmware updates which include making that router work better, security updates and or patches!Let me guess you took yours out, set it up and just use it?Any router that is 5 years old and no longer supported is a security nightmare! No patches or updates me no holes are fixed, which open doors to hackers and others to use your internet or collect info...Here's good reason to update!Eero mesh routers.1. Auto updates usually weekly.2. Auto ad blocker3. Scans network and websites for melwear and dangerous sites.4. Let's you know if anything any new devices go on your network.5. Block sites easily.6. Parental control7. Built in diagnostics for network outages and etc.8. True wifi 7 speeds9. Built in firewall.10. It's a full smart router 6, 6e and wifi 7.Old routers are out in the pasture ready to be put down.True fully smart routers are better, faster, and more secure.Dumb routers that are old, or even 1 year old routers... if not updated (firmware) your asking for hackers, virus, melwear, Spyware to sell your internet, identity or data!Use a eero to its fullest, and add the optional security package subscription... you have full and complete protection from router and on pc just incase (VPN, melwarebytes, 1password) and other features..
plus 1 million coverage incase of identity theft or fraud.It's a no Brainer...

Jay I'm happy for you and your new router purchase.
I don't want to rude/snarky... Amazon has full access to everything you do.
This isn't contested.
Amazon has a very bad track record of handling people's personal data: multiple examples of them accessing customers' camera footage - either to gawk at someone's wife, or laugh at someone's husband.
They literally built the all-access, real time surveillance mega-system from "The Dark Knight.". And let multiple "government" entities access this network of personal data: no warrant, no order, no push back -- just invited them in to come comb through footage of you and your family.Amazon doesn't need to install malware - its how they provide "weekly updates.". They don't need to sell your data - you're paying them to take it.If a router works, it doesn't need to "work better."
When your network is secure, you don't need to plug any holes.
And when you give a company access to your data - all of it - they are going to monetize.

Thanks for the guidance.
I went from WiFi 5 (~10 years) to WiFi 6 a few years back.
It was a big upgrade.
Like all technology, you just gotta decide when to jump on the train.

How about upgrade when your old model fails or is obsolete.
I'm actually using an N router because most of my heavy lifting is wires and I placed the unit with a lot of thought and testing.
So now it at the point where I think it's EOL, wifi dropping intermittently so I'm looking to replace it.
I found a massive upgrade in a 7 that's about $10 more than a 6.
I'll get the 7 and in 10 or 12 years I'll get whatever is new.
About 50 devices, maybe more.. smart plugs and cameras add up fast, fridge, stove, washing machine, lights etc.
So probably closer to 70.
Desktops wired, 3 close roku wires and the rest perfectly happy on the N network.... when it's working

Don't get wifi 6, wifi 6e is coming. Don't get wifi 6e, wifi 7 is coming. Don't get wifi 7, wifi 8 is coming. You see how this works?

Except that the author says the opposite - 6e is enough, 7 is not necessary.

I appreciate your suggestions but my WiFi 7 router is almost here. I ordered for it to be future-proved so I wouldn't suffer any lag in performance for the next 6-10 yrs. More so, the version I ordered for is very affordable and reliable from all critics that used it.

I have a tplink 7, and the MLO feature pushes 36GB/sec to my S24u, but the flash only writes at about 24MB/sec. I can walk around outside my house, around the pond, and still get decent video way better than AX class. It wasn't too expensive, missing a few of Asus features and knobs, but it works. As far as reporting goes, saying 4 times to wait upgrading to 7 doesn't make it a conclusion. Just an opinion. Please get rid of any routers less than AC (5), or don't have WEP3 (2 is hacked), and don't bother with mesh unless you have cement or metal walls. The AX (6) or BE (7) routers cast a large cone that easily goes through 2 regular walls. I have mine on the middle floor of 3, and even pick up 3 bars on the roof.

I cannot really find heads and tails in these arguments. It seems like plenty bla bla bla without much substance. I can do that too and here is my recommendation: Forget about WiFi 6E. WiFi 7 is, what it should have been. Massively better speed in troubled rooms of the house without hickups. Mostly because of MLO. It's always connected to both 2.4, 5 and 6GHz or at least 2 of them and smoothly transfers the bulk of the data on the best one or two. WiFi 6E has nothing comparable to offer.
WiFi 6E is often a little faster close to the access point where there is actually a penalty in struggling with MLO, but who cares since even WiFi 5 is good enough close to the access point. What matters is performance a few rooms away and here WiFi 7 shines because it always uses the best band and it works. I'm finally in heaven when it comes to WiFi.

> it's my job to test these things, so I know what I'm talking aboutAnd yet you discuss only wifi-enabled routers. What about dedicated access points which usually pack much better hardware?
