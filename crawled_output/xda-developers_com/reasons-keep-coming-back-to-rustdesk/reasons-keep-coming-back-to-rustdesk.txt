Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like Iâ€™m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
With so many options available in the market, choosing the right remote desktop software can be a real challenge. While I have tried my fair share â€” from big names like TeamViewer and AnyDesk to other lesser-known tools like NoMachine and HelpDesk. And yet, I always find myself coming back to RustDesk. RustDesk has earned a permanent spot in my toolkit. Unlike the others, it just works, and it does so in a way that feels different and more dependable. Letâ€™s break down the top reasons why I keep choosing RustDesk for my remote sessions, and why you might want to as well.
Ease of use
Ideal for non-technical users
Beyond the powerful features and open-source philosophy (more on that in a minute), one of the most underrated reasons I keep coming back to RustDesk is its simplicity. I have been the designated tech support for my parents for years, which often means I need to access their computer from miles away. With other remote tools, it used to be a complex process. I would have to walk them through a lengthy setup process, and they would often get confused by the sign-up process, pop-ups, and permission requests. With RustDesk, itâ€™s a completely different story. I can now simply ask my mom to open RustDesk and share the ID and password from the sidebar. There is no login, no account creation, and no searching for a session code in their email. The UI isnâ€™t flashy. While it might not win any design awards, it gets the job done without any distractions or unnecessary clutter, which is a massive plus when you are helping someone who isnâ€™t tech-savvy. It just works every single time.
Excellent performance
Hardly skips a frame
In my line of work, I often have to stay connected to a remote machine for hours at a time, sometimes even leaving a session running overnight to monitor a long task. I always felt hesitant about other remote tools. I would often come back to a frozen screen or complete disconnection, which would force me to restart the session. Thatâ€™s where RustDeskâ€™s performance truly shines. Itâ€™s built on the Rust programming language, which is known for its speed and efficiency, and itâ€™s something you can feel in every session. Whether Iâ€™m going through a detailed document or working on a code editor with a lot of on-screen changes, the screen hardly skips a beat. Take last week, for instance. My dadâ€™s laptop was acting up, so I decided to do some troubleshooting from my desktop computer. I connected to the laptop using RustDesk and spent the next hour or so running diagnostic tools, installing a few updates, and tidying things up. The experience was so seamless that I almost forgot I was working on a remote machine. I could switch between windows on the remote laptop, open the task manager, and even drag-and-drop files from my main desktop to the laptopâ€™s desktop without any noticeable lag.
Ample features for my remote session needs
Gets the job done in style
One of the biggest reasons I have stuck with RustDesk is that it packs all the essential features I need into a clean, simple interface without any of the fluff or paywalls. After all, when Iâ€™m in a remote session, I need to be able to do more than just click and type. For starters, clipboard synchronization is quite handy. When Iâ€™m helping my dad set up a new email account, I can copy his complicated temporary password from my password manager on my local machine and paste it directly into the remote login screen. Similarly, file transfer is a breeze. Beyond the basics, features like unattended access are crucial for me. And when Iâ€™m connected, the built-in chat feature is a simple but effective way to communicate with them without having to yell across the room or use a separate chat app. While it may not have all the features of TeamViewer or HelpDesk, RustDesk focuses on perfecting the core functionalities that matter most.
Cost-effective and open-source
With optional self-hosting
RustDesk being free for personal use with no catch is a massive point in its favor. Iâ€™m tired of using the service for a few months, only to get an annoying pop-up telling me I have been flagged for â€˜commercial use.â€™ Besides, itâ€™s an open-source solution that gives me a huge sense of confidence that my remote sessions are truly private and secure. And while I havenâ€™t personally tried it yet, the self-hosting capability is another assuring feature. The ability to set up my own dedicated relay service means I can take complete control of my data.
Fly through remote sessions
Overall, my journey through the world of remote desktop software has led me to a clear conclusion: RustDesk isnâ€™t just another option; itâ€™s a superior choice. While alternatives may offer a polished interface and endless features, RustDesk focuses on and nails the basics. It ticks all the right boxes for my usage and has earned a permanent spot on my Windows taskbar and MacBook Dock. If you still havenâ€™t, I highly recommend giving RustDesk a try. Itâ€™s the tool that finally got me to stop searching for something better.

Well, after reading this, I think I'll give it a shot. I'm used to AnyDesk only for the special feature of having to set up an Unattended password on any device I need to log into if the user is not available to accept the connection or if it disconnects while I'm still working and the user has left their seat. I don't know if Rust has this same feature though. I'm just currently tired of the pop ups from AnyDesk flagging me for commercial use too ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£. I keep having to clear the App Data to get another connection code if you know what I'm talking about ðŸ˜‰
