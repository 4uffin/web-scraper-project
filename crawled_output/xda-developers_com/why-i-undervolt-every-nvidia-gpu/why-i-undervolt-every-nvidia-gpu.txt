Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
When I first got into PC gaming, I used to overclock my graphics cards to squeeze out more performance than what was advertised. All I needed to do was move a couple of sliders in MSI Afterburner for a 5% improvement in frame rates. Nowadays, though, those performance gains feel far less exciting, especially since my RTX 4090 has no trouble running most games at over 100FPS at 1440p. And when I want to game at 4K, I can always rely on DLSS upscaling and frame generation to improve frame rates. Sure, I could still chase that extra 5% for bragging rights in benchmarks, but the trade-offs just aren't worth it anymore for improvements that aren't noticeable in real gameplay. That's why I now focus on improving the efficiency of my GPU by undervolting. It doesn't necessarily raise my benchmark scores, but it pays off in more meaningful ways than I ever thought it would, and that has changed the way I approach performance. I see undervolting as a way to make my GPU run smarter and safer, which is why it's the first thing I do whenever I get a new card.
Lower GPU temperature
Lowering the voltage means less heat for your GPU to handle
The problem with modern GPUs, especially the high-end models, is that they operate at high temperatures even at stock settings. Even if you get a GPU with a triple-fan cooler, it's normal to see temperatures hovering in the 70 to 80C range while gaming. So, if you decide to overclock on top of that, you're even more likely to run into thermal limits, which can cause the GPU to throttle its performance. That's exactly why undervolting makes much more sense for modern GPUs. By lowering the voltage a bit, you can reduce your peak GPU temperatures by a few degrees without a noticeable performance hit. For instance, when I managed to undervolt my RTX 4090 to 1.00V, the GPU temperature dropped by about 3 degrees. Sure, this may not seem like a lot, but when your GPU is running in the high 70s, even a couple of degrees can be the difference between stable performance and throttling. It's the number one tweak I recommend for reducing GPU temperatures if you're not comfortable repasting your card or don't want to spend money on improving the airflow in your case.
Sustained boost clocks
Lower temps allow your GPU to maintain peak performance for longer
Many people hesitate to undervolt their GPUs because they're worried it will negatively impact their frame rates. While that can sometimes happen, it shouldn't really be a concern if you set the voltage curve correctly. This is because temperature has a direct impact on how far your GPU can push its clock speeds. The way Nvidia's GPU Boost algorithm works, when your card gets close to its thermal limits, it lowers its boost clocks to keep temperatures under control. This is where undervolting makes all the difference. Since lowering the voltage reduces temperatures, your GPU has more thermal headroom, allowing it to maintain its peak boost clock speeds for a longer period. So, if you're thermally limited, undervolting can actually improve your frame rates a bit, especially the 1% and 0.1% lows. And even if you aren't, the average FPS will be within 1–2% of your GPU's stock performance. My point isthat undervolting makes your GPU's performance more consistent, which is far more valuable than the mere 5% average FPS boost you get from overclocking.
Reduced power draw and noise
A quieter, more efficient GPU is always a win in my books
High-end GPUs like the RTX 4090 and 5090 are very power hungry, and that's mainly the reason why they generally run hot out of the box, despite their chunky cooler designs. For instance, the RTX 4090 has a TDP of 450W, whereas the newer RTX 5090 can draw up to 575W. That kind of power consumption not only raises your electricity bills but also results in significant heat output, forcing your fans to spin faster to make sure temperatures don't get out of hand. With undervolting, you can typically lower the power consumption of a high-end GPU by 40-50W. When I undervolted my RTX 4090, for example, the average power draw went down by 45W while gaming. The money you save by reducing your GPU's power consumption may not seem like a lot, but it can add up over time if you game for several hours a day. And since you're also lowering the GPU temperature by doing this, your fans won't have to ramp up aggressively, meaning your gaming sessions will also be quieter.
It's the smarter way to get more out of your GPU
Out of the box, most GPUs run at higher voltages than they actually need since manufacturers want to ensure stability across a wide range of chips. This results in excess heat and power draw, especially under heavy loads such as gaming and rendering. By lowering the voltages a bit, you're essentially making your GPU run more efficiently without sacrificing performance. And unlike overclocking, there's no real drawback if you do it correctly. Sure, if your undervolt is too aggressive, your graphics card may crash or cause visual artifacts, but you don't have to worry about damaging it. If anything, since your GPU is running cooler and quieter, it's likely to last longer while giving you a better day-to-day experience.

There are those exceptions.
It is a shame to see a beautiful sports car not driven to it’s potential.

You can do both, undervolting often gets more performance anyways, it doesn't change the max watts or.anything, so undervolt, raise the cap, overclock, do it all, especially if your cooling solution can handle it

I too seek a quieter PC experience, and agree undervolting is a part of a good strategy in achieving this.I was able to get my Alienware R16 4090 to run on 0.975V “stable”. I use stable loosely as I haven’t tested significantly other than 100+ hours in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.Overclocking use to net big gains. My first experience overclocking was on an Intel I9 3930K six core CPU. When I installed an AIO 360 liquid cooler on that thing, I was able to get a 1Ghz overlock that was rock solid for six years.

You talk about how much money you're saving with your undervolted 4090? Why did you even buy a 4090? Can we get an article on raising the power usage please?

That would be much more interesting and show real knowledge about the topic. Whilst my 4080 Super is great for more things there are cases when it isn't locked at 144, but going between 130 and 140 so a 10% gain would see me capped to monitor again.
