When we reviewed the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, we deemed it the best CPU for gaming that money could buy at the time. And while some time has passed, it's still a very good CPU, and has gotten even better since we've seen the price slowly starting to drop. Right now, you can score the top-end CPU for its lowest price yet, coming in at $430 on Amazon. So if you've been thinking about starting a new PC build, this one is going to be one to consider.
Great performance at a lower price
This CPU is built on AMD's latest AM5 platform and was one of the first CPUs with 3D V-Cache. The CPU features 8 cores and 16 threads, with the ability to reach up to 5.2GHz when needed. It's an absolute beast of a CPU that's perfect for gaming.
We really loved the performance from our tests, and the pricing is now even better, which makes it incredible value if you're trying to build something new. In order to take advantage of this chip, you will need a motherboard that can handle an AM5 CPU. Furthermore, you will also need to invest in DDR5 RAM. From there, you can mix and match the other components to your liking, spending where you need to in order to create your perfect PC. If this sounds like what you're looking for, get it now while the price is good.
