Summary
Raspberry Pi 5 + solenoids drive a removable robot piano player with colored lights
Plays feats humans can't: it nails impossible tracks like 'Rush E' with robotic precision
Non-destructive setup; accepts song requests and uploads performance videos on demand
You know, I don't think I've seen a lot of Raspberry Pi projects that can play music. It seems like a good use for them, as you could set one up to play songs for you whenever you like, but I really haven't seen people make something that does that. I guess people don't purchase expensive instruments so that something else can play them for them. It's a lot cheaper just to stream music on Spotify. Well, that didn't stop one tinkerer, who uploaded videos showing a Raspberry Pi-powered piano player blasting out some tunes. Best of all, if you want to see it play something specific, you can ask the creator and see if they'll do it for you. Nice.
This Raspberry Pi piano player can bust out tunes that humans can't achieve
We first caught wind of this excellent project on the Raspberry Pi subreddit, where user Weegert made a post describing it. It's called the PianoPi, and Weegert describes it as a "robot piano player," which sums it up nicely. The original post contains a video that demonstrates the piano in action, and I must say, the addition of the colored lights really makes it stand out. Take a peek:
Weegert also added a little description of what they're up to:
I built a robot piano using a Raspberry Pi 5 and some solenoids. Song is Transcendence Lindsey Stirling.
I can upload song requests to YouTube https://www.youtube.com/@PianoPiPlayer AMA
I didn't want to permanently modify the piano, so this can be lifted off the keys in a few seconds.
Yes, despite how invasive the project looks, it doesn't need to modify the piano in any way. Because, as much as an automatic piano sounds good, it'd have been a shame if the creator had to put holes in it to get it to work. The creator uploaded a video on how it all works, so be sure to give that a look if you're interested:
As part of the Reddit thread, Weegert opened up the floor for people to make music requests for the PianoPi to play. Of course, one of the first requests was for the piano to play "Rush E," which was created so that no human being could possibly play it. Fortunately, the PianoPi had enough robo-fingers and processing power to chew through the song with relative ease, and the creator even uploaded a video as proof. If you want to hear the PianoPi play your fave tunes, be sure to pop over to the thread and make your request. And if you'd like to see more music-inspired projects, our resident SBC fan, Jeff Butts, made a cool Pi-powered jukebox around the turn of this year.

Any chance you can share the bill of materials and the programming?
I currently have a player piano and I want to record all my paper rolls to midi files so they will be preserved and then I can use a portable device like yours to play them as needed.
Thanks,Shawn

Maybe a technical triumph. But musically absolutely awful - devoid of everything that makes music so special and capable of touching our very soul and heart. Let’s pray this is NOT the future of music… Nigel GTCL (Hons) LTCL PGCE(Mus) professional pianist, teacher and music director.
