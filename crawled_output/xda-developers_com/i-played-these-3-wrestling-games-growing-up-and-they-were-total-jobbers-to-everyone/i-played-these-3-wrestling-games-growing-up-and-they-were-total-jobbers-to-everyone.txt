Give me a lighthearted recap
Growing up in the 90s and early 2000s with video games included many different kinds of fandom. One of those fandoms that was closely tied to games was wrestling, especially with the WWF and WCW promotions that were big at the time. Multiple wrestling games were developed and released throughout the 90s and 2000s, with a following that grew to support a variety of platforms as the popularity of wrestling continued to grow. But while there were classic wrestling games that people fondly remember, not all of them were champions in the eyes of fans. Some wrestling games were just flat out terrible, and viewed as jobbers to other games that were better overall. These kinds of wrestling games still managed to feature many of the beloved superstars of the time, but their gameplay just wasn't the quality that many fans like myself wanted to see. Eventually, these kinds of bad WWF and WCW games fell by the wayside and became forgotten relics of a time long since past. I still remember them vividly, even though I probably won't go back to play them as often as other wrestling games that were better. Here are three wrestling games I played while growing up that were total jobbers to everyone.
WWF Attitude
Know your role and shut it off
Source: Acclaim Entertainment
The attitude era of the WWF is considered one of the greatest times to be a fan of sports entertainment. This was the time when superstars like Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Triple H, and The Undertaker had a hold on pop-culture that hasn't been duplicated since. While fans were rabid with excitement at the WWF at the time, some of the video games released around then weren't always that good. One such example is WWF Attitude for the original PlayStation and the Nintendo 64. It was also released on the Sega Dreamcast and the Game Boy Color, with many differences between the versions on each platform. What made WWF Attitude so disliked was how stiff and annoying it was to play because of the system that was reused from its predecessor, WWF War Zone. Moves were done with button sequences after initiating a grapple on an opponent, which needed to be inputted quickly to damage the life bars of wrestlers before going for a pin. Fighting in matches often devolved into scrambles for a grapple and inputs of buttons that led to moves that weren't always intended. Match options were varied, with many of the big match types shown on WWF broadcasts at the time. Compared to other better wrestling, matches in WWF Attitude were often a real mess.

The presentation of the game was also not great, with a lot of blocky and bland visuals that were mildly better on the Sega Dreamcast version. Entrances were viewable before matches, but were far inferior to the display of them in other wrestling games. Although WWF Attitude did have a Create Modes for custom superstars, Pay-Per-View shows, and Stables, it wasn't enough to mask the rest of the game's shortcomings. Most fans played this game until the releases of WWF WrestleMania 2000 and WCW/nWo Revenge.

WCW Backstage Assault
Simply not perfect
The WWF may have had their fair share of bad video games, but WCW didn't go unscathed by them back then. Most people remember two main WCW games that were excellent, which were WCW vs. nWo World Tour Revenge and WCW/nWo Revenge for the Nintendo 64. But the rest of the games developed based on the WVW promotion ended up being mediocre game releases that failed to spark real interest from players. The worst among them was WCW Backstage Assault by Electronic Arts. This game was released on the Nintendo 64 and original PlayStation, and is the very last video game released before WCW was purchased by the WWE. But it also is still considered one of the worst wrestling games ever made. What makes WCW Backstage Assault so terrible in the eyes of many is how rough the gameplay is. In concept, the idea of focusing on backstage brawls with hardcore rules is intriguing to wrestling fans, especially those who loved the backstage antics of the WWF and WCW that were big in the early 2000s. But everything that could go wrong with its gameplay does so in monumental fashion, suffering from massive bugs and hit detection issues that can ruin matches quickly. Fighting involved using weapons and moves that took advantage of the environment backstage, which built up momentum to execute a wrestler's signature moves before going in for a pin. However, controlling wrestlers to do all of this felt stiff to control and moved incredibly janky, leading to some pretty laughable scenarios mid-match.

WCW Backstage Assault also had a tedious system for unlocking new content, including additional playable wrestlers and weapons to use. Playing through the Hardcore Mode let players compete for a championship, which could unlock some content, but also required other tasks to be completed. This often involved doing things in a match that lined up with backstage antics, but required a match to take place in specific areas or involve specific items. As the last official WCW game to get released before the company declined, it was a bad one to end a legacy that had been going on for a long time before.

WWE Crush Hour
Yeah, this made The List
Do you remember when the newly crowned WWE was trying out new things with their brand? Whether it was superstars showing up in blockbuster movies or collaborations with other major brands, the WWE had pushed their image heavily outside their lane. This included releasing games that were out of the norm to feature WWE wrestlers, but without much of the wrestling component as the focal point. Unfortunately, things didn't end up in their favor with the release of WWE Crush Hour, a spin-off vehicular combat game that had WWE superstars as the drivers. It was anything but what wrestling fans expected, or even wanted. A lot of comparisons about WWE Crush Hour can be made to Sony's Twisted Metal series, which is pretty obvious where the inspiration for the game came from. But unlike the Twisted Metal games, the gameplay in WWE Crush Hour was not as well-received by players. The premise of the game is heavily based on the over-the-top personality of Vince McMahon, the chairmen of the WWE at the time, and his tendency to create wild offshoots of the sports entertainment company. He decides to put together a destruction derby featuring his wrestlers in vehicles that include weapons to battle for supremacy, and ratings.

The game is a very goofy and shallow take on the formula from Twisted Metal. While it features over 20 different superstars from that specific era of the WWE, everything else about it is exactly as one would expect for a vehicular combat game. For some, there was an appeal of seeing their favorite superstars in such a crazy scenario, but the charm of that runs out quickly when faced with many of the game's technical problems. Bugs, glitches, and hit detection issues with weapons are a big problem, as well as many of the visual and audio hiccups that happen frequently. It's a ridiculous concept for a company about wrestling, and it turned into a mediocre and ridiculous concept for a video game that just did not pan out well.

Laying the smack down on them
Wrestling may be a form of entertainment that has endured for a very long time, but these types of game releases will not. The late 90s and early 2000s were a time of excitement for wrestling fans who followed the WWF/WWE and WCW on a daily basis, so it was inevitable to see game releases to capitalize on that. Although we saw a few real contenders that would go on to become classic games, a number of other releases became real jobbers instead. They were not that fun to play, had many technical issues, and ended up becoming products of their time. It doesn't matter if everyone was hyped about them back then, because games like these turned into relics of a time long since past.
