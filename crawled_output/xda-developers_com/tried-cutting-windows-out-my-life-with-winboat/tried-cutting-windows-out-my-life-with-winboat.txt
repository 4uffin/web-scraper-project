I tried cutting Windows out of my life with WinBoat, but I just can't recommend it

Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
There seems to be an increasing desire from many people to ditch Windows 11 in favor of Linux, and I've been caught up in it. I've tried a few Linux distros over the past few months, and I've settled on Arch Linux with KDE Plasma for what I now consider my main laptop. However, there are still some big drawbacks, specifically the lack of apps I'm accustomed to on Windows or macOS, such as Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop. Thankfully, solutions like WinApps exist, and while I tried that one a while ago, I recently heard of another, more user-friendly option: WinBoat. So, of course, I had to give it a shot.
Setting up is pretty easy
Much more user-friendly than WinApps
I originally set up WinApps on one of my Linux PCs, but coming into WinBoat is a very different experience. The hardest part was setting up Docker, which is the virtualization engine powering the Windows experience in WinBoat. You'll need to use Docker's CLI tool rather than Docker Desktop, as the desktop client doesn't support all the features required by WinBoat, but this isn't really explained to you during setup. Once I got that sorted (and it took a while), setting up WinBoat is actually a lot easier than WinApps. It has a nicely designed UI guiding you through the process of choosing your desired specs for the virtual machine and making sure you have everything set up correctly. It feels a lot more welcoming than WinApps, and it takes some design cues from Windows itself. On the flip side, WinBoat doesn't integrate quite as well with Linux as WinApps does. My Windows apps aren't registered in Linux's launcher, which means I need to launch WinBoat first in order to run the apps I want. Though at least apps are added automatically and if something is missing, the more friendly UI also makes it easy to add custom apps. For some reason, WPS Office wouldn't appear on my app list normally, so I had to do it manually, but after that, it was fine.
Some apps work quite well
WPS Office is much better here
Actually getting into using my Windows apps, the experience is a mixed bag. WPS Office is a standout example of an app that works quite well, with a much better experience than what I got with WinApps. Everything is responsive and works as expected, and I can type a document totally fine. I can't perceive any delay while typing, and I can even insert images from my Home folder on the Linux host, and it all works very seamlessly. On WinApps, I had noticed some issues with parts of the app loading correctly, but that doesn't seem to be an issue here. It all works great. Adobe Lightroom is also mostly fine, provided I don't try to use GPU-intensive features like the automatic denoising capabilities. These still take too long since the Windows machine can't access the GPU on your host easily. If you have a discrete GPU, you might be able to assign it to a VM, but on integrated graphics, there isn't much you can do. Still, most of the other features work fine and it's a decent experience. I tried a couple of other apps, though there frankly isn't a whole lot more that requires me to use Windows rather than Linux. The Windows version of Vivaldi mostly ran alright, barring some graphical issues that can usually be fixed by resizing the window.
It's still not good enough to fix the "app gap"
Reliability and performance are huge issues
There's one major app I still need in order for Linux to be able to fully replace Windows for me, though, and that's Photoshop. Unfortunately, this is where things fall completely flat for me. Photoshop relies heavily on GPU processing, and there's no GPU being passed through to the Windows virtual machine, which means the experience is nearly unusable. It seems fine at first, but as soon as you use something like the selection tool, the entire experience falls apart. The floating menu that appears under a selection just pops in and out of view and you can't see what you selected. Clicking around can sometimes fix it, but I can't find a reliable way to get the UI to function, so the app is simply unusable. If you have a discrete GPU, you might be able to pass it through to the VM when you need it, but that means it can't be used by the host system, so there's always a trade-off. And on a typical laptop, you just have no way to get it to work properly. That alone is enough to make this solution not viable for me, but it gets worse. The implementation of FreeRDP to open Windows apps within Linux just isn't the most reliable, and the behavior isn't consistent. In my relatively short testing period, I tried launching apps numerous times only for nothing to happen on the screen. If you try to open a Windows app when another one is already open, the original app will disappear, though you can eventually get it back by trying to open a new app again. Things don't render reliably. The most reliable way to use Windows is to just open the entire Windows desktop and do things that way, because the technology for showing individual apps clearly isn't there yet. But at that point, you can use any typical VM software.
Will we ever get to that point?
Ditching Windows would be great
It's very unfortunate that a solution like this still won't work as reliably as I need it to, as I'd love to be able to simply use a Linux PC all the time, but the way things are looking isn't very positive. Despite their user interface differences, WinBoat and WinApps essentially work the same way in the background, so a lot of the issues are going to be in both solutions. Another option you can try is Wine, but the real-time translation approach is also far from perfect for a lot of apps, so your mileage will vary a lot. Unfortunately, it just seems like a perfect solution doesn't exist, and might not exist until companies like Adobe bring their apps to Linux natively. Will that ever happen? It seems unlikely, but one can hope.

But isn't winboat clearly flagged as being in beta? Other articles I've read about it have mentioned that (I just fact checked myself & it is in beta)

Well, some of us are fortunate not being stuck with Adobe and other stubborn companies. And it's not a Linux fault that they opt only to support one platform.Interestingly enough - it may work rather well with wine/proton or crossover...

It may not be Linux's fault, but it is Linux's reality. To grow in the consumer space marketshare, these solutions are needed. These are the reasons why people continue to use Windows even when they really don't want to. Same goes for games too, a lot of games work fine on Linux with Proton but a few big games with anti cheats specifically do not because their devs refuse to make Linux versions due to it being a more open system (and easier to circumvent). And their devs don't because they don't see the cost benefit, with Linux being such a small percentage of consumer PCs.That being said, things are way better than a few years ago so maybe in time.

Kicap I just play other games, there are enough of them that just work. If all you do everyday is Photoshop then just use Windows, on Linux you'd do the same so it wouldn't make a difference. I'm a programmer and I've been deep in the Linux ecosystem for years, I use it for work and for play. I have software that does not run on Windows so it would actually suck for me if an employer makes me use Windows again after 15+ years on Linux.

Kicap but this is 'chicken & egg' problem if we put it that way; and if everyone would flock to linux only because it's free and expect everything there to be free then probability of having "solutions" is lower…
Though we have awesome Blender and there is Krita and other FOSS apps so it's possible.Also quite a lot of people dismiss Linux and it's tools without even checking them out or trying to change a bit of habbits…Valve created proton just to avoid being locked out of windows ecosystem when MS launched it's "windows store". That's just it. For me it works just fine but I don't play any (online-)multi-player so for me it's awesome :)

"due to it being a more open system (and easier to circumvent)."Ah, I see you've bought into the propaganda. Truth is, though, is that it's much easier on Windows due to faulty drivers. Most commercial cheats take advantage of vulnerable printer drivers and the like to gain kernel access. This isn't possible on Linux, and the reality is that the companies making these claims do so because they don't see Linux as profitable. They don't want to pay for the manpower to offer technical support to players on the platform, and they're gaslighting you when they say Linux makes cheating easier. The openness of it does not inherently make it less secure. If that were true, Linux wouldn't power the majority of the Internet.

Roel  Same. The tools I use to be efficient just don't exist on Windows. At least not natively. Like, why would I install WSL for the things I rely on most when I can just use Linux? Not only that, why would I expose myself to Microsoft's anti-consumer practices for a handful of things that Linux can't do? I'd rather just sacrifice those things, and find alternatives.

wojtek I play tons of online multiplayer games. EA, Activision, and Bungie are the big three who won't allow this, so they don't exist in my mind. They don't want my money? Fine. I don't want their games primarily aimed at teenyboppers anyway. There are numerous other games I can play with friends and ransoms without issue.

Ya, winboat is ok but you need to move on from a lot of terrible windows apps, adobe products included. I used to teach Photoshop in a classroom and swapped to gimp 2 decades ago and now I hate Photoshop. Gimp can do everything Photoshop can except edit PSDs well so I use photopea.com for that. Gaming is my only issue currently, there are no programs that are proprietary to windows without a better open source version, you just aren't used to them.
