One of the first things I used to notice while going through the specs of a CPU was its clock speed, because it seemed like an easy way to judge single-core performance at first glance. Modern CPUs list both base and boost clock speeds on the spec sheet, but until recently, I always prioritized the latter as a gamer. It felt natural to assume that higher boost clocks meant better performance in the games I play. After all, if one CPU claims to hit 4.8 GHz while another tops out at 4.5 GHz, the difference should be obvious, right? Soon enough, I learned that these numbers don't really tell the whole story, especially when it comes to modern CPUs with large L3 cache and newer architecture. This became clear to me when I upgraded from the Ryzen 9 5900X to the Ryzen 7 5800X3D last year. Even though the 5800X3D advertised lower clock speeds and fewer cores, it easily outperformed the 5900X across all the games I play. But that's not the only reason why I'm now skeptical about boost clocks. So, let's get right into the variables that affect a CPU's boost behavior.
Boost clocks aren't really sustainable
Depending on the load, the CPU typically runs below its peak speed
The harsh reality is that CPUs don't maintain their peak boost clock speeds for very long, especially under moderate to heavy loads. I realized this as soon as I started playing games with the 5900X. In Cyberpunk 2077, while monitoring with MSI Afterburner, I noticed that my CPU would briefly spike to its peak speed of 4.8GHz, but only for a few seconds before dropping down and staying around 4.4GHz. While that's still well over its base speed of 3.7GHz, it showed me that the advertised maximum wasn't something I could realistically expect to see during actual gameplay. I even noticed this behavior with the 5800X3D across a bunch of games, including Battlefield 6 and Assassin's Creed: Shadows. After briefly touching its peak speed of 4.5 GHz, it would drop to around 4.3 GHz and stay there. Sometimes, it would even dip closer to 4GHz, depending on the scene, even when the CPU wasn't running hot. I'll admit that none of this hurt the smoothness of my gameplay, but that's when I learned that the maximum boost clock speed is more of a best-case scenario under ideal conditions. That's also why both AMD and Intel phrase their specifications as "up to" a certain frequency rather than promising those numbers.
Thermals can limit boost clocks
High temperatures will inevitably force the CPU to lower its speed
I can't stress enough how much your cooling solution can affect your CPU's boost behavior. The way boost clocks work is pretty simple: as long as your CPU has the thermal headroom, it will try to push clock speeds higher. But once that headroom shrinks, the boost algorithm becomes more conservative, even if the CPU hasn't reached its thermal limit. That said, better cooling doesn't mean your CPU will always maintain its advertised speeds since power limits and workload also play a crucial role. What it does provide is more headroom to sustain higher clocks for longer, which can make a noticeable difference while gaming. When my PC was new, my CPU used to maintain around 4.4 to 4.5GHz across most games. However, after a couple of years, when my 360mm AIO wasn't performing at its best due to dust buildup in the radiator and thermal paste starting to dry out, my CPU temperature began creeping above 80C. As a result, the clock speed dipped to around 4.3GHz during extended sessions. This is exactly why I highly recommend a high-end cooler to get the most out of your CPU. And if that's not in your budget, undervolting your CPU is an excellent way to keep temps in check without sacrificing performance.
Motherboards and power limits
Your CPU can only boost as far as your motherboard allows
Although maintaining lower temperatures is crucial for a more aggressive boost behavior, it's just one piece of the puzzle. Besides thermal headroom, your CPU also needs sufficient power allowance to sustain higher frequencies, and that's when your motherboard's power limits come into play. If your motherboard is conservative with its default values, your CPU will settle at lower boost clocks, no matter how powerful your cooler is. Some boards ship with aggressive power limits, allowing the CPU to pull more power than its official TDP. I learned about this when I compared my 5900X's clock speeds to benchmark videos on YouTube. I noticed how a few users had no trouble maintaining clock speeds of 4.6 to 4.7GHz while gaming, but my chip would hover closer to 4.4GHz across the same games. At first, I assumed it came down to silicon lottery, but after browsing several Reddit threads, I realized the difference was due to the default power limits set by the motherboard manufacturer. So, if you settle for a low or mid-range board, expect slightly lower boost clocks out of the box.
Gaming isn't defined by boost clocks alone
Other factors like cache and CPU architecture matter just as much
If a CPU’s boost clock speed were all that mattered, then the Intel i9-14900KS would be the fastest gaming CPU today, considering it can hit 6.2 GHz. But that's not really the case with modern CPUs. Take my Ryzen 9 5900X, for example. On paper, it looks stronger than the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, with more cores and higher clock speeds. And while it may be better for multi-threaded workloads, the 5800X3D blows it out of the water when it comes to gaming. That's mainly due to its massive 96MB of L3 cache, which helps the CPU access game data faster and more efficiently. Likewise, architectural improvements make just as much of a difference. An older CPU may seem faster on the spec sheet, but a newer CPU can still outperform it at lower speeds if its cores are more efficient per cycle. That's why IPC gains from generation to generation often matter more than peak clock speeds. AMD's lead over Intel in recent years wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for those IPC improvements, which allowed Ryzen CPUs to compete with the fastest Intel chips without needing to push for higher clock speeds.
Lower boost clock isn't the end of the world
After seeing firsthand how my 5800X3D consistently outperformed my old 5900X in gaming, I've come to terms with the fact that it's okay if my CPU doesn't boost as high as advertised. From workload type and thermal limits to power limits set by the motherboard, there are many variables at play. Just because my CPU runs at a slightly lower frequency doesn't mean my gaming sessions are full of microstutters and FPS drops. Ultimately, it's the overall experience that matters the most, and that depends more on sustained clock speeds, cache size, and architectural improvements. Don't let marketing jargon push you into buying a CPU just for its boost clock.

Oh, god, clock was used by ignorant already back in like 2000s. Because CPU performance never was just click and you had lower clocked CPUs beating higher clocked for long time. Because performance is determined by clock, Instructions Per Cycle or IPC, cache, core count and also by RAM speed and latency too, depending on cache size and how often CPU needs to go into RAM.Clock was basically how ignorant compared it. Basically simple number for monkey brain. Hence why also one if the worst possible sites, Userbenchmark, is so popular despite it giving misleading information.Also yes, that is CPU boost that today is way more like GPU boost, both basically spiking due to various limitations they hit, be it workload not being there or waiting for something else, temperature, power, current and silicon lottery.As is, best you can do is to buy COU based on performance in CPU limited scenarios. Not just singular numbers. I get appeal of dumbing things down, but that is way too much dumbed down to the point of useless. Might as well ask fortune teller, she will be equally accurate too.

I gave up on clock speed a decade ago. The best way to get an idea on relative performance between CPUs is to look on cpubenchmark.net for the single core and multi core rating. A higher single core performance will make the PC feel faster in daily use and a higher multi core number will perform better in multi-tasking (or things like rendering that can be easily split into multiples sub-tasks).

If you don't like AMD boost clocks. Please don't look at Intel under max load. Intel boost clock is for single thread only. And drops significantly when more than one core is maxed out.

I agree with the author, and I learned this also with upgrade to 5800x3d. Do not discount the silicon lottery though, I've ordered 3 chips and selected the one that would let me do the max voltage offset to keep chip cool and allow for maximum boost. Nowadays overclocking/boosting performance is done through undervolting CPU and GPU alike.
