Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
I test out a lot of Docker containers, and not all of those stay in my stack forever, or even make it to my dashboard. This presents a big problem. You see, you start off by setting up a few containers, think you'll remember port mappings, even take down the port numbers on sticky notes, and then you forget about them. Grafana, Karakeep, and among all the other self-hosted services, there are only so many bookmarks you can keep before things get out of hand again. Of course, you just open up Portainer or keep guessing containers, but that's a time sink. There's got to be a solution. Turns out, there is a Docker container to solve exactly that Docker container-finding problem. I discovered Dockpeek a few days back, and it solves such a straightforward problem that it has essentially become my new homepage. The lightweight self-hosted dashboard requires zero configuration on your end. Instead of juggling ports or digging through Compose files, Dockpeek presents all the Docker containers running on your home network in one neat interface, and lets you click straight through to the interface. Nothing more, nothing less. It's fantastic.
What is Dockpeek, and why it's so important to my stack
Instant visibility into your container stack
Dockpeek isn't a full-fledged dashboard, but depending on what you need from one, it could pass off as one, as it gives you instant visibility into all the containers running on your network. The idea is beautifully simple and does exactly what it says on the, ahem, container. Once up and running, Dockpeek automatically detects all your containers, lists the ports they expose, and turns them into clickable links. So, for example, if you've got Karakeep on port 3022, you no longer need to remember that. Just click the link, and you'll be bounced straight into Karakeep with a one-click shortcut. Dockpeek also handles multiple Docker hosts simultaneously using socket proxies. This is a great feature if you divide your Docker containers between more powerful server hardware, and say a Raspberry Pi for lightweight tasks. Just add in the relevant details, and they'll all auto-populate on the dashboard. Look, Docker is great at the entire abstraction of complexity, but when it comes to running self-hosted applications, managing containers is a fairly messy task still. More importantly, I still struggle to remember port numbers even for commonly used services. Heck, I've plastered my NAS drive's IP address on it using a labeler. Dockpeek makes that extremely simple, and it does this not by being a Docker multi-tool or a full-blown dashboard like Portainer. It does this by being quick, minimal, and a frictionless way to have quick access shortcuts.
How to get Dockpeek up and running
Quick, painless, and easy to access
Running Dockpeek is refreshingly simple. I installed Dockpeek using Portainer on my Synology NAS, and outside of providing a secret key, changing the default username and password, there was no additional configuration needed at my end. That's a big help when adding a fresh collection to your stack, especially for first-timers. Point your browser at the default 3420 port, enter your login details, and Dockpeek will instantly populate all your containers. There's no long configuration, messing around with YAML, or further work needed. There are other minor additions to Dockpeek that make it stand out further. For example, the zero-config container detection is the obvious one. But there's more. Dockpeek is smart enough to detect whether the clickable URLs should point to HTTP or HTTPS addresses, depending on the ports and containers. There's built-in search functionality that comes in clutch if you are running a large number of containers. A one-click refresh button is also provided to update the list of containers as they start and stop. What I particularly like is that Dockpeek can also point out images that need updates. If you're using it as a home page to launch your containers, it's a nifty tweak that ensures you're never running an older version of software.
Simplicity beats complexity
Dockpeek is one of those nifty tools that deserves a place in everybody's self-hosted stack, mostly because of its simplicity. Not every tool needs to be a full-fledged management platform for container orchestration, and Dockpeek is proof of that. All it does is reduce daily friction in use. Once you've installed it, it is ready to go in your browser, and every container on your server is just a click away. The few extra additions are embellishments at best and don't really detract from the core objective. For me personally, that simplicity and one-minded approach was a key selling point. I waste too much time every day looking up my Docker container ports or even typing them out. With Dockpeek set as my homepage, all of these containers are now just a click away. If you spend a lot of time using Docker containers in a home lab or even a production environment, Dockpeek handily earns its spot in the stack.

You can greatly simplify the ports problem by using a reverse proxy and named services that all will be on 443

I use Traefik and Homepage. Homepage is configured with labels in the Docker composer file. But occasionally (usually in early stages of implementation, when I've got something misconfigured), I need to be able to use the Docker internal IP

Does dockpeek look at other docker servers or just the one it is installed on? For instance I have two raspberry pi 's running docker as well as my Synology nas. In which case yes it would be very useful.

Yes — Dockpeek can connect to multiple Docker hosts through a Socket Proxy.Just run a socket-proxy on each machine (Synology + Raspberry Pis) and point Dockpeek to them with the variables.- DOCKER_HOST_1_URL=tcp://192.168.1.168:2375- DOCKER_HOST_1_NAME=Synology- DOCKER_HOST_1_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=- DOCKER_HOST_2_URL=tcp://192.168.1.169:2375- DOCKER_HOST_2_NAME=RaspberryPi1- DOCKER_HOST_2_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=- DOCKER_HOST_3_URL=tcp://192.168.1.170:2375- DOCKER_HOST_3_NAME=RaspberryPi2- DOCKER_HOST_3_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=

I was doing it all from terminal - docker ps, docker stats and view the compose files... But ok I get it. Some people want a GUI.

Lol. Just the clickable link might make it worthwhile. All of my web frontends are behind Traefik and it drives me nuts that on the Services page it will show me the URL: BUT IT'S NOT CLICKABLE!

I just have a bookmark folder specifically for containers. Part of my build process is to add the appropriate URL to the folder. If I decide to keep the software, it gets an NPM/pihole entry so IP:8123 becomes ha.lan. It then gets added to Dashy.This sounds easier for the first step though, because like you, I install a lot of stuff to check out and end up not keeping it. Thanks!

But you are using Portainer that has all this functionality built in... I see a use of you didn't use basically more advanced solution as a launchpad, and probably/hopefully Dockpeek is less setup and leaner than Portainer? Still might be useful for some cases.
