Summary
Windows 10 support ends Oct 14, 2025; Zorin OS 18 Beta targets users left behind by Windows 11 requirements.
Zorin OS 18 Beta offers OneDrive support and Windows-installer help to ease data and app transition.
Familiar Windows-like interface makes Zorin an easy, free route out of Microsoft's ecosystem—try the Core Beta.
As Microsoft prepares to stop providing feature updates for Windows 10 this coming October, users still running the operating system have a few options ahead of them. While you can upgrade to Windows 11 (either with a new PC or by forcing your old one) or extend your Windows 10 support for a year, there's always the option to abandon ship and try a new operating system altogether. That's what I did, as I've since moved on to Fedora KDE. However, Fedora isn't the only distro available by any means. In fact, several communities are banding together to advertise Linux as a suitable "get out of Microsoft's ecosystem free" card, especially as we get close to October. For example, the Zorin Team have released a new Zorin OS 18 Beta, and it's designed specifically to make ex-Windows users as comfortable as possible.

Over on the Zorin Teams blog, the group announced the release of Zorin OS 18 Beta. Right from the start, the team makes it very clear that they'd love to welcome in people who are fleeing Windows 10's end-of-life date:
With Windows 10 reaching its end of life on 14 October 2025, an estimated 240 million computers1 that don’t meet Windows 11’s strict hardware requirements will be left behind. Many users are faced with the choice of either buying a new computer soon or switching to a supported, modern operating system.
Zorin OS is designed to be the perfect replacement for Windows, thanks to its ease of use and powerful features [...] The improvements in Zorin OS 18 make the transition from Windows easier than ever, offering a familiar and intuitive experience for Windows users while unlocking the full potential of your existing computer.
So, what does the Zorin OS 18 Beta do to help Microsoft escapees adapt to Linux? Well, for one, the OS is actually fully compatible with OneDrive. That way, if you want to jump off Windows but you don't want to leave all of your files behind, Zorin OS can help you access them. It also has a database of Windows installers, and if it detects you launching one, it'll give you advice on how to get it set up the Linux way, plus some pointers toward some alternatives you can check out. Honestly, it sounds ideal for people still trying to get used to the open-source scene. Other than that, the OS definitely has the look and feel of a Windows product. Take a peek at the screenshot above: if you had told me it was a Windows 10 skin, I would believe you. If you want to get started with the operating system, head over to the Zorin OS 18 Core Beta download page and give it a try.

Yes, I would recommend Zorin and have found it to work well on a Tablet PC with touchscreen gestures.Apparently the Microsoft OneDrive solution offered by Zorin isn't exclusive to them and it's based on Gnome. There are also other implementations. From what I've read, there are limitations observed by those who've used them. So to say it's "fully" compatible might be a stretch.My own conclusion when using Microsoft OneDrive or GoogleDrive on Linux would be to buy a lifetime license to the InSync app from insyncpro and sync the whole drive to your system, or add a big enough SSD or HDD for this purpose. Only with this approach will you avoid limitations of the other systems.Real life means that we have use Google Drive or One Drive, because we collaborate with other people that do use them too, on their macs and Windows machines, in work and personally. And I'm a user of those platforms too.

Zorin is great! It's the only Linux distro I tried that "just worked" with a default install, and including running most of my Windows apps via WINE (which is built-in). Very impressive.
