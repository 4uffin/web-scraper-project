Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Windows 10's impending retirement has users in a state of uncertainty. The obvious alternatives are mainstream Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, that don't impose difficult system requirements like those of Windows 11. Unsurprisingly, users like me will switch to Ubuntu because of its popularity and open-source nature, which doesn't require a one-time purchase or subscription. However, using it as a daily driver on one of the laptops made me realize that it lacks several native features that I expect an operating system to have. Whether you transition from Windows 10 or 11, you'll surely miss these features/tools in Ubuntu. Ubuntu tends to skip system restore, lacks native OCR features in screenshot and image viewing tools, and has a limited phone connection feature set, as well as an inability to reset the operating system. Let's discuss these points in detail and why Ubuntu should give it serious thought before finalizing the next release.
System Reset
A one-click solution
While I understand that Linux has a different approach to what a system and packages are, the lack of a reset feature befuddles me. In Windows, you can hop into settings and use system reset to wipe the system installation, reinstall the core files, and save or discard the personal data/app installs. Ubuntu doesn't have a reset option to revert the system to default settings in one click, and the only option is a live USB with Ubuntu. If you didn't create one using Etcher or Ventoy, you cannot return. I'm not a fan of reinstalling the operating system until necessary, and I need a reset option. Also, you cannot do a repair upgrade that fixes the OS using the latest image. I can directly mount the latest ISO file in Windows, run the setup utility, and reinstall the OS without creating a bootable USB drive. Ubuntu doesn't include any such feature natively, and relying on a Ventoy USB drive is my only choice.
System Restore
Cannot preserve a working system state
Before system reset became popular, the System Restore tool fixed your PC after a series of wrong steps, bad updates, and other problems. The concept is simple, as the tool creates restore points that serve as a snapshot of the system at a certain point. If your operating system breaks after installing a problematic app or just changes too many settings, you can return to a working system state by applying a restore point. The OS even offers to create restore points automatically, so you have a backup plan, even when the OS breaks abruptly. On Ubuntu, my only choice is to reinstall, which is an exhaustive route. It means starting afresh, even if you don't want to, reinstalling all my system apps, and manually backing up every personal file to an external storage disk. There's also no backup tool in the distro to create a system image I can use as an installation medium and recreate my system later.
No OCR-based tools
A modern-day necessity
When Microsoft included OCR in the Snipping Tool, I didn't even realize it was important until I hopped onto Ubuntu. The built-in screen capture tool has all the basic functions but lacks OCR. So, you cannot click a snapshot and then use OCR to extract text from it. The only option is to open the image in a browser, preferably Chrome, and manually scan using Google Lens. OCR tools are essential because images often contain information you need to extract, and a native solution reduces the time. You don't have to upload the picture using a web tool, then extract the data, browse multiple ads and pop-ups, or pay to extract the image content. So, it is useful in image capture and viewing/editing tools. Ubuntu’s native image viewer doesn’t offer OCR integration or image editing tools, while Windows offers OCR in Snipping Tool, Photos, and Phone Link. It’s become a system-wide affair, and even if Ubuntu added an option just in the screen capture tool, it would be extremely helpful.
Phone integration
You cannot skip that
Skipping phone integration takes me back to 2015, when I used SHAREit to transfer files wirelessly to my laptop. Windows’ improved Phone Link app is an excellent solution for managing your phone from your PC. You can check your notifications, receive or make calls, browse images and files, and even edit them on the PC. There's also a mobile device feature suite in Windows settings that can help you use your phone's camera as a webcam, access and sync the clipboard, and access phone storage in File Explorer. This seamless smartphone integration with the OS, so much so that you don’t need to switch to your phone for basic actions, is quintessential if you don’t want to hamper your productivity. Even if I ignore the niche features, essential elements like wirelessly accessing phone data and using its camera are features that Ubuntu must add. It might involve building a companion app and an account service for Ubuntu, but you could do more without connecting a USB cable to the PC.
Ubuntu has potential
I like Ubuntu's Gnome desktop environment and the simplicity of package management. But it's difficult to look past these glaring features, some of which are a part of distros like MX Linux and AntiX. If other niche Linux distros can do it, Ubuntu can surely add a system restore and other features I discussed above. If it's truly the year of Linux, Ubuntu needs to improve soon. I don't want to search for apps that offer or try to mimic these critical OS features or spend time installing unreliable packages.

Perhaps I misunderstood, but here are my thoughts:Timeshift will do a System Restore. And Resetting a program is often as simple as deleting its ~/.config file and reinstalling it.KDE-Connect handles phone integration. have no idea about OCR-based tools as I've never needed them.

I use KDE Connect, and it can't hold a candle to Phone Link. P.L. is a fully integrated application with everything in one place. KDE Connect is divided up into separate apps, doesn't seem to display images in text messages, won't run phone apps or display photos from your phone. If I'm incorrect, please show me. Thanks.

KDE connect does the notification, calling, texting kind of integration. ScrCPY is what I usually use if I want to use my phone on PC including games that I wish to play using keyboard. (it also takes touch and click inputs, of course)For instant screenshot OCR, I use "TextSnatcher". I'm not a Windows user. Most of the power users I know don't use Windows either, so I don't exactly know the tools you're talking about. But by the sound of it, I think these tools might help you get rid of that Windows nostalgia. PS: Oh and I also use clonezilla to take occasional backups of my system and keep them on a separate external storage. It's not exactly the same as Windows system restore, but it works for me.

Why have a tool to fix something that never breaks?
In my more than 20 years of using Linux once in a blue moon I would be unhappy with an app after an update, in which case I would reinstall a previous version or work around in another way. But that's rare. I've never had the system itself break after an update.
And unlike Windows , it's my choice to update--and what to update. One of my current laptops is mostly offline on my boat docked almost off the grid. It's system hasn't been updated in years and works fine.

Linux has all of these but you need to enable them. Also if you install Ubuntu with btrfs you can snapshot and revert to any of them. Timeshift is a great backup utility allowing you to restore individual files or the whole OS.Backup is another great option. I feel mostly that you don't really know Linux at all, you need to setup some things yourself.

It appears you want a Windows experience on a Linux distro.
Why?There are options to sort of do what you want want but you have to be willing to configure it and do some work.
I have used debian and ubuntu for 15 years and will never go back to the bloated mess that is Windows.

All things I am happy to live without using Linix Mint, it's a great system, and there are recovery options.

Exactly, I have been using LM for over 2 years and I am so happy, and like Richie_writes said, you update what you want when you want. Restoring to a previous version is as easy as taking a Time shift saved snapshot and hitting restore. Apps are just as easy to reload, delete it and from the software window pick it again and install it. And all this is done so much faster than any Windows reinstallation.

Valid points. Refreshing to see the approach of pointing out where Linux could do better and pointing out the better tools that are available in Windows instead mindlessly bashing Windows.

1. Valid but nobody really uses it on windows2. Deja dup, brtfs snapper... Both way better than windows backup and restore3. KDE's spectacle and many other screenshot tools have ocr capabilities4. KDE connect (or gsconnect for Ubuntu) is significantly better than Microsoft phone link

It's no winblots, first you should ask for help in your community chat or check some distro blogs. Start using timeshift or equivalents when you just nstall a distro.same as above.there's an app call frog in the flatpak repositories.Install Kde-connect in your cell. tablet, etc. then install kde-connect or gsconnect in or pc.Just a happy LM user

Timeshift does it better than Window's reset and restore features. This is just my personal opinion though

The only thing I've missed since moving to Linux Mint is File Locator Pro (aka Agent Ransack). Nothing in Linux or other search software in Windows can compare, in my opinion. I wish they'd write it for Linux.

"I don't want to...spend time installing unreliable packages." On Linux. This sais a lot about the author. I think he kind of missed the whole point of using Linux and just wanted Windows.Windows is a toy, a cool toy that you can hardly break but can not change into another type of toy. Linux is a big bag of random Lego bricks. One can build a Linux into anything, even into a Windows look alike. But one can't enjoy a Linux if one doesn't find joy in playing with various bricks, combine them however he likes, then admiring the result as a unique product of his own creativity. The Linux distro is just the base brick, the chassis of the Linux you will build for yourself, not the entire toy.

Linux has many of these features:System restore can be performed using TimeShift. It is standard on Linux Mint, and can be downloaded on any other Linux distro if it is not there by default.I don't use OCR much, but I did play around with Gimagereader, and it seems to work. There are other OCR apps also.I use scrcpy to link my Android phone to Linux Mint. It works great.I can recommend rsync for backups. It copies only the changed portion of the file, resulting in faster backups.In general, I have found there are Linux-specific or cross-platform apps for almost any operation you may need to perform.
