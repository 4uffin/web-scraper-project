Summary
Tiny11 update nukes Copilot, New Outlook, Teams, and many built‚Äëins, trimming Windows 11 bloat.
The mod shrinks the image and makes Tiny11 25H2-ready, so upgrades don't carry bloat.
It also removes Clipchamp, Edge, OneDrive, Mail, People, Xbox, Media Player, and more.
By default, Windows 11 comes with a lot of pre-installed apps. While you may find use for one or two of them, there's a good chance that there will be a ton of apps left over that you never plan on using, but will still take up space, update themselves, and sometimes run services in the background. But what if you wanted to get rid of those apps? And not just picking and choosing which ones you want, either; instead, you wanted to go the nuclear option and just remove them all entirely. Well, the developer of Tiny11 has released a new update for their app that scrubs Teams, the new Outlook, and Copilot out of the operating system.
Windows 11's unofficial Tiny11 mod update removes more features (and that's good)
In a post on X, the developer of Tiny11, NTDev, apologised for the radio silence. Fortunately, they also bring good news: Tiny11 is now eliminating Copilot, the new Outlook (which NTDev notes on their website, "IMO absolutely sucks btw"), and Teams. And because there are now fewer pre-installed apps, there's more room for stuff you actually want. Neat.
So, what does Tiny11 get rid of? NTDev updated the master list on their website to read the following:
Clipchamp
News
Weather
Xbox (although Xbox Identity provider is still here, so it should be possible to be reinstalled)
GetHelp
GetStarted
Office Hub
Solitaire
PeopleApp
PowerAutomate
ToDo
Alarms
Mail and Calendar
Feedback Hub
Maps
Sound Recorder
Your Phone
Media Player
QuickAssist
Tablet PC Math
Edge
OneDrive
Copilot
New Outlook Client
The update also makes the custom operating system "25H2-ready," so if you're planning to upgrade but don't want all the bloatware coming with you, Tiny11 sounds like the way to go for the time being. If you'd like to read more about what Tiny11 is and what it's like to use, our resident OS editor gave it a test run last year. Granted, an app can change a lot in a year, but it should still give some insight as to what you can expect if you give Tiny11 a shot for yourself. If you're feeling brave, head over to the Tiny11 Builder GitHub page and give it a shot.

You can just un install most of these apps ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄ.
A handful you can't.About the only one you can't remove anyway is Gethelp and maybe GetStarted can't remember.You can just uninstall News, Weather, Copilot, New Outlook, Teams, Clipchamp, Xbox, Media Player. People was a Windows 10 app and New Outlook replaces Mail so will be removing that anyway.I personally wouldn't be removing Edge, it's a core component and used by several apps on the app store.At least you can remove most bloatware on Windows 11.Something you can't do on MacOS, it has significantly more, and you never hear Apple users moan about. I guess because they're all so biased about it in general.
