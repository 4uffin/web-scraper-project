There’s a drawing tool built in
As a solo creator, juggling tasks, ideas, inspiration, and execution can feel like entire projects of their own, and they often live scattered across different apps and tabs. So I’ve been on a journey to find apps that pair well with Figma to keep my project chaos in line, and I’ve found a perfect combo in Google Keep. Keep acts as a brain dump, idea inbox, organizer, and lightweight task manager all in one. Anything that pops up, whether a design idea or some notes from a tutorial, goes straight into Keep. From there, I can organize, tag, and prioritize without losing my flow in Figma. The result is a workflow where ideation and execution are separated, so things move forward without friction. Here’s how I’ve been using Keep to do that.

Capture ideas instantly
It keeps me from losing good ideas
When design inspiration strikes, I usually note it down on the nearest thing I can find: my physical sticky notes, a notepad app on my desktop, or just hope I remember. Now, I have Google Keep bookmarked and head straight there with fresh ideas. I also use it to store snippets of new information, such as links to design principles or Figma resources. Organizing the content comes later, so getting the concept down is the priority. Keep's minimalist nature makes it dead simple to capture them in no time. I don’t even have to create a new file or note; I can just start typing in the text bar right at the top, and it automatically turns it into a new note. And the best part is that there’s a mobile app which syncs all notes across the same Google account, so I can easily take notes on the go. There couldn’t be an easier system for a creative with a distractible mind.
Organize and prioritize visually
Creating a structured flow
The labels (Keep’s version of tags), colors, image inserts, and drag-and-drop function turn my ideas into an organized notes system. And the simplicity of the UI makes it easy to get all my random notes in order without spending much time reconstructing them. First, I start with an overview of my notes for the day. Let’s say I have a note for a color palette idea, a note for gradient images and the projects I intend to use them for, and a note with a link to a new Figma tutorial. I'll start by ensuring each note contains all the necessary information to fulfill the concept, such as hex codes for my color palette or an outline of the content in the tutorial. Then, I’ll drag them around on the notes canvas for a better flow. Because I use Keep for more than just design content, I only use the first three colors for Figma: Coral for links, Sand for ideas and challenges, and Peach for miscellaneous. This makes it super easy to get a quick overview of the type of Figma content that needs attention. I also use labels to sort all of my Keep notes into different categories. This way, I have separate spaces for areas like design, Figma, appointments, work, etc., and don’t have to fish through the main collection of notes to find something. Keep also has reminders, which I use on occasion, but I prefer doing design work in my own time. And as a solo creator, the collaboration feature also doesn’t get much love from me, but it’s nice knowing it’s there for future collabs.
Using checklists
Keep simplifies the project steps
My workflow is a combination of best practices and my own steps, so the process can be a little all over the place. To ensure I stay on track with a Figma design, I write down the steps to go from ideation to completion. For example, on my mobile login page design, the first step is layout, then icon placement, then text, followed by the colors, and so on. Keep’s checklists (which is its to-do list feature) couldn’t make this simpler. All I have to do is hit New List, give it the title of my project, and start typing my steps (hitting Enter creates a new checklist item). Once I’ve completed something and checked the box, Keep moves that item to the bottom of the list and grays it out. This visual demonstration of completion is like a little reward and motivates me to finish the whole project.
There’s a drawing tool built in
Every designer needs one
This is not a feature I expected to find in Keep when I first started using it. In the text bar, you can select New Note With Drawing, and it’ll open a canvas with a couple of drawing tools. It’s not a drawing suite or anything, but it’s perfect for lo-fi layout ideas that I can later elaborate on in Figma. There are a couple of brush types and sizes, colors, an eraser tool, and a transform tool. I imagine Keep’s drawing feature would be awesome for tablets with a stylus, especially for making wireframes on the go, but it works perfectly fine on phones and computers too.
Keep-ing things organized
Keep captures, organizes, and tracks my design ideas and tasks, while Figma handles the execution. This combination reduces lost ideas, organizes my resource chaos, speeds up iteration, and, most importantly, keeps the mental load manageable. Figma or not, any creator who struggles with messy projects can benefit from integrating Google Keep.
