The hidden costs of self-hosting
By
Joe Rice-Jones
Published Sep 15, 2025
Maker, meme-r, and unabashed geek, Joe has been writing about technology since starting his career in 2018 at KnowTechie. He's covered everything from Apple to apps and crowdfunding and loves getting to the bottom of complicated topics. In that time, he's also written for SlashGear and numerous corporate clients before finding his home at XDA in the spring of 2023.
He was the kid who took apart every toy to see how it worked, even if it didn't exactly go back together afterward. That's given him a solid background for explaining how complex systems work together, and he promises he's gotten better at the putting things back together stage since then.

Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
I'm fully onboard with the recent push towards self-hosting services and apps, whether to
reduce subscription costs,
retain data sovereignty, or pick up some new handy skills. My home lab has NAS units, mini PCs, and is about to get a
Mac Studio and a powerful Threadripper workstation, all running different tasks. Some of these services came with additional setup that was mostly glossed over by the initial tutorials, but that's far from the only thing that isn't apparent when you take those first few steps into self-hosting.
That's mainly because everything has a cost associated with it. You might not notice, as your brain is thinking of the money you will save monthly by not paying for cloud subscriptions, but those costs are still there. They could be in time, hardware costs, backup costs, or more intangible costs like the amount of brain energy you have to handle tasks, but they exist, and I've found out the hard way that sometimes they're not much different from cloud subscriptions.
Transferred costs
Hardware, software, and the big one — electricity
I might be one of the few home labbers who doesn't have a room full of cheap old enterprise parts, but that's not for lack of trying. It always seemed that those decommissioned rackmount servers disappeared before I messaged, or the rack went to someone else, or any number of other reasons that it never panned out. The only things I have are a few dual SFP+ Mellanox 10GbE/25GbE NICs, which I grabbed off eBay. Maybe that's a good thing, because while my electricity costs are around $0.13 per kWh, the additional costs of supply, etc. brings that closer to $0.45 per kWh. If a 15W mini PC can host the services that I need, using a large rackmount server seems superfluous and wasteful. Most of
my hard drives and SSDs are similarly new, because while I know used drives can be just as reliable, they don't come with the same level of warranty support, and I'm wary of anything without aftersales support because things go wrong, frequently.
Open source and self-hostable doesn't always mean that the software is free, whether that's a subscription to remove nag screens and get access to the latest updates like with Proxmox, or more stable packages and customer support in the case of OPNsense. Buying DVDs to encode for your Jellyfin or Plex server has a cost, as does the DVD drive, because what computer comes with one of those nowadays?
Don't forget domain registration and other networking services
Self-hosting is easier when your services are linked to a domain, and while you can use local domains, having a public domain is always a good idea. Even if you're cybersquatting on your own name, paying the yearly domain registration means nobody else can impersonate you, and you get a domain name to use for reverse proxies or for using subdomains to make sense of your Docker stack. And I'll always recommend having a cheap VPS with several services running on it, because self-hosting doesn't have to mean everything is under your roof. In fact, some services like remote access or VPNs are better when hosted off-site, as you can sidestep issues with your ISP or access services without needing to keep ports open through your home firewall.
And every Watt you cool needs removing from your office air
My NAS has plenty of storage space and is fairly efficient, even if it's a quad-core Xeon. But I recently transferred all active data to an all-flash mini PC because it has a CPU with a TDP of 15W at the most, and even with 5W (max) for each of the six NVMe drives, that's less than the CPU of the older NAS unit uses. All summer I've been suffering somewhat because the devices I self-host are all in my office, and every Watt of power that they consume is partly radiated into my room in heated air. Every bit of heated air means my air conditioning needs to work that little bit harder, and when it can't keep up, I suffer. The eventual goal is to move most of the equipment either into the network cabinet under the stairs or into the garage, where they can offload heat without it getting to my working area, but some devices I still need easy access for and those are staying in the office.
I haven't tallied up the exact costs, but I'm pretty confident that for every cent I spend on server electricity, I'm spending nearly a cent on cooling costs. Every piece of equipment I can make more efficient or swap for lower-power units is a blessing for my self-hosted empire.
More hidden costs
After a night of wrestling containers, sanity starts to become one as well
I'm not quite done with practical considerations yet, because if you want to rival the cloud subscriptions you were replacing, you need to think about uptime. That's a multi-faceted thing of its own, with tools like Keepalived to handle failover between multiple copies of running services, Proxmox clusters to ensure uptime, an uninterruptible power supply in case of blackouts, and a seemingly never-ending list of additions. Depending on where you are in the world, you might run into issues with your ISP plan. My ISP both blocks some ports necessary for self-hosting, and has CGNAT for even more fun when trying to reach my network from outside. I could pay for a business connection, but that's over twice the price of what I pay now, and the benefits are few. I'm thankful I don't have bandwidth or data caps, because that would be even worse but that's a situation many find themselves in. And then there are invisible costs. Your mental well-being is often overlooked because things start out fine, as a hobby, but it often soon balloons into an unpaid network admin job on top of your normal job and your family responsibilities. Thoughts like "this will only take a minute" soon turns into eight hours of troubleshooting only to find that the fix was something fairly small.
Add backup costs to your considerations
Keeping up with the not-inconsiderable data needs of self-hosting soon gets expensive. You've got local storage that needs maintaining, increasing, and replacing when drives die. Then an equal amount of storage somewhere else, as a mirrored backup for the onsite, and a third, equal amount of data on another physical set of drives. It all adds up, and if it wasn't for wanting privacy and your data being in your own hands, it might even be cheaper and easier to use the cloud subscriptions you were trying to get away from. Oh, and one of your backups should be offsite, which could be the cloud, but at least Backblaze or Mega or Amazon Glacier are cheaper than active cloud storage.
Sometimes it's more cost-effective to stick with the cloud
Don't get me wrong, I love self-hosting and it's been an incredibly rewarding journey of self-expression, knowledge gathering, and self-reliance. But I can't say it's been considerably cheaper than using cloud services, not when I factor in every other thing. But the increase in privacy and the knowledge that I can, is worth every cent.

The difference is how much and that it is running a high idle (or low load) all the time.Like i was thinking 10-15$a month max but it's now like 30$a month

No real surprise that it can cause the costs to go up, but an enterprise xeon eats a lot more power than an N150 CPU, and for most homelabbers the N150 mini PC will meet the needs without much of a problem.My collection has been mostly previously enterprise mini PCs from Dell, Lenovo, and Intel NUCs, and even that's more than enough for my needs.The only place I might wish for a larger electrical footprint is for having enough storage spaces for a DIY high capacity NAS with RAID and 5+ drives.

a lot of these are valid. Depending on the hardware costs, for example, something as simple as a NAS could actually cost just as much, if not more, than cloud hosting.Unfortunately, self-hosting anything is DIY and equating it to being cheaper is usually a logical fallacy. If you don't spend more money, you're going to at least spend more time (and vice versa). Treat it more like a project or moral/ethical choice rather than a way of being frugal.And even that alone is plenty of reason for most people to not bother.

Like wrestling with pihole for nearly a week before I just went with external Ad Guard DNS? Didn't seem like an accomplishment that time...The networking issues drove me to take a university course in Linux Networking. But honestly, if it wasn't my 20-ish containers, I'd be playing with something else. Good thing I'm retired…I really should plug my system into a power monitor next time I unplug.

I am running a Chinese system that has laptop chip soldered to a desktop matx motherboard and it's super powerful whilst sipping not that much at idle, if I stop my HDDs it will be around 25w, it can transcode in 4k, but rarely has to so the electricity isn't an issue. It still comes out far cheaper than a 4k Netflix subscription in my country where electricity is very expensive right now. I've had my used Amazon drives for a year now, they were very good when the came, long spin time but very few startups, still in single digits, I also got an Amazon 4 year insurance policy on them for cheap, I've used this Amazon insurance policy before on my broken Nintendo switch and it was good. I absolutely agree with the sanity thing. I've felt like ripping my brains out of my skull on quite a few occasions, mostly with setting up services with installation scripts that regularly have errors that take a long ass time to fix, but also some docker services.

How is it selfhosting when you let someone else host it?My server is on the lower side of power consumption. It has an i5-9500 and no extra gpu.

There are free ways to backup Docker yourself and it's not hard. Or am I missing something? I haven't played with Docker later but a quick Google search turned up a few easy ways for free.

Excellent overview. Especially the human resources required (8 hours to fix a 1 minute setting) are often overlooked. Not to mention that you should have a backup physically separated in case of major disasters? Which means a VPS somewhere. Which is cloud again. Except if you have a cousin in another country. :)

Went in fully knowing each switch uses 200-300W and servers... almost 400W but it accelerates your career so its worth it. Well, for me at least it's worth it

Never used a VPS and never have needed one. I'm not sure that's really a hard homelab cost. I opted to spend that money on a getting ISP redundancy instead with the lowest cheapest tier from the cable provider while my primary is fiber. Combine that with a tiny reverse proxy 'dmz' and a pair of Technicium DNS servers for authoratative zones and you have your domain, name servers, and ha proxy service undsr your own roof and as a bonus you have basic internet service if your primary ISP goes down. As far as heat, I built a little Nook into my attic to act as my server closet. I built it with the extraction of heat in mind so all the exhaust it going directly into the attic. With a fan to help move it along. Both a cool air fan intake from the room it's next to as well as a dedicated 6" duct for AC air that has an electric shutter.
Based on digital thermometer reading, the intake fan will turn on, and if that's not enough it will also open the ac duct. All this along with insulation kept me from having to coexist with the hot servers and brought the electric bill down.Also most servers and hardware can tolerate more heat than what feels right to most of us. Raising my server closets nominal upper end temps from. 80 to 90 degrees further lowered my bill with no effect on my hardware. It bothers me more than the servers. 😂

"basic internet service if your primary ISP goes down." Luxury! If my fibre goes down, there are zero real alternatives here (no cable, last ISP I had was wireless over 3G, before that satellite)

I too enjoy the ease and convenience of paying corporate overlords to do things for me that I can do for myself. Buy my power, rent my data, and rent my storage all from people who have a vested interest in destroying my democracy, so really, paying them helps to undermine my entire existence, which is a win win if you think about. This guy knows!

Host your own movies (plex or jellyfin), music, and gaming (emulator station that doubles as a dedicated gaming computer projected or directly connected to living room tv) and it is well worth it.
I have a used Dell server, used Cisco programmable switch, used fortigate firewall, and 2 $100 mini PCs that i dropped under $600 on total.
Plus my older gaming pc rig i wasnt using for years.

Pcloud. Hosted in Switzerland with Swiss privacy and encryption at rest and in transit. $1150 for 10TB lifetime. Which, when you factor in buying 1-2 NAS and at least 2x 10TB enterprise or NAS drive + power for the lifetime of the NAS device then PCloud is probably considerably less expensive.
When you think about the lifetime of that data…then factor in the replacement cost of said drives and NAS devices, then PCloud is a far better value. I have PCloud and self-host several “enterprise” NAS devices, but it’s silly to pretend that my setup at home was more economical than PCloud. Any single NAS device alone costs 2-4x what my lifetime PCloud subscription did. However, I have 3/4 petabyte of storage at home, and I’m not sure PCloud would achieve those economies of scale. Then again, maybe they would or better? Also, I can’t host a Plex or Jellyfin server using PCloud storage and get reliable playback (without some “always keep on this device” feature, which means I still have to have enough local storage), far less do transcoding of 4K HDR content. I also can’t spin up 30+ VMWare or Hyper V boxes and 100+ Docker or K8s on PCloud. So, I think it also depends on what that data is, not just the raw ability to store it.

I don't really get people complaining about electricity costs for running a server. Seriously, how much can it possibly cost... Using that logic, the best would be not have any electrical appliances. Do you turn off the tv every time you go out of the room? Do you decrease the volume on avrs and speakers? Do you turn off the security camera when you are home? Unplug the fridge during winter season? And by any means don't use any smart devices, they will cost you at least 1$ of electricity in their entire lifetime... If it's really that big of a deal, put up a solar panel and it will power your server and all the smart tech

"A solar panel" won't power a typical home lab. Even my little installation is running around 100W. That's 2.4kWh daily. Typical solar panels are 200W. In most places, that'll generate for no more than 5 hrs/day on average. That's 1kWh. Where I live we get an average of 4.2hrs sunlight per day. If you live in an equatorial desert, you'll still get less than 2.4kWh, daily, from a 200W panel.

If you really want to go into the numbers. My little installation, is running around 50-60W, with peaks to around 200W (when the GPU load is high). On average it's under 1.5kWh daily. Typical solar panels, these days, are 400W. So, a single panel covers it easily. And I'm not talking about running a RPi or some super efficient mini PC. I'm running a beefy consumer grade PC with a decent GPU.My point wasn't if it takes 1 or 2 panels, the point is that it's not so bad as people make it out to be. One washing machine/dryer/dishwasher cycle consumes around the same amount as a server in 24h.

It's easier if you do what? Register a DNS? Why? It's not easier at all.... It just makes it simpler for stoopid people to target you. You can easily host behind a static IP with no DNS pointing at you.

You don't think the stoopid people will attack you if you only use an IP? Surely most of them are just running through netblocks. Make it harder for yourself, for no extra value.

Derek I've heard of people launching attacks based on DNS because you can't evade it by changing your IP.
If you know a DNS points to the IP... It's much better to target the namespace - ppl are generally reluctant to change that.
