Kate is the IDE you needed to replace VS Code

If you're just stepping into the world of programming, the right Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is an absolute must. After all, that's where you would be doing all the programming before executing your code. There are quite a few popular options for a good IDE, with Visual Studio Code — more commonly known as VS Code — being a favorite among programmers. VS Code offers extensive features and a large extension library that make coding easier. When I was trying to learn to code a few months back, I was looking for IDEs to try, since I wanted to experiment with new options. That's when I came across Kate. My basic requirement was a free, open-source, and lightweight alternative. Kate, an advanced text editor from the KDE community, fits the bill perfectly. It's a multi-document editor that has a bunch of useful features — making it the perfect alternative to VS Code. The best part is that it's super light and nimble, so it runs on pretty much any hardware without breaking a sweat. It's also quite user-friendly, making it a good fit for beginners who are just dipping their toes into the world of programming. Even after using it for a few weeks, I haven't bothered switching to a different IDE, even though KDevelop is also available.
Easy to set up and use
Up and running in a couple of minutes
Installing Kate is as simple as downloading the relevant installation file for your computer's operating system and following the installation instructions. I use an M1 Pro Mac for coding, so I downloaded the DMG file for ARM-based chipsets. While setting up Kate is extremely quick and simple, using the app is also a similar experience. Compared to VS Code, Kate starts almost instantly when I click on the icon to launch it. This is an important factor for older machines. The interface is clean and minimal, with only the bare minimum options displayed in the programming console. Everything else is tucked away in the menu bar. This provides a focused coding session, while also ensuring the UI doesn't look cluttered. That said, there are several useful features in the UI, like a split-screen view that lets you open multiple programs at once for comparison, toolbar customization, code folding, etc.
Simple yet powerful
Limited but useful extensions
While it may be simple in terms of appearance and UI, Kate has a bunch of useful features that programmers will certainly appreciate. For starters, there's a built-in terminal that makes it easy to organize and test your code without switching between multiple apps or needing external tools. If you're writing Python code and have Python 3 installed on your computer, you can use the terminal inside Kate to execute your program directly. Then, there's the code completion feature that works for over 200 programming languages. If you're a beginner or you work with code in different languages, this feature lets you easily distinguish between different elements like variables, comments, loops, and other parts of the syntax. Then come the plugins. Here's where VS Code (and KDevelop) certainly has an upper hand compared to Kate — at least in terms of sheer volume. While Kate has fewer extensions compared to VS Code, they're all quite useful and powerful. There are four main plugins that work with Kate: LSP Client, Project Plugin, Build Plugin, and Terminal Plugin. The LSP client provides the code completion feature I mentioned earlier, along with error highlighting and go-to-definition features for popular programming languages like Python, C++, and Java. The Project plugin organizes your files into projects that can be easily sorted. This helps with navigating between multiple codes. The Build plugin helps with simplifying the compilation process and running the code. Finally, the Terminal plugin enables the built-in terminal mentioned earlier. Head to Settings -> Configure Kate -> Plugins to enable or disable any of the plugins mentioned above. It's slightly disappointing that there's no support for external plugins, as that would have made it the perfect alternative to VS Code, even for power users who need various plugins for different workflows.
A more streamlined experience
While VS Code may still have an upper hand in terms of features and extensions, the simple nature of Kate makes it a good option for those who don't necessarily need all the bells and whistles offered by VS Code. This way, you're also getting an app that doesn't take up resources unnecessarily in the background. It's also well-suited for beginners, since the UI isn't as intimidating, and you can start typing code in any language, and the LSP client provides code completion prompts and error checking, without the need for any additional extensions or downloads. Notably, Kate is missing a few useful features that pro developers may miss, like advanced debugging, project-wide build automation, and an extensive plugin ecosystem. Owing to this, seasoned coders may want to label it as a lite version of an IDE. That said, beginners and intermediate coders will appreciate the simple interface and no-frills experience.

Looks like an article from someone who doesn't write code for a living. Is XDA became just a bunch of random posts with no real value?

unfortunately, there are a number of sites that make posts of no real valuefor a professional coder, like me, who does use Kate, i find it refreshing to find someone else who uses it like me but the no real value of your argument still holdsi personally use Kate for my coding and PyCharm for document formattingeverything else i do from the command linei only use PyCharm for one thing, but for others, it may be so many things that Kate isn't really an optionbut the target audience of this article is newbies, not seasoned coders like yourself

VS Code and Visual Studio are Microsoft products. If you write Microsoft code like C# or ASP.NET use them, they are some of the best IDEs available and free. Easy to use also for beginners. You start VS, you create your first project and VS provides you already with all the code to run the program, even you have not added your own code yet.I also wonder why someone who said he has little coding experience ("When I was trying to learn to code a few months back") can give expert advice. People new to programming need advice from someone with experience.

this isn't expert adviceit's advice for newbies starting to code
even for non-newbies, like me, i use Kate for 90% of my coding and PyCharm for the restit's really not a bad IDE even though PyCharm has way more features

Cant take someone who uses Mac to program code seriously. Mac isnt the platform, Linux or Windows with Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio 2022 yes. Kate is not that great Sublime is better but why would you give up VS Code no way.

Kate is far from being an IDE. Try this, you search for a word. Kate doesn't know how many of occurrences of that word there are in the file. VS codium will tell you that. When you navigate among the occurrences it tell you the position like 5/7. You view a JSON or YAML file, select.an element, can you get the path of the element?And how about git? Like 3 panes merge conflict resolution? Compare curent to a branch in git. Compare two files either in project or already opened? Try IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (free) it beats Kate by a 100km.

Like any IDE it takes some practice to drive, e.g. rather than using the basic Find use Find in Files, which gives you what you are looking for - highlight search word, issue <ctrl>+<shift>+<F>...Most of the other features are available in one form or another but generally require some config. Some defaults don't make a lot of sense, e.g. you really want to enable Restore Open Projects, under Settings>Configure Kate>Projects>Session Behavior.OOB, Kate supports a multitude more (coding) langs than IntelliJ IDEA, but what IntelliJ does, it does well. I used to use Eclipse mostly for JVM dev (the limited amount I do), but I barely use it anymore in favour of Kate.I mainly use Code and Kate, and rarely Studio anymore, but find myself using Kate more and more often, especially when working on multiple projects simultaneously. It really comes down to expertise with the lang in focus and whether you need an integrated debugger for your target (ymmv with Kate).If starting from scratch, it's often easier to start a project in a template driven IDE and
once mature use more lightweight variants like Kate. Obviously if you have a KDE, your more likely to have had exposure to Kate too.

quotient Don't worry bro I'll sum up your tldr for everyone "I need lsp so I use kate because I can't figure out the 3 extra buttons on vsc. I also have no idea what right click does and have no idea how to use search unless I ask a llm so kate is better because I have to do less and learn less."

I could be mistaken but isn't kdevelop dead?
Its last update appears to be 2020.
Why then reference it?

Yeah and what an AmaZiNg update that was.... I'm surprised the update wasn't a app brick. Couldn't even put it down for good. They let it (and us) suffer for 18 months before they gave any inclination we lost our paddle 3 miles up stream.

Kate as an IDE? Is this article meant to be parody? Next up, you'll be suggesting vi as an IDE.> When I was trying to learn to code a few months back,You should not be writing articles on something you have no experience in. You're doing the equivalent of suggesting a 2x2 camping tent to someone looking to buy a new house.

VSC is not the best thing ever... Now that I've said that....Sumukh... Bro... You can't drop a "pro tip" blog on XDA about programming if you're new to it. You were doing phone and tech reviews less than a year ago. I love that you are trying to get into programming but you need to ACTUALLY know what you are saying if you are going to give a recommendation here. You are going to lead people that are trying to learn down the wrong path. It's not okay and it's not cool. This is exactly why XDA is dying. Posts like these acting like the OP knows what they are saying and trying to solve problems that don't exist. VSC is also free and user friendly. It also has WAY more integrations than some other IDE's. KATE shouldn't be called an IDE and you really shouldn't speak on the matter since you just "recently learned to code". Leave your vibe code bullcrap off XDA. If you can't write a single line of REAL code yourself that won't cause a security risk at 7-11 then don't post acting like you should be allowed to give advice. People come to XDA for EXPERTS not some kid that uses AI to write a script and then asks it to write a blog about it. Y'all are going to ruin XDA... Mark my words.

Ain't no way bro thinks he can give advise after just starting. Here's my 3 step guide to the perfect IDE after a decade of experience.1. Do you wanna be a programmer/Developer?Yes --> Keep reading.No --> Why are you even here?2. Do you have money?Yes --> Jet brains.No --> VSC*de.3. You don't like Micr*soft?Yes --> VS Codium.Yes but I also don't like electron, and I bit*h about small things that aren't the way I want them or think should be different --> Neovim.No, I love Micr*soft, they are the best.--> VSC*de

I really don't understand the purpose of this article. VS code is also FOSS. Kate just looks like a 1:1 copy.

kate is like a speak and spell for kids learning to code with a lsp. It's like a 0.35:1 after you dig into both. VSC is "leave me alone and let me work" kate is "please daddy hold hand so I don't fall in the puddle".

Articles like this are why I am nearly always in favor of what the XDA blog has become.
There's nowhere else on the web where a novice to coding such as myself can go to learn about useful tools such as this.I'm confident that if XDA had been around in something approximating its current form 25 years ago I wouldn't have wasted my time teaching myself Action Script.
A programming language that was niche back then and 100% truly dead now.

This specific blog should not be used for learning. I have been a firm believer in XDA since 2006. It's no longer pros giving real advice. It's kids with AI trying to churn out posts for money. If you want to know the real heros look for people like Logix, orb3000 and Sam Nakamura. They were the ones you followed every word because they ACTUALLY wrote the code and they debugged it. They tested it. They put in their time and didn't ask for anything in return. That's only a few, there were legends before lsp was the default. Also... Python was created in 1989... So action script was over a decade late to the party but still couldn't hang.

As a novice to coding, you should really read the rest of the comments here. The person who wrote this article has less experience than you, and has no idea what they're talking about!
