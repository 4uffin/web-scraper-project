Give me a lighthearted recap
AMD's Ryzen CPUs have transformed the company's prospects, from an also-ran running out of money quickly, to the class leader in desktop and server processors. Recent releases like the Ryzen 9000 series have cemented its place ahead of rival Intel, and it doesn't look like that will change any time soon. With that knowledge, you might be tempted to use AMD for your CPU next build, and that's a good idea, but you should also know what little foibles you're getting. The biggest bugbear that AMD has tried to throw off is RAM compatibility. Part of this is because of Ryzen's architecture, with chiplets connected by the Infinity Fabric, an interconnect that passes data between the chiplets and the RAM. It's also partly because when Ryzen first came out, Intel was the dominant factor, so early CPUs had to use RAM modules that were tweaked for Intel CPUs, and didn't always run well with AMD. With Ryzen-specific modules on the market, that's also changed, but even with that, you should know about some potential issues and how to get past them.
Infinity Fabric clock ratio issues
There's a golden ratio for Ryzen and it's not 1:1.618
While many of these tips could apply to other CPUs, the Infinity Fabric is Ryzen specific. Essentially, it connects AMD's CPU chiplets to each other, but also acts as a chiplet-chiplet, CPU-CPU, and CPU-GPU interconnect for all data transfer on the motherboard. The Infinity Fabric runs at a specific frequency, FCLK, connecting all the parts of the CPU together. This can be linked to the memory clock or unlinked with a series of dividers and multipliers, so you can run higher memory than the memory controller officially supports. There are also two other clocks in Ryzen's memory architecture:
UCLK (Unified Memory Controller Clock): controls the speed of the memory controller in the I/O die
MCLK (Memory Clock): corresponds to the speed of the memory modules
This gives a FLCK:ULCK:MCLK ratio that's used across all generations of Ryzen, but in a slightly different way. For Ryzen up to and including 5000 series, AMD recommends a 1:1:1 ratio, but FCLK can be tweaked for better performance. Verify in BIOS that the UCLK ratio is set to 1:1 with MCLK, which will be half the rate of your memory speed. On Ryzen 7000 and 9000, AMD recommends an Auto:1:1 ratio, so the only factor that changes is UCLK, which will run at half the speed of the memory controller once you get to a certain point.
For AM4 Ryzen processors, the 1:1 ratio is maintained up to DDR4-3600 (5000 series can do DDR4-3733)
For AM5 Ryzen processors, the 1:1 ratio is maintained up to DDR5-6000 (Ryzen 9000 can do DDR5-6400)
The problem with this is that once you unlink the two, you get a performance hit. This can be okay, as if your RAM is fast enough, the latency hit is overcome. For AM4, DDR4-4000 was enough to overcome the latency when I was using that, but it was a pain to get working so DDR4-3600 is still the best option. For AM5, if you can get 8,000MT/s running on your CPU, that will be slightly better than 6,000 1:1, but not really by that much.
Mixed memory brands and modules
This is never a great idea but it's even worse on Ryzen
It's 2025, and mixing RAM kits can still be a risky proposition. It's tricky enough on Intel where the memory controller is usually better, but with Ryzen it can be a non-starter right out of the gate. It doesn't have to be from different manufacturers either, just the differences from two production runs of the same SKU can cause issues. These could include lowered speeds, lowered capacity, or random crashes and BSODs, so it's a tricky choice. You might be able to get away with mixed kits if you match the following exactly:
Memory type (DDR4 with DDR4, DDR5 with DDR5)
Speed (MHz)
CAS latency timings
Voltage requirements
Capacity per module
Even then, Ryzen's memory controller is known to be sensitive, and they might not work. The only way to really be sure is to buy a matched kit, whether that's for two DIMMs, four DIMMs, or eight DIMMs if you're buying for a Threadripper motherboard. Oh, and if you're filling all the RAM slots you need to know that you might not get the rated speed, because the memory controller on Ryzen 1000, 2000, 3000, and 5000 series slows right down if you do. On AM5 motherboards you might also run the risk of slower speeds, but it's less of a consideration.
Conflicts between single and dual rank modules
Just like brands and speeds, this can have your system crashing out
I will split this one into two sections, because AM4 Ryzen CPUs have issues with single and dual-rank DIMMs, while AM5 Ryzen only has the usual issues that any CPU would. The general rule of thumb is never to mix single-rank and dual-rank in the same memory channel. You can get away with using mixed modules if they're in different memory channels, and you have to disable memory interleaving in your BIOS to do so.
DDR4 with 8GB capacity is single-rank (usually), while anything higher will be dual-rank. That's the easiest way to guess if it doesn't say on the product page. For DDR5, 24GB is the cut-off where single-rank ends, and anything higher will be dual-rank.
Ryzen for the AM5 socket, however, uses DDR5, and while the memory controller might not be rated for super speeds, those speeds don't change if you're using single- or dual-rank DIMMs.

You might get issues if you mix single- and dual-rank, however, so check this before you add more RAM to a system that already has two DIMMs. The best option is still to go for all single-rank when filling every slot, which means 24GB per module currently. Any capacity higher than that will be dual-rank. For two modules only, use dual-rank DDR5 because the drawbacks are minimal and capacity is king.
EXPO or XMP issues
While Ryzen motherboards can read XMP values they might not always work
While XMP and EXPO aren't completely different technologies, they're not always comparable. XMP was a standard developed by Intel, while DOCP or EXPO are standards developed by AMD. They might define very similar profiles, but your motherboard might treat those very differently. That said, neither is a guaranteed overclock on any system, Intel or Ryzen, but you can do a few things to ensure the least amount of disappointment. For Ryzen, checking the QVL for your motherboard is one of the things you should do before buying anything. If the kit you've been eyeing isn't on that list, or is of a higher MT/s than those kits, you can still buy it but know you're probably not going to get the best out of it. Ryzen 7000 or 9000 owners should look for EXPO-certified kits as a first option, and the best price to performance is at DDR5-6000 at CL30. For Ryzen AM4, DDR4-3600 at any timings will be the best option. You might have to go into the BIOS and drop the memory speed slightly (eg 3600 to 3200), but otherwise you should be fine. Increasing VRAM voltage by 0.05V from the rated specification can give you enough of a boost to get the rated speeds.
Voltage and memory controller limitations
Each generation of Ryzen comes with different considerations
Every generation of Ryzen has a slightly different memory controller with varying capabilities and requirements to run at their best. The newer the Ryzen CPU the better, and AM5 Ryzen chips are easy to run at higher speeds if you have the right motherboard. Remember it's not just the CPU that governs RAM max speeds, so pair with a premium motherboard for the best chance of higher MT/s. These general rules will help you choose RAM that fits your CPU:
Ryzen 1000/2000: Struggle beyond DDR4-3200, weak memory controllers
Ryzen 3000/5000: Good up to DDR4-3600 with proper tuning
Ryzen 7000+: Native DDR5 support, aim for DDR5-5600 to DDR5-6000 at CL30 or below
Other things to monitor are SoC voltage, which should be under 1.2V for safety no matter which generation of Ryzen you own. DDR4 can easily run up to 1.5V for daily use (I ran mine at this for two years before upgrading to AM5 with DDR5), and DDR5 can vary between 1.1-1.35V depending on the speed you are running at. I wouldn't be too worried about RAM voltage. In my years of computing, the number of truly dead RAM kits I've had is small, and those were faulty, not abused with voltage.
Ryzen has had its share of RAM issues, but they're mostly ironed out now
Look, I don't want to put you off buying one of the
best CPUs around. AMD's Ryzen are the class leader in most segments, and if you go Intel you have other issues to contend with. Buying RAM for Ryzen isn't that difficult, you just need to go into it armed with the right information and tempered expectations. Then you'll be fine, whatever you choose.

You're confusing 1:1 FCLK:memclk with AM4 with 1:1 uclk:memclk with AM5.The only ratio that is 1:1 up to 6000 is UCLK:MEMCLK (memory controller: memory) after that it will automatically switch to 1:2. You can force 1:1 for added performance but anything after 6000-6200 is silicon lottery and likely won't be stable. Some get away with 6400 1:1 and I've even seen higher but anything above 6400 1:1 is pretty uncommon.Infinity fabric (FCLK) maxes out at around 2000-2200 so unless you're running DDR5 at 4000-4400 you're not getting a 1:1 FCLK:MEMCLK ratio nor would you want to.Memory latency/performance isn't very much impacted by infinity fabric ratios with AM5 and you obviously can not get a 1:1 memory to infinity fabric with AM5 at 6000. Also infinity fabric does not automatically do any ratio with AM5 like it did with AM4. FCLK maxes out at around 2000-2200 on AM5 so obviously a 3000:2000-2200 isn't 1:1. You can get a slight memory latency reduction if you do a 2:3 FCLK:MEMCLK ratio with running UCLK:MEMCLK in 1:1 or a 1:4 FCLK:MEMCLK with running UCLK:MEMCLK in 1:2 so running 2000 FCLK when running DDR5 6000 or running DDR5 8000 but you can also just get FCLK clocked as high as possible and not notice any real world difference.

Just finished fighting that bs with am5 9 x3d thought my 800 dollar chip was broken wanted to cry but then started removing everything think adding one thing at a time and it went from there and worked .

The CPU runs at 4800Mhz unless it's overclocked. 6000Mhz is the sweet spot it would overclock the memory to running a PBO at 5.9Ghz. You can put in 6400Mhz but it's not likely to be any better since the processor overclocks to 5.9Ghz from the Precision Boost Overdrive from AMD. The main thing is to make sure the memory is on the motherboard QVL for the best compatibility.

Only if your IMC can run 6400 at 1:1 UCLK:MEMCLK. It has nothing to do with infinity fabric like the article claims, it's all IMC silicon lottery. You would have to go in and manually set UCLK=MEMCLK and see how it runs. You could always bump it down to 6200 or 6000 though as almost any 9000 chip can do 6200 1:1 and almost any 7000 chip can do 6000 1:1

Phillip PBO and memory overclocks are 2 different things and the performance impact from one doesn't really impact the performance impact of the other.
