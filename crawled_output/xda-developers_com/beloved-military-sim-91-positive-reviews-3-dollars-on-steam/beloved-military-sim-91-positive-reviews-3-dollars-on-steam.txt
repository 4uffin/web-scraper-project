Give me a lighthearted recap
I've clocked my fair share of hours into Arma 3 with my friends. It may be 12 years old, but it's one of the more in-depth military simulators I've ever played. In fact, with so many years under its belt, its community has been hard at work developing mods and unique experiences that make it better than ever before. And yes, it is 12 years old. In fact, it has only just reached 12 years old, as the developers, Bohemia Interactive, have just celebrated its release anniversary. The best part is that we're all getting a gift for the game's birthday, as the devs have knocked the price down all the way to $3. An absolute steal, if you ask me.
Arma 3 is just $3 on Steam until September 25th
If you've never heard of Arma 3, it's a military simulator that's best played with friends or on a community server. The experience you'll have hugely depends on the server you pick; when I played with my friends, the server would automatically spawn enemies in a town and task us with clearing them out. Given how it's a military sim, it's not as easy as picking up a big gun, walking into the town, and fighting everyone off; in fact, we spent a lot of time on the outskirts trying to pick people off while hiding behind whatever cover we could find. Here's how the devs describe the game:
Experience true combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox. Deploying a wide variety of single- and multiplayer content, over 20 vehicles and 40 weapons, and limitless opportunities for content creation, this is the PC’s premier military game. Authentic, diverse, open - Arma 3 sends you to war.
Defeat your enemy on a richly detailed, open-world battlefield – stretching over 290 km² of Mediterranean island terrain. From expansive cities to rolling hills, whether steamrolling your tank across the dusty plains, flying a transport helicopter over the dense forests, or waging asymmetric warfare from the rocky hills, the islands of Altis and Stratis are dynamic worlds, which lend themselves to the most varied engagements in gaming.
If you want to give it a try yourself, it's currently enjoying its 12th anniversary with a 90% discount on Steam. There are several different editions available with varying discounts, but the one you'll want to check out is the base game edition, which is currently only $3 until September 25th. And if you need any more convincing, you may be interested to hear that the game's predecessor, Arma 2, was the foundation for a mod that would eventually become DayZ.
