If you've been looking for a new mechanical keyboard with a little flair that isn't going to hurt your wallet, the EPOMAKER RT 100 should be one to look out for. The brand dubs this keyboard as having a retro style, and even offers it in different colors. For the most part, we like the look. It's compact, and has small touches that really make the keyboard pop. Perhaps the first thing you'll notice about this keyboard is that it has a detachable LCD display, which is not something you see all that often. There's also a customizable control knob that can be used to control different action, and can also act to control your media as well.

As you might expect, you also get customizable RGB lighting, and the ability to connect using wired, Bluetooth, or a 2.4GHz wireless signal. The wireless options are supported by a 5,000mAh battery, and the keyboard also has excellent construction here that lends to a comfortable typing experience with a gasket-mount design, pre-lubed stabilizers, and swappable mechanical switches.
It's a pretty good keyboard for the price, packed with tons of features. It's usually priced at $110, but can now be had for much less thanks to a steep discount that drops it down to just $44. Whether it's your first mechanical keyboard or you're someone that collects, we think the EPOMAKER is worth taking a look at.
