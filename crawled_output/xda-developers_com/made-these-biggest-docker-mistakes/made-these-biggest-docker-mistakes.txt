Give me a lighthearted recap
My biggest Docker mistakes weren’t just about syntax errors or configuration issues. They were the kind of mistakes that led to security vulnerabilities, bloated images, and countless wasted hours. When I started with Docker, I was focused on one thing: getting it to work. I didn’t think about best practices, and I certainly didn’t anticipate the problems that would arise later on. This post is a confession. I will walk you through the biggest Docker blunders I made. My goal is to save you the headaches and late-night debugging sessions I went through, so you can build and use efficient containers from the very beginning.
Forgetting to set resource limits
A huge mistake
One of my earliest and most costly Docker mistakes was forgetting to set resource limits. I was new to containerization, and I thought my machine’s powerful hardware was more than enough to handle anything I threw at it. I was working on a local development project. I needed to run a batch job that processed a large dataset and dumped the output into a database. The script itself was fine, but I launched it with a simple Docker run command. Everything seemed okay at first, but after a few minutes, my laptop’s fan kicked into high gear, and the system began to slow down. When I finally managed to open my system monitor, I saw that the single Docker container was a resource hog, consuming nearly all of my available RAM and maxing out my CPU. It left nothing for the host operating system or my other applications. I had to force-kill the container to regain control of my laptop. From then on, I have made it a habit to define memory and CPU limits for any resource-intensive container.
Building every image from a Dockerfile
Just use the Docker Hub
When I first started with Docker, I made a big mistake. I thought I had to build every image from scratch. I would start with a basic Alpine image and then manually add everything I needed, like my programming language and its libraries. I believed this was the best way to keep my images small and simple. The truth was, this approach was a huge waste of time. I spent hours debugging Dockerfile commands just to get basic things to work. My builds were slow, and the images were often bigger than I intended because I didn’t know how to clean up temporary files correctly. That’s when I discovered official images on Docker Hub. Instead of building my own Node.js environment, I simply used the node:18-alpine image. It was already set up, tested, and optimized for me. My Dockerfile became much shorter and easier to read. By using an official image, I could stop worrying about the low-level details of my container’s operating system. After all, these images already contain the software you need (like Node.js, Python, or PostgreSQL) and are configured with best practices. I could trust that the image was secure and well-maintained by experts.
Trying to run multiple services within a single container
Single container, multiple processes blunder
When I was starting out with Docker, I thought I was being smart. My first project involved a web server and a database, and my initial thought was to put them both in a single container. It seemed logical — one container, one project. I figured it would be easy to manage and deploy. This idea was a huge mistake. My single container became a mess. If the database crashed, the whole container went down and took the web server with it. I couldn’t update just one part; I had to rebuild and redeploy the entire container for even the smallest change. As you can imagine, it was a nightmare to debug. I finally learned the core idea of Docker. By separating my web server and database into their own containers, everything became simple. I could manage them separately, scale them as needed, and update them without affecting the other. My web server container could be fast and light, while my database container could be robust and focused.
The command-line confusion
Docker run vs. docker start vs. docker exec
When I started, one of the most confusing things was the difference between docker run, docker start, and docker exec. I would find myself trying to use run when I should have used start, or I would get frustrated because I couldn’t get a command to work inside a running container. It felt like they all did a similar thing, but they didn’t, and mixing them up caused a lot of headaches. You should understand the differences between them before getting started with Docker.
Running as root
A dangerous default
One of the biggest security mistakes I made was running my containers as the root user. I didn’t realize that, by default, a container has root privileges. This means if an attacker finds a vulnerability inside my container, they could potentially get root access to my entire host machine. The solution is quite simple. I learned to add the USER instruction to my Dockerfile. This command creates a non-root user and then switches to it, so my application runs with limited permissions.
Best Docker practices
During my early days with Docker, I was focused on the destination: getting a container to run. I wasn’t thinking about security, efficiency, and maintainability that come with good practices. By avoiding these common pitfalls, you can save yourself precious time of debugging and frustration. So what are you waiting for? Learn from my mistakes and unlock an efficient, secure, and scalable workflow. Meanwhile, check out these Docker containers to boost your productivity.

More technology writers should try to write in this style. I know what Docker is, but I'm neither a developer nor a programmer. And yet I enjoyed the read. I could basically understand the language and explanations.

What your container can access is limited by what you allow in your docker compose. So no, if someone finds a vuln in your container, this is not an open door to your host.You can make your container dangerous for the host, but you must mean it. Another vector is a vulnerability on the docket engine itself, it must be really kept up to date

First of all. How would you even run 2 services in one container? It's one image per service and one image per container. So its fine to run 2 or more services in one compose, but not in one container

Quite easily, investigate something like honcho, or supervisord.There are absolutely times when it makes sense to run multiple processes in one service, but it should _definitely_ not be your default.
