Give me a lighthearted recap
Open-world games are a dime a dozen, and while the idea of being able to 'go anywhere, do anything' was once incredible, it's been a couple of generations since we've gotten used to them. Today, one could argue that we've got too many open-world maps, with way too many fetch quests and points of interest to go check out for XP. Still, there are a few that are a cut above the rest, because their devs took the time out to make those open-world maps special. And how are they special? Well, the best open-world maps don't make you feel like they are game worlds created for you to explore. Instead, they make you realize that you're a guest in this already-thriving, lived-in world which existed long before you arrived, and will keep going long after you leave. These incredible open-world games and their maps prove how immersion doesn't come from scale, but rather, authenticity.
The Commonwealth – Fallout 4
The apocalypse never felt so alive
Fallout 4 was the first Fallout game I ever had the pleasure of playing, and boy did it leave an impact. To this day, there's something profoundly unsettling about the Commonwealth in that game. Sure, there are plenty of barren wastelands and repetitive patches of gray-brown tones in this map, too, but Boston? Despite being a post-apocalyptic world, it still feels... alive. The neighborhoods I visited told stories etched into crumbling brick, still alive while clearly being destroyed. Every corner you turn in Fallout 4, you will come across something that undeniably had life before, be it a diner or a school. That's exactly the kind of spirit that has always felt missing from Fallout 76. I think the best way to describe the Commonwealth and why it feels like such an incredible open world is that it reminds you of a graveyard. In Fallout 4, there is always enough content and depth to create infinite branching storylines, and whether you decide to align with the Brotherhood, the Railroad, or the Institute, those titanic movements and groups are still going to command the same weight they always have, regardless of you. Moreover, it's a decade old today, but boy does it still look and play great, thanks to intelligent and long-lasting game design.

1860s London – Assassin's Creed Syndicate
One of the best-realized worlds in the series
I consider myself extremely lucky for having played Assassin's Creed Syndicate at the time I did. Why? Because I was in eleventh grade, and that was the exact time that we were learning about the Industrial Revolution in History class. So what we read and discussed in class? I'd see parts of it when I got home and booted up AC Syndicate — soot-coated factory walls, thick clouds of black air over the Thames, and all the important historical figures we crammed notes for. That experience alone made my playthrough of AC Syndicate one of the very best of my life, but of course, it wouldn't have been this memorable had it not been for Ubisoft learning everything they did from Unity and putting their soul into Victorian London to create one of the most alive and responsive Assassin's Creed worlds in this fantastic franchise. I've definitely lost count of how many times I took a Leap of Faith off Big Ben, or how many screenshots I took of factories or coal heaps that I could've sworn came right out of my History book. The factory whistles scream, and the gangs clash in the alleys, while horse carriages rattle down the cobbled streets of London in AC Syndicate, all coming together to turn it into a rare digital city I kept mentally going back to while in class. The Frye twins and their charisma certainly helped the game, but London was inarguably the most dominant character in the game.

Hong Kong – Sleeping Dogs
I wish more games gave us Hong Kong
Sleeping Dogs will always be one of the best 'GTA-clones' ever created, and 13 years later, it's a shame that we never really got a sequel to this fantastic open-world adventure that nearly beat GTA at its own game. The best part about the game, by a mile, was its tiny, consolidated but vibrant map of Hong Kong, which really made me feel like I was stepping into a culture more than I was playing a game. In fact, the smaller scale of the map helped keep it more interesting, with brilliant neon lights flanking every road, beautiful warm lamps lighting up the night sky, all while you ran around in bloodstained clothes from a back alley brawl. Sleeping Dogs gave us a fully-realized city with neighborhoods that oozed personality, and sometimes, I just didn't even bother driving. I'd just go into a night market, order street food, get into a fistfight or two, and then finally hop on a bike and race down the highways of Hong Kong, slick with the rain. Here's hoping the upcoming Sleeping Dogs movie achieves enough success to warrant a sequel.

The Continent – The Witcher 3
Deserves its flowers for its sunsets alone
I'd have put The Witcher 3 and The Continent on this list for its sunsets alone, but when it comes to immersion, this decade-old game is still one of the best to ever do it, and that's thanks to CDPR, who definitely know how to birth an open world. The map is vast and sprawling, all while being alive in a way that makes every single journey you take unpredictable. You'll come across villages scarred by war, still singeing from atrocities, while peasants and townsfolk whisper about monsters. It's impossible not to feel like you're intruding on someone's tragedy wherever you go in The Witcher 3, and that is where this amazing RPG's brilliance lies.
Based on how much time you spend in the game, the farmers' crops grow, and the beasts stalk the woods, preying on other animals or people, regardless of Geralt being around or not. This is a map so meticulously detailed and packed with history, that it's impossible not to feel like you're in a world that has already lived centuries of stories.

Hitman: World of Assassination
Mini open-worlds with a life truly their own
After... whatever Hitman: Absolution was, IO interactive pivoted this fabled franchise into one of the best possible directions it could have — open-world, self-contained sandboxes for each level. Whether it's Sapienza, Mumbai, or Dubai, the World of Assassination trilogy absolutely nails the open-world feel of its maps, through and through. Each level, venue, and city is always teeming with life, detail, and tons of environmental storytelling that you couldn't possibly pick up on without playing it ten times over. Waiters gossip, security guards call home or confide in friends, and sure, they might get knocked out and get their clothes stolen in a minute or two, but they feel human throughout.
Again, the brilliant part here is that even if you were to never touch your controller, these intricately-crafted maps in this amazing trilogy would still go on without you. The fashion show in Paris? It would go on smoothly and come to an end properly. The markets of Marrakesh? They would remain bustling, and that's what makes the new Hitman games and their levels so remarkably immersive. Despite being the greatest assassin in the world, you're simply not the center of this world. What you are, though, is an intruder, bending these sandboxes to your will.

Night City – Cyberpunk 2077
The greatest urban jungle ever to grace our machines
I went back to Night City in Cyberpunk 2077 for about an hour last week after having finished the campaign and the brilliant Phantom Liberty DLC back in 2023. Five minutes in, I was hooked again. The sounds, the lights, the mega buildings, the vehicles, the NPCs and their chatter, and the entire atmosphere of that in-game world is genuinely akin to nothing else. Sure, the game got off to one of the rockiest starts ever, but the final product we have today is one of the best urban environments ever created. Santo Domingo's tight roads feel like a well-built city with verticality, while the air around Dogtown is oppressive, and Pacifica... is still Pacifica. Night City, for all its beautiful vistas and streets, is still the villain in every story you could fathom in Cyberpunk 2077, and that's what makes it not just an incredible immersive map, but also lends to it a depth that few other games or maps can achieve. It's an overwhelming sensory nightmare at every step, and when you say you can get lost in Night City? That's by design.

Kamurocho District – Yakuza series
A district that has gotten the most love from devs and fans alike
If there's one slice of Tokyo that has gotten an immense amount of love consistently over decades, it's the Kamurocho district from the Yakuza games. Over so many games, we've seen the series refine and expand this fictional district, and for a lot of the players, it genuinely has begun feeling like home at this point. You can go hit a bar, sing your heart out in a karaoke joint, spend time at the arcade, or just interact with shopkeepers trying to earn an honest living, and that's what good, unforgettable immersion is all about. The best part, of course, is how each game lets you revisit old haunts, too, so you get to see them evolve and change alongside the story. It's the aspect of familiarity that makes Kamurocho feel like a second home with a pulse of its own, and I've never once gone walking through its streets without also looking up airfares to Tokyo before gently closing those tabs and apologizing to my bank account.

Prague – Deus Ex: Mankind Divided
Night City isn't the only great cyberpunk city out there
Prague in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is one of my favorite open-world maps of all time, and it's not without reason. I still re-visit it from time to time, whether it's to test out a new monitor or benchmark a GPU, or just try out new filters on the game occasionally. It was never as big as a traditional open-world map, and it definitely wasn't expansive, but what Prague lacked in scale, it made up in density and immersion. The city lends itself to the narrative structure of the game, too, making sure that the oppression and tension are palpable every single minute.
This is a city where guards line every alley and street, and bigotry runs rife in almost every conversation you overhear while walking through the city. Walking past an NPC almost always invokes a response, and you feel the disdain the writers want you to feel. Every street and back alley has a meaningful secret for you to find, whether through magazines, or someone's emails about their worldview. That's the level of immersion that Prague made unforgettable, and I'll always be a little mad about never getting a sequel to see Eidos and Square Enix finish off this amazing trilogy.

The Lands Between – Elden Ring
This is how you make an open-world map unforgettable
Elden Ring is one of the greatest games ever made, yes, but it's also a masterclass in open-world design — something I hope every game learns from. No, it isn't a bustling map teeming with life or light. Instead, The Lands Between radiate mystery, history, and decay — eons of it. The world in FromSoft's Elden Ring has existed for millennia before you even opened your eyes, and every crumbling castle, rotting lake, drowned village, and fallen tree is a reminder of exactly that. The socio-political tensions you insert yourself into have always existed, and always will. Cults conspiring, races rebuilding themselves, and communities either thriving or slowly decaying — all of this goes on in Elden Ring, and depending on how you play your cards, you only get insight into some of it. However, during this entire time, every single place in The Lands Between you set foot in will take your breath away with its sad, muted beauty.
You could set out in one direction, and six hours later (like yours truly), find yourself walking through dungeons you didn't even know existed, in an area you simply didn't know the world had. Through tons of lore and secrets running amok, Elden Ring manages to create a world that is alive, not through everyday bustle, but its sheer depth and authenticity. In fact, another reason why it becomes one of the most unforgettable open world maps ever is how it gives you... nothing. To explore The Lands Between, you must set out yourself, in any direction you please, and follow what you deem interesting, thus building a deeper connection with every inch of this brilliantly-crafted, admirably-designed map.

The United States – Red Dead Redemption 2
It is still the gold standard
No discussion about any open-world game could ever be complete without giving Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption its due credit. Even among the greatest ones, very few maps have come close to feeling as alive and breathtaking as the 19th-century America we got in 2018's Red Dead Redemption 2. Seven years later, it remains the gold standard for creating the perfect, most believable open-world map, and that's saying something. RDR2 gave us a living, breathing ecosystem where NPCs had their own day-and-night routines, and every animal, blade of grass, and NPC just... exists in its entirety, without having anything to do with you for the large part. The best part? RDR2 always remembers it's a game, so you can always play around with this world and its characters, but even without you, they'll continue living on.
The towns bustle with believable routines, and the wilderness is gorgeous to look at, all while still being real in the way it punishes you if you're not careful. One of the most authentic open-world experiences ever, Red Dead Redemption 2's immersion could perhaps only be surpassed by Grand Theft Auto VI, considering how it's taken Rockstar more time to make the game than has passed since RDR2 graced our consoles.

The best open-world games give you unforgettable immersion
Here's what ties all these maps together, as I've said before. It's the sense that they don't need you. These immersive open-world games and their worlds have a magic about them that keeps you in awe of everything you see, hear, and experience, all while reminding you at every turn that you're only a visitor in this beautiful digital world.
