5 self-hosted services I tried to love, but later uninstalled

Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Experimenting with self-hosted services has been one of the most rewarding ways for me to learn about running a server, working in Docker, and networking to tie it all together. While I'm still early in my self-hosting journey, I've tried my fair share of services. Some look great on paper, only to become more trouble than they’re worth. These five are the ones I gave a fair shot before finally pulling the plug.
Nextcloud
I'll consider going back eventually
I'm all for trying to break reliance on corporate cloud-based services, and Google Drive is chief among them. Seamless file access from anywhere, on your own hardware, with add-on plugins to boot was enough for me to take up trying it myself. Sync issues ultimately ruined what is still, in theory, a great replacement for cloud storage. I love the ability to integrate a calendar and Google Docs-esque file editing, but the reliability ultimately killed it for me. In reality, my $0.99 storage subscription is enough to store what I need—for now, at least. I'll definitely end up trying it again once I have time to iron out all the issues, and I have no doubts it can be a reliable service, but at this time, sticking with Drive makes more sense.
Plex
There are other, friendlier options
Plex was a mainstay on my home server, and while it served me and my relatively small library quite well for a long time, it's time to try something else. I really enjoy the polish of both the server-side experience as well as the client-side, but the recent additions of a paywall to other, previously available features, as well as weird emails outting the watch history of my family and friends, were signs it was time to consider other options. Jellyfin was chief among them, removing the bloat and subscriptions that made Plex feel so much heavier than it needed to be. Having something free, open-source, and can run entirely on my LAN, without ever having to route through Plex's servers.
Bitwarden
It's not you, it's me
Self-hosting your password library can be a game-changer. I won't deny that. In my attempt to remove my reliance on cloud-based services, my password vault seemed like a no-brainer, relatively simple thing to setup, and it was for the most part. There's nothing wrong with Bitwarden or Vaultwarden for that matter, but after one small hiccup while traveling, I decided to can my self-hosted Bitwarden vault. Bitwarden does save a cache of your passwords on-device, but if you make any changes, and they fail to sync, you've potentially lost a saved password, which is what happened to me during my most recent travels. For one reason or another, my home lab shut down while I was away, and cause all my services to go down temporarily. This wouldn't have been a big deal, but it caused enough of an annoyance for me to switch back to the first-party Bitwarden solution. Eventually, once I better set up my home
Pi-hole
There are better options
Pi-hole is awesome when it works. Network-wide ad-blocking is something that's hard to give up when everything is running smoothly. When it's not, it's a huge headache that takes up valuable time to troubleshoot and get back online. Everything about it is really attractive: it runs on low-power hardware, is very lightweight, and there's no client browser extension required, but it's caused enough issues for my household that it's time to try something else. In my experience, in multiple different circumstances, Pi-hole would pin my device's CPU at 100%, fail to respond to DNS queries, and just straight up crash sometimes. And it's not like I put it under heavy load, it should be able to manage traffic from a couple of different sources at once. Most of the time, it was totally fine, but after trying it on a couple of different devices and having frustrating hiccups in service, I decided to ditch it for another DNS solution. I'll admit, it could be some kind of user error, but Pi-hole isn't something I'm hosting on my network anymore.
Email server
Never again
Setting up an email server sounded like a fun tinkering project in theory, and it was going alright for the first few hours, but even after going through the hell of setting it all up, it became very apparent why nobody recommends doing this. Having full control over all your data and privacy seemed like they'd be a worthwhile benefit, but even if you get it all set up properly, you're now responsible for maintaining a mission-critical service, where even a few hours of downtime could mean important missed emails. Outbound mail is also a huge issue, as keeping your mail out of spam and junk boxes meant even more configuration, and sometimes that's not even possible for some of the bigger corporate email providers. I'm sticking with Gmail, and there's no shame in that.
Convenience is a priority for me
While I do value privacy and having control over my data and activities, these services crossed the line where convenience outweighs control. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy tinkering with servers and keeping a few tools self-hosted, but for mission-critical stuff I use every day, I'm going to need to spend a lot more time finding the right services, and prioritizing redundancy.

Agree 100%. I use all these services religiously except for the self hosted email server. I am looking to do this though...
But I have a big home lab with 30-40 VM servers and containers running 24x7. And this person clearly doesn't know what he/she is doing. Pihole and Plex are no brainers!!!!
But to each their own....

Pihole in particular I created a fairly simple script and cron job to update and reboot like Sunday overnight. It's been getting the version and gravity updates on schedule and has been performing well on a pi4

I love pihole. I'm running it on a Pi 4 and a Pi3a+ with nebula-sync to keep them synched up, Unbound is on the Pi4 too, no issues at all. We have
about 25 desktops, phones, laptops, and a few servers, switches, smart devices, etc. It's been pretty snappy and responsive.I think for me personally, the only one I don't want to run is email. I did a long time ago and honestly that one is just to much of a headache for me. I'll stick with the likes of Protonmail and even gmail for some things, over hosting it at home.

I have mine on a container on Proxmox, but I really should get a backup going. I keep putting it off

I honestly didn't even think of a backup until reading an article here at some point, but Nebula-sync and that cheap 3a+ from adafruit for $25 made it reasonable and easy to maintain.

I run selfhosted email server (Xeams) couple of months now without any spam issue with google or microsoft. It just need correct configuration: spf, dmarc, dkim for your domain and choose smtp relay (smtp2go, for example) if dynamic IP is in use.

Ddns works well. One could use freemyip and combine with a cronned curl job to keep it resolving correctly.

Mail hosting is still possible, but you need to use something like AWS as an outbound relay because you'll never get your IP off Microsoft's blacklist.

Yeah, email serving is a huge problem. Plex is absolutely not worth it. Jellyfin is excellent. And Free.I do wish you'd commented on the other "options" for pi-hole. Or at least named them (I do know of AdGuard, but that's all). I rather doubt any of them would solve the problem I'm having with pi-hole, though (not being able to direct my Router's DNS to an internal IP [ISP won't let me], and not being able to switch to the Pi-hole's DHCP, because... other network issues). I will try bit- or vaultwarden soon, though

Nextcloud I tried as well and it just seemed like it was trying to be too much. Too complex. Too needy. Vaultwarden and Pi-Hole have given me no problems in the years I've been hosting it and even letting it update.Plex hard agree. I looked into it when I was setting everything up and it just seemed so against everything self-hosting is supposed to be. Like all of the downsides of setting up a server PLUS all of the downsides of having a cloud solution (Centralized, pricy subscription, external companies controlling "your" service.) Ew. How does anyone defend it still? Bite the bullet and go Jellyfin.Email server I also looked into... Not worth it. I found PurelyMail as a stupid cheap host that has been rock solid and I just host a webmail client (that I never use.)

Nextcloud does too much in one place imho. I use it for collaborative lists, notes and todos but there are far better solutions that. There are also far better solutions for syncing files.I fully agree with you on Plex.I had no issues with vaultwarden so far but you said if there are issues they can fuck you up and i can see that.Adguardhome is a more polished alternative to pi-hole.Emailserver: jap, i agree.

Plex has been blowing my mind for years so it's funny to read someone uninstalling it.

Regarding pihole - it must be user's misconfiguration, or two left handed person's work, which causes uninstall. It is really good.Plex is also really good software.Having email server, is not recommended by any of ISPs, as users often get their IPs blacklisted due to spam or similar. ISPs get the blame, so be careful what you are using!Also if you are installing cloud apps in your home network, make sure you can rely on your home lab, get UPS etc. if aithor does not care about his/her homelab, then installing apps is not for them in the first place.Author must be adequate before doing such things, and not write such silly articles...

A lot of self-hosting seems to presume everyone has at least gigabit fiber, no CGNAT, and related access (e.g. phone) that doesn't gag at VPN. I considered Vaultwarden, but Starlink's CGNAT isn't fluid enough for me to rely on it farther than a "oh that's cool" reaction. Jellyfin is great in-home, but my phone company decided it wasn't free streaming & billed extra on "unlimited data." There are a lot of variables
involved with self hosting that work against it.That said, Pi Hole works well enough that my non-techie wife notices the difference.

an email server is fun as an exercise but yeah - no, not for real.you don't actually need to worry about it going offline for a while, anyone sending you email will queue it up for ~ 4 days.you do need to worry that you just made an email server that's open to the internet - that's a whole lot of worry that you don't need (did you secure it properly?).you also now need to worry about how you're going to deal with all the inbound Spam - far better to pay someone else to do that part for you.and as someone else pointed out, there's no point running a server if mail you send is ignored or blacklisted at the receiving end because they don't like your IP address.
