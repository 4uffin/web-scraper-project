I switched from Pi-hole to Unbound DNS, and it's been amazing

Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
I've been self-hosting for a very long time, whether it was an IRC bouncer to keep my nickname online and authenticated, a media server to watch movies, listen to music, and read manga from, and more recently, everything from smart home control to replacements for cloud services. I've also long been a user of DNS-based adblocking software, because I've been infected with malware from dodgy ad networks before, and I don't recommend it happening again. For the longest time, that was AdGuard, because it had apps for my smartphone and tablet, and things worked. Then the number of devices I owned grew exponentially, and I switched to Pi-hole, like many of you probably did. For years, it's been working fine, protecting my home network and every device on it, but something has changed recently to make me look for alternatives, and I decided on Unbound DNS. This now runs on my OPNsense router and firewall, adding another layer of protection that wasn't there before, and I don't have to worry about the service or the hardware it's running on going dark.
Why I switched from Pi-hole
It all started when the Pi-hole decided to block ALL my DNS traffic
The troubles began a few months ago, when all of my services started dropping out, and web browsing worked for some sites but not others, and then eventually not at all. You know what I'm about to say if you self-host an AdBlocker, DNS server, or similar service. The Pi-hole had stopped working properly, and DNS requests were only being served from the small number of entries in the local cache — until they weren't at all.
Unlike my colleague Adam, I didn't want to double the problem by running two Pi-hole instances. It would just break again, and I wanted something more robust. I've used many different DNS servers recently, but this time I decided the replacement would be Unbound. Why? Because it runs on my OPNsense router, which is always on. And now I have several OPNsense installs, so I've got CARP set up so that the routers failover when one goes down, keeping my network running no matter what. Okay, unless I lose power too, and then wired internet is the last thing on my mind.
Pi-hole to Unbound wasn't a one-to-one swap
Aspect
Pi-hole
Unbound
Impact
Initial Query Speed
Fast (20-50ms to upstream)
Slower (200-300ms first lookup)
Unbound is slower for uncached queries
Cached Query Speed
Very fast
Very fast with prefetching
Similar performance
Cache Efficiency
Basic DNS caching
Advanced with hierarchical caching
Unbound provides better hit rates
Resource Usage
Low (50–100 MB RAM)
Low (similar resource usage)
Comparable efficiency
Network Resilience
Single point of failure
Highly resilient
Unbound more robust
Now you might look at that chart and think that recursive DNS resolvers like Unbound are slower, and you'd be right — but only for the first time you browse to a website. After that, web browsing speeds right up as you're caching the results, so your browser doesn't have to wait, and you eliminate third-party DNS latency. Hosting it on two OPNsense installs with failover set up properly meant no more interruptions like the Pi-hole's glitches, and I could still use the same blocklists to keep unwanted things off my network. In some ways, this was even simpler to use, because everything was already running, and it was just a matter of ticking a few boxes inside OPNsense to get Unbound running.

Unbound isn't a perfect replacement
But it gives me much more utility
Unbound isn't exactly a straight swap, but it's more proficient and has more advanced features. I don't need Pi-hole's GUI and statistics page because OPNsense carries that role out for me, and being able to enable Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a huge plus. And I'm no longer simply forwarding DNS requests to upstream resolvers, I'm validating and caching them on my own network, keeping my traffic a bit more private. No more Google or my ISP seeing every DNS request I make, able to sell that data for advertising and other uses. No more fingerprinting of me, my household, and our socio-economic profile, which is a great benefit. Yes, the ISP could track me if they wanted to spend the resources, or I could enable DNS over HTTPS or TLS for fully encrypted requests, but muddying the waters to make it cost the ISP more to track me is often enough of a deterrent. Plus, it has better local nameserver functionality, so I can assign local domains to the growing sea of self-hosted services on my Proxmox server, and then accessing them is a matter of knowing which service I want, and not the IP-port combo that I had stored in my password manager.
Unbound DNS saved my network from issues and ads
When I first started self-hosting, I liked the novelty of adding services like Pi-hole to its own SBC, partly to keep track of things in my mental map. But space is a premium, and I can stuff so many containers and VMs onto the 12TB of SSDs on my Proxmox server. One of those containers is now OPNsense with Unbound DNS enabled, with all the blocklists I was using on Pi-hole, without the worry of the Pi-hole deciding to blackhole its own network. And really, uptime is the name of the game for network appliances, and I'm glad I switched over.

Pi-hole and Unbound are two very different tools, so I think the article makes things sound more like a “swap” than it really is:* Pi-hole = DNS filter (ad/tracker blocking, nice GUI, stats).* Unbound = DNS resolver (recursive lookups, DNSSEC, privacy).They’re not direct replacements. In fact, the common setup is Pi-hole with Unbound as its upstream resolver, so you get the best of both worlds: ad/tracker blocking plus private recursive lookups.A couple of weird points in the post:* Saying “Unbound saved me from ads” is misleading. Unbound by itself doesn’t block anything — it just answers queries. To block, you still need lists (Pi-hole, OPNsense DNSBL, or manual config).* Complaining about “not wanting to double the problem by running two Pi-holes” but then running two OPNsense installs with CARP for failover feels contradictory. High availability is high availability, whether Pi-hole or Unbound.* Pi-hole crashing and blackholing all DNS usually means an unstable install (often Raspberry Pi SD card wear, power issues, or bad upstreams), not Pi-hole itself being unreliable. Running it on a proper PC/server tends to be rock solid.So really, it’s not Pi-hole vs Unbound — they’re complementary. Unbound gives privacy, Pi-hole gives blocking. The article kind of blurs that line.

In relation to Pi-hole crashing, it's a somewhat common issue with Pi-hole v6. There are many posts on Reddit about the issue, and I experienced it as well. What ultimately pushed me to switch to Unbound with blocklists on OPNsense was the fact that it happened to both of my instances at the same time, knocking my DNS offline.

It sounds like the author doesn't realize he can run pihole as a container instead of as a dedicated SBC system. Or maybe he's intentionally glossing over the obvious counter-arguments for his hot take, clickbaity article.

Adam Interesting to hear your experience. From my side, I feel like Pi-hole’s stability often depends less on the software itself and more on the setup around it. Was it running bare metal, through apt packages, or in a Docker container. Was DNS properly locked down so all traffic actually went through Pi-hole, or could clients sometimes bypass it. Which upstream resolvers were used, something stable or DNS that can time out. And was the OS environment itself stable and updated.Also, running two Pi-hole instances doesn’t always do any favors if both fail the same way at the same time. It can add more complexity without actually solving the root cause.I’ve noticed people sometimes blame Pi-hole when the real issue is how it’s deployed. Running it on a stronger machine with a stable OS and reliable upstream DNS makes a big difference. Unbound with OPNsense is a solid solution, but I don’t think Pi-hole is inherently unstable, it just depends a lot on the environment.

There's also this contradiction:"But space is a premium, and I can stuff so many containers and VMs onto the 12TB of SSDs on my Proxmox server. One of those containers is now OPNsense with Unbound DNS enabled..."Even if there's a missing 'only' (I can only stuff so many...), I don't know how one or two Pihole instances will be a problem for 12 TB of storage.

Literally what I was thinking when I read the title. Unbound replaced Bind as DNS in newer versions of Ubuntu last I knew.

You don't replace pi hole for unbound they're two different things that work together...

Good write-up overall! You’re right that Unbound gives you more privacy and control by cutting out third-party resolvers, and DNSSEC validation on your own box is definitely a win.That said, Unbound itself isn’t an ad blocker — it’s a recursive resolver. Its job is to fetch and validate answers, not filter them. Pi-hole is what does the blocking and gives you the dashboard, stats, and list management. You can make Unbound block with some config hacks, but it’s nowhere near as easy or powerful as Pi-hole.So yeah, Unbound is great if you want independence and privacy, but for most people the sweet spot is still Pi-hole handling the blocking with Unbound as the upstream resolver — that way you get both privacy and ad-blocking instead of trading one for the other.

Nick I'm no expert, but Im pretty sure my redundant pi-hole containers - which also run unbound, by the way - on my proxmox cluster are NOT a single point of failure.

You lost me the moment you said you don't want the trouble of having two dns instances...Do you know why you've always added the two Google dns instances to the ipv4 settings on your computer back in the day to bypass the ISP's dns blocking websites? Because when one goes down, it's a good idea to have a backup... otherwise you essentially LOSE access to the internet. I had to learn this the hard way when I decided to update my only DNS instance, the update failed, and lost Internet access at home until I manually reset the system.Another reason, some systems don't always go for the first DNS server and only use the second one if the first is down, so if you only have one instance (or have 8.8.8.8 as the second one), there's a chance some of the requests will not go to your DNS server.

Author is very disconnected.If something breaks, you fix it. You don't replace it with something that serves a different purpose

"I didn't want to double the problem by running two Pi-hole instances""Hosting it on two OPNsense installs with failover set up properly"Privacy advantages noted but don't think this slipped by. I'll stick to my two Pi Zeroes running pihole instances, thank you.

Two OPNsense installs with failover via CARP is a supported use case of OPNsense and is natively supported. When it comes to Pi-hole, the developers don't support or recommend any of the equivalents that provide the same level of failover.

you don't need to have any awareness. You just need to run 2 instances.

Kind of apples and oranges. True home lab dns ascension though is running Technicium DNS with public adblock lists, authoratative DNS for you internet domain name presence, reverse proxy interface for your authoratative zones, and Encrypted DNS forwarding.Its the best home lab dns out there Imo.

I have two Pi Zeros running Pihole, don't ever think about it. The article seems to be over-complicating things whilst implying what I have is complicated. My setup was get one working, clone the SD card and change the static IP on the copy.

If you have an OPNsense router, I suppose this makes sense.
I don't have one, and I'm not familiar with their features.But judging by the comments, adding Unbound to a Proxmox setup (along with pi-hole) would be a good idea.

I'm surprised adguard home wasn't even mentioned. I switched from pihole to adguard home a few years ago and haven't looked back. For my use case it's way better than pihole.

Surprised how many articles start with Pihole failing and searching for replacements. I've had Pihole running on a Raspberry 3.x for over 5 years without a single failure. Am I special?
