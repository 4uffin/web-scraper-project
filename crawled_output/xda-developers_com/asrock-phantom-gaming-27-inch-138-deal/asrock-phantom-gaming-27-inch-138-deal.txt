Sometimes the best piece of gear is the one that you can afford and won't break the bank. If you've been looking for a cheap gaming monitor, we think we've found one with this ASRock gaming monitor that's just $138. It's now seeing a substantial discount on its retail price, and also offers everything you could want from a gaming monitor. But be quick, this is the lowest price we've seen for this monitor.
A solid upgrade, if you've been looking for one
When it comes to a gaming monitor, it's going to be all about the specifications. This monitor features a 27-inch 1440p display with a 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time. For most, that's going to be all you need, handling pretty much any game you can throw at it.
Of course, you also get great colors and contrast, with the ASRock featuring a 95% DCI-P3 coverage and also offering wide viewing angles. There's also support for AMD's FreeSync technology, along with plenty of connectivity with two HDMI, one DisplayPort, and a 3.5mm audio jack.
You also get a 1500R curve, which is great for gaming and movies, making the experience feel even more immersive. Again, the specifications and steep discount are what make this monitor an interesting purchase. Save nearly 30% off with this promotion from Newegg while you still can.
