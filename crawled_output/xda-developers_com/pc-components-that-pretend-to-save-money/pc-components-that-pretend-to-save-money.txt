6 PC components that "save money" but cost you more in the long run

Published 6 days ago
Maker, meme-r, and unabashed geek, Joe has been writing about technology since starting his career in 2018 at KnowTechie. He's covered everything from Apple to apps and crowdfunding and loves getting to the bottom of complicated topics. In that time, he's also written for SlashGear and numerous corporate clients before finding his home at XDA in the spring of 2023.
He was the kid who took apart every toy to see how it worked, even if it didn't exactly go back together afterward. That's given him a solid background for explaining how complex systems work together, and he promises he's gotten better at the putting things back together stage since then.

Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
When planning a new PC build, most of us will be working to a strict budget. That means some aspects will have to fall into compromises, given that graphics card pricing is out of control and will likely take the most significant portion of the budget. The problem is that, while many budget components might seem like a good deal to begin with, they're also more likely to cause issues later on. That $20 you save could end up costing you many times that in repairs or replacements, and then your budget has crept past what you wanted to spend. If you have to compromise on anything, try reducing the capacity of storage or memory, things that you can easily upgrade later, so your initial build still has quality components.
Generic PC cases
And the low cost, low quality fans they come with
If you're a function-over-form type of PC builder, or run out of budget and need anything to put your PC into, the case is often the last consideration. Sure, you have to check clearances and other measurements so that the graphics card you've chosen fits in, but apart from that, the chassis could be the cheapest one on the market, and you wouldn't mind.
But you should budget for a quality case, as cheap cases have many hidden drawbacks. Maybe they're bad for airflow, starving your components of clean, cool air, so thermals suffer. The fans that come with budget cases are always an afterthought, don't move much air, and often sound terrible. You often don't get a PSU shroud to hide your cables behind, or if you do, the space inside is cramped. Future expandability could be an issue, with no space to put storage drives, the materials are usually thin and cheap-feeling, and you won't want to look at it while it's on top of your desk.
Cheap power supplies
Ever heard the term "fire sale" because it applies here, just not in the way intended
More than any other item on this list, you really shouldn't cheap out on your power supply. It's like buying second-hand, bald tires for your car. It might save money, but it's a ticking time bomb waiting to cause your machine to crash. You'll want to look for at least an 80Plus Gold rated PSU, in my opinion, because anything rated as Bronze, White, or unrated is going to give you a bad time at some point. Even if you're using lower power components and don't intend to overclock, a bad (re: cheap) PSU will haunt you in annoying ways. This could be unstable voltage going to your motherboard, CPU, RAM, and GPU, or cause issues with a power drop on your storage drives while the rest of the system is under load. You'll also want to ensure you have enough wattage for your system with a little extra space for peripherals and future use.
Budget peripherals
Guaranteed to break three days after the warranty runs out
When picking your PC peripherals, you don't need to buy into the marketing hype, but at the same time, you don't want to go for the cheapest things. The keyboard, mouse (and sometimes headset) with prebuilt PCs are there to get you gaming, but that's the very low bar they've been designed to meet. Sure, they might boast mechanical key switches or high polling rates, but they're essentially e-waste from the moment you unwrap them. It has to be said that affordable doesn't always mean cheap, but cheap always means cheap, and you'll notice it on peripherals. After all, these are the things that your hands will be on all the time while you're at your computer, and the drawbacks to not spending enough are many. If you're lucky, all you'll suffer is bad or inconsistent key feel while you type, but you might also get missed keystrokes, switches that die early, mice that misclick or don't have accurate sensors, and that's without thinking about wireless connectivity options. And cheap audio options will always sound cheap, whether it's headsets, headphones, microphones, or speakers.
Low-quality monitors
Why would you do this to your eyes
While you don't have your hands on the screen when using your computer, the monitor is the only peripheral that sees as much use. A good monitor will last for several PC builds, so you can rationalize things in that way, and then the higher cost at first doesn't seem so bad. And really you don't need to spend a ton for a good quality budget monitor because panel technology has become very affordable. When you buy a cheap monitor, the most likely outcome is that the panel's image quality will be substandard. That's just how it is, you pay more for panels that pass higher levels of quality screening. For panels that didn't pass quality checks, you might expect physical defects like stuck or bright pixels, or inaccuracy in the displayed color. The monitor's chassis could be poorly made, or the stand might lack customizability. The power supply on cheaper monitors is also of lesser quality, and they're more likely to suffer panel or PSU issues. The warranty period might be lower because the length of the warranty is another part of the initial cost.
Generic cables
These are always good (at giving you hard-to-troubleshoot issues)
Ahh, the humble mass of cables that every PC needs to function. Whether it's PSU cables, USB cables, HDMI or DisplayPort cables, or optical ones, I shouldn't need to remind anyone that low-quality cables will worsen your PC experience. Neither do you need to fall into the trap of gold-plated everything, audiophile branding, or anything that's clearly marketed with many buzzwords. Cheaply made cables use thinner metal or weaker alloys of metals, and often don't come with any shielding. And the insidious problem is that while cheap cables will appear to work, you could get data corruption, system instability, or even damage to connected components over time. Cheap USB cables often won't pass the charging voltage you need for fast charging, and networking cables will make your network less resilient. Over time, you'll not only have weird issues that go away once the cable is replaced, but you'll find yourself replacing cables more often, eroding any savings you had made.
Generic SSDs
Your data is worth more, protect it
SSDs have come down significantly in cost since they first came out, but that doesn't mean you should buy any random name. Your data is worth more than your price for that cheap SSD, and the cost savings aren't worth it in the long run. That said, you don't need to buy the most expensive names either. Many of the myths around SSDs hearken back to their early versions, and SSD technology has improved considerably since then. Even affordable models will outlast your PC build, but the firmware and controller on them might be of lesser quality, and I've had more controllers die than the actual storage on the drive. Is your data worth it to you? Then spend a little more and get a trusted name so you don't have to worry.
Many cheap PC components aren't worth your time, let alone your money
Trying to save money on PC parts isn't bad, but it's short-sighted to go too far into the abyss and end up with substandard parts. Every time I've bought the cheapest option, I've had to replace it soon enough, or lost data that isn't replaceable. It's a false cost saving, and one that will hurt you (and your wallet) somewhere down the line.

So, basically, don't cheap out on anything.

Read more reviews esp. negative, before u buy anything. Quality pays but don't spend a fortune either. There's always luck but don't test it by buying the cheapest..

If you're ever unsure of what to get, get the top result on pcpartpicker, those at the top are the most popular, the company that makes them will try their best to make their most popular product be less prone to issues even more than for their expensive products because having 1000s of people send RMAs for a budget or midrange product is way more expensive for the company than replacing or repairing a dozen of their top tier products, not the mention the margins are already thin on their cheaper stuff so a bunch of RMAs will not be economical.

Things I find wrong:Cables. I rarely buy cables. Most things you buy come with cables. And if they re low quality, I usually have spares. Ethernet cables I can make myself.Cases. I have found some good budget cases for around 50-70 euros, either because they're on offer, or because they re out of fashion. My criteria is good airflow and easily removable filters but you will find this in budget level if you look hard enough.PSUs: I settle with bronze as long as they're from a reputable brand. Will rather buy bigger PSU IE more watts than lower Watts and higher rating for the same money. But never cheap out on it.I agree on everything else. Especially a good monitor keyboard mouse headset controller flight stick racing wheel speakers can last several pc builds.

Finally something that has more truth to it. Your AI did a good job here. Although I would distinguish three categories.1. Experience os use. Monitor, keyboard and mice are something you are constantly interacting with and they should be good for you. It's like mattress, maybe a simple thing but you spend 1/3rd of your life on it, it should be good, not just acceptable.2. Convenience. PC case is in this category, similar to various tools, desk with electric lift. Once done, you don't care, but setting it up and maintenance might consume more time. Budget cases are fine, they just waste your time by fiddling with bad design and lack of features.3. Breakages. Cables either work or not. Cheap cables are perfectly fine as long as they work. You may have issues with higher speeds, like running 4K 120Hz on some old, cheap cables, but if it works for you, there's no need for a change.

You can buy a cheap case and it's fine, just either strip the fans and replace them with higher quality fans (good fans aren't expensive, but cases with good fans are not) or only use them as long as you absolutely have to. Personally I prefer to buy them separately anyway because I would rather have fans from a company that specializes in them with a good reputation.
Everything else was pretty spot on.

Agree with all but the case. There are so many budget cases nowadays at $50 or so that come with quality pwm fans, good airflow and good cable routing and managing space. For power supplies use the spl psu tier list and for SSDs go to ZTT’s website and use the SSD tier list there.

Cheap cables, always become a problem if not straight away eventually. Also one of the most frustrating problems to diagnose
