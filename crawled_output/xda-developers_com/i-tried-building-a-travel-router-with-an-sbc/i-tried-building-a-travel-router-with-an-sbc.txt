Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Call me paranoid if you must, but I take all sorts of precautions to bolster the security of my devices. Running a router/firewall OS with hardened rules is one of them, and I’ve been using an OPNsense-powered mini-PC for a long time to secure my home lab. However, I recently went with a fresh installation of OPNsense 25.7.2 on a separate machine, which didn’t go all that well in the beginning. Regardless, I figured it was time to bring a custom firewall to my travel setup. For reference, I tend to use my TP-Link router alongside a tiny 4-port switch whenever I need to leave my tech cave for extended periods, and while the former works well for the most part, I wanted to integrate a dedicated firewall/router distro into the setup. A tiny single-board computer seemed ripe for the task, as I didn’t want to lug around a larger mini-PC on my travels. So, here’s a log of how I turned my Zimaboard 2 SBC into a powerful router.
I had a couple of SBCs to choose from
But I went with the Zimaboard 2
If you’ve read my XDA articles – or even just checked the thumbnail images – you’d know I had a ton of options to choose from. For months, I’d used OpenWRT on my Raspberry Pi 5, and it served me well until I started dabbling with x86 firewall distros. I could technically go with the same setup, but I’d already configured my Raspberry Pi as the monitoring hub for my home lab. And truth be told, I adore OPNsense more than any other router OS. Although I’ve heard that it’s possible to get it running on Arm systems using some workarounds, I didn’t want to spend days running the distro on incompatible hardware. That left most of the Arm SBCs out of the equation. Next, I considered going for my Radxa X4, which is easily my favorite SBC on the market. But it only includes a single Ethernet port, meaning I’d have to use a USB-to-RJ45 adapter to connect the SBC to my LAN switch – which is far from ideal (even though I had to resort to it when setting up OPNsense on my old PC). That’s when I remembered the Zimaboard 2 that, on paper, seemed perfect for the job. Not only does it possess an x86 Intel N150 processor and dual 2.5G Ethernet ports, but it uses the Intel I226-V controller, making it a lot better than its Realtek (or god forbid, Marvell AQtian) counterparts you’d find on typical PCs or cheap NICs.
The setup process was absolutely painless
A far cry from my experience with an old PC
With the decision-making part out of the way, it was time to don my tinkering hat and install OPNsense on the Zimaboard 2. I could technically go for a virtualized setup, but I didn’t want to deal with the hardware passthrough challenges. So, I went with a bare-bones OPNsense setup, and began flashing a USB drive with the VGA .img file after downloading it from the official link. After I’d booted into the OPNsense interface by selecting the USB drive in the BIOS, I ran the installer. Luckily for me, OPNsense immediately showed both interfaces – a far cry from my experience using a Marvell AQtian card with the router OS. However, I had some difficulty when adding the WAN and LAN interfaces, as OPNsense couldn’t assign a WAN address to my setup. Turns out, I had to flip the names of the interfaces, as igc0 referred to the RJ45 connector on the right, as opposed to what I’d initially considered. I also tried to install OPNsense on the 32GB eMMC storage, but ran into some partition issues. So, I went with an external SSD for the time being (even though I plan to configure it on the eMMC module to save some space in my travel bag).
Besides those minor gripes, the rest of the setup procedure went by without a hitch, and I was able to get my OPNsense travel firewall up and running.
I low-key want to replace my home router with this setup
For an SBC-powered setup, the Zimaboard 2 holds its own against OPNsense pretty well. I quickly created some VLANs on the makeshift router and connected it to my Zyxel managed switch. Lo and behold, it worked just as well as my home setup – potentially even better, since I could use the hardware offloading feature on its Intel I226-V controller. Since the Zimaboard 2 includes a PCIe slot, I low-key want to buy a Mellanox card and see if I could tinker with extra interfaces. Plus, I also want to turn the x86 SBC into a full-fledged Proxmox node to house all my containers alongside an OPNsense VM – one that uses PCIe passthrough for the LAN interface.

I would have thought something with wifi would be needed for a travel router since most hotels don't have Ethernet?

Exactly. As a road warrior for many years now, finding a hotel that still has active ethernet is a thing of the past. I used to use a little TP-Link Nano travel router back in the day. A few years ago I lost it in a hotel room I assume and never bothered buying another for that exact reason.Good article... But unfortunately for most, we'll never have that joy of hosting our own private network via rj45 ever again.

If you could share knowledge with others, theory and practice, it would be worth more than a glossy BSc paper with loans "in attachements". Of course, not for free, but it would be valuable info to put to work. Nice job!

If you can manage the heavier and larger size, I prefer a Tiny PC like the Lenovo m920q or P330. Substantially more powerful like Intel i7 8700 cpu, 32gb ram, nvme ssd, and pcie slot for 4-port nice or 10gb sfp+.

And I'm still waiting on my Kickstarter order to be delivered of the Zimaboard2... Can't wait to add them to my existing Zimaboard set-up.
