If you're looking to back up your data in the cheapest way possible, then an HDD is going to be the way to go. This Western Digital Easystore external hard drive features 2TB of space and is now just $75. That's a great price for a ton of storage. While this isn't going to be the fastest drive out there, the important thing is that it will be reliable.
Compact, reliable, and cheap
To be quite honest, there isn't really much to say about this hard drive. It's a simple piece of hardware that's plug and play, which will provide you with instant access to 2TB of storage space. The external HDD utilizes a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port that connects via USB-A.
While you can use it as a general purpose drive, Western Digital does provide software for Windows that will allow you to set up a schedule to perform backups for you. This can be set to back up your data hourly, weekly, and monthly. If you're using something other than Windows, you'll have to use whatever default solutions are available with that operating system. For example, with macOS, you'll format the drive and set it to back up using Time Machine. Western Digital also throws in a two-year warranty on the drive, just in case you need some support. We'll say it again, but overall, not a bad price for a ton of storage. The discount isn't all that steep but every bit counts, especially if you're looking to purchase more than one.
