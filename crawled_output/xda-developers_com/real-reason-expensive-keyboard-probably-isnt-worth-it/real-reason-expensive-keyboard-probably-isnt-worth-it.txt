Give me a lighthearted recap
I wrote this article on my favorite mechanical keyboard. It has it all — switches that feel great to type on, a smooth sound profile, a volume knob, RGB backlighting, and even performance snappy enough to keep up with gaming. It's also the cheapest keyboard I've ever reviewed. If you're searching for a great mechanical keyboard, you're probably wondering how much you have to spend. Maybe you're looking for the ultimate gaming keyboard, hoping the most high-end model will give you a competitive edge. After reviewing, building, and customizing dozens of keyboards, I can safely say it's very easy to waste your money on a pricey keyboard that's not right for you. The most expensive keyboard might be the right pick, but it probably isn't for most people. Here's why.
My favorite keyboard isn't my nicest keyboard
A more expensive keyboard isn't always a more satisfying keyboard
I have two keyboards on my desk right now — a "budget" keyboard worth less than $100 and a custom-ordered gaming keyboard worth over $300. When I first started exploring mechanical keyboards, I would have assumed the premium gaming keyboard would be the superior choice. However, I use the budget keyboard much more often. The keyboard I'm referring to is the Epomaker x Aula F75, which costs just under $80. It's the perfect size with a clean design, a volume knob, and reliable performance. The components in this keyboard aren't as nice as those in my premium gaming keyboard, but I still prefer the Aula F75. After testing this and so many other keyboards, I've realized the way a keyboard feels to type on matters far more than the brand, how much it costs, or how "premium" the components are. My premium gaming keyboard is nice, but just doesn't feel as satisfying as the Aula F75, at least not to me. More than design, features, or even sound, what determines the best keyboard for most people is whether you personally like the way it feels to type on. That's why a higher price tag doesn't always mean you're getting a better keyboard for you. Plus, most mechanical keyboards today are easy to customize. If you're new to mechanical keyboards and aren't sure what you're looking for, you could end up wasting hundreds on a high-end keyboard you don't like. Starting with a less expensive keyboard that leaves you money for trying out different switches or keycaps is a much more cost-effective way to get the perfect keyboard.
The most important feature on a mechanical keyboard
The two specs that make or break your typing experience
So if the price or brand aren't the most important traits on a mechanical keyboard, what is? There are two specs I suggest focusing on to find a keyboard that feels perfect for you: switch type and actuation force. These two specs will have the biggest impact on how a keyboard sounds and feels. Of course, other specs and features play a role, but focusing on these specs first is the most reliable starting point in my experience. Mechanical keyboard switches fall into a few main categories: linear, mechanical, and clicky. There are also Hall Effect and "silent" switches, but even those are also technically one of the three main categories.
Actuation force is the amount of force required to bottom out a key, typically measured in grams. It might seem like a little thing, but it makes an enormous difference in how a keyboard feels. If you have switches with a high actuation force, you could end up with sore, tired hands after a long typing session or slower responses while gaming. On the other hand, a higher actuation force can prevent accidental keystrokes, improving accuracy. Both of these specs come down to personal preference. If you want a light, fast typing experience, I suggest linear switches with an actuation force under 50 grams (I often aim for the high 30s). If you want "thocky" sounding keys and more physical feedback, go for tactile switches with an actuation force over 50 grams. For most people, the brand of the switches doesn't make as much difference as the type and actuation force. Paying attention to these two specs first is a great way to filter out keyboards that won't feel the way you prefer. From there, you can consider other factors like design, RGB lighting, and gasket mounting.
I love how gasket-mounted keyboards sound and feel, but they're not for everyone! If you want a stiffer, firmer typing experience, it may be better to avoid gasket-mounted designs, which use little pads inside the keyboard case to create a cushier typing experience.
When are pricey mechanical keyboards worth it?
A couple of features are worth spending a little extra on your next keyboard
Most people can get a great keyboard that sounds and feels perfect for well under $200 or even under $100. A $50 keyboard could feel just as good to type on as a $150 keyboard, depending on your personal taste. However, there are times when it makes sense to spend a little more for certain features. Hall Effect switches are a great example. These switches use a magnetic sensor instead of a physical spring. That makes them more responsive and customizable, which can give you a slight edge in gaming. If you often play fast-paced e-sports or competitive multiplayer games, it could be worth spending a little extra to get a Hall Effect keyboard. Even if you want to try out the Hall Effect, you don't necessarily have to spend a lot of money. There are a growing number of Hall Effect keyboards under $100, like the Epomaker HE80, which is just $70.
Hall Effect switches can be faster than regular mechanical switches, but they are usually not interchangeable. If you get a hot-swappable Hall Effect keyboard, you can usually only use Hall Effect switches on it (and vice versa with regular mechanical switches).
The other exception is full-size keyboards. For one reason or another, the majority of mechanical keyboards on the market these days are smaller, often between 60% and 80% size. If you want the number pad, function keys, and all the bells and whistles, you'll need to spend a little more for a full-size keyboard. My personal favorite is the Lofree Block.
Don't waste your money on the wrong keyboard
Expensive, premium mechanical keyboards can be nice, but they're often not worth it, especially when you're new to mechanical keyboards. What makes a great keyboard is so subjective that you might be happier with a "budget" keyboard than a high-end one. Price doesn't guarantee quality, either. Before brand or price, focus on figuring out what type of switches would be best for your needs and typing style. Some people prefer the soft sound and smooth performance of linear switches, while others like the thocky feedback from tactile switches. It's all about personal taste, not price. Plus, "budget" keyboards have gotten so good that you can get fantastic performance for well under $100 these days. If you're new to mechanical keyboards, I recommend starting with a budget-friendly keyboard with the type of switches you prefer and experimenting with customization to find the perfect fit for you.

Did I mention it comes in TKL format. I had to purchase an additional numeric key pad.

For casual computer users, keyboards may not be a big deal, but where it makes a difference is with secretary's and coders. When I told a client to get a pckeyboard.com keyboard for his secretary, he scoffed. I bought it and she loved it. So he reimbursed me.

"... fall into a few main categories: linear, mechanical, and clicky."Probably you meant tactile?
