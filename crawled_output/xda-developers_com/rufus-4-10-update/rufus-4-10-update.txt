Summary
Rufus 4.10 beta adds Dark Mode and Windows 11 25H2 (Windows CA 2023) media support.
Fixes include crash on very long ISO paths (>256 chars) and other bug/UEFI fixes.
Great for making bootable USBs to upgrade Windows 10 to Windows 11 quickly.
Windows 10's end-of-life date is just over a month away, and people are still holding onto the operating system. While some are taking Microsoft's offer to extend security support for another year, others will likely force Windows 11 on their system to maintain support. Right now, two apps make upgrading to Windows 11 on any PC a ton easier:
Flyoobe, and Rufus. While the former is very good for upgrading a single computer and customizing your install once it's done, Rufus is best for creating a USB drive from which you can quickly upgrade Windows 10 machines to Windows 11. If Rufus sounds like what you're looking for, you'll be pleased to know that it received a small but impactful update today.
Rufus 4.10's beta introduces dark mode, Windows 11 25H2 support, and more
Over on the Rufus GitHub page, the developers have released Rufus version 4.10. It's still in the beta phase for the time being, but if you want to give the patch a try and don't mind potentially encountering a bug or two, you can give it a try right away. The first feature lets you create "Windows CA 2023 compatible media." Rufus says that it "requires a Windows 11 25H2 ISO," and given how the ISOs have only just been released, that's pretty quick, going by the Rufus devs. Also, there used to be a crash when you tried to load up Rufus with a Windows ISO in a very long path. It seems that if you tried to load a Windows ISO with a path longer than 256 characters, things would break. This has been fixed, so hopefully there will be fewer frustrating crashes. Finally, there's my personal favorite change. Rufus now features an official dark mode, so if light mode was causing a little eye strain, you can now create installation media with less visual fatigue. Here are the full patch notes:
Add Dark Mode support (courtesy of @ozone10) (#1453)(#2510)(#2713)
Add support for creating Windows CA 2023 compatible media (requires a Windows 11 25H2 ISO)
Add support for saving an existing drive to ISO (UDF only)
Improve error reporting when saving to VHD/VHDX (with thanks to @Kazkans) (#2779)(#2799)
Fix UEFI DBX updates being reported in some timezones, even when there are none (#2762)
Fix a situation where no file system can be selected in ISO mode (#2769)
Fix a crash when trying to process Windows ISOs with very long paths (#2777)(#2787)(#2793)
If you'd like to give the tool a try, we have a guide on how to use Rufus to create a bootable USB drive and install Windows that can help you get started.
