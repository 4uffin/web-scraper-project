If you're someone that's looking for better cooling for your PC, but doesn't want to make things complicated, an AIO CPU cooler is going to be a safe bet. All you have to do is make sure it's compatible with your build, attach the pump to the CPU, and mount the radiator and fans to the PC case. It's a fantastic upgrade that can really elevate the look and feel of your computer. Of course, there's always a price to consider when splurging on these types of accessories. But the good news is that you can now find AIO cooling solutions at affordable prices if you know where to look. That's where this top-rated AIO from Thermalright comes in, delivering everything you could want for a price that can't be ignored.

The first thing you're going to want to know about this AIO cooler is that it's compatible with a wide range of CPUs. Thermalright details how this specific model can be used with AMD AM4 and AM5 CPUs, along with Intel LGA 1700 and 1851 processors. Naturally, you'll want to make sure your CPU is compatible before reading any further. Now that you've made it this far, and you know that this product is right for you, this AIO cooler features three 120mm fans, which offer tons of air flow and also have some customizable RGB lighting on them as well. All of this is attached to a 360mm radiator, which is going to do the bulk of the work in order to keep your CPU cool. What makes this $75 AIO cooler really set itself apart from other affordable products is the fact that this one has a screen that can show off the stats of your PC, or be customized with movies and images of your choosing. It's quite a large display, coming in at 3.5 inches, so we think it will look pretty good in any computer setup. You really get a lot for the price, making this AIO cooler one that packs impressive value. We think you'll like it if you're someone that's on a tight budget, or just not sure if this is something that you should go for. It's a small price to pay for a new piece of hardware that will really change the way you use your PC. AIO coolers aren't for everyone, but some people will swear by them.
