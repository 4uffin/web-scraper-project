Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Raspberry Pi boards are incredibly versatile, but they are not the answer to every computing project. Some tasks require more power, better storage options, or specialized hardware support that Pis simply cannot provide. This is where mini PCs step in, filling the gap between hobbyist-friendly boards and complete desktop machines. If you want to tackle heavier workloads, these are the projects where only a mini PC will suffice.
Virtualizing full desktop operating systems
Why virtualization demands more power than a Pi can offer
Virtualization is one of those areas where the Raspberry Pi just can’t keep up. While it can handle containers with Docker or k3s clusters, running entire virtual machines pushes it beyond its limits. Mini PCs, with x86 processors that support hardware virtualization, can run multiple operating systems with ease. This makes them practical for testing Windows, Linux distributions, or even macOS in a controlled environment. For home lab users, the difference is night and day. A Pi might barely manage a single lightweight VM, but performance quickly becomes frustrating. Mini PCs can allocate more RAM, spin up additional storage, and run hypervisors like Proxmox or VMware without choking. That opens the door to learning enterprise-level tools or simulating production-like systems. Virtualization also benefits from advanced features like snapshots, passthrough networking, and cloning. These features are mostly unavailable on a Pi, but mini PCs handle them effortlessly. If your goal is to build a true virtualization playground, the mini PC is the only realistic platform.
Building a serious Plex or Jellyfin server
Why heavy media servers need more than ARM boards
Media servers are another area where the Raspberry Pi shows its limits. While the Pi can handle lightweight streaming, transcoding higher-resolution video overwhelms it. Mini PCs with Intel Quick Sync or AMD hardware acceleration can transcode 1080p and 4K streams without skipping a beat. This makes them far better suited for users with diverse device ecosystems. In practical use, transcoding often happens when clients don’t support the source format. Phones, tablets, and smart TVs all have varying requirements, and the Pi cannot adjust fast enough for smooth playback. A mini PC ensures that files play seamlessly across all devices. It turns your media server into something you can rely on daily, not just a fun side project. Storage is also a factor that favors mini PCs. They support faster internal drives and can accommodate multiple disks, unlike Pis, which rely on external USB enclosures. For anyone managing an extensive library of movies or TV shows, this makes the workflow far easier. In this case, the difference isn’t just performance but convenience as well.
Running AI and machine learning workloads
Why Raspberry Pi boards fall short for AI tasks
Artificial intelligence projects push hardware to its limits more than almost anything else. Even lightweight models, such as Whisper for transcription or Stable Diffusion for image generation, run painfully slow on Raspberry Pis, even on the Pi 5 with the AI HAT+. Mini PCs, especially those with support for GPUs or newer CPU instruction sets, can complete these workloads in a fraction of the time. This is critical for anyone who wants to experiment with AI in a meaningful way. The gap becomes clear when you try to use these tools interactively. A Pi might eventually complete the task, but it can take hours to process results. Mini PCs, on the other hand, deliver outputs quickly enough to make AI useful in real-time applications. Whether you are developing chatbots, running local voice assistants, or testing computer vision, you need this responsiveness. Memory also plays a considerable role in AI performance. Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch demand large amounts of RAM, and mini PCs are far better equipped. While Raspberry Pis cap out at 8GB, mini PCs can offer 16GB, 32GB, or more. Without that memory, many models simply will not run.
Hosting a full-scale NAS with ZFS
Why robust storage setups need more than a Pi
Raspberry Pis make good starter NAS devices, but they have significant limitations. The shared bandwidth between USB and Ethernet creates bottlenecks under heavy load. Mini PCs, with multiple SATA ports and PCIe lanes, allow for more reliable storage solutions. This makes them a better choice for anyone serious about building a dependable NAS. One standout feature of mini PCs is ZFS. ZFS requires extra CPU and memory overhead, but in return, it offers snapshots, compression, and data integrity checks. A Raspberry Pi does not have the resources to manage these features effectively. With a mini PC, you gain not just storage, but advanced storage management that protects your data. Scalability is also easier with a mini PC. You can expand your storage with additional drives, upgrade networking options, or even add RAID cards. These improvements turn a mini PC into a true small-office or home NAS. Pis can teach you the basics, but mini PCs let you deploy something closer to enterprise-grade reliability.
Running game servers with higher demands
Why some game servers exceed a Pi’s limits

Game servers push both CPU and memory harder than you might expect. A Raspberry Pi can host lighter titles like classic Minecraft or Terraria, but more complex games quickly overwhelm it. Mini PCs, with faster processors and more RAM, can handle modern titles like Valheim or ARK: Survival Evolved. This makes them the right choice for multiplayer gaming with friends. Networking is another place where mini PCs shine. With gigabit or even dual Ethernet support, they handle multiple connections without dropping performance. Paired with SSD storage, this allows for faster world loading and smoother gameplay. A Pi’s limitations become apparent when you start adding more players or running large mods. Mini PCs also allow you to run multiple servers at once. You could keep a Minecraft world going while hosting another game in parallel, something Pis cannot do reliably. For anyone seeking stability and flexibility, a mini PC is the clear solution.
Why some projects really need more hardware
Raspberry Pis are excellent for learning, tinkering, and lightweight servers, but their limits are easy to reach. Virtualization, AI, advanced media streaming, ZFS-based NAS systems, and demanding game servers are all projects that require more processing power. Mini PCs bridge that gap and make these ideas possible in ways Pis simply cannot.

The article incorrectly states that the raspberry pi tops out at 8gb ram.
It tops out at 16gb ram..
That is important.
Still, the point remains that the intel mini pc’s are superior for heavy workloads.

Using a mini PC for Plex and/or as a NAS is far from ideal. I run both on an old HP mini PC and the amount of workarounds, hack together solutions and the amount of duct tape, zip ties and 3D printer filament holding that thing together.
It's a miracle it works as well and as reliably as it does.For an example the thing comes with 1 sata port and an NVME port for expansion.
That's it.
So I had to buy a sketchy NVME to 8 SATA board from Ali.
Which I use run my HDD array, which lives in a separate 3D printed housing.
There's no way to power them either so I also have to run a standalone ATX power supply.
That gave me no end of unrepeatable gremlins till I tied a ground pin from it to the body of my mini PC.Don't even think about running a powered USB hub either!It is certainly possible but I wouldn't recommend it for the faint of heart.

It’s unsolicited advice Sunday! I’d recommend you switch to a dedicated NAS with more appropriate hardware specs, and keep the mini as the host for Plex and any other web services you might want to run. I don’t know anything about the specs of your disks or the adapter, but I can imagine it being a bandwidth bottle neck, and even if it’s not, if it fails it’s taking a bunch of disks down with it, and depending on how things are configured you could even lose the data stored on them.

I own both Raspberry Pi (2) and mini-pc (2). The Rpi was introduced and works well as a learning tool, and a platform for experiments and hobbies. The mini-pc is a scaled down version of normal PC with either MSwin or Linux as OS. They have different purposes and are targeted at different audiences. Your comparison about their capabilities is like comparing a farm tractor to a race car.

The original concept more than a decade ago for the Pi was indeed as a learning tool but they have evolved far, far beyond this. Modern versions are comparable to some small form factor PCs and have many different OS options including fuller distributions of Linux than Raspberry Pi OS. As well as being development platforms or for hobbyists, Raspberry Pis and similar SBCs are now used in production environments in commercial and industrial applications, even as permanent components of high-end integrated systems.Whether a mini PC or an SBC is used for a particular project nowadays really is about what kind of processor you use.

This article primarily uses server-based reasons. These are all things which a Mini PC would be terrible at doing!

I do all of these things on a mini PC with a 5700U! It was my first Proxmox node. I now have a much more powerful server, but you can do all of these things with a mini PC, and it works great for it. The only downside is zero redundancy when it comes to using it as a NAS, but I don't store anything important on it. Before I fully migrated TrueNAS to my Proxmox node, I was using the 5700U as a basic NAS for quick file transfers and for accessing shared files across devices, like my dev stuff. I always have a local copy on each machine for that, too.

NAS server: most mini PC have room for only one internal storage unit and are typically provided with one 1Gb Ethernet. Everything else must be USB. Even while you can max out such a mini PC with a 4 TB M.2 SSD, this is still a "starter NAS" as the overall speed is limited by the Ethernet bottleneck. The SSD was just a waste of money.If you want performance levels that are significantly greater than a RPI, you need to look for specialized NAS hardware (even if in small form factor), or a small server. This is not a generic "mini PC" anymore.

Imo its comparing a a race car to a robot. Both different purposes and the PI was never made just for beefy computing, its a learning platform and was intended to be used in robotics or tasks needing GPIO utilisation. If you want to selfhost things just get a pc and dont be like 'the pi sucks, idk why it was ever made' if it cant run your services because it was never meant as a server or heavy computing system.

I use an OPi03 for self hosting few fairly light services (maybe except immich and jellyfin). It's not too powerful, but it definitely does Not suck. For what it delivers with very little power - 3-6W it's really a great deal.

None of the these use cases is what the Raspberry Pi was designed for, a cheap multipurpose device for learning and design.The main PC is designed to be a full PC, but in a smaller box.The main advantage of the Pi is it's initial low cost,and simplicity. It is virtually impossible to completely brick a Pi and considerably cheaper to revive a software bricking.
