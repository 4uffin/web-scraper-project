Now, while the visuals on this monitor are great, Dell also has some neat tricks up its sleeve when it comes to the audio performance. This monitor features five built-in speakers that reside at the bottom of the screen, and there's a sensor there too, that can track your head movement to provide the most optimal sound experience. Naturally, the colors and contrast on this monitor are going to really blow you away. It's great for movies and games, and can even be used for work, handling pretty much anything you can throw at it. When it comes to the numbers, you're looking at a 4K screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time. The Dell monitor delivers a 99% DCI-P3 color coverage and has support for VESA's DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification. When it comes to ports, you get three USB-C and one HDMI. You can use the USB-C to power devices if you want, and it can also be used as an input port as well. So plug in all the devices you have and enjoy stellar visuals with the Dell.
