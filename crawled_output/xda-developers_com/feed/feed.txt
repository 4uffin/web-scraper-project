Don't let a sudden blackout leave you in the dark and your devices vulnerable
<p>Depending on where you live, power outages can be a serious problem. However, I think we can all agree that when it happens, it's not a pleasant experience. They happen at the worst times, and there's always the possibility that some of your gear can get damaged. Of course, there's no way to know when you're going to have issues with power, which is why having some protection is the best way to go. </p>

Arm has been slowly picking up pace in the last two decades, but the momentum is only growing stronger.
<p>Over the last few decades, Intel's x86 architecture has ruled the world of computing, powering everything from the most basic laptop to the most powerful data center machines. However, a quiet revolution has been quietly occurring in the background: Arm. Truly starting to take hold in the smartphone era, the Arm architecture is now gaining a key foothold in mainstream computing areas that would have previously been unthinkable. So much so, that it feels as if the writing is on the wall when it comes to the dominance of x86.</p>

Discover 10 powerful yet overlooked Windows features that can significantly enhance your productivity and user experience. From voice typing to virtual desktops, these hidden gems are game-changers for power users.
<p>Windows updates often land with all the fanfare of a software license agreement. They are unceremonious and disruptive, and so many users I know put them off until a convenient weekend, when the PC sits idle and updates. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/with-every-update-feels-like-windows-11-gets-worse/" target="_blank">We tend to assume</a> most of the changes are arcane, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-windows-updates-so-often/" target="_blank">under-the-hood tweaks</a> that, while important, don't change how we interact with our machines. However, I like to be proven wrong, and when I go snooping in menus and on Reddit, I see how Microsoft slips in some genuinely clever features that fly completely under the radar.</p>

Get into portable PC gaming for less.
<p>Despite there being a ton of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-steam-deck-alternatives/" target="_blank">Steam Deck alternatives</a> on the market now, the original PC gaming handheld from Valve is still very much worth a look. Sure, it may have a few more years on it than its competitors, but that doesn't mean it's useless. In fact, if you want to give handheld PC gaming a try but don't want to shell out a ton of money for a console, the LCD Steam Deck is a great first pick-up. Granted, it's not the most powerful or stylish handheld on the market, but at $399, it's one of the most affordable units out there.</p>

Computing DevicesHome Assistant
My new server didn't have a Bluetooth adapter I could pass through to my virtual machine, so I built my own instead.
<p>Bluetooth dongles are pretty cheap devices, and nowadays, many PCs have them built in. However, as I've consolidated a number of my self-hosted services into one machine, the migration process has come across a few hiccups along the way. One of those relates to Bluetooth; the machine my Home Assistant box had previously been running on had an easily-passed through Bluetooth adapter to the Home Assistant VM, but the new server I've migrated to doesn't. That's when I realized that I could turn the Makerdiary nRF52840 MDK into a Bluetooth dongle.</p>

AMD Threadripper CPUs offer impressive efficiency and performance for home lab setups, handling multiple VMs, containers, and self-hosted services.
<p>When one mentions an AMD Threadripper CPU and efficiency in the same sentence, it can draw some raised eyebrows. How on earth can a 64-core beast like the <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1021979"><a href="/amd-threadripper-9980x-9970x-review/" target="_blank">Threadripper 9980X</a></span> be anywhere near efficient with a TDP alone of 350W? You can expect this CPU to draw up to 400 watts of power through the socket at stock settings, but after using it in place of a few used enterprise rack servers, I've discovered it to be incredibly efficient, even compared to a few mini PCs.</p>
