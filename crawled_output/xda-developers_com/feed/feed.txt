<![CDATA[I tried out the brand new KDE Linux distro, and it's already my favorite]]>https://www.xda-developers.com/i-tried-out-brand-new-kde-linux-distro/Simon BattLinuxKDE
It's KDE, but without all the non-KDE stuff.
<p>If you've been following along with my Linux adventures, you'll know that I recently ditched Windows and found my new home over on Fedora KDE Plasma. The biggest reason it kept me around was that I really enjoyed KDE, and out of all the distros I used that came with a desktop environment, Fedora was the most stable. And all was happy.</p>

Might just beat NotebookLM at its own game.
<p>While many are familiar with Google's AI-powered research assistant, NotebookLM, thanks to its viral features like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-impressed-notebooklm-audio-overviews/" target="_blank">Audio Overviews</a> and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/notebooklm-generate-mind-maps/" target="_blank">Mind Maps</a>, not many know about the people who made the tool possible. If you fall into that group, let me give you a quick rundown.</p>

Discover a minimalist note-taking system that combines Typora's distraction-free Markdown editor with Google's AI-driven NotebookLM for a seamless, powerful workflow.
<p>We are constantly switching between tools, managing folders, and trying to make sense of our growing collections of notes. But what if there was a better way? After trying out several tools, I have created a minimalist note-taking system that combines the best of two worlds: the elegant simplicity of Typora, a distraction-free Markdown editor, and the powerful, AI-driven analysis of Google’s NotebookLM.</p>

Limit which ports can talk to each other and be more secure
<p>Setting up <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/segment-your-network-without-vlans/" target="_blank">network segmentation is best practice</a>, whether <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/rules-for-sane-vlan-design-at-home/" target="_blank">using a series of VLANs</a> or some other method. While we tend to speak of one method or another as singular forces, really the best practice is a layered method with multiple features acting in concert, whether that's firewalls, VLANs, or other means.</p>

Discover Funkwhale, a free and open-source music streaming platform that you can self-host and customize. Learn how it compares to Spotify in terms of privacy, control, and community-driven features.
<p>Spotify is good, but the free version has ads, and the premium subscription keeps getting more expensive. On top of that, you have no control over your privacy, and there’s almost no customization. I recently started using an alternative to Spotify called Funkwhale, which you can host yourself, customize, and share on your own terms. This free and open-source audio platform is built by a passionate community, and it lets you stream music and podcasts from anywhere.</p>

If you're hunting for improved performance across the board, undervolting is more effective than overclocking for most
<p>Undervolting versus overclocking might sound like two sides of the same coin, but the benefits they bring are very different. While <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-i-regret-overclocking-high-end-nvidia-gpu/" target="_blank">overclocking</a> chases raw speed at the cost of heat and power draw, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/undervolting-your-gpu-can-actually-improve-performance/" target="_blank">undervolting</a> prioritizes efficiency and stability. For most users, that trade-off makes undervolting the far more practical choice, and here are six reasons why.</p>

Your shiny new OLED deserves some stunning wallpapers
<p><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-wallpaper-engine-wallpapers/" target="_blank">Wallpaper Engine</a> is my favorite program when it comes to enhancing the look of my desktop. I have over 1,800 hours of usage on it, according to Steam, and I'm still in awe of how much value I'm getting out of it for a one-time fee of $4. After I got <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-no-one-told-me-about-ultrawide-oled-monitor/" target="_blank">my first OLED monitor</a> this month, I wanted some new wallpapers that would look especially cool on an OLED display. If you're in the same boat, the following wallpapers should be enough to get you started.</p>

I wish I had found this extension sooner.
<p>Though a new AI tool seems to launch almost every day, the truth is most of them aren’t all that impressive. I’ve been testing as many as I can, both for work and in my personal life, and only one has really stood out: <em>NotebookLM</em>. I probably open it more often than any other app, and it’s become an essential part of my workflow. It’s packed with genuinely useful features that I could rave about all day.</p>

Why allow the classics to fade away when you can revive them with a Pi?
<p>Raspberry Pi Picos are one of the best ways to bring old handheld consoles back to life. Not only are they small enough to fit nicely within a portable enclosure, but they're powerful enough to emulate retro games. As such, it's not uncommon to see a Pico or two pop up in retro projects.</p>

And yes, it's really difficult.
<p>With Silksong proving itself to be a tougher cookie than some people took it for, what better way to wind down than by playing an equally difficult (if not harder) game? If you've been on a masochistic gaming spree, you'll likely want to check out FromSoftware's title Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. It keeps the same raw difficulty as the developer's infamous Dark Souls series, but with a brand new theme, and it's currently 50% off on Steam.</p>
