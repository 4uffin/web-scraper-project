It's not looking good for gaming GPUs, and it might get worse
<p>The real <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/heres-what-happens-when-your-gpu-runs-out-of-vram/" target="_blank">implications of insufficient VRAM</a> have finally started to rear their head in the last two years. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-avoid-8gb-gpu-in-2025/" target="_blank">Graphics cards with 8GB of VRAM</a> are simply not capable of handling the latest titles, sometimes even at 1080p. However, a lack of VRAM might not be the worst problem plaguing GPUs right now. Ever since the launch of Nvidia's RTX 50 and AMD's RX 90 series GPUs, multiple disturbing trends have surfaced that paint a bleak future for graphics cards. These dark trends might ruin your GPU upgrade dream before VRAM even gets a chance.</p>

Some games were believed to be duds, until they became legendary releases. These 3 games turned out to be classics instead of complete failures.
<p>Not every game makes the best first impression to gamers when they first see it. This can be a harsh reality for some games that are released on consoles, where the first impression to the gaming audience can mean the difference between success and failure. But sometimes everyone can believe a game is going to turn out to be a failure at first, and instead turn into one of the most beloved releases of all-time. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's truly an indication of something special.</p>

I didn't expect to run into problems with P2P gaming, but it makes total sense why I did.
<p>I absolutely love <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1021029"><a href="/why-use-opnsense-over-pfsense-dont-trust-netgate/" target="_blank">OPNsense</a></span>, and it's the perfect place to tinker with my home network, learn more, and do some pretty cool stuff in general. Yet every now and again, something happens that leaves me scratching my head trying to figure out what's going on. This isn't an OPNsense quirk before people tell me that I should have used pfSense instead; no, this is a security-by-default quirk, and it affects pfSense, too.</p>

Discover why Focalboard, a self-hosted project management tool, outperforms Trello with its seamless NAS integration, real-time collaboration, and flexible task management features.
<p>For years, Trello was my go-to for <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-project-management-tools-for-professionals-and-entrepreneurs/" target="_blank">project management</a>. It’s simple, a card-based interface was perfect for visualizing my tasks and keeping my personal projects organized. But as my needs evolved with confidential projects, so did my desire for better control. Being a self-hosting enthusiast, with a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device running in the corner, I realized I could do better.</p>

Qualcomm is going all-out for Windows on Arm, and the latest partnerships bring even more apps to the platform.
<p>Qualcomm has just announced its latest compute products with the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/snapdragon-x2/" target="_blank">Snapdragon X2 Elite</a> lineup of processors at the Snapdragon Summit event. But that's not the only exciting news for Windows on Arm fans — Qualcomm has also announced that more important apps are coming to Windows on Arm PCs, including Cinema 4D, ZBrush, and Razer's Synapse software.</p>

The big Snapdragon Summit continues to impress.
<p>The Snapdragon Summit is currently underway, and our editor-in-chief, Rich Woods, has been soaking up all of the new reveals and mingling with folk at the event. The last time I checked in with him, he was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/snapdragon-x2/" target="_blank">drooling over the Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme</a>, so it's safe to assume he's having a blast.</p>

These off-label uses for VSCode stuck with me
<p>When you hear VSCode, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/if-programmer-like-vs-code/" target="_blank">programming is probably one of the first things that come to mind</a>. That’s a fair enough reputation as developers do seem to live in the app. But I don’t code, and it’s still an app I use almost every day for various projects and tasks.</p>
