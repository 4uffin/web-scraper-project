<![CDATA[4 lightweight Linux tools I could never go without]]>https://www.xda-developers.com/lightweight-essential-linux-tools/Chandraveer MathurLinuxEssential ProductsProductivitysoftware
Discover the top 4 lightweight, must-have Linux tools that streamline your setup process and make any distro feel like home. Boost productivity without sacrificing performance.
<p>Linux is a slippery slope for new users, albeit one of the most rewarding. I'll be transparent upfront that I recently started exploring this fascinating world of distros on an older computer, while Windows remains my daily driver; however, the sheer freedom is addictive. However, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/17mb-linux-distro-runs-any-pc/" target="_blank">sampling desktop environments</a> like a kid in a candy store, toying with GNOME on Fedora or a tiling window manager on Arch, quickly brings the realization that one chore is repeated no matter the distro.</p>

Now we're really thinking with portals
<p>Web servers and game servers do not have a lot in common. Besides sometimes accessing web pages for a "message of the day" on a custom multiplayer server, or perhaps something like browsing the web in your <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/free-to-play-platformer-games-on-steam/" target="_blank">Steam</a> overlay, there isn't a lot that the two have in common. Despite that, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v5vCLLsqbA" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PortalRunner</a> managed to not only host a complete web server within the Source game engine, but control it using in-game actions.</p>

That's a lot of storage for a power efficient NAS.
<p>NAS devices come in all kinds of shapes and sizes, from the basic two-bay NAS to the more extravagant eight-bay options. With that comes a range of other hardware too, like the CPU, RAM, and flash storage. Recently, Ugreen launched the DH4300 Plus outside of China, and it's a pretty tiny four-bay NAS. Here's the interesting part, though: it runs on <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1023185"><a href="/arm-answer-to-npu-something-even-better/" target="_blank">Arm</a></span>. Specifically, it has a Rockchip RK3588 with 8GB of soldered LPDDR4X RAM, and 32GB of on-board soldered eMMC storage.</p>

They're just that good!
<p>Pretty much every GUI operating system ships with a utility to help you browse your directories, files, and documents. Windows, for example, has a decent File Explorer that can get the job done for the average Joe. If you want more facilities, you can try arming your PC with Total Commander, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-onecommander-favorite-free-file-manager-windows-not-even-close/" target="_blank">OneCommander</a>, Directory Opus, and a host of other cool file managers.</p>

Computing DevicesHome LabnetworkEthernet
USB-to-Ethernet adapters seem convenient, but hidden flaws make them unreliable for critical use. Invest in real networking gear.
<p>USB-to-Ethernet adapters often seem like an easy fix. They are cheap, portable, and promise to turn a device without a dedicated Ethernet port into something more capable. For laptops, tablets, or even single-board computers, that sounds like a simple solution. In practice, though, the adapters tend to be <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-usb-to-ethernet-adapters-reliability-nightmare-home-lab/" target="_blank">far less reliable</a>.</p>

NomadBSD exceeded all my expectations
<p>The sheer number of distributions is one of the many factors that separate Linux from Windows and macOS. But if you thought Linux was the only operating system that ships with different flavors, you might want to turn your attention to the FreeBSD ecosystem. This alternative Unix-like OS is home to its own collection of distributions, ranging from the popular router-oriented pfSense and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/opnsense-guide/" target="_blank">OPNsense</a> to the more obscure (but just as useful) general-purpose distros like DragonFlyBSD and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/i-tried-using-a-freebsd-distro-as-my-daily-driver-in-2025/" target="_blank">GhostBSD</a>.</p>

For home NAS setups, the complexity, cost, and limited gains of RDMA often outweigh its benefits
<p>You may have dreaded watching the progress bar crawl as you share huge files from your <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-nas/" target="_blank">NAS</a> to your computer. You may have wondered if there was a faster way besides using <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-use-both-nfs-and-smb-nas-for-file-sharing/" target="_blank">SMB or NFS</a>. There is, but not a straightforward one. Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) can deliver higher transfer speeds with low latency, provided you configure it correctly.</p>

Great for momentum, but not a replacement for creative judgment
<p>When <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/replaced-graphics-workflow-open-source-gems/" target="_blank">diving into design</a>, I usually piece together the process through a messy combo of tutorials, forums, and just trial-and-error inside the graphics tool itself. Discovery is one of the most fun parts, especially when you end up with something that kind of looks like what you were going for. But the flip side is how scattered the process can become.</p>

These mods fix the flow and polish of Hollow Knight: Silksong, improving the game's quality-of-life without making it easier.
<p>We all waited 8 long years for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> to finally arrive, and it's genuinely a perfect sequel that builds on the first game's success, learns from it, and gives us more of the same, but better. In the meantime, however, the community didn't just sit on its hands and wait (although there was a lot of that involved as well). Instead, <em>Hollow Knight </em>became supported with mods by the truckload, with some of them capable of transforming our entire experience of the first game.</p>

Thunderbolt 5 still doesn't have the bandwidth for flagship GPUs.
<p>External graphics cards have occupied a niche market over the last decade. When <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/thunderbolt-5/" target="_blank">Thunderbolt 5</a> was announced, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-thunderbolt-5-making-external-gpus-viable/" target="_blank">some of us thought it would make eGPUs viable</a>, but the truth is somewhat complicated. The popularity of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-pc-gaming-handhelds/" target="_blank">PC gaming handhelds</a> gives eGPUs another chance at being relevant, but the slow adoption of Thunderbolt 5 has somewhat limited their effectiveness. For those of you who need the extra GPU grunt, eGPUs still have their place, but it's important to know exactly what you're getting into when you decide to purchase one, as your expectations might not match up with the reality.</p>
