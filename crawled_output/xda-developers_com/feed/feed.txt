Discover the top 5 lessons learned from 3D printing smart home enclosures, including material selection, tolerances, test prints, post-processing, and layer orientation for durable, professional results.
<p>When I first started 3D printing smart home enclosures, I thought it would be as simple as designing a box, hitting print, and placing my electronics inside. But I quickly realized there’s a lot more to it. Everything from material choice and ventilation to tolerances and mounting options can make or break a project. Looking back, there are many <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/things-to-know-before-3d-printing/" target="_blank">things I wish I had known before I started 3D printing</a>, and more specifically, before I began creating enclosures for smart home devices. Over time, I’ve learned a lot through trial and error, as well as from resources I found online, and I am here to share those lessons with you. If you’re planning to do the same, these insights will save you both time and material in the long run.</p>

Already beaten Silksong? These Hollow Knight mods can transform your next run into something completely new.
<p>If you're anything like me, you've probably already burned through <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>once, and maybe even twice. The game is phenomenal and there's no denying it, but once the credits rolled, I was staring at the screen, wondering what to do with my hands. I could've gone into another Metroidvania, since there's just so many <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/best-metroidvania-games-this-side-of-the-century/" target="_blank">amazing ones out there</a>, but you can't blame me for wanting to dive back into the comfort food that is the original <em>Hollow Knight</em>.</p>

The secret sauce to taming your smart home chaos and turning it into calm, organized magic.
<p>Managing a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/replaced-all-smart-home-apps-with-home-assistant/" target="_blank">smart home with individual apps and cloud platforms</a> for each smart device can quickly become tedious and frustrating. Instead, you can bring everything under one roof using <a href="https://mqtt.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MQTT</a>, a lightweight messaging protocol designed for centralized message-based communication and control.</p>

Discover why Trilium, a self-hosted open-source notes app, outshines Google Keep with its rich text editor, data control, and powerful organization tools.
<p>Google Keep has been my go-to notes app for years, and I'd wager a guess that it's been a popular choice for many others, too. It's simple, quick, built into the Google ecosystem, and comes pre-installed on my Android phones. What's not to like? Moreover, it seamlessly syncs across devices without needing much user intervention. But as someone getting increasingly deeper into the self-hosted ecosystem, the lack of data ownership was bearing on me, not to mention the simplistic feature set of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-keep-ultimate-replacement-todoist/" target="_blank">Google Keep</a>. Notes get lost in the clutter, the labels are too basic to manage complex projects, and there isn't much of a structure. Keep is convenient, but it was time for a replacement. So, I tried out <a href="https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Trillium</a>, a self-hosted, open-source note app. This might just be the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/these-self-hosted-apps-cater-to-my-data-hoarding-needs/" target="_blank">self-hosted</a> notes app that will make me ditch Google Keep.</p>

This unexpected Linux distro transformed my old laptop into a full-fledged desktop with Xfce.
<p>DietPi is my easy pick whenever I need an operating system for my Raspberry Pi. It's full of features that other SBC operating systems lack, and doesn't require too many system resources to work. But what if there were a DietPi version for laptops and desktops? I never thought of DietPi making a version for x86 systems, but it exists, and I was eager to try it on my old laptop. I previously <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/linuxs-antix-os-works-like-charm-on-old-laptop/" target="_blank">installed AntiX on the laptop</a> and liked the experience, but I didn't expect the same from DietPi’s x86 version.</p>

Relive the glory days of LAN gaming with a mini PC and free Batocera software. Create the ultimate portable LAN party experience.
<p>The mid-2000s were incredible for local area network (LAN) gaming experiences. We had the absolute magic that was <span class="display-card-hyperlink-article" data-id="1018672"><a href="/every-halo-campaign-ranked/" target="_blank">Halo 2</a></span>, which essentially kicked everything off with excellent local multiplayer support. I recall gaming into the early hours of the next morning with a bunch of friends playing through Halo and even running events to see which team could smash through the campaign on legendary first. It was a different time from how gaming is handled today, with everything usually carried out online. Even if you get together, there's a good chance your actual game will still pass through your router to the outside world.</p>

Computing DevicesESP32Tablets
Discover why ESP32-powered displays outperform old tablets for creating interactive smart home dashboards, offering customization, cost-effectiveness, and power efficiency.
<p>Custom smart home dashboards on an external screen reduce the need to access the actual system. You can create stunning dashboards that display all your metrics on a small screen, which sits on your desk, your bedside stand, or the kitchen countertop, and is easily accessible. Adding a touchscreen to the mix allows you to interact with the dashboard and control all the connected devices. The first impulsive thought that comes to mind is using an old phone or a tablet, or purchasing a low-spec one to serve as a dashboard display. However, it isn't always a wise choice.</p>

Windows may seem easier, but Linux has a lot of advantages over it. You might not even know these features exist, but they're fantastic.
<p>Windows has long been the dominant force when it comes to desktop operating systems, and there really isn't much room for debate there. It's got a massive lead on both <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/moved-away-from-windows-11-but-didnt-go-to-linux" target="_blank">macOS</a> and Linux, and it's so ingrained in our society that a lot of Windows users have never known anything else. After all, ignorance is bliss, and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-11/" target="_blank">Windows 11</a> works well enough if you don't know about the alternatives.</p>

<p>We've covered many budget and <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/gaming-pc-you-need-to-build-for-2026/" target="_blank">mid-range gaming builds</a> on XDA, but non-gaming PCs haven't gotten any attention lately. Well, this build guide intends to do just that. Non-gamers either build a no-nonsense starter build for a home office and casual gaming, or a workstation for professional needs. I intend to take the former as a foundation and tweak it accordingly for a performance-oriented rig, recommending components for each of the two builds.</p>

Discover 7 practical strategies to optimize your PC's power usage, from software tweaks to hardware upgrades. Reduce energy waste and lower your electricity bill without compromising performance.
<p>When building a PC, all our thoughts about power revolve around getting a PSU that can handle the transient spikes in the total power draw of all the components combined. We also presume the PC won't be running at full tilt all the time, so there's no realistic way to estimate the actual increase in your utilities bill until you plug the PC in and use it for a couple of months. Things might be different with a laptop that typically draws a consistent amount of rated power. The truth is, your <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/decrease-power-consumption-windows-server/" target="_blank">PC could be guzzling watts</a> unnecessarily, even when it's just sitting there showing you your desktop wallpaper. Every component, from the CPU to the case fans, is a potential point of inefficiency.</p>
