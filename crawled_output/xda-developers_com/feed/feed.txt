<![CDATA[Windows 10 goes out with a whimper as its final non-security update clears up a few loose ends]]>https://www.xda-developers.com/windows-10-final-non-security-update/Simon BattWindowsWindows 10
A decade of Windows 10 updates comes to a gentle halt.
<p>Windows 10 will lose general support on October 14th, but that doesn't mean it will never see updates ever again. If you're signed up for the extended security program (or if <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/eea-free-windows-10-for-another-year/" target="_blank">you're in Europe</a>), you can get another year of security-only updates. This is great for keeping Windows 10 usable in the modern era, but it does mean the operating system will get no more security-critical bug fixes or new features.</p>

A hidden gem in the mechanical keyboard world, now at an unbelievable price
<p>If you've been looking for a new <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/why-upgrade-to-mechanical-keyboard/" target="_blank">mechanical keyboard</a> with a little flair that isn't going to hurt your wallet, the EPOMAKER RT 100 should be one to look out for. The brand dubs this keyboard as having a retro style, and even offers it in different colors. For the most part, we like the look.</p>

The price might make your eyes water.
<p>Though 2025’s been a big year for gaming handhelds, the year isn’t over yet. One of the most anticipated gaming devices of the year is the Xbox handheld we’ve been hearing rumors about for years. In June 2025, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-xbox-branded-handheld-reveal/" target="_blank">Microsoft confirmed a partnership with ROG to create the Xbox Ally</a> and introduced two new products: the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X. Besides confirming the products and that the gaming handhelds would work with PC game stores, both companies went incredibly light on the details.</p>

PCIe risers can cause problems — buy the right one
<p>If you've ever wanted to <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/reasons-vertically-mount-graphics-card/" target="_blank">show off your GPU vertically</a> or convert a spare PCIe slot into M.2 slots, you probably know about PCIe riser cables. These PCIe extenders bring added flexibility to your PC, but they do so with some unavoidable complications. To make matters worse, the PCIe risers on the affordable end of the spectrum often make matters worse instead of improving functionality. You not only risk BSODs and glitches on the GPU side, but also data corruption on the storage side. Here's how to pick the right PCIe riser for your system.</p>

Dying Light: The Beast has only been out a week, and modders are already reshaping it in all the right ways.
<p>It's been a week since Techland finally gave us <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, and after a full decade, Kyle Crane was back. Sure, we had a mainline sequel in 2022, but the devs clearly tried way too many different things, a lot of which didn't resonate with the fanbase. So, turning <em>Dying Light 2</em>'s major expansion into a full-fledged game (while still keeping it free for <em>DL2 </em>Deluxe Edition buyers) was the right call, because we got Kyle Crane back, and what a return to form it has been.</p>

I set up my NTP server on Ubuntu and OPNsense for accurate time synchronization across all devices on my local network.
<p>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is an internet-based protocol that synchronizes the clocks of all devices to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) through the use of a public-facing time server. By using a public NTP server with an atomic clock as a reference, devices can synchronize for accurate and consistent time across a wide range of hardware. It's essentially how all our devices are able to accurately tell the time.</p>

An expensive slice of Pi.
<p>If there's anything I've learned about the Raspberry Pi community, it's that they love to shove hardware into portable shells so they can take their computers anywhere. After all, when the mobo is the size of a credit card at <em>most</em>, why not make it as portable as possible?</p>

The best bang for your buck AMD CPU for gaming is now even cheaper
<p>When we reviewed the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, we deemed it the best CPU for gaming that money could buy at the time. And while some time has passed, it's still a very good CPU, and has gotten even better since we've seen the price slowly starting to drop. Right now, you can score the top-end CPU for its lowest price yet, coming in at $430 on Amazon. So if you've been thinking about starting a new PC build, this one is going to be one to consider. </p>

Discover 4 powerful single-board computers that outshine the Raspberry Pi in performance, features, and value. From Radxa X4 to Orange Pi 5 Pro, these alternatives offer superior specs and capabilities for demanding projects.
<p>The Raspberry Pi enjoys the maximum spotlight in the single-board computer (SBC) category. It’s got a versatile lineup of basic to top-tier boards that cater to multiple segments. The Pico and Zero 2W fit into a single-purpose role, while the 4B and 5 series cater towards the more demanding side of projects. But Raspberry Pi isn’t the only deserving candidate on my list anymore. The competition is noticeably outshining the Pi in many respects, some even offering an NPU and a comparable price-to-performance ratio.</p>
