Summary
SteamOS 3.7.15 beta fixes sleep-related bugs and audio glitches, boosting handheld stability.
It fixes the grip button bug on the original Asus ROG Ally, so buttons work after sleep.
Adds battery, Wi‑Fi, controller and security fixes, alongside audio defaults and screen reader updates.
Getting SteamOS on a handheld console that doesn't support it by default can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, using SteamOS can boost performance just by installing, as we saw with the Lenovo Legion Go S. On the other hand, the lack of official support means that some features may not work properly immediately. Fortunately, Valve doesn't just shrug and say that the ball is in the handheld manufacturer's court. On the contrary, it's really, really good at updating SteamOS to tackle any issues that arise, which makes it a really attractive option for anyone who wants to put the operating system on their handheld. And if you'd like an example, Valve just fixed a really irritating issue when running SteamOS on the Asus ROG Ally.
Valve fixes that one annoying Asus ROG Ally button issue that occurs when it wakes from sleep
Over on the SteamOS update page, Valve breaks down what's in the latest beta for the operating system. Titled "The Sound of Silence," the SteamOS 3.7.15 beta build looks to be mostly a wave of bug fixes to squash some annoying issues. Looking through the list, some highlights include issues with the Steam Deck waking from sleep, including the inability to reconnect to Wi-Fi and problems with power and clock limits. There was also, apparently, a bug where SteamOS would ramp the volume all the way to 100% when you disconnect a pair of wired headphones, which sounds like a really awful bug to have if you're trying to keep things quiet. However, under the "Non-Deck" category is this nugget:
Fixed grip buttons after sleep on the original Asus ROG Ally
This has been a real pain point for Asus ROG Ally owners for a while now, so it's great to hear that ROG Ally owners can now put their system to sleep without worrying that some of the buttons won't work when they reawaken it. If you want to give this update a spin, you can sign up to the SteamOS beta build by going to Settings > System > System Update Channel. And if you want the full low-down of what the patch contains, here are the notes:
General
Fixed power and clock limits sometimes getting reset after sleep
Fixed a case where WiFi would fail to connect after sleep
Improved battery charge time estimation
Accessibility
Enabled multi-language support for the screen reader. The screen reader will default to the language configured under Settings->General.
The screen reader language may also be manually configured under Settings->Accessibility
Audio
Fixed volume jumping to 100% upon removing 3.5mm headphones
Fixed USB audio devices not being automatically switched to when connected
Removed non-functional "Pro Audio" profile setting in desktop mode, which would disable audio until deselected
Fixed audio glitches in Ori and the Will of the Wisps
Fixed audio distortion with the Steam Deck microphone in game recordings
Non-Deck
Fixed grip buttons after sleep on the original Asus ROG Ally
Improved support for the Lenovo Legion Go when using controllers detached in FPS mode
