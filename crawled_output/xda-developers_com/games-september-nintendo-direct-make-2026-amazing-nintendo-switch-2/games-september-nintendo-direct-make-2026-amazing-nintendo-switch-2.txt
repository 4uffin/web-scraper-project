Give me a lighthearted recap
The Nintendo Direct presentation for September 2025 had many games to showcase. It was over an hour of new insight into what Nintendo has planned now that the Switch 2 is finally out and going into its first holiday season. Not only are there a ton of great games for Nintendo Switch 2 owners to play right now, but there's a lot more on the horizon. While most people are eagerly awaiting the release of major titles like Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, the start of 2026 is looking to be even more exciting for Nintendo fans. Games for the Switch 2 are going to be abundant in the early part of 2026, especially as winter winds down and spring finally arrives. But the new year as a whole is going to have Nintendo games that everyone is going to want to pay attention to. A combination of games to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Super Mario franchise, as well as returning beloved Nintendo franchises, will get every Switch 2 owner excited. Here are some games from the September Nintendo Direct that are going to make 2026 an amazing year for Nintendo Switch 2 owners.
Mario Tennis Fever
Getting back on the court
There is going to be a lot happening for the Super Mario series in 2026. With the 40th anniversary of the franchise, Nintendo is looking to celebrate Mario in a big way on Nintendo Switch 2. Not only are classic games like Super Mario Galaxy 2 getting re-released with its predecessor in one bundle, but Mario is getting back on the tennis court with Mario Tennis Fever for the Switch 2. It's been a while since we've seen a new Mario Tennis game released, since Nintendo's favorite plumber has been pretty busy going on different adventures for the last few years. But it was a welcome surprise for Nintendo fans to see another Mario sports title making its way to the console. Mario Tennis Fever is not only going to give more of the easy-to-play tennis action many love from the series, but something even greater that's a first for it. A new adventure mode, complete with cutscenes, is going to be a major part of the experience. A fun twist on this is the reveal of Mario and his friends being turned into their baby forms, and needing to embark on a grand adventure to return to normal. Gameplay-wise, Mario Tennis Fever is also adding in some new techniques for players to take advantage of, including Fever Racket abilities that can affect opponents on the court. Mario Tennis Fever will release for Nintendo Switch 2 on February 12, 2026, just before the release of a new edition of Super Mario Bros. Wonder for the Switch 2.

Resident Evil Requiem
Legendary horror comes to Switch 2
Nintendo and Capcom have a great relationship that has led to many iconic series being on Nintendo platforms. One of those series that people love is Resident Evil, which has had multiple releases across various Nintendo consoles. Luckily for Nintendo Switch 2 owners, they'll be able to experience the next chapter of the series around the same time as everyone else on other platforms. Resident Evil Requiem was revealed to be coming to the Switch 2 in 2026, along with the previous two Resident Evil titles as well. Resident Evil Requiem is set to release on February 27, 2026. Although there are not a lot of details about the plot of the game, the few reveals before and during the Nintendo Direct offered some interesting nuggets for fans of the series. Not only will the story take everyone back to Raccoon City, but it will follow new characters and build upon the legacy of the franchise even further. The first-person view from Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village is back again, with even more chilling things to see. There's going to be a lot of survival horror happening for the console next year, and Switch 2 owners are ready for it.

Fire Emblem Fortune's Weave
More strategy in a new setting
Credit: Source: Nintendo
The big reveal at the end of the Nintendo Direct presentation was that a new Fire Emblem game was coming to the Nintendo Switch 2, Fire Emblem Fortune's Weave. Like previous entries in the series, there's going to be a new setting and a new cast of characters to follow in between the tactical action. The game appears to have a Roman-inspired theme to it, with various characters battling foes in a coliseum as multiple leaders and key figures look on. A young man who is seen in the trailer explains that he fights to save his father's life, which may become a very big plot thread throughout the story. Just like other Fire Emblem games, other characters that show up in the reveal appear to have their own motivations and abilities they take with them in battle. How exactly all of this will come together and what relationships will be forged is anyone's guess, for now.

The reveal also gave a peek at some of the gameplay, with exploration in towns and tactical combat. It's safe to assume that the gameplay shown was running on the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, which looked very good. Some moments in combat appear to have characters calling in legions of allies to fight on their behalf, which could be special battles taking place during the story. Other skirmishes between units look just as good as previous entries in the series, but with more polish and flair to make every moment of swords clashing look epic. While there is no definitive date, Fire Emblem Fortune's Weave is planned to release in 2026.

Yoshi and the Mysterious Book
Wholesome and cuddly world
Credit: Source: Nintendo
It's no secret that most Nintendo fans love Yoshi. He's a trusted ally of Mario in various games, but has his fair share of solo adventures on Nintendo consoles. And in 2026, Yoshi is going to be going on another outing with the release of Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. It's a new 2D platformer that has Yoshi entering a mysterious book that he must put back together after it falls from the sky onto his home. Within the book is a whimsical world that has a very interesting visual style. And just like previous Yoshi games, this one is going to pull on a few heartstrings. The gameplay shown during the Nintendo Direct presentation showcased many of the things players can expect in this new Yoshi adventure. Everything from traversing platforms and exploring obstacles for secrets, to throwing eggs to remove enemies and targets, and floating around is there. If you've ever played a game like Yoshi's Island on the Super Nintendo before, then a lot of what's in Yoshi and the Mysterious Book will be familiar territory. But what makes this new game so charming at first impression is the detail in the presentation, with a lot of it being credited to the colorful and wholesome environments. Some interactions that Yoshi can have just by walking around can also aid him in manipulating obstacles and open up new paths for him. Yoshi and the Mysterious Book is planned to be released for the Nintendo Switch 2 in Spring 2026.
