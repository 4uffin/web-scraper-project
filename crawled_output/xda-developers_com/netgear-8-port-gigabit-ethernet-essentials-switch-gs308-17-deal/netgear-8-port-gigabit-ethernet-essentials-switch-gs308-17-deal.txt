When you think about networks, going wireless is the obvious and convenient choice for most households and offices. Of course, wired connections have an important role to play too, which is why adding a switch to your current network setup may be something worth exploring. And sure, you can always go with something pricey that supports PoE, but if you're just looking to experiment for now, this one from Netgear that's discounted to $16 is going to be a fantastic choice.
Wired connections are good to have
There's no doubt about it, wireless connections are an absolute lifesaver when you're looking to connect on the fly. You just pop in the Wi-Fi password and away you go. And while we love wired connections here at XDA, it's not always the most convenient way to connect. But, as we stated before, wired connections do have a place in your current setup, especially if your device has the means to connect using a physical cable. And this can be for any number of products, like TVs, media boxes, game consoles, smart displays, and more. If they're all in the same general area, that makes it even better and easier to connect them all to one switch. Not only are you going to get a more reliable connection using a wire, but the speed of the connection could be faster too. This is especially important if you have a home filled with smart devices, which is where a PoE switch can become extremely handy to have. Again, this isn't completely necessary, but for certain devices, it can be a game-changer. And perhaps the best reason to invest in a switch is because it isn't all that expensive. This one from Netgear is just $16, which makes it perfect to have a few around the house. If you're not quite sure why you need to add a switch to your current setup, we recommend taking a look at some of our top reasons.
