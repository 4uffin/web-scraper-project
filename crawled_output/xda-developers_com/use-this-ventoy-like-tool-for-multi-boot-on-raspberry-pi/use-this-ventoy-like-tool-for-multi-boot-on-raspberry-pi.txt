Give me a lighthearted recap
Raspberry Pi and other SBCs can boot an operating system from SD cards and USB devices. I own multiple SD cards and am a fan of swapping them to instantly switch to a different OS, such as RetroPie, to emulate games when I have time. But my SD card slot on the Pi started acting up due to this activity, which made me think of a different approach. I wouldn't need to swap SD cards frequently if a tool like Ventoy for Raspberry Pi existed. I still prefer to keep my main OS on an SD card, but a multi-boot SD card or USB drive would take the OS swapping to the next level. Noobs used to be an official tool to achieve multi-boot on Raspberry Pi, but it's no longer in development, and the next best alternative is PINN. It's a tool at the core of the storage drive, helping you install, clone, and manage multiple operating systems on a single storage device. Let's discuss how you can implement multi-boot for your Raspberry Pi.
Installing PINN
Setting up the boot environment
I prefer to install PINN on a separate SD card and then pick the storage medium to install multiple operating systems. The easiest way to do this is to use the Pi Imager app, which can handle the PINN installation for you. Pick your Pi model and select PINN’s latest version on the operating system selection page. It's small and almost instantly flashes to the SD card. Close the Imager app and then plug the SD card into the Pi. Also, connect any storage drive if you don't want to use the PINN SD card to install multiple operating systems. Since we aren't SSHing into the Pi, you must connect a monitor and keyboard to the Pi to configure the operating system.
Picking multi-boot operating systems
Setting up drives, the OS, and more
PINN needs an internet connection because it doesn't have an operating system. Like the Pi Imager, it downloads all the operating systems you select. Before that, you must set up a Wi-Fi connection, which is easy with the GUI interface. Scan for available networks, then type in the password to complete the Wi-Fi setup. After that, you'll see many operating systems spread across multiple tabs. Finding the most popular ones is not a problem because Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, DietPi, and Arch Linux are all available. There are even niche operating systems, like RISC OS, and a dedicated gaming tab for RetroPie, Lakka, and more. I noticed that the operating system list varies depending on the Pi model. If you use the Pi Zero 2W, you'll see fewer options than with the Raspberry Pi 5. It's a good approach because you're limited to only the operating systems that work without problems on a specific Pi model. Click the check boxes in front of the operating system names to select them and then move to the lower part of the screen. Here, you can choose the storage to which you want to install the operating systems. I picked the USB device as a demo, but it's the same if you want to use an external hard disk or solid-state drive. For Raspberry Pi 5 users, the NVMe drive is also an option to expand storage and is the fastest among all types of supported storage for Pi. Since each operating system requires installation space and space for apps and data, use a bigger storage capacity, preferably 64GB or higher. Note that some operating systems don't support booting from a USB drive and will disappear from the list if you select the USB device.
Setting up storage capacity
Modify boot preferences
PINN is intelligent enough to automatically divide the available storage space into equal parts for the operating systems you want to install. However, if you're going to modify the entries, you can just type the numbers manually. It didn’t work when I tried, so I clicked OK with the default levels. Installing multiple operating systems can take a while because it fetches and installs images. It took around one hour, with three operating systems, which is a tad slower. Upon installation, the OS order selection window launches. You can adjust the order in which the operating systems will boot, then click Boot to load the first in the list. PINN will follow the boot order every time your Pi powers up. Press the Shift key to load the PINN interface before the default OS boots if you want to change the settings. You can easily create a multi-boot SD card or USB device for your Raspberry Pi without fiddling with commands and scripts.
Remote and SSH access
Editing the PINN cmdline file
If you want remote SSH access to configure PINN from your main PC, you must modify the cmdline file after flashing PINN to the SD card. Since the Imager app doesn’t let you apply the SSH and Wi-Fi credentials beforehand, you must manually add these entries to the recovery media with text files. Adding vncshare ssh to the cmdline file installs VNC and ssh support while adding a wpa_supplicant.conf file with Wi-Fi credentials sets up the internet connectivity. After that, create an empty SSH file, plug the SD card into the Pi, and let PINN boot it up. If everything is fine, the Pi will appear on your router page's list of connected devices.
Give the SD card port some relief
You only need a slightly bigger SD card or HDD to boot multiple operating systems on your Raspberry Pi. I’m surprised how easy PINN is for users to set up a multi-boot OS with its GUI design. Since it’s actively developed, you can count on it for support when newer Pis arrive.
