6 FOSS Notepad alternatives for coders

Coding has been one of the mainstays of computing, right from the reason for computers to exist, to the foundation for all the applications we use on these machines today. Until quite recently, most of this code was written in the oft-ignored Notepad application. This iconic tool still endures, and I return to it frequently to jot down ideas before they are lost in the sea of thought or create AutoHotkey scripts, among other things. However, when I go to create a shopping list or try to code in it, I'm suddenly reminded of how manual the process is. Notepad lacks syntax highlighting, line numbers, or even a basic project view, turning coding into an exercise in memory and patience. Microsoft knows this and created Visual Studio Code, a powerhouse editor for programmers. However, there are several other tools power users and programmers can turn towards when upgrading from the humble Notepad. The Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) community has produced an incredible array of powerful, feature-rich text editors and code editors that can transform your coding experience. These are my favorites, and none cost a penny.
Notepad++
A staple from the early days
A straightforward Notepad replacement ought to be Notepad++, even if you judge a book by its cover. This souped-up version is still lightweight and lightning fast like the Microsoft original, but it packs in more essential features for coders and power users. The feature set is exactly what you'd expect from a mature project. You get syntax highlighting for dozens of languages right out of the box, a tabbed interface for managing multiple files, and a powerful search-and-replace function that fully supports regular expressions. One of my favorite quality-of-life features is its session management. It remembers all your open files and unsaved changes even after a reboot, saving you from the panic of losing work due to an unexpected outage. This tool is largely dependent on a plugin ecosystem. These little components offer a code linter, file comparison tool, and a hex editor, too. Using them, you can create a Notepad replacement minus bloat you'll never use on a full-blown code editor.

Microsoft VS Code
The spiritual successor
It would be remiss to skip VS Code on this list since it replaced Notepad and application-specific code editors for many, while doubling up as a neatly formatted note-taker for others. It strikes an incredible balance between the performance of a lightweight editor and the capability of an IDE. Sure, this isn't fully open-source and Microsoft includes some proprietary telemetry, but the core is shared with the open-source Code-OSS project, which also forms the foundation for community-driven builds like VSCodium. VS Code's ace is what Microsoft calls IntelliSense — a code completion and parameter info system that lets you focus on the logic instead of the technicalities and syntax. It smartly adapts suggestions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules. I also love how Microsoft has baked in support for Git, placing version control right in the VS Code window. Like Notepad++, VS Code has an expansive selection of extensions for formatting, framework-specific snippets and commands, and advanced linting. This alone makes it a great default environment to hone skills in Python, JavaScript, C++, or Go.

Brackets
From the folks at Adobe
Source: Brackets/GitHub
While I'm on the subject of proprietary, somewhat open-source Notepad alternatives, Brackets is worth a mention for its focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Conceptualized by Adobe and now maintained by the community under the permissive MIT License, Brackets is interestingly coded using the same languages it supports. Quite like Adobe's image processing utilities, this tool has a Live Preview feature that immediately shows what you changed, like in a web browser. You can even click on an element in the browser, and Brackets will highlight the corresponding source code. This tight feedback loop is critical to designing GUIs intuitively. Brackets also introduced some clever workflow enhancements, like Quick Edit, which allows you to edit the CSS rules for a specific HTML element in an inline editor without visiting the stylesheet. Brackets isn't very famous, but several users swear by its efficacy for the limited scope of application.

Atom
VS Code's precursor
Source: Atom/GitHub
Before VS Code dominated the landscape, there was Atom. Billed as "a hackable text editor for the 21st Century," it was created by GitHub and played a pivotal role in popularizing modern, extension-powered coding suites built on web technologies like the Electron framework. This editor leverages thousands of community-built packages that add new features and language support through the package manager. Unlike other options on this list, every element in Atom is customizable, right from the UI theme to the keybindings, hence making it a versatile tool for any workflow. Atom is old enough that it inspired now-mainstream features, including a fuzzy finder for quickly opening files, a clean project-wide search, and seamless integration with Git. For many, it was the perfect middle ground between a simple text editor and a heavy IDE. Importantly, GitHub officially sunsetted the Atom project in late 2022, so it's no longer under active development. However, it remains a fully functional and powerful open-source editor.
Neovim
Where text is king
For developers who live in the terminal and prioritize keyboard-driven efficiency above all else, Neovim is a revelation. As a fork of the legendary Vim editor, Neovim aims to aggressively refactor and modernize the codebase while maintaining backward compatibility. The result is a faster, more extensible, and more user-friendly version of Vim that is better suited for modern workflows. One of Neovim's most significant improvements is its architecture. It decouples the core editor from the UI It also packs support for scripting in a language called Lua that has spawned a generation of powerful and performant plugins. As such, configuring Neovim is a lot easier than it was with Vimscript. Developers won't even miss IDE-style code completion, go-to-definition, and inline diagnostics in this modern version since it supports the Language Server Protocol (LSP). Neovim isn't for the average note-taker or Notepad user, but professional programmers would appreciate its versatility and improvements from the original, especially if reaching for the mouse is a chore.

Emacs
Where it all started
Source: GNU Emacs
This list would be incomplete without GNU Emacs, often mentioned in the same breath as Vim among titans of text editing. Unlike Vim, though, it is an extensible Lisp environment where text editing is just one of many possibilities. Fundamentally, Emacs is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp (Elisp) that can manage everything from writing code and prose to managing to-do lists (Org Mode), handling version control (Magit), reading email, and browsing the web. Emacs is comparable to an OS, but has a notoriously steep learning curve that deters all but the most committed pros. The upside is a text-first tool that shapes up how you want it, instead of a generic OS like Windows. If you're familiar with the other items on this list, Emacs might be the challenge you seek. It's also compatible with practically every mainstream OS today.

Find the replacement that works for you
We all use Notepad differently, and the ideal replacement could be a code editor or a full-blown OS replacement, depending on what you seek. While Microsoft VS Code helps weed out syntax errors and formatting for most basic tasks, the templatized and assistive nature of Neovim or Brackets could save you time spinning up a new project. In any case, every option here is free to download and use.

I know it may not be a contender yet but Kate is shaping up well. It has added several features mentioned here. As a KDE app, it fits into my desktop natively and with a few tweaks, manages my coding workflow quite well.

The title suggested lightweight, notepad-style tools, but the article highlights full-featured code editors. If you're looking for simpler FOSS alternatives, Kate is probably the closest match. Joplin and Obsidian could also be solid options depending on your workflow.
