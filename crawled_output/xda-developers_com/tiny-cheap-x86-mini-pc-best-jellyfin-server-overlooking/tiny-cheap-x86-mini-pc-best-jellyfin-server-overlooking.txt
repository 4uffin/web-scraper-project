Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
If you’ve been looking for a reliable and affordable way to host your Jellyfin media server, chances are you’ve considered using a Raspberry Pi or repurposing an old desktop. Both options are popular, but neither is a perfect fit. The Pi often struggles with transcoding and multiple streams, while a power-hungry tower PC is noisy and inefficient. That leaves many people stuck trying to balance performance, cost, and convenience.
The Air 12 Lite ensures you spend more time enjoying your library and less time troubleshooting.
There’s another option that rarely gets the attention it deserves: small x86 mini PCs. These machines often deliver more processing power than ARM boards while keeping energy use far below that of older desktops. One of the most interesting examples is the Geekom Air 12 Lite, powered by Intel’s modern N150 chip. It’s a compact device that can easily blend into your setup, yet has the performance to make Jellyfin shine.
Why this mini PC deserves attention
A cheap but capable streaming powerhouse
For many home lab enthusiasts, the first instinct when setting up a media server is to reach for a Raspberry Pi. It’s small, flexible, and has an active community. However, when it comes to smooth media playback and reliable transcoding, ARM-based single-board computers often fall short. Jellyfin, while lightweight, still benefits from more powerful hardware when dealing with mixed media formats and simultaneous streams. That’s where x86 mini PCs come in, and the Geekom Air 12 Lite deserves far more attention than it currently gets. Powered by Intel’s efficient N150 processor, it offers a rare mix of performance and affordability. It’s compact enough to tuck behind a TV or on a shelf, yet has enough horsepower to handle 1080p and even 4K streams without issue. Unlike older desktops pressed into service, it runs whisper-quiet and sips power. With a design that feels purpose-built for a modern media setup, this device bridges the gap between hobbyist boards and bulky PCs. It can run nearly any operating system you prefer, supports Docker for containerized services, and integrates seamlessly with home networks. If you’ve been hunting for a low-cost, dependable Jellyfin host, this overlooked box checks all the right boxes.
Why the Geekom Air 12 Lite stands out
Balancing performance, ports, and efficiency
At the heart of the Air 12 Lite is Intel’s N150 processor, a modern, low-wattage CPU designed for compact systems. While it won’t rival gaming rigs, it is far more capable than the ARM chips found in SBCs. With four efficient cores, it handles video transcoding, metadata fetching, and simultaneous streams without grinding to a halt. The integrated Intel UHD graphics also provide Quick Sync acceleration, which can significantly enhance performance for video-intensive workloads. This system ships with 16GB of RAM, which is plenty for Jellyfin’s database and background processes. Storage is fast and expandable, with NVMe support making navigation snappy even in large libraries. You’ll also find generous support for use as a media server, including a full-size HDMI port for easy TV connection, multiple USB ports for external drives, and a VESA-compatible bracket to wall-mount the mini PC or attach it to the back of your TV. Everything you need to build a solid media server is included out of the box. Perhaps the most appealing feature is its energy profile. Unlike tower PCs that can draw hundreds of watts, the Air 12 Lite typically uses only a fraction of that. Leaving it running 24/7 won’t drive up your electricity bill, making it a practical long-term solution. Combined with its compact form factor and quiet operation, this makes it the kind of device you can set and forget while enjoying reliable media streaming.
How it compares to other options
Arm boards and old desktops fall short
It’s worth asking why you wouldn’t just stick with a Raspberry Pi or dust off an old desktop. The answer lies in striking a balance between performance, compatibility, and convenience. A Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 might serve as a basic media server, but transcoding support is limited, and the boards often struggle with heavier workloads. If you have family or friends accessing your server, those limits become very obvious very quickly. Older desktops, on the other hand, typically offer more raw power, albeit at the expense of noise and energy efficiency. A mid-2010s tower might seem like a free upgrade, yet the constant hum of fans and the spike in power draw make it less practical as a 24/7 solution. Over time, the cost of running an inefficient system outweighs the money saved by reusing it. The Air 12 Lite avoids this trap by combining modern architecture with minimal energy use. Software flexibility is another deciding factor. x86 compatibility means you can run any Linux distribution or even Windows without dealing with special builds or driver headaches. That’s not always the case with ARM-based devices, where quirks and missing support can complicate setups. The Air 12 Lite ensures you spend more time enjoying your library and less time troubleshooting.
Setting up Jellyfin on the Air 12 Lite
Simple installation with room to grow
One of the biggest advantages of the Air 12 Lite is just how easy it is to deploy Jellyfin. There’s no need to hunt for workarounds or specialized guides. If you’ve ever installed software on a standard PC, you’ll feel right at home here. The N150 has more than enough performance to run both the server and supporting services like reverse proxies or network storage solutions. Linux users can rely on Jellyfin’s repositories or opt for Docker, which keeps everything modular and clean. Windows users can download the official installer and be streaming within minutes. Hardware acceleration is supported on both platforms, which can be enabled through Intel Quick Sync for efficient transcoding. That option alone makes this mini PC stand out, since it smooths playback on devices that can’t handle direct play. If you’re ready to get started, here’s a straightforward process:
Install your preferred operating system (Ubuntu Server or Windows 11, both work well).
Update the system and apply any driver updates.
Install Docker or the Jellyfin standalone package.
Configure Jellyfin, add your media libraries, and set up user access.
Enable Intel Quick Sync hardware acceleration for better transcoding performance.
Within an hour, you’ll have a responsive Jellyfin server running smoothly. The extra headroom also means you can expand the system later with add-ons like Nextcloud, Pi-hole, or a VPN server.
While it's possible to install Jellyfin on Windows, you may find that some third-party extensions don't perform as well. You also have the overhead of Windows' GUI using up some of the PC's resources. Installing on a Linux server is by far the better option.
The overlooked mini PC worth trying
The Geekom Air 12 Lite proves that you don’t need a pricey NAS or high-end server to enjoy smooth streaming. It combines modern x86 performance with low energy consumption and a simple setup, all in a package that’s more affordable than most premium SBC kits. For many home users, it’s the sweet spot between power and practicality. If Jellyfin is at the heart of your streaming setup, this compact PC deserves a serious look.

I am no plex fanboy by any means but despite all these posts and articles about how great jellyfin is, I still prefer plex.
