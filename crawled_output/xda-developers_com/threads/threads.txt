Virtual Boy games are coming to the Switch 2 and I am losing my mind
Nintendo has just held its latest Direct showcase going over numerous upcoming games for the Switch and Switch 2. There were some great announcements in there, but none shocked me more than the addition of Virtual Boy to the Nintendo Classics library on both Switch and Switch 2.
The Virtual Boy is infamously Nintendo's worst selling console hardware, recorded at 770,000 units sold worldwide, though the hardware was never launched in Europe. This addition to the Nintendo Classics library is also going to require an add-on that pretty much replicates the look of that original hardware, and it'll be available in all major markets, meaning it's more than likely it will sell more than the original hardware.
I'm just absolutely befuddled that this is happening now, when Nintendo had a perfect opportunity to re-release these games on the 3DS and never did it. But there's no way around the fact that this is at least interesting.JoaoJoaoPosts
I wish Linux were better on tablets
I've been trying a lot of different things lately when it comes to Linux and operating systems, and earlier this week, I went hands-on with FydeOS on an old 2-in-1 laptop. Suffice it to say, it's easily the best experience you can get on a tablet-like PC, with great, smooth interactions and gestures.
I had a lot of hope that more mainstream Linux distros would have developed better support for tablets, but with the market being relatively small to begin with, I can understand why that's not the case. But with Microsoft fumbling the bag so hard when it comes to... everything, I wish there were more alternatives. That being said, FydeOS is fantastic and I highly recommend it.JoaoJoaoLatest7 days agoUsers1Posts1
Is it a good idea for Linux distros to try to mimic the look and feel of Windows?
Some may argue that making Linux distros resemble Windows can make it easier for users to transition from Windows to Linux, providing a familiar interface. However, others believe that mimicking Windows goes against the open-source ethos of Linux and can lead to security and privacy concerns, as seen with distros like Winux. Ultimately, the decision depends on individual preferences and priorities, but trying something new can feel more liberating.RichardRichardPosts
A virtualization-optimized version of Windows 11 would be awesome
Recently, I found out about a project called WinApps that attempts to run Windows apps on Linux in a seamless way, making them appear integrated into the native desktop. This relies on a full Windows VM paired with a remote desktop tool, but Windows is a hefty OS to run in the background for a setup like this.
It got me thinking it would be a cool idea if Microsoft made a Windows ISO image designed for tinkerers who want to use lightweight VMs or containers, where you can still run all the Windows apps, but without the usual background processes Windows comes with. It would make it way easier to ditch full Windows installs for good.JoaoJoaoLatest2025-09-05Users1Posts1
Do you prioritize network security over raw speed when it comes to your home network setup?
People's priorities may vary, but for those running home labs or concerned about the security of their network, investing in a custom firewall with advanced security features could be more valuable than simply increasing bandwidth. However, for average users focused on streaming and browsing, speed might be the primary concern. Do you value speed over security, or is it the other way around?RichardRichardPosts
I love using HACS' Proxmox integration with Home Assistant
Armed with numerous integrations and dashboards, the Home Assistant Community Store is a must-have for tinkerers who want to take the functionality of their HASS-powered smart home to the next level. However, the Proxmox integration is hands-down my favorite HACS offering, as it lets me monitor and control my PVE nodes directly from Home Assistant's UI. Throw in a custom dashboard and a cheap display, and I can manage my Proxmox-based virtual guests like the conventional smart devices in my home lab. AyushAyushPosts
What's your favorite Linux distro?
As you may know, I've become a very big fan of Linux over the past few months, and my primary laptop now runs Arch linux with KDE Plasma. I love using it and find it much more fun than Windows, but I also know there's a huge world of distros out there for all kinds of people.
So I'm curious what your favorites are. Do you use Arch? NixOS? Maybe something more user-friendly like Ubuntu or Linux Mint? I'd love to hear your thoughts!JoaoJoaoLatest2 days agoUsers3Posts3
It's been 40 years since Super Mario Bros. came out and the titular plumber is still going strong
Seriously, 40 years is a long time, and Mario has been curbstomping Goombas for every minute of it. Whether he's running around with his brother Luigi or pairing up with dinosaurs, talking hats and more, Mario has been a part of the gaming landscape for young, and the young-at-heart. I can't wait for the next outing (and his first on the Nintendo Switch 2), because I've played every game to date and Nintendo's first-party titles are always worth picking up. Is Mario your favorite or is another Nintendo character in that top slot?Joe_Rice-JonesJoe_Rice-JonesPosts
I love the ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display
I've been learning a lot about ESPHome recently, and the Cheap Yellow Display (CYD) has been a fantastic way to get to grips with LVGL and creating a display that actually works in my smart home. I have some ePaper displays on the way, along with some other small displays that I can mount, too. What else should I get next? AdamAdamLatest2025-06-23Users1Posts1

Rolling releases vs. fixed releases: Which do you prefer?
I've long used fixed-released operating systems that require major upgrades to bring the underlying code up to scratch with the latest updates that aren't minor. In recent times, I've gradually moved to rolling-release Linux distros and much prefer being able to update just about every part of the OS without having to wait for the developers to roll out a major upgrade. But which do you prefer?

Nintendo has another hour-long show coming this week
Nintendo has just announced its first "general" Nintendo Direct since it launched the Switch 2 over three months ago, and suffice it to say, it feels like it's going to be a banger. Partly because Nintendo skipped its usual June showcase, which means we're overdue for a deluge of Nintendo news, but also because Nintendo is kind of promising exactly that.
According to the company, this will be a roughly 60-minute long show, which makes it the longest general Direct ever, if we exclude the April showcase that was exclusively focused on revealing the Switch 2 and its launch lineup. There are no expected hardware announcements this time around, so it's all about the games (and maybe the sequel to the Mario movie), which makes it all the more exciting.

I low-key want to 3D print a rack for my SBCs
The lightweight champ Raspberry Pi Zero began my obsession with Single-Board Computers, and I've since expanded my collection to include everything from Arm boards to x86 units and RISC-V SBCs. Thanks to their small size and low power consumption, I run a handful of these SBCs in my home lab. Unfortunately, I don't own a proper rack for them, and all my attempts at finding the one that suits my needs have ended in vain.
However, I recently came across some forums and idea boards where tinkerers showed off their 3D-printed racks. And now I really want to print one for my arsenal of SBCs. Of course, I'll have to research the right schematics and filament type, but it seems like a fun weekend project.

Beeper is still the best thing to happen to messaging apps
It's been well over a year now since I first wrote about Beeper and how much I loved it. Seeing as we've never covered it again, you might think that was something of a fluff piece, but make no mistake: Beeper has been an absolutely consistent presence on every device I use.
Beeper does require a level of trust, as you're technically signing into various messaging services on a remote device that isn't yours, but honestly, I've just been loving the convenience so much.  All of my messaging apps now live under one roof, so whether it's SMS, Facebook Messenger, Discord, or Telegram, I can use it all in one place, and it's so convenient.
The only downside is Facebook Messenger continues to be annoying and randomly disconnecting once every week or so, forcing me to login again. WhatsApp also disconnected me at first, but it only requires me to keep the app installed in order to prevent that from happening. That's not enough for Messenger, and I can only hope a fix will come at some point

Someone figured out how to use SSDs in an unmodded Xbox 360
The Xbox 360 has been around for two decades now, and in all that time, the internal storage drive has always been mechanical hard drives. That's down to Microsoft putting security restrictions on the console so that only a few hard drives would work. Console modders figured out how to firmware mod hard drives to use non-approved ones, but it took until this week for those modders to figure out how to modify SSD firmware so that the Xbox 360 can finally get the speedy storage as a solution. After so many years, it's incredible to see enthusiasts still finding new ways to improve these consoles.

How many case fans does your PC have?
Besides dust buildup, high temps are easily the biggest nemesis of PCs, and you could end up lowering the longevity of your painstakingly-assembled rig if you take your fan placement lightly. Me? I've got an arsenal of fans attached to my PC cabinet. I've installed three 140mm fans as intakes on the front, with two 120mm fans at the top and another 120mm on the back acting as exhausts. That way, my cabinet has slightly positive pressure, which is ideal for folks like myself who want lower temps without too much dust accumulation. What about you? How many fans does your gaming machine possess?

Grip cases for the Nintendo Switch 2 feel more like a problem than a solution
I received a couple of grip cases for the Nintendo Switch 2 when it first launched so I could test them, and they did improve my comfort. Recently, I picked the Dbrand Killswitch back up because I noticed my hand sweat/grease was quite visible on the Joy-Con 2 and I want to preserve the look of the plastic.
But it's not really a matter of comfort for me, and frankly, in terms of protecting the console, I worry that using one on these grips cases causes more damage than it prevents. Applying them is fairly difficult, and I worry that I'm going to scratch something. I recently ordered a Dbrand skin instead, but I can't even remove the Killswitch case because I'm worried about removing and reinstalling it potenitally causing more damage. At the end of the day, I'd just rather use skins than grip cases.

I can't wait to play Nightreign's Deep of Night mode next week
Now that it has been a few months since Elden Ring: Nightreign dropped, we've had quite a few bosses added to the game (even though they're technically just the enhanced versions of their base-game counterparts). If you're even remotely as into Nightreign as I am, you've probably beaten everything the game has to offer and are itching for something new to fight. Well, Fromsoftware will add a hard mode starting next week, and I can't wait to try it out. Named Deep of Night, this mode will apparently add random bosses, buffed enemies, and a progression system, wherein the game gets progressively harder the deeper you go into the mode. Me? I just want to equip more relics and create the most broken builds possible. Leaks revealed Deep of Night allows up to six relics for each Nightfarer, and I'll probably spend the first couple of days farming the relics exclusive to this mode.

I finally updated my Immich storage configuration
For the past few weeks, my self-hosted Immich server has been blocked from upgrading due to requiring changes to my storage configuration. For whatever reason, the project has made it so that your immich files need to be stored in regular folders rather than dedicated datasets for each type of data, which I don't really get.
This was quite annoying, too, because the warnings in TrueNAS did a terrible job at providing guidance on how to move my existing data to the new format, so I was experimenting for a bit and it wouldn't work. Thankfully, I found a proper guide last night and was able to follow the steps to make everything work correctly. It feels nice to finally have my NAS and its apps up to date. Did you have any trouble migrating your Immich storage?

Are you playing Kirby and the Forgotten Land on the Switch 2?
Nintendo just released the Switch 2 Edition upgrade for Kirby and the Forgotten Land earlier this week, and as a huge Nintendo fan, of course I'm already all over it. So far, the new campaign seems like more of what we saw before, and that's not a bad thing considering the game was phenomenal from the start. I do think the new levels are beautiful, too, but maybe I'm just simple-minded and love sparkly things. Plus, everything runs more smoothly and at a higher resolution, so that's nice.
What I'm currently most curious about is the new boss rush difficulty that's introduced in this new edition. I remember beating the ahrdest difficulty in the base game, but it's been a while and I'm a little rusty. Have you already beaten the new content? What are your thoughts? I'd love to hear them!

I'm starting to grow fond of FreeBSD distros
TrueNAS Core was the first FreeBSD distro I tinkered with, and it was (and low-key still is) a surprisingly robust distribution for a DIY storage server. But after transitioning to TrueNAS Scale, OPNsense was my only link to the FreeBSD world for a long time.
However, all that changed when I came across GhostBSD earlier this year. Contrary to my expectations, it's a rock-solid general-purpose distro, and it's what pushed me into the FreeBSD scene yet again. I also recently installed NomadBSD on a flash drive, and I've been loving it so far.

What do you wish your Google Nest Hub could do?
I've been playing around with building my own Google Nest Hub alternative, and I've been using an Elecrow 7-inch ESP32-based display for building it up. I'm implementing typical "idle" pages that will surface controls for my home, but what can a Nest Hub not do that I could implement as well? I'm curious; there aren't many things I wish mine could do out of the box, but there are lots of silly things I could implement that are fun.

I'm back in the custom Android ROM game
Lately, I've been getting more and more into Linux as a replacement for Windows 11, and I've recently installed Arch Linux with KDE on one of my preferred laptops. It seems this has gotten a little bug in me, as recently I started wondering about installing Lineage OS on my Android phone, too, especially after Google started threatening to block sideloading of Android apps from unverified developers.
Well, that wonder quickly turned into action as last night I flashed Lineage OS 22.2 (Android 15) on my Fairphone 5, and so far, I really like it. I opted to include Google apps as I do have use for them, but it's nice that I can uninstall all the things I don't need. Plus, this just seems to perform a lot better than Fairphone's stock Android ROM, so I think I might be staying on LineageOS for a while.

It's been 34 years since the first iteration of Linux
Thirty-four years ago, Linus Torvalds announced his "free" operating system to the world, with just a few more than ten thousand lines of code inside it. Now, that many lines are added to the kernel daily, with over 34 million lines of code contributed to by thousands of dedicated developers worldwide. It powers everything from gaming consoles to routers, servers, the top 500 supercomputers, and more, and it will only grow from here. Who knows what the next few decades will hold, especially once Torvalds retires and other maintainers take control, but Linux isn't going anywhere.

I just upgraded my router, and I'm blown away
I recently switched internet providers to a much cheaper one, and while the advertised download speeds are the same, I've found that the provided router from this new ISP is much worse than my old one, with noticeably worse Wi-Fi speeds when I'm right next to it, and even more so when I move to a different room.
Some Reddit users recommended me a router called Flint 2 from GL.iNet, and I finally caved, and I have to say, I'm blown away by its performance. Connecting it via cable to my ISP's router and using its Wi-Fi is a night-and-day difference. Performance in my office is almost as good as being right next to the router, and in all cases, it's noticeably faster than the included router.

Be honest, how many wins do you have against the Everdark version of Libra in Nightreign?
When Fromsoftware announced the Everdark variant of Libra, Creature of Night, I was itching to fight the Equilibrious Beast. And between the never-ending army of invaders, random madness-inducing AoEs, and ocassional "deals" from Libra, the boss fight exceeded all my expectations.
Truth be told, I loved the boss fight, even though I've only beaten the Everdark Sovereign twice. The first win was due to my team finding Marais Executioner's Greatswords (yes, we found more than one) during the first day in Nokstella and grinding several enemies to buff the weapon. The other time, it was all thanks to a skilled Ironeye carrying us through the fight. What about you? How many wins do you have against this challenging boss?

If WinApps gets proper Wayland support, I never want to touch Windows again
I've been more and more interested in the Linux space over the past few months, and I just recently mentioned I only use Windows because I have to. Well, today, a friend of mine told me about WinApps, a project that containerizes Windows so you can run apps like Microsoft Office or Adobe Creative Cloud without real-time translation and the potential bugs that come with it.
Sadly, it seems WinApps is still designed around x11 and won't work on Wayland, but if that changes soon, I think I might not have a reason to use a Windows PC anymore. I can't wait for that day, honestly.

This LED matrix display is one of the best uses for an ESP32 I've found
The ESP32 is a ridiculously versatile microcontroller, and you can connect practically anything to it with some technical know-how and programming skills. One example of that has been the HUB75-based Waveshare 64x32 matrix LED panel, which I've been absolutely loving. It looks good, it's easy to use (once you get the hang of things), and it's one of the most practical uses I've had to dedicate an ESP32 to.
What other devices have you been using with your microcontrollers?

The iMac is 27 years old and boy do my knees hurt reading that
The iMac's enduring place in the market is a far cry from the Macintosh machines that nearly sank Apple as a company in the 1980s and 90s. Those were beige, soulless boxes with confusing options, while the iMac was an instant design classic, and every iteration has been a banger. Bright colors, high performance thanks to the deep integration of macOS with the hardware it's running on, and everything you need in one box, including speakers, a mouse, and a keyboard. Throw in good networking, and you had the fastest and easiest way to get on the fledgling internet in the late 1990s. Now you have Apple Silicon and fantastic display quality, wrapped in a super slim chassis, and the iMac virtually sells itself. Here's to the next quarter century!

RAM ranks high on my priority list when I'm hunting for a new NAS
When you're planning to buy a Network-Attached Storage system, you'll probably pay a lot of attention to its Ethernet provisions, drive bay count, support for NVMe drives, and other storage/network aspects. After all, you don't need a beefy processor for a storage server. However, I pay a lot of attention to the amount of RAM that ships with a NAS.
That's because I prefer ZFS to other file systems, which is infamous for hogging up extra memory. For a powerful server with massive RAID pools, I'd rather not starve my ZFS arrays on the RAM front. And that's before you include the lightning-fast speeds my HDDs could achieve after enabling RAM caches.
