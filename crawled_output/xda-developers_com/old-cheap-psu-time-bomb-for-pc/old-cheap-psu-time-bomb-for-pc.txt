Your old, cheap PSU is a ticking time bomb

I bet you've been dreaming about at least one big PC upgrade. It might be a new RTX 50 series GPU or a Ryzen X3D CPU, but have you considered that what might need upgrading the most might be your PSU instead? That cheap budget PSU you've been using for 5 years might not have shown any signs of dying yet, but that might just mean it's been silently counting down to an inevitable, explosive end. Poor-quality power supplies aren't just inefficient and incapable; they can be fatal to your precious PC. If you haven't already, replace your cheap old PSU as soon as possible.
Exploding PSUs aren't a fantasy
Especially subpar units
If you haven't experienced a dead PSU firsthand, you might feel like I'm exaggerating; I wish I were. One of my colleagues here at XDA recently had an EVGA Gold-rated PSU die on him after just 5 years of use. Now, a high-quality PSU blowing up might be an exception, but it shows that you shouldn't take PSU quality lightly. The power supply is responsible for routing clean and sufficient power to each of your components. A unit with insufficient power or poor materials can give up under heavy loads. This is why you should always avoid off-brand and unusually cheap PSUs with a poor efficiency rating and cheap internals. You might treat the power supply as an afterthought when building a PC, but it's one of the most critical components of any build. It's always recommended to buy a quality PSU after doing your research, consuming reviews, and checking PSU tier lists to ensure you're minimizing the chances of something going wrong.
It's not worth saving a few bucks
You're gambling on the safety of your PC
I understand that every dollar counts on a budget build, but the PSU is hardly the area where you should pinch pennies. The reason is that the downside of using a poor-quality PSU is highly disproportionate. It doesn't just cost you the price of a new PSU if it blows up; it can also take down your other components. That can easily cost you hundreds of dollars in the long run. A well-built unit from a reputable manufacturer with an 80+ Bronze rating (or better) should be the minimum you should consider. You might save $20–$30 with a cheaper power supply, but the negative effects of insufficient power can ruin your PC experience. Your CPU and GPU might not perform at their potential, especially if you're overclocking them. Random freezes, crashes, and shutdowns are also possible if your PSU can't supply enough wattage. While you might say that a budget build doesn't need much power anyway, the fact is that you still need a reliable PSU to protect your components from power spikes, no matter their performance tier.
Replace your cheap PSU right now
Before the worst happens
Even if nothing bad has happened to your PC yet, it doesn't mean it won't in the future. Gigabyte's exploding GP-P850GM and GP-P750GM units created a huge stir in 2021, forcing the brand to offer replacements. You might just be lucky that your cheap (and old) power supply is somehow still running. I'd advise you to replace it ASAP with a Gold-rated (if possible) unit that's well-reviewed and has enough wattage to account for power excursions and future upgrades. You can use a PSU calculator to find your PC's power requirements, and then add a 25–40% margin over it. On the other hand, if you're using a high-quality power supply already, check if you're approaching the end of the warranty period. Replacing your PSU before it is out of warranty ensures you have peace of mind when using your PC to its fullest. You don't have to worry about random failures, or you can at least minimize the chances. Buying a PSU with a 10-year warranty is ideal if your budget permits; if not, try to ensure it's a well-reviewed unit and is known to be reliable.

Don't risk the life of your entire PC
The damage from a PSU blowing up isn't always limited to the unit itself; it can kill your GPU, CPU, motherboard, and more. The $20 you saved by opting for a cheap unit will feel inconsequential in front of the hundreds of dollars in dead components. Check your power supply to ensure it's not a cheap unit with no proper efficiency rating. If it is, replace it ASAP with one that's ideally Gold-rated and well-reviewed. You'll give yourself some peace of mind by replacing your PSU before the warranty expires, even if it's a high-quality unit.

I would usually dismiss this kind of article, wouldn't it been for the fact that the strange HDD wire errors and SATA disconnections I was having in my NAS weren't due indeed to a PSU going bad. Less than two years old, no other symptoms, just not enough or irregular power to the drives. I wasn't even suspecting it, but after eliminating every other factor (board, memory, CPU) I switched the PSU by another with the same rating (850w) and all the issues disappeared.

I tried Seasonic. Stopped buying them after one died on me. Ditto Antec. Now I only ever buy Corsair or Be Quiet. Never had one come back faulty.Been building PC's for over 20 years.

Brands don't matter much, most of them outsource production to one of the big manufacturers. Seasonic being the exception, but they still have some objectively bad designs in their lineup. Even different power ratings within the same series can range from dangerous to high quality.

Still using my Corsair HX 620 I installed in 2007. It's seen me through one mobo/CPU upgrade. About to upgrade to an RTX 5060
- only 2D stuff so should be ok.
