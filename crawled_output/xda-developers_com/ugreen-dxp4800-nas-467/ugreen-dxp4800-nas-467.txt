Saving your data to a portable drive is a solid way to back up anything important that you don't want to lose. But for those that want a little more control, while also still having the versatility of what the cloud has to offer, a NAS is going to be the way to go. This one from Ugreen is an easy one to recommend, mainly because its price is just so good, dropping to $467 for a limited time.
A work in progress

Ugreen isn't a brand that's typically known for its NAS devices, but it delivers a pretty solid product here thanks to the device's excellent hardware. It's compact, durable, and also comes powered by an Intel N100, 8GB RAM, and can accommodate up to four HDDs. There's also two slots for M.2 SSDs up to 16TB. In total, this NAS can store up to 136TB, which is quite a bit. As far as how you can use this device, well, you can easily back up all your files from various devices, and access those same files while you're on the go. You can also use the NAS to manage and stream all your media, while also creating Dockers and Virtual Machines. The great news is that Ugreen continues to add more features as time passes. And judging from the positive reviews on Amazon, folks are pretty happy with their purchases, which is why this NAS is top-rated on the platform. Overall, this is going to be a fantastic purchase for anyone looking to experiment with building their own storage setup. While portable drives and cloud storage are good, having your own NAS is going to be a game-changing experience.
