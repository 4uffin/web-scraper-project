Give me a lighthearted recap
As a longtime user of Mealie, I thought I had found the perfect self-hosted solution for managing my recipes. It was reliable, straightforward, and got the job done for a while. However, over time, I began to encounter some limitations that left me wanting more features and flexibility. I wanted a robust system for organizing my ever-growing recipe collection. That’s when I discovered Tandoor, which promised to be the upgrade I was looking for. After making the switch, Tandoor has changed the way I cook, plan, and organize. Here are the top reasons why I will never go back to another tool.
Tandoor has a better user experience design
Less confusing for new users
Tandoor features a more intuitive user experience design, making it easy to add recipes and navigate the app. It truly feels like it was built with the user’s workflow in mind, which sets it apart. For example, adding a recipe manually in Tandoor is efficient. It’s a straightforward, single-page process where all the necessary fields, like title, description, ingredients, and instructions, are presented clearly. Unlike Mealie, I don’t have to click through multiple tabs and menus to get my recipe into the system. Everything is laid out right there, which makes a quick task feel even quicker. Even the general layout is logical and uncluttered (and customizable, where I can change the app accent color from Settings). The ingredient list, instructions, and notes are all displayed in a way that’s easy to read and follow while cooking.
Better import process
More flexible
Importing my entire recipe collection was a crucial step in making the switch, and this is where Tandoor really shines. While I appreciated that Mealie could handle importing recipes from a URL or an HTML file, Tandoor takes this capability to the next level. When I went to the import page, it wasn’t just a generic file upload; it had specific options for migrating my data from my existing apps. I was able to select Mealie and simply upload the backup file I had created. Tandoor recognized the file structure, including photos and other metadata, and brought everything over seamlessly. The same goes for other popular services. If you are coming from Nextcloud Cookbook or a mobile app like Paprika, Tandoor has a specific import option for you as well.
Tandoor has better community-made mobile apps
Kitshn vs. Mealient
The quality of a mobile app is a deal-breaker for me, and this is an area where Tandoor really pulls ahead. While Mealie has a community-made Mealient app, it’s nowhere near Tandoor’s unofficial app called Kitshn. Kitshn is developed using Jetpack Compose and Material You, which gives a clean, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing interface. It’s a joy to use on my Pixel 8. The app’s layout is intuitive, and everything from browsing recipes to adding items to my shopping list feels fluid and natural. In comparison, I often found Mealient to be a bit clunky. The list of features includes cooking mode, meal planning, shopping list, recipe books, and more. You can’t go wrong with it.
Collaboration setup is smooth
Thanks to spaces
Before Tandoor, sharing recipes felt complex. I would either export a recipe and send it to a family member, or we would have to use a shared user account, which quickly got messy and confusing. Tandoor’s Spaces solves this problem perfectly. It allows me to create a dedicated space where I can invite family, friends, or roommates to collaborate. Within a space, everyone can add, edit, and contribute to the same recipe collection. When inviting members, I can define a role (guest, user, or admin) and even set validity. It’s a single, shared database for our meals. This seamless, built-in collaboration is a game-changer and has made cooking with others a smooth experience.
Advanced feature set for power users
Deeper ingredient management
Like Mealie, Tandoor has nailed the basics. But it goes a step further with several powerful features. For example, Tandoor has a smart system that understands the relationship between the ingredient amount, the unit, and the food item itself. Now, I don’t have to manually recalculate every single ingredient. I can simply adjust the number of servings, and Tandoor handles the rest. Other unique features include a powerful search and tagging system, excellent meal planning with a calendar view, and nutritional and pricing insights. You can also head to the Database menu to create recipes, shopping lists, meal plans, and more. As expected, Tandoor is also an open-source solution with self-hosting capabilities.
A better way to manage recipes
So, while Mealie was a solid starting point for my self-hosted recipe journey, my move to Tandoor has been effective. The improved user experience, powerful features like advanced search and ingredient management with minute details, and the overall reliability have made my digital kitchen more organized and efficient than I ever thought possible. If you have been looking for a way to take your recipe management to the next level, or if you're a longtime Mealie user feeling the same limitations I did, I highly recommend giving Tandoor a try.
