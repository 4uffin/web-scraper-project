Nintendo has just announced its first "general" Nintendo Direct since it launched the Switch 2 over three months ago, and suffice it to say, it feels like it's going to be a banger. Partly because Nintendo skipped its usual June showcase, which means we're overdue for a deluge of Nintendo news, but also because Nintendo is kind of promising exactly that.According to the company, this will be a roughly 60-minute long show, which makes it the longest general Direct ever, if we exclude the April showcase that was exclusively focused on revealing the Switch 2 and its launch lineup. There are no expected hardware announcements this time around, so it's all about the games (and maybe the sequel to the Mario movie), which makes it all the more exciting.
