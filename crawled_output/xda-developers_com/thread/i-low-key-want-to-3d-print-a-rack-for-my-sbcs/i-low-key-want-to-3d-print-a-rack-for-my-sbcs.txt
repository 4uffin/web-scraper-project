The lightweight champ Raspberry Pi Zero began my obsession with Single-Board Computers, and I've since expanded my collection to include everything from Arm boards to x86 units and RISC-V SBCs. Thanks to their small size and low power consumption, I run a handful of these SBCs in my home lab. Unfortunately, I don't own a proper rack for them, and all my attempts at finding the one that suits my needs have ended in vain. However, I recently came across some forums and idea boards where tinkerers showed off their 3D-printed racks. And now I really want to print one for my arsenal of SBCs. Of course, I'll have to research the right schematics and filament type, but it seems like a fun weekend project.
