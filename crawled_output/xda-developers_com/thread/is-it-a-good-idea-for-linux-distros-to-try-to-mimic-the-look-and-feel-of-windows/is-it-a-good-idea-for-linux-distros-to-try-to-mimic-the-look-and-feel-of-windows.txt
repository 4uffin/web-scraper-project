Some may argue that making Linux distros resemble Windows can make it easier for users to transition from Windows to Linux, providing a familiar interface. However, others believe that mimicking Windows goes against the open-source ethos of Linux and can lead to security and privacy concerns, as seen with distros like Winux. Ultimately, the decision depends on individual preferences and priorities, but trying something new can feel more liberating.

There is nothing wrong in mimicing Windows GUI in GNU/Linux. But there would be wrong to mimic Windows behavior in terms of how the operating system works.The best way is to act like KDE Plasma. This desktop environment has Windows-like default layout of panel and app launcher, but the user is welcome to change the layout to resemble any operating system, be it macOS, Windows, and any desktop environment, be it GNOME, CDE, Budgie. Windows lacks such flexibility.
