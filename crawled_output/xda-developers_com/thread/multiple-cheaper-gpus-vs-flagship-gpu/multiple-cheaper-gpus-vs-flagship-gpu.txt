On one hand, using multiple cheaper GPUs can provide a balance of performance and cost savings, especially when leveraging older hardware. It also offers some redundancy in case one GPU fails. On the other hand, a single high-end GPU may offer better overall performance and simplicity, without the need for complex configuration and management of multiple cards. The choice ultimately depends on budget, specific requirements, and the value placed on performance versus convenience. Which camp are you in?
