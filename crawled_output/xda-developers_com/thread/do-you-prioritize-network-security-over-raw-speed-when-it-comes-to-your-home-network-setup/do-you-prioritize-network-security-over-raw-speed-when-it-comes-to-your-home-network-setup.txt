People's priorities may vary, but for those running home labs or concerned about the security of their network, investing in a custom firewall with advanced security features could be more valuable than simply increasing bandwidth. However, for average users focused on streaming and browsing, speed might be the primary concern. Do you value speed over security, or is it the other way around?

Richard, I have a network question. Just upgraded to fiber with a 500 mb/s service. I am receiving over 600 at the ONT. The Wi-Fi router function will provide nearly the same speed to closely linked appliances. I have a wired network in my home connected through the ONT's 5GB Ethernet cable connection using CAT6 wire to a NexGear GS308. In my office, the wired signal speed drops to less than 100 mb/s (280 mb/s on Wi-Fi). All cabling is Cat 5e or Cat 6. I have checked all rj45 cable connections and replaced any that were questionable. What have I missed? Any tests that I should run? Should I just resign myself to loading up the Wi-Fi network connections (80+).
