Nintendo has just held its latest Direct showcase going over numerous upcoming games for the Switch and Switch 2. There were some great announcements in there, but none shocked me more than the addition of Virtual Boy to the Nintendo Classics library on both Switch and Switch 2.The Virtual Boy is infamously Nintendo's worst selling console hardware, recorded at 770,000 units sold worldwide, though the hardware was never launched in Europe. This addition to the Nintendo Classics library is also going to require an add-on that pretty much replicates the look of that original hardware, and it'll be available in all major markets, meaning it's more than likely it will sell more than the original hardware.I'm just absolutely befuddled that this is happening now, when Nintendo had a perfect opportunity to re-release these games on the 3DS and never did it. But there's no way around the fact that this is at least interesting.

Good news for the 10 people who owned one of these back then :) sadly I broken my 40+ years relationship with Nintendo, what they are doing to the gaming industry is horrible.
