I recently wrote a very personal piece on why Windows 11 updates are boring and how I much prefer the Apple approach of adding notable new features with the majority of annual updates. Microsoft's strategy is more about rolling out new features whenever they're ready, which makes it a little less interesting to follow the developments.However, I'm sure many people don't care about updates at all and just want a functional computer. Are you someone who enjoys getting big new feature updates, or do you prefer the more boring and upredictable pace of Windows 11 releases?
