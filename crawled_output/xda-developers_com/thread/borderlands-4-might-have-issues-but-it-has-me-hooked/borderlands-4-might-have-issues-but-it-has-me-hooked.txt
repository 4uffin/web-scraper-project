Whelp, Gearbox has done it again. Another Borderlands release, hang on one sec, another broken Borderlands release, but it doesn't matter. The looter shooter has got its claws into the dopamine factories in my brain, and it won't let go. I'm not sure if I like the vault hunters on offer this time around (although two unknowns are coming in DLC, so maybe I'll enjoy one of those as much as I loved Krieg the Psycho from BL2), but damn, if the guns don't feel great, the writing (for the side-quests anyway) is spot on, and the dopamine hits from every green glowing container when I pop it open. I'm sure there's a main storyline somewhere, but all I can see is containers to open, shinies to pick up, and cel-shaded baddies to stomp.

I have to go back to Windows and I'm not happy about it
How far have you progressed into Nightreign's new mode?
I finally applied a skin to my Switch 2, and it's so much nicer than a grip
