The Nintendo Switch 2 is just over a month old, but with the launch of Donkey Kong Bananza, Nintendo has already shown it has what it takes to make a true next-gen game experience. I've only had the chance to play it for about one hour, but it's amazing how quickly this game gives you a sense of "I don't know how they would ever have done this on previous hardware".Sure, Mario Kart World's interconnected world would need a lot of sacrifices on the original Switch, but the sheer amount of destruction you can cause in Donkey Kong Banaza is incredible. The entire world is yours to smash, crash, and bash as you please, and it all responds perfectly. Making use of voxel technology in such an ambitious way really elevates this game and shows off the hardware's capabilities in a way you might not immediately think of. Plus, the game looks gorgeous, too.
