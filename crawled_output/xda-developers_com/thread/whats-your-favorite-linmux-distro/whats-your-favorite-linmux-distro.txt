As you may know, I've become a very big fan of Linux over the past few months, and my primary laptop now runs Arch linux with KDE Plasma. I love using it and find it much more fun than Windows, but I also know there's a huge world of distros out there for all kinds of people.So I'm curious what your favorites are. Do you use Arch? NixOS? Maybe something more user-friendly like Ubuntu or Linux Mint? I'd love to hear your thoughts!

My favorite is Fedora Budgie Atomic. But for now, I've been using my next favorite, which is Fedora Kinoite. Budgie 10.9, which is based on the old outdated X11 display server, is in Fedora 42. But Budgie 10.10, which is Wayland based, is in F43. So I'll switch back to Budgie on F43.Wayland is important to me mostly from the standpoint of being able to install Android Play Store apps. If Budgie is Wayland based, I can create a Fedora container and install Waydroid in it. If Budgie is X11 based, I'd have to create a VM from a distro that is Wayland based and then install Waydroid in the VM. An OS container runs apps much more seamlessly than its VM.
