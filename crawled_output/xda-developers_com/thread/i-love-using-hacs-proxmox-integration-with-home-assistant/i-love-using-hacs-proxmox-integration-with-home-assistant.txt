Armed with numerous integrations and dashboards, the Home Assistant Community Store is a must-have for tinkerers who want to take the functionality of their HASS-powered smart home to the next level. However, the Proxmox integration is hands-down my favorite HACS offering, as it lets me monitor and control my PVE nodes directly from Home Assistant's UI. Throw in a custom dashboard and a cheap display, and I can manage my Proxmox-based virtual guests like the conventional smart devices in my home lab.
