When I reviewed the Dbrand Killswitch a while back, I noted that it seems to do its job well, but I just don't find this kind of product that appealing. I would much rather use a typical travel case, and more recently, I even noticed how I didn't even want to play with the grips, either.However, I was starting to worry that my hand grease would wear down the plastic on my Joy-Con 2, so I finally bit the bullet and bought a skin from Dbrand. And it turns out, I was right, I like this way more than using a grip. I do already find the Joy-Con 2 quite comfortable, and the skin looks really cool on it. I will say the measurements seem to be a fraction of a millimeter off, and aligning with + button means that the skin is just a smidge too high for the other buttons, particularly B, Home, and the C button. But so far it still seems totally usable, and it looks great.
