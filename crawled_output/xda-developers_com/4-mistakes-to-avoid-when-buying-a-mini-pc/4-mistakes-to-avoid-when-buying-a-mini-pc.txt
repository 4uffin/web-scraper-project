Give me a lighthearted recap
Mini PCs are a great option for a home PC or work setup, offering the experience of a desktop PC without taking up as much space as a mid-sized tower with additional portability. While most folks won't commute with a mini PC, it is a possibility. And the PC itself being so small makes it easier to move in the event you need to change apartments or want to redecorate your office. There's also a great degree of variety in the mini PC market, with some PCs offering better gaming performance and others being minimalist workhorse machines. But when you're looking to buy a new mini PC, there are five key mistakes to avoid so you can get the most out of your new computer without worrying.
4
Limiting your upgrade options
Mini PCs can be difficult to upgrade over time
One of the primary benefits of desktop towers is the ease of upgrades. You can easily change components of a desktop tower piece by piece as you need, adding additional storage and memory to available slots, upgrading your GPU, and eventually swapping out the motherboard, CPU, cooler, and PSU. Not all mini PCs are designed to be upgraded. Some mini PCs are more modular; others, like the Asus NUC 14 Pro, are more like build-kit PCs that can be upgraded. However, many mini PCs are designed to be self-contained computers with minimal upgrade access, similar to a laptop. If you know you'll want to tinker with your mini PC and upgrade it over time, make sure you check reviews of mini PCs to find one with good upgradability before you purchase one, because not all mini PCs are intended for upgrading. Or if you want one that's fully pre-built, make sure you don't take home a NUC, which are often sold without storage or memory.
3
Ignoring network connectivity
Got to be careful with those I/O ports
If you know you're going to need serious network connectivity, be sure you check for an RJ45 Ethernet port on your mini PC or ensure it has a strong Wi-Fi card, since the Realtek Wi-Fi cards pre-installed on many mini PC motherboards may not be suitable for your use case. While most mini PCs have at least one Ethernet port, there are a few that don't have any at all, like the Khadas Mind. Of course, if your mini PC is mostly going to be used for checking your emails, and will be running Windows, the onboard Wi-Fi card is probably enough. But if you plan to use your mini PC as part of a home lab, or if you plan to install a Linux-based OS on your mini PC, you might want to make sure it's got a Wi-Fi card that plays well with Linux or has at least one Ethernet jack.
2
Assuming they're portable
Mini PCs are more portable than a desktop tower, but not as much as you think
A mini PC is much smaller than a desktop tower, so it's easier to pack up and take with you. But it isn't as portable as a laptop, since you still need to worry about the monitor, keyboard, and mouse at the very least. There are ways around this, of course. If you'll be taking your mini PC between two locations that already have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse workstation setup, then the mini PC is an incredibly portable option. But if you're moving or traveling, the accessories you need to get a mini PC running make it a bit trickier to carry around compared to a laptop which has a built-in display, keyboard, and touchpad. Travel monitors do exist, and I've known at least one person who travels with a mini PC, keyboard, mouse, and monitor. But for most, that's a lot of extra tech to carry with them for a short trip.

Forgetting performance and graphics limitations
Smaller size means less cooling options and smaller GPUs
Mini PCs are intended to be small, which come with some necessary performance sacrifices to fit a fully functional PC into such a small format. This primarily comes at the cost of cooling options, as you've got fewer fans and more limited options for liquid cooling in a small mini PC case compared to a mid-sized or full-sized desktop tower. Just like with laptops, mini PCs are thermally constrained PCs, so you won't be getting the same class of performance out of each individual component. Which means 6-core and 8-core mini PCs are often more cost-effective and can more easily leverage the onboard chipset than more expensive mini PCs with higher-end components. But mini PCs also opt to use mobile CPUs for space savings, so you're not getting the full desktop experience regardless. Similarly, these thermal and space constraints also impact a mini PC's graphics performance and graphics card options. Because of the slim, small form factor, many mini PCs are integrated GPU machines, but more gaming or design-focused mini PCs often have models with discrete GPUs. Mini PCs with discrete graphics opt for the mobile GPU variant, like the Asus ROG NUC (2025) with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 Laptop GPU. This is due to both space constraints in the mini PC design and thermal constraints on the cooling front. If you want a gaming mini PC, you do have some options. But they will be competing with gaming laptops in terms of performance, not desktop towers. So, if you want to keep your desktop class performance, you might be better off going with a new ATX tower or ITX case instead of a mini PC. Though a mini PC will save you a lot on desk space, but it won't be the multitasking machine or gaming powerhouse of your dreams.
The key is knowing what you want from a mini PC
Before buying any computer, you should have an idea of what you're going to use it for. And that should help you narrow down your search or decide to go with a larger form-factor PC instead. That's not to say mini PCs aren't great. They're fantastic as long as you know what you're getting for your money. They tend to be less repairable or upgradeable as a whole, and have less graphics and compute performance than mid-sized or full-sized tower PCs.

These aren't so much mistakes to be avoided as they are just things to be aware of when deciding to go with a mini.

Small PCs give me claustrophobia. I use a tower with a DVD drive and a couple extra HDDs. It's vertical instead of wires and peripherals spread over a desk. If I want smaller I use a laptop.

What about these are mistakes? It's more like a list of things to consider if you need a laptop, desktop or mini PC, if you need upgradeability and horsepower, desktop is the way to go. If you need portability, go laptop, go laptop! If you just want a cheap office computer or a fairly capable home server, mini PC is probably your best bet unless you need less power, in which case a Pi is enough.

As a computer technician, I advice everyone to stay away from mini computers if possible, unless you need them for specific needs and you know what you are doing!Stay away from All In One computers unless you TRULY have no space!If you use a computer in ONE place, I advice you to buy a DESKTOP, not a laptop unless you have no space!I advice you every one to stay away from Apple products, but that's a different discussion

I have a different take: When you buy a mini PC, buy it for a specific purpose - and don’t expect it to serve in any other purpose.I like to use mini PCs as dedicated servers for specific functions on my home network. If I want a Plex server, I can build that on a mini PC; if I want a Calibre e-book server, I can build that at a really low end mini PC.Some mini PCs can be upgraded, but you need to know that when you make your plans, and you should do that almost immediately after purchase. The point is to get a machine that meets the specific requirements of the role you’re going to give it, and then build it to fit that role.One of the really nice things about mini PCs is the fact that they sip electricity at the very low levels, so you can use them as appliance servers, especially if you’re running Linux on them.If you need a general purpose machine, then you’re probably better off building a tower for that purpose. But if you want a single purpose machine, a mini PC will probably be the best bang for your buck.
