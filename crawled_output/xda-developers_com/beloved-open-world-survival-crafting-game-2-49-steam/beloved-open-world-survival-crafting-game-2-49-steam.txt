There are a ton of open-world survival crafting games out there now, but it's always worth it to pay homage to the ones that helped pioneer the genre. One such title was Don't Starve, which was released back in April 2013 to critical acclaim. Even today, the game holds up really well. If you want to see how long you can go without starving, then Don't Starve is currently on a steep sale over on Steam. While the game does feature quite a bit of DLC, you can give the base game a spin for just $2.49 and see if it's to your liking.
Don't Starve is now 75% off on Steam
If you've never heard of Don't Starve before, it has a unique take on the open-world survival crafting genre. It's a top-down game where the characters and the world all have a cool, hand-drawn look to them. As for your objective, not starving is a good first step, but as you'll quickly discover, there are things in this world scarier than an empty stomach. Here's how the devs describe the game:
Don’t Starve is an uncompromising wilderness survival game full of science and magic.
You play as Wilson, an intrepid Gentleman Scientist who has been trapped by a demon and transported to a mysterious wilderness world. Wilson must learn to exploit his environment and its inhabitants if he ever hopes to escape and find his way back home.
Enter a strange and unexplored world full of strange creatures, dangers, and surprises. Gather resources to craft items and structures that match your survival style. Play your way as you unravel the mysteries of this strange land.
Despite being 12 years old now, Don't Starve has 239 recent reviews at the time of writing, 95% of which are positive. And while you may want to pick up some of the DLC in the future (such as Don't Starve Together for online multiplayer), you can't go wrong with $2.49 to give the game a test drive. Just be sure to grab it before September 27th when the deal will return to the shadows once more.
