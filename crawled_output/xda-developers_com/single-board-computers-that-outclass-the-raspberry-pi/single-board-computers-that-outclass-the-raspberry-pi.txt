Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:

Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
The Raspberry Pi enjoys the maximum spotlight in the single-board computer (SBC) category. It’s got a versatile lineup of basic to top-tier boards that cater to multiple segments. The Pico and Zero 2W fit into a single-purpose role, while the 4B and 5 series cater towards the more demanding side of projects. But Raspberry Pi isn’t the only deserving candidate on my list anymore. The competition is noticeably outshining the Pi in many respects, some even offering an NPU and a comparable price-to-performance ratio. While the Raspberry Pi is an easy choice for many, it would be unwise not to consider other single-board computer offerings from brands such as Radxa, Orange Pi, and many more. These boards trump the Pi in multiple situations; there’s no reason to choose the obvious option mindlessly.
Radxa X4
An x86 alternative
Why confine yourself to ARM when you can get an x86-based Radxa X4 in the same price bracket? If you plan to use your SBC as a desktop and consider the Pi 5 with 8GB of memory, you'll surely encounter hiccups. Our previous review of the Pi 5 saw a lot of problems with the YouTube playback beyond 1080p resolution due to the slightly inferior SoC. Radxa X4 excels in the desktop replacement category with its powerful Intel N100 mini-PC processor. So, any kind of OS or casual browsing is a simple task for the Radxa X4. Its x86 architecture makes deploying most mainstream operating systems easier, including full versions of Ubuntu, Windows 11, and there's even scope for virtualization. I also find it amusing that Pi skips the audio jack even in its fifth iteration. Radxa fortunately has one, and connecting a decent speaker, especially if you want to make it into an audio streaming device, becomes super easy. Another praiseworthy feature is the M.2 SSD slot, which saves you the trouble of finding an NVMe hat. You'll be happy with connectivity options because Wi-Fi 6 and 2.5GB are a rarity in the under $100 SBC segment. The protruding antennas are a little annoying compared to the on-board solution on the Pi 5. Emulating PS2 games is also a decent experience, but I wouldn't consider pushing it a generation further. PS3 game emulation is suitable for systems with a good GPU, and that's “too hot” for this single-fan board.

Banana Pi BPI-M7
Plenty of I/O and power

The Banana Pi BPI-M7 is for serious board tinkerers because the nearly $150 price tag can deter many from a mini PC. Its high price is due to overloading the board with a robust Rockchip SoC, useful ports such as dual 2.5 G Ethernet ports, Wi-Fi 6, and the latest Bluetooth versions, as well as a full-sized HDMI port. It’s one of the few boards that can play 4K video, making it fit for a media streaming setup, if you plan to build one with a spare display. That said, the NPU allows small-scale AI models, and the operating system support is not bad. You can find a list of all Banana Pi products, each accompanied by a concise document outlining how to set up the board, the official list of compatible OS images, and links to the products. It doesn’t include a cooler or an audio port, which further bloats the overall setup cost. However, you can add a full-size NVMe drive via the port on the back and enjoy PCIe Gen 3 transfer speeds.

Orange Pi 5 Pro
Praise-worthy performance
Unlike the Radxa X4, the Orange Pi 5 Pro is an ARM architecture SBC with double the processor cores, but only four are high-performance cores. Still, it's armed with Rockchip RK3588S and 8 GB LPDDR5x memory, and the combination makes a great difference in demanding multi-core scenarios. If I talk about the available operating systems, Orange Pi tries to offer a versatile experience, and even has an Android version. For a competitive price, you get a physical M.2 SSD port, which means no need for external hats and an eMMC port. An aux port is also there, but you get only a USB 3.0 port. I'm happy that someone decided to keep a full-sized HDMI port, reducing the need for one more adapter. Orange Pi’s raw performance is USP, while ports and IO are mixed. Still, there's much less to complain about if you consider the board's price-to-performance ratio.

ODroid M2
Suitable for AI workloads
ODroid M2 is quite an improvement (mostly) compared to the older M1. The board focuses mostly on raw power and latest-gen memory modules, and that shows in the heavy workloads, but some decisions don’t sit right with me. The first weird thing about this board is that it downgrades to a PCIe 2.1 interface, which reduces the overall transfer speed. You also need a $5 power adapter, which isn’t USB. Still, the overall cost for a fan doesn’t exceed the price of a complete Pi 5 with an NVMe hat, a cooler, and a power supply. When you upgrade to a new board like the ODroid M2 with an improved Neural Processing Unit (NPU), downgrading the PCIe slot is a bummer. There are a few more similarities with the Raspberry Pi 5, like the same Gigabit Ethernet port and a missing audio output jack. Other than that, if you are fairly adept with the SBC ecosystem and have used multiple SBC operating systems in the past, the ODroid M2 won’t trouble you much. You will surely get better performance in an AI project as the NPU is there to help. Pi 5 doesn’t have the NPU onboard, but you can add one with the help of the AI hat that costs as much as the 8GB memory version. The inflated cost of the AI hat makes the ODroid M2 with integrated NPU more appealing.

Pi has some serious competition
Raspberry Pi becomes an easy pick for a first-time SBC buyer because of the easy guides that help set up the board quickly. Other SBCs are trying to improve in this area, but you mustn’t ignore powerful SBC alternatives like the Radxa and Orange Pi solely because of the documentation. DietPi slowly expands to newer boards from these brands, and installing XFCE on top can bring you closer to a desktop experience. Moreover, these boards have ample working OS options (Ubuntu, custom OS, Android). If you crave more from the Raspberry Pi 5, try the above options.

I crave these so much that I just bought a Raspberry Pi 500+, with all the RPi ports, 16GB RAM and a 256GB SSD.
If you are developer who spends a lot of time on custom builds, these alternatives might be fine, but I don't want to spend the time to learn a new platform and reinvent the wheel.
