PC building has remained fundamentally the same over the last three decades. You pick the same 8 components, assemble them into your dream build, and waste hours optimizing every little aspect of it. What has changed, however, are the underlying trends surrounding the esthetics, and the modifications we make to our rigs. From gigantic cases and custom watercooling loops to delidding and all-RGB builds, some PC building trends aren't "cool" anymore.
5
Full-tower cases
Stopped being popular 15 years ago
Full-tower cases used to be all the rage till the early 2010s, when people wanted tons of space for their hard drives, multiple CD-ROM drives, and elaborate cooling setups. Plus, a lot of users preferred keeping their towers on the floor, as opposed to the newer practice of keeping them on the desk, next to your monitor. Relatively compact mid-towers and mini-ITX cases are easier to keep on your desk, and are just as easy to build in. Almost no one needs enormous cases anymore — hard drives, CD-ROM drives, and floppy drives are extinct in most setups. And complex custom watercooling loops have given way to AIO liquid coolers and air coolers. No matter how many radiators you want to install, or the number of fans you want to cram in your case, there's a mid-tower that's up to the task. Besides, mid-towers and SFF cases look sleeker and blend in better with the rest of the setup.
4
All-RGB builds
Ridiculous, Gaudy, Bygone
"To each their own" is something I always believe in, but excessive RGB is one of the PC trends that rapidly exploded before becoming a no-no in the last few years. From enhancing the looks of the PC to becoming the butt of jokes, RGB has been on a journey. Done tastefully, RGB lighting can still make a build look classy, but when you take it to the extreme, "rainbow puke" isn't an inaccurate summation. Manufacturers aren't stopping, though — RGB went from components to monitors, and even on GPU support brackets. You can find RGB deskmats, heatsinks, cables, and even chairs if you want. Combined with gaudy lighting that some people like to flood their PC room with, the entire scene quickly resembles a nightclub, and not the sophisticated kind. While RGB components, devices, and accessories won't disappear anytime soon, all-RGB builds have certainly dropped in popularity.
3
Overclocking CPUs and GPUs
Overrated, more like
Overclocking used to be the badge of honor for builders who went the extra mile to squeeze every ounce of performance from their builds. It was almost expected to push your CPU and GPU to their realistic limits; otherwise, you were leaving performance on the table. Today, however, overclocking has stopped being relevant. The gains aren't there anymore, and PC building has gone mainstream. Manufacturers started pushing CPUs and GPUs almost to their limits right out of the factory to target the new-age builders who prefer components that "just work." Overclocking became a niche hobby (more so than before) that yielded far too little for far too much effort. Some builders still do it on principle, but I see many more people undervolt their hardware instead of overclocking it. It reduces operating temps, extends component lifespan, and even gives you a small performance boost.
2
Custom loop watercooling
Much ado about nothing
While custom watercooling loops look superb, and provide cooling for not just the CPU, but multiple components simultaneously, most people just don't benefit enough from it anymore. The budget builder has no choice but to pick a $35 air cooler or $50 AIO; the mid-range builder upgrades to a better AIO or air cooler; and the high-end builder spends the extra budget on other high-end parts.
Custom loops are now relevant only to the enthusiasts of the enthusiasts — content creators or builders who can spend a ton on esthetics. A custom loop can still transform your PC visually, and even offer thermal benefits over an AIO, but the performance benefits are slim, and the cost and effort are high. Most CPUs and GPUs, even the high-end ones, can be tamed with AIOs, and it's far easier to craft a good-looking build without a custom watercooling loop.
1
CPU delidding
The risk-reward ratio is skewed
Source: Flickr
The only thing more complex on this list than custom watercooling is delidding your CPU. Removing the IHS to expose the CPU die for direct-die cooling (or replacing the TIM) has inherent risks. You can easily break your CPU permanently, and it obviously voids the warranty. The objective here is better thermals — something that just isn't possible without getting rid of the IHS. However, the gains aren't worth the risk. Modern chips are comfortable running near their TJMax, the temperature beyond which the CPU starts to throttle performance. They are designed to provide the maximum performance out of the box, and if you're really chasing lower temps, you can invest in a decent cooler and undervolt your CPU. Resorting to delidding isn't for everyone, and numerous accounts on Reddit show broken CPUs as a result of incorrect delidding.
PC building doesn't need to be complicated
You don't need to make life difficult for yourself just because you're building a PC instead of buying a pre-built. Things like delidding your CPU, crafting a custom loop, or even overclocking your hardware aren't relevant anymore, at least not for most people. PC building goes through trends just like any other sphere of life, and stuff like all-RGB builds and full-tower cases stopped being popular years ago.

I don't agree with number one. I still insist on having a disk drive due to still owning a nice collection of cd/dvd based games, and even to watch dvds, because my PC is my multimedia device, and I need multiple internal hard drives because I always have them packed with games and things that I've downloaded. Everything else though, is pretty spot on.

Don't worry. Half of these are nonsense from XDA nowadays I agree full cases are the way to fix especially with GPUs the way they are now. Allows plenty room for lovely cable management.I still uses spinners for high capacity data. But not for data I need speed.

TBF he said almost no one wants full towers not absolutely no one. What he said is objectively true hardly anyone wants or needs spinning drives or optical drives in their cases anymore just because you’re an outlier doesn’t mean he’s wrong.

Going by this article the poster is not a pc enthusiast by a long shot. Chances are they also buy pre builds.

The author is mostly right about pretty much everything in this article. The only questionable ones are the first and second, which are entirely subjective. In the case of full towers, they have significantly dropped in popularity, and SFF has become the new fad. External drives have supplanted 5.5" bays, and many people are setting up home NAS units instead of stuffing their towers with HDDs. mATX in a mid tower is becoming an increasingly popular combination, as few people need the extra PCIe slots.
There's still a market for full towers, but it's an increasingly niche one.For rainbow vomit, to each their own. Entirely subjective. For overclocking, custom loop water-cooling, and delidding, the author is completely spot on in that these practices are dying out with recent hardware due to reduced gains and increased risks. Undervolting to improve performance is very much the thing with newer chips, with the added benefit of less wear.If you're not aware of these shifts in hardware trends, it seems like YOU'RE the one that's not an enthusiast.

I stopped overclocking years ago, tired of freezing and being forced to reset BIOS settings regularly. But I still like the RGB fans...you need fans anyway so might as well.

I'd say that now overclocking has very little potential as most equipment already had low margins. I've been overclocking most of my life and the last one was 9700K pushed to 240W. After that I specifically went for 14900K to just plug it and roll on defaults, didn't want to spend time on any OC for little benefit. I was so wrong, I ended up replacing it, I've got 14900KS and it's also damaged by Intel's issues. In the end I still have to fight with BIOS settings to make it run right except there were no stable defaults to go back to.

Over clocking was fun when I could punch my Celeron 300A to 450mhz and complete with my buddies Pentium II 450 lol... But a 200mhz O/C on something already running over 3ghz....who cares

Unless you're a few generations behind and haven't looked into recent hardware trends, the author here is pretty spot on with most points. Case choice and rgbs are subjective, though there has been a trend towards SFF lately, and rgb-less components are getting easier to find again, but the author is completely correct about recent hardware benefitting less from overclocking and delidding due to less headroom. Custom loops have always been niche, and AIOs are good enough and inexpensive enough now that the only reason to have a custom loop is for looks and bragging rights.

I would not say overclocking is dead. Maybe if you buy an i9/r9 sure. But my 12600K has nice headroom I have it running at 52/52/50/50/50/50 with e cores at 40 all around. Pretty well matches a stock 12900k in gaming with only a few exceptions.

I think the author is referring to more recent chips, not necessarily lower-tier ones. There is very little overclocking headroom on a 14th-gen chip or a core ultra chip. Ryzen architecture chips haven't benefitted much from overclocking since their introduction despite AMD historically benefitting more from overclocking than Intel, because the ryzen chips just run so close to max out of the box.Times sure have shifted from the days of sandy bridge and bulldozer.

Most people I know have a full tower. Mini cases are a massive pain and finding parts at reasonable prices sucks - replacing a video card for a mini is a horrible experience.
As usual, a writer on this site is completely out of touch - full tower cases (with RGB lights) for life!

Most people you know probably actually have a mid tower. That's been the standard size for a long time, with full towers being a more niche enthusiast grade product.The popularity of said full towers is definitely giving way to the SFF community in the enthusiast space though, as evidenced by the success of cases like the Fractal Design Terra, CoolerMaster NR200, Lian Li A3, the perpetually sold out Dan cases, etc. Sure, SFF parts are generally more expensive (though many of the current popular sff cases use tricks like riser cables and clever PSU placement to allow for full size components in the SFF case), but when has price ever stopped the enthusiast crowd?

RGB just looks gawdy/cringe.

Wow how an article can make you feel old. Only once did I bother overclocking...out of interest...back & forth finding a stable overclock....apart from that I never saw the point of the hassle for what little gains you get.

Let's face it the only place for the average builder to find joy in overclocking is memory and a smooth data storage setup... my next rig will probably be another full tower setup to run a *for hire* pc gaming multi-player server. Which im initially gonna try and hook up with them chromehounds necromancers.

My current build is an a3 matx with vented sides, no glass. Saved me a bunch of headaches making sure everything was perfect and terrible rgb software. I'll never have a glass panel again.

I've got a ton of rgb (fans, AIO, motherboard, mouse, keyboard, mousepad, and speakers), but I don't have it color cycling or flashing etc.
Instead I just have it set to red as I like to play in the dark and it's fairly easy to see everything without the lighting being a sensory overload.

Full tower for an air cooled system still makes a lot of sense. Big fans and a big dual fan dual tower cooler are much easier in a big case.No real downside to a bigger case.

Full towers and custom loops are still the epitome of PC building so that's a pretty bad take.

I also miss the olden days when processor manufacturers produced things with real safe margins, which allowed us to overclock if we wanted to. Nowadays they get away with selling things with zero or negative margins. Custom loops looks neat, but the moment you move it starts leaking everywhere. :)

Definitely sticking with full tower, since I use a CD/DVD/BD drive and platter drives for high volume storage. RGB was never necessary, but I like it in moderation. Agree with the rest, and glad to see an article like this not slagging AIO coolers like a lot have recently for no apparent reason.

Beg to differ on overclocking. Running my CPU at 5.1ghz all cores over 4.7 stock gives me an extra 20ish fps in most games at 3440x1440

A 10% cpu overlooking might get you a few fps in some games...buy 20fps in most? I would stop spreading bsCpu overclocks these days generally do sweet fa to framerates unless your running a cpu many generations lower than your gpu and/or playing old dx9 games.

I want my PC to be stable, quiet and basically something I don't notice.
This means no RGB, windows etc.
It's a utility for using software, not decoration.

I disagree with most of these things.
It's your rig, you do as you please. I've got 6 RGB fans in a full tower case with RGB strips lighting the way. I've spent very little money on my rig as I'm disabled but very happy. I don't care if it's in vogue, I'm not pulling it down a catwalk by the power cable lol

I must admit I have never spent hours optimising things. If you want it to work faster then buy faster components. I still use a full tower case. I like the space it has. I don't care if it's fashionable. I've never done any of the other things, mostly because I'm not a complete numpty.

Except the full tower which is a waste of space, the rest of it, people are still doing them. 🤦 the only thing is people who knows how to, still do it. But many didn't know how to they skip it. Pushing the CPU and GPU to their most optimum potential is part of utilising the money well spent. But again, people who doesn't know how to, end up burning and breaking them. Co paring to the stock performance, overclocking does give the extra 10~25% better performance depending on your luck in silicon lottery and how much you know on the tunings. Also open loop cooling is still a preferred choice for easier maintenance. Why? Because for watercooling you need to change the coolant after sometime. Same goes for AIO, but AIO is sealed, replacement of the coolant is quite a problem.

I'm curious what cpu you're running in your current rig, because recent chips really don't benefit much from overclocking. Undervolting can actually improve performance, like the author stated, by helping the chip run cooler.As to custom loops, sure it's easier to change the coolant on a custom loop compared to an all in one, but you could also just completely replace an AIO multiple times for less than the cost of building a custom loop. And the risks of a failed custom loop are far less than the risks of a failed air cooler.
