Not everyone’s ready to drop big money on a gaming monitor. If you're working with a tighter budget, the goal is to find something reliable, with some performance, that won’t break the bank. Luckily, that's actually quite possible in 2025, with a range of quality options available when they're on sale. For a limited time, you can score this 27-inch gaming monitor for just $95. You read that right, you're saving 40% off retail, which drops it down to one of its best prices yet.
Everything you need for under $100
Let's get all the specifications out of the way, so you'll know if this monitor is for you without wasting too much of your own time. It's a 27-inch 1080p IPS display with a 180Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time. Colors and contrast look good, with this monitor delivering 123% sRGB coverage. So whether you're playing games or watching movies, things will always look good. Plus, you get VESA's DisplayHDR 400 certification and support for AMD's FreeSync technology. When it comes to connectivity, there are two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort 1.2. So you can connect more than just your PC to this device if you have one. ASRock also throws in a two-year warranty just in case you have any doubts about the product's quality. Overall, not a bad piece of hardware. You got plenty for what you're paying, and it won't disappoint if you're on a tight budget. But be quick because this discount won't be around for long.
