Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Before I built my current PC, I used a good old 60Hz Samsung monitor for the longest time. I purchased it way back in 2012, when I didn't care much about refresh rates. Coming from a PS3, all I wanted was to play games at 60FPS with my GTX 680. However, when I upgraded to the GTX 1060 later on, I noticed that many games ran well above 60 FPS, and I started to wonder how they'd actually look if my monitor could keep up. That's when I started digging through Reddit threads and learned about monitor overclocking. Up until that point, I wasn't aware that I could push my monitor's refresh rate beyond factory settings. The idea of squeezing more performance out of my monitor, just like I could with my CPU and GPU, immediately got me excited. After testing a few custom resolutions in the Nvidia Control Panel, I managed to get my monitor running at 75Hz without any instability or artifacts. Now that I think of it, it's probably one of the best tweaks I've ever made.
A noticeable jump in fluidity
When you're at 60Hz, even a small bump makes a big difference
On paper, a 15Hz increase in refresh rate doesn't seem like it should even matter. But the truth is, when your base refresh rate is 60Hz, even a modest bump is noticeable. Percentage-wise, going from 60Hz to 75Hz works out to a 25% improvement, which is significant enough to make a difference not only while gaming but also in everyday use. From moving the cursor on the desktop to opening new windows and scrolling through webpages, everything felt smoother and more responsive. This improvement felt even more obvious while gaming, especially since I used to play popular FPS titles like Battlefield 1, Rainbow Six Siege, and PUBG. These were the kinds of games where fluidity mattered the most, and even though I wasn't getting esports-level performance like I would with a 144Hz or 240Hz monitor, the small refresh rate bump still made it easier to track enemies because the animations looked smoother. Of course, if you overclock a 144Hz monitor to 160Hz, you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference, but for me, that little boost was transformative.
Lower input lag, better gameplay
Even a few milliseconds made almost every game feel more responsive
Increasing the refresh rate didn't just make animations smoother and fast motion easier to follow; it also cut down input lag, which is a huge deal if you play online first-person shooters like I do. At 60Hz, each frame stays on the screen for about 16.7 milliseconds, but at 75Hz, that drops to roughly 13.3 milliseconds. You could argue that a 3ms difference isn't even worth mentioning, but when you're in the middle of an intense gunfight, those few milliseconds can stack up quickly. Every flick shot, peek, and quick strafe felt a bit more immediate at 75Hz, and that alone was enough to make me never want to go back to 60Hz. That was the first time I realized in-game responsiveness wasn't just about having a capable CPU or GPU, but also how quickly the monitor kept up with my inputs. Again, I'll admit the improvements aren't nearly as dramatic as jumping to 144Hz or 240Hz, but at the time, they were still significant enough to change how every game felt to me.
I held off on a monitor upgrade
75Hz was just enough to keep me satisfied for a couple more years
Back then, high-refresh 144Hz monitors weren't nearly as cheap as they are today. On top of that, I was a broke student who couldn't justify dropping a couple of hundred dollars on a new monitor. I'll admit I was tempted to upgrade, but after overclocking my monitor to 75Hz, that urge quickly faded. That small bump in refresh rate was enough to give me a taste of high-refresh-rate gaming without paying full price for a new 144Hz panel. Sure, it wasn't the same as owning an esports-grade monitor, but at least I no longer felt like I was gaming on outdated hardware. By the time I overclocked my monitor, it was already four years old, but the 75Hz refresh rate felt "new" enough to delay a monitor upgrade for the next few years. It wasn’t until 2020 that I finally bought a true 160Hz gaming monitor. Even though I use a 360Hz OLED panel as my primary display today, I still look back at that 75Hz overclock as the tweak that bought me time when I needed it the most.
If you're still gaming at 60Hz, what's stopping you?
60Hz monitors may not be nearly as common as they were several years ago, but they haven't disappeared into oblivion either. I've seen some casual gamers with budget PCs and laptops still relying on them. So, if you're one of them, there's little to no harm in finding out what that old panel is actually capable of. Sure, overclocking your monitor may affect its longevity, but realistically, how long are you planning to keep it around? That minor bump in refresh rate can actually improve not just your gaming experience for free but also make day-to-day tasks feel smoother, from scrolling through webpages to dragging windows across the desktop. It's a simple tweak that breathes new life into the hardware you already own, and sometimes, that's all you really need.

Thanks for bringing back some good memories. Unfortunately I don’t remember the first monitor I overlocked. I do think I did it using the Custom Resolution Utility. I was fortunate to get an Asus VG248QE sometime in 2013. The 144Hz that monitor could do was amazing. It was a great time to be a PC gamer.

It may have been the Dell UP2414Q that I was able to get a small overlock on. It was a fun monitor to game on because it was a 24” 4K screen. That doesn’t sound impressive now, but in 2014 it was something playing AC Black Flag, Batman Arkham City and many other games on.My system at the time had an Intel Core X 3930K CPU, 16GB quad channel RAM, and two GTX 680s with Artic liquid cooling kits in SLI.Before the end of 2014 I swapped out the two 680s for two Titan Blacks. I should have just bought NVIDIA stock instead!
