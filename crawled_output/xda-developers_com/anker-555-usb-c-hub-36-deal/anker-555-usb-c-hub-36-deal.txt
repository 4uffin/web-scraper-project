This is one of those accessories that you can't be without once you start carrying it around. If you've ever needed more ports on your laptop, phone, tablet, or PC gaming handheld — this Anker USB-C hub is going to be the perfect choice thanks to its compact size and expanded connectivity. While it has a retail price of $50, it can now be had for less, as it drops to just $36 for a limited time.
A great way to connect, even on the go

The most important part of any USB hub is the ports that are available. This Anker 555 comes with eight ports total, with two USB-C, HDMI, Ethernet, SD and microSD card slots, and two USB-A ports. Now, some of these ports you can already find on some of your most popular devices, but it doesn't hurt to have a few extra, considering that you can use all of them simultaneously if you want.
The great part about this USB-C hub is that you get passthrough power. So, just connect your USB-C power cable to this device, and you can use the built-in cable to power your device. The USB-C hub will support output up to 85W, so you'll want to use a 100W+ charger in order to get the best possible use from it. Anker also throws in an 18-month warranty on the hub, just in case you might experience some issues. You also get excellent compatibility too, with support for Windows, macOS, and ChromeOS. So if this sounds like something you need, grab it now for its discounted price.
