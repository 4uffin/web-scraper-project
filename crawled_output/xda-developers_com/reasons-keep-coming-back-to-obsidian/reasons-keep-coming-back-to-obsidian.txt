Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
I’m constantly on the hunt for the perfect knowledge management app—the one that promises to organize my thoughts, handle my to-do list, and finally make me feel in control. I have been on the journey for years and switched from one productivity tool to the next, convinced that the next download would be ‘the one.’ But after all that experimenting, I always find myself returning to a single, simple, and powerful application: Obsidian.
The core concept is robust
Local and private
Obsidian’s digital philosophy is the complete opposite of what most modern software offers, and it’s why I keep coming back. Let’s talk about Markdown first. Unlike OneNote, Notion, Evernote, and many others that lock you into their proprietary format, Obsidian stores every note in Markdown format. This simple approach ensures longevity. Even if Obsidian disappears or shuts down tomorrow, I can always open my Markdown notes in another software and continue my work. I don’t need to deal with a clunky converter just to read my notes. Also, the local-first approach is another huge win. I can access and work on my entire knowledge base offline, whether I’m on a plane, in a remote cabin, or just dealing with a bad internet connection. Let’s have a word about the price tag as well. While Obsidian offers a couple of paid add-ons, they are optional. All the core features are free to use.
The flexibility in storing data
Save vaults in OneDrive, Google Drive, or even offline
When I first started with Obsidian, I was a bit hesitant about the synchronization part. Obsidian has its own excellent paid Obsidian Sync service, but the truly game-changing part for me is that I’m not forced to use it. This flexibility is where Obsidian truly sets itself apart. My entire knowledge base is in a simple folder on my computer, and I can choose how to sync it. For my main vault, I prefer OneDrive, which silently and reliably syncs every file to the cloud. I can access these notes on my work laptop, personal computer, and even my phone. However, for my more sensitive information, like personal journals or project plans for private clients, I created other local-only vaults. I don’t sync these to any cloud service. My data remains entirely on my machine, completely isolated from the internet. No other app I have used offers this level of choice.
An active community
There is always a plugin for a specific use case
Obsidian goes beyond the core features. The community has built an ecosystem of third-party plugins and themes that fill every gap. There are thousands of plugins created by independent developers, and they are all just a click away. For me, the Kanban plugin has been quite handy to unlock Trello-style boards right into my vault. Tasks is another plugin that I use regularly to stay on top of my to-do list. These are just a couple of examples. The possibilities with third-party plugins are endless. Beyond these plugins, the community has created a library of beautiful themes and CSS snippets. If I’m feeling a bit bored with the default look, I can switch to a new theme with a single click, instantly giving my vault a neat makeover. This level of customization allows me not only to make Obsidian more functional but also a more pleasant and personal place to work.
Obsidian Bases has been a game-changer
That sealed the deal for me
While I loved Obsidian for its core philosophy, I missed databases from my Notion workspace. I tried using the Dataview plugin, but it felt too complex to use. Then, the Obsidian team released the Bases plugin. It was the moment I finally knew I could make Obsidian my permanent home and ditch Notion for good. It’s a genuine database engine built right into Obsidian’s core. I can now create a folder and turn it into a database, where each file becomes a row and the file’s properties become the columns. I can view my notes as a table and a list of cards. This has changed the way I manage my projects and content. All the data is still stored in plain Markdown. I still maintain full ownership and control of my data, while also enjoying the robust functionality of a database. It’s still in the early stages, and I can’t wait to see how Obsidian improves it.
The tool that grows with you
Whether it’s Craft, Reflect Notes, Capacities, or AppFlowy, I always find my way back to Obsidian. It’s not about a shiny interface, smooth animations, and other bells and whistles; it’s about nailing the basics of knowledge management. It’s a tool that respects my data and workflow, and its reliance on local, plain text files means my notes are always mine and live on a server or service of my choice. Obsidian is built for long-term thinking, a digital garden where I’m not just recording notes but creating a network of knowledge that grows with every new idea. Now, that doesn’t mean Obsidian is perfect. I would love to see more database features, a better UI, and refined mobile apps in the future.
