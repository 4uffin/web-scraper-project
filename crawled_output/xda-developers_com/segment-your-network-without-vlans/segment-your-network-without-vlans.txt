VLANs are better than dozens of firewall rules, but here's how you can still segment your network without one

Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:

Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
As your home network needs grow, you might
consider network segmentation to make it more manageable and keep things safer. If you are, you're on the right track toward having a
more resililiant network, where ease of use is balanced with security and other needs. The most common way to achieve this is through using VLANs, but that isn't the only way to get the network segmentation you want, and it might not be the best way for your particular network setup.
Software-based solutions
Whether it's firewall rules or software-defined mesh networking, you can achieve your goal
To get the defense-in-depth strategy of network segmentation in place without using VLANs, you've got plenty of software options that will depend on how complex your networking needs are. You could handle it all from one managed switch or router that supports Access Control Lists (ACLs) if you wanted to. These are usually set up using the MAC or IP addresses of individual clients, and you can block or allow their passage through the switch, or if you're setting up the ACLs on a NAS, you can set granular controls over which folders and services those IP addresses can access. A slightly more complex setup could use firewalls between each network segment, with ACLs and firewall rules to allow traffic between network segments, or to allow or deny traffic based on the protocols used. Protocol-based controls can be a powerful tool to set up access between specific devices and network segments without using VLANs. Still, many commonly used services use the same few protocols, which limits their overall usefulness. When setting this up, it's important to set up allow rules before restrictive blocking rules, as most firewalls work from a first-match principle. One such inter-subnet block rule would consist of an alias containing all RFC 1918 private network ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16), disallowing them to communicate except for essential services like DNS resolution to the firewall's IP address. Or you could set up zone-based firewall rules, eg: internal, DMZ, external, and set up rules to control traffic flow between the zones. Be careful when changing firewall rules, as any mistake could lock you out, or override the carefully crafted deny rules. It's always best to set up a rule set to bypass any potential lockouts before you start.
Software-defined mesh networking
Networking tools have become ever more sophisticated in recent years, and the rise of software-defined networking has made it possible for you to set up network segments easily. Virtual mesh networks like
ZeroTier and Tailscale can be used for ACLs and network segmentation. ZeroTier has an advantage as it works on Layer 2, so you can use broadcast traffic, multicast, and ARP resolution. Most of these types of tools start from a Zero Trust principle, so newly added devices are already segmented, and then you can allow the things you want them to be able to access.

Hardware-based options for network segmentation
Advanced hardware brings microsegmentation, or you can use multiple network devices to achieve the same thing
Many consumer routers have microsegmentation built in, hiding under the Parental Controls section. This lets you create user profiles, group the devices they're allowed to use together, and control how those devices can access other services or the internet. You could set up an old router as a network segment, and use the power of the firewall on that router to keep traffic you don't want off of it. Or with multiple routers, you could set up a segmented mesh network of sorts, assign devices to the individual APs, and set up some rules for how they can communicate.
Newer and more advanced networking appliances like my beloved Firewalla and its access points can set up segmentation based on individual router ports, VqLANs (Layer 2 segmentation based on access control lists) for device groups, users for even more granular microsegmentation, and more. Networking in this way starts with a principle of Zero Trust, and that's the best way to do things on your home network. It's more flexible and powerful than VLANs on their own, and makes managing complicated inter-device communications a breeze.
Network segmentation doesn't have to be done via VLANs
As networking gets more virtualized and software-defined, the old ways of network segmentation are no longer the only way to do things. In reality, a combination of every method mentioned here, including VLANs, would be how things would be set up, to give the most layers of security while making things easy to manage from the admin's point of view. Security is only as good as the amount of effort people are willing to put into setting it up, and the easier network segmentation can be made, the better.

I vlan my network into "main", "iot devices", "DMZ web servers"....and I make IP objects, group them, and at the firewall - I allow out groups that need Internet access first conditionally - if the group uses known ports.... I also strict Mac bind my network so that my router only deals with known Mac addresses. Vlans and firewalls work together - I would not try to say one is more useful then the other because they do different aspects of security - one does not work where the other does.And they are not the only aspects of security you need to worry about... Fir example if someone does connect to your network can they logon to your router... My router requires username, password, verification code and motp
authenticator password... No one is logging on
to it other then me.

I know vlans are popular but vlans have been breached through sophisticated techniques that are now available in attack tool kits. I built my segmented Network out of a multi-ethernet interface firewall, a couple of small switches, and opnsense with the rules routing subnets to the interfaces For me, this was easier to build and validate than anything with vlans.The limitation of this technique is that you only have one network per ethernet drop and you need multiple Wi-Fi access points which works to my advantage in my situation.

How is a vlan breached??. It's simply a network segment... If the vlan has things in it that should not be there... Id check my binding rules and my firewall rules... The vlan is not really a stop n block solution.... It's just a segment of network space....
