I 3D printed these 5 accessories for my Steam Deck and saved a fortune

If you own a Steam Deck, you're already aware of how expensive some of the official or third-party accessories can be. As a maker at heart who often turns to 3D printing for my projects, I decided to skip spending money on every little add-on and fire up my 3D printer instead. 3D printing has always saved me from buying expensive things, and this time was no different. Not only did it save me a ton of cash, but the process was also a lot of fun. Here’s a look at the accessories I 3D printed for my Steam Deck.
Steam Deck screen + stick protector cover case
Fits both LCD and OLED models
The Steam Deck Screen + Stick Protector Cover Case, designed by Jamie and available for free download on Makerworld, is the first design I 3D printed. My Steam Deck screen used to suffer scratches, especially during portability, and 3D printing this file helped a great deal. It is crafted to address common issues like screen rubbing and device movement as it features a precisely carved 0.5mm screen, so the plastic doesn’t rub on the screen (with optional adhesive foam recommended for added cushioning). It also comes with vent holes and a USB-C port exposed, so you can charge it while it’s protected. Unlike traditional vertical prints that risk warping, this design enables all components to lie flat on the print bed, eliminating the need for supports and allowing for seamless multi-color AMS logos on the front for personalization.
Steam Deck carrying case insert
Keep everything organized

I found myself constantly juggling my charger, cables, and other small gear, so I 3D printed this carrying case insert. It fits perfectly inside the original case and adds dedicated compartments to keep everything organized. It’s designed to hold four full-sized SD cards, and there’s a slight press fit at the bottom of each slot, so the cards don’t pop out when unwrapping the charger. Instead of a lid, the design lets me simply wrap the cord around the body of the insert and tuck it under the case’s elastic band, and it works whether I wrap the cord clockwise or counterclockwise. The model even includes built-in support that breaks away cleanly, as well as a no-support version for those who want to generate their own.
Steam Deck clip-on stand
Play Steam Deck on the table comfortably

I have always wanted to play my Steam Deck on a table without having to prop it up against something awkwardly, and this clip-on stand turned out to be the perfect solution. It snaps securely onto the back of the console, providing a sturdy kickstand that feels stable whether I’m gaming, streaming, or browsing. The detachable stand snaps into place easily, and the design even has registration marks that align with the screw holes on the back of the deck, so it lines up perfectly every time. There’s plenty of clearance around the intake and exhaust vents, so airflow isn’t blocked, and despite putting it on and taking it off dozens of times, it hasn’t scratched my Deck once. It comes in three parts: Stand, Hinge, and Flap, all in .3mf file format. The designer recommends buying2 x m3 x 0.5mm thread, which is 6mm long.
Steam Deck OLED charger holder
Properly store the charger holder at the back of the Steam Deck

The Steam Deck OLED Charger Holder is a simple yet practical print that keeps my charger neatly in place, preventing it from rolling around or getting tangled. It is designed specifically for the Steam Deck’s OLED model, and it provides a snug slot that holds the charger securely while still making it easy to grab when needed. This charger holder even features a version with a small slot to clip the end of the USB cable, keeping the cord neatly in place without unraveling. To insert the charger, the designer recommends sliding the wall plug in first until it bottoms out, then threading the cable through the center of the wrap posts and starting to wind. If you wrap it clockwise with a snug fit, the entire cord will fit cleanly inside, and you can lock the cable tip into the slot for extra security. For printing, place the model flat-side down on the build plate. You’ll only need support under the two small tabs that guide the cord during winding.
Steam Deck backpack
Have all Steam Deck essentials in fingerprints

This backpack allows me to keep small essentials, like cables, SD cards, earbuds, or even a slim power bank, directly on the deck itself. It’s lightweight, doesn’t get in the way while playing, and makes the console feel even more versatile on the go. What I really love is that this design puts everything at my fingertips, quite literally. Whether I’m traveling, gaming at a café, or just lounging at home, I can keep all the little extras I need right behind the device without cluttering my space. The setup includes an adapter for this USB-C hub that allows both video output and charging simultaneously.
No need to buy Steam Deck accessories if you have a 3D printer.
You don’t need to purchase Steam Deck accessories if you own a 3D printer, because almost everything you would like — stands, organizers, and the ones I’ve mentioned above — can be printed at home for a fraction of the price. Not only does this save you money, but it also gives you the freedom to customize each accessory to suit your exact needs and style. Additionally, printing your own gear is a fun way to get more use out of your printer while creating practical items you’ll actually use.
