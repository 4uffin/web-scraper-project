Summary
PowerToys 0.94 adds a new search feature for quick access to toggles.
Shortcut conflicts now show in red, and the Home dashboard displays your conflict count.
Version 0.95 teases a couple of major features.
It's the beginning of a month, and that also kicks off a fresh wave of features and updates for several Microsoft apps and services. This time around, the software giant has started with one of its popular tools on Windows: Microsoft PowerToys. The company has just pushed a new update to PowerToys, taking the app from version 0.93 to 0.94 and adding some new features that finally fix some of the issues you have faced while using the app. Also, like many of its previous releases, the company has teased a major new feature coming with the next version of PowerToys.
What's new in the latest PowerToys update
PowerToys version 0.94 comes with a new search box in Settings, and it works very similarly to the one in Windows 11's Settings app. Instead of scrolling through a long list of toggles, you just need to click the search box and type the initial few letters of the name of the settings, and PowerToys will show a flyout with all the matches. You just need to click the one that you're looking for.

The latest version of PowerToys also has a new keyboard shortcut that lets you start typing directly in the search box. Sounds more convenient than reaching the search box through the mouse cursor? You can press Ctrl + F on your keyboard and start typing. This isn't a surprise announcement, however. Last month, we reported that Microsoft was working on introducing a search box in the PowerToys settings. It's good to see that Microsoft hasn't delayed the feature. In addition to the search box, PowerToys has also gained a visual feature that will help you quickly fix your keyboard shortcut conflicts. The keyboard shortcuts that are currently in use are marked in red in the latest version. Also, the Home dashboard now shows how many shortcut conflicts you currently have on PowerToys. PowerToys 0.94 also includes a bunch of improvements and bug fixes, and a new accessibility feature, which you can learn more about here.
What's coming next for PowerToys?
The next PowerToys update will be version 0.95, and it'll likely arrive next month. It's too early to predict how many new features will be added in the next release, but Microsoft has already confirmed a few exciting new features for the next release. In its official version 0.94 release note, it has announced that PowerToys will get an automatic dark mode switch based on your schedule and a revamped Keyboard Manager UI. What's more, the company previously confirmed that version 0.95 will improve PowerToys' Peek utility by allowing users to preview files by typing a command in Windows' command line tools. Hopefully, you'll see more new features and improvements than what's been officially confirmed.
