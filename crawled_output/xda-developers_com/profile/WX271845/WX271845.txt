Should annual Windows features include new updates, or be boring?
I recently wrote a very personal piece on why Windows 11 updates are boring and how I much prefer the Apple approach of adding notable new features with the majority of annual updates. Microsoft's strategy is more about rolling out new features whenever they're ready, which makes it a little less interesting to follow the developments.
However, I'm sure many people don't care about updates at all and just want a functional computer. Are you someone who enjoys getting big new feature updates, or do you prefer the more boring and upredictable pace of Windows 11 releases?

I have to go back to Windows and I'm not happy about it
Recently, I was offered a chance to review a product ahead of its launch (I'm not at liberty to share what it is yet), and unfortunately, the vast majority of its features are only available on Windows. I've been using macOS as my main OS for a good while now, and I'm not looking forward to going back to a Windows machine.
That being said, this is also a good opportunity to test Raycast for Windows more extensively, seeing as it just recently became available and I haven't had as much time with it as I would like. Still, the idea of using a Windows PC full time isn't particularly exciting.

I finally applied a skin to my Switch 2, and it's so much nicer than a grip
When I reviewed the Dbrand Killswitch a while back, I noted that it seems to do its job well, but I just don't find this kind of product that appealing. I would much rather use a typical travel case, and more recently, I even noticed how I didn't even want to play with the grips, either.
However, I was starting to worry that my hand grease would wear down the plastic on my Joy-Con 2, so I finally bit the bullet and bought a skin from Dbrand. And it turns out, I was right, I like this way more than using a grip. I do already find the Joy-Con 2 quite comfortable, and the skin looks really cool on it. I will say the measurements seem to be a fraction of a millimeter off, and aligning with + button means that the skin is just a smidge too high for the other buttons, particularly B, Home, and the C button. But so far it still seems totally usable, and it looks great.

What's your favorite Linux distro?
As you may know, I've become a very big fan of Linux over the past few months, and my primary laptop now runs Arch linux with KDE Plasma. I love using it and find it much more fun than Windows, but I also know there's a huge world of distros out there for all kinds of people.
So I'm curious what your favorites are. Do you use Arch? NixOS? Maybe something more user-friendly like Ubuntu or Linux Mint? I'd love to hear your thoughts!

How do you feel about roguelike games?
After the Nintendo Direct presentation last Friday, I quickly bought the DK Island & Emerald Rush DLC for Donkey Kong Bananza, mostly because I love the base game and figured I'd have fun with it. The DLC contains a rogue-like mode where you have to collect as much emerald ore as possible in a limited time.
I find the concept intriguing, and it's decently to fun to play in the moment, but I've found it hard to stay invested in the game as it feels like there's no real progress being made. It could also be that I'm bad at the game, but I've felt similarly about games like Dead Cells, which has me thinking I might just not like this genre. Do you like roguelike games, or do you prefer games that have a more defined path to progression?

Virtual Boy games are coming to the Switch 2 and I am losing my mind
Nintendo has just held its latest Direct showcase going over numerous upcoming games for the Switch and Switch 2. There were some great announcements in there, but none shocked me more than the addition of Virtual Boy to the Nintendo Classics library on both Switch and Switch 2.
The Virtual Boy is infamously Nintendo's worst selling console hardware, recorded at 770,000 units sold worldwide, though the hardware was never launched in Europe. This addition to the Nintendo Classics library is also going to require an add-on that pretty much replicates the look of that original hardware, and it'll be available in all major markets, meaning it's more than likely it will sell more than the original hardware.
I'm just absolutely befuddled that this is happening now, when Nintendo had a perfect opportunity to re-release these games on the 3DS and never did it. But there's no way around the fact that this is at least interesting.

I moved away from Windows 11, but I didn't go to Linux
Of course, only an article paid by Apple would feature such high praise as "Customization... exists" in one of the headers. Smart investment on their part, really.

True, but you can ignore the donation and use the classic installer link to get it for free.

You can download the app for free from the website, I would recommend doing that before going through the Microsoft Store.

My family stopped using Google Photos and OneDrive after installing this container
Valid question! The mini PC is running a lot more than Immich since it's a Proxmox system with TrueNAS (which has Immich and other apps) and Home Assistant VMs
