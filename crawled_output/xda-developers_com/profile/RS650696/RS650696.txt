Do you prioritize network security over raw speed when it comes to your home network setup?
People's priorities may vary, but for those running home labs or concerned about the security of their network, investing in a custom firewall with advanced security features could be more valuable than simply increasing bandwidth. However, for average users focused on streaming and browsing, speed might be the primary concern. Do you value speed over security, or is it the other way around?

Is it a good idea for Linux distros to try to mimic the look and feel of Windows?
Some may argue that making Linux distros resemble Windows can make it easier for users to transition from Windows to Linux, providing a familiar interface. However, others believe that mimicking Windows goes against the open-source ethos of Linux and can lead to security and privacy concerns, as seen with distros like Winux. Ultimately, the decision depends on individual preferences and priorities, but trying something new can feel more liberating.

Rolling releases vs. fixed releases: Which do you prefer?
I've long used fixed-released operating systems that require major upgrades to bring the underlying code up to scratch with the latest updates that aren't minor. In recent times, I've gradually moved to rolling-release Linux distros and much prefer being able to update just about every part of the OS without having to wait for the developers to roll out a major upgrade. But which do you prefer?

I should stop buying enterprise servers ... but I can't
There's just something about technology that always peaqued my interest, even as a child. I was more fascinated how everythign worked, as well as enjoyed the result of all the magic coming together. It's carried through to adulthood but now I'm slightly obsessed with used enterprise servers. How Dell, HP, Lenovo, and other brands manage to cram so much hardware inside such compact chassis. Sure, they're nothing in comparison to modern consumer-grade components, but there's something about having a few servers running in a cabinet that puts a smile on my face, especially when logging into the Proxmox cluster to see how everything is performing.

Buying a cheap Android tablet reminded me how bad mobile OS updates are
I last owned a decade ago and have since switched between phones while they were still supported by the manufacturer. For Prime Day, I wanted a cheap tablet that could run OSRS and a few other things without issue, and I settled on the Doogee T40 Pro, running Android 14. No worries, I thought, there's the same T40 Pro running Android 15, so it should be an easy upgrade. Nope, this specific version of the T40 Pro is stuck on Android 14, and Doogee won't be releasing new firmware. I used to root and flash phones back in the day, so how hard could it be with this tablet? Turns out, quite so since there's barely anyone flashing it, there's no access to firmware, and none of the major custom ROM players support it. The plan of action is to back everything up from the tablet and prep it for flashing with the means to recover should the worst happen. I'm fully expecting some degree of failure, whether it's boot looping or specific features not working, but where there's a will, there's always

It's good to see more coverage on Windows users finally looking to Linux
Even our own Jacob Roach has been infected with the bug. Linux is everywhere, and while it has largely been on the sidelines, we're seeing a surge in ways to experience Linux without even uninstalling Windows. Ventoy is a fantastic way to store ISOs, including all available Linux distros with live environments. This makes it easy to test out multiple distros to find the best one for you. Then there's the live environment itself, which can handle the installation of various software and act much like a full-fledged OS. When you're ready to make the jump, it takes a few minutes to set everything up. With Windows 10 ending support, more people are considering the free and open-source alternative to Microsoft's AI-infested experience.

From underdog to top dog: How AMD beat Intel at everything
Absolutely agree. Even though Intel's 14th-gen family weren't received well, how the company continued to release chips that were still competitive on the performance front was a feat in of itself. That said, overall, AMD is crushing it. We'll hopefully see more healthy competition, and I bet we shall see an eventual flip, as we have done already. I look forward to that day of being able to write up my thoughts on Intel's comeback ... hopefully with its own fab and better leadership.

Depends on the day! CLI when I want to pretend I'm Mr Robot and web GUI for 99% of the time. ﻿😂﻿
