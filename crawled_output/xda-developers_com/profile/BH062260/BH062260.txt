How far have you progressed into Nightreign's new mode?
It has been a while since Elden Ring Nightreign added the Deep of Night difficulty to the game, with the new mode bringing more powerful enemies, extra relics, and more weapon parameters to the table. It also brings a progression system, where each successful run will net you some rating points. Once you've acquired enough of these points, your depth level will rise, with each successive level increasing the difficulty of the game. In my experience, Depth 1 is fairly easy, while Depth 2 is quite a difficulty curve — even more so when you end up facing the Everdark Sovereign variants of the Night bosses. I've made it to Depth 3 by playing with my friends, and I'm only a two hundred points away from hitting Depth 4. But that's just me. What depth level are you at in Nightreign?

I love using HACS' Proxmox integration with Home Assistant
Armed with numerous integrations and dashboards, the Home Assistant Community Store is a must-have for tinkerers who want to take the functionality of their HASS-powered smart home to the next level. However, the Proxmox integration is hands-down my favorite HACS offering, as it lets me monitor and control my PVE nodes directly from Home Assistant's UI. Throw in a custom dashboard and a cheap display, and I can manage my Proxmox-based virtual guests like the conventional smart devices in my home lab.

I low-key want to 3D print a rack for my SBCs
The lightweight champ Raspberry Pi Zero began my obsession with Single-Board Computers, and I've since expanded my collection to include everything from Arm boards to x86 units and RISC-V SBCs. Thanks to their small size and low power consumption, I run a handful of these SBCs in my home lab. Unfortunately, I don't own a proper rack for them, and all my attempts at finding the one that suits my needs have ended in vain.
However, I recently came across some forums and idea boards where tinkerers showed off their 3D-printed racks. And now I really want to print one for my arsenal of SBCs. Of course, I'll have to research the right schematics and filament type, but it seems like a fun weekend project.

How many case fans does your PC have?
Besides dust buildup, high temps are easily the biggest nemesis of PCs, and you could end up lowering the longevity of your painstakingly-assembled rig if you take your fan placement lightly. Me? I've got an arsenal of fans attached to my PC cabinet. I've installed three 140mm fans as intakes on the front, with two 120mm fans at the top and another 120mm on the back acting as exhausts. That way, my cabinet has slightly positive pressure, which is ideal for folks like myself who want lower temps without too much dust accumulation. What about you? How many fans does your gaming machine possess?

I can't wait to play Nightreign's Deep of Night mode next week
Now that it has been a few months since Elden Ring: Nightreign dropped, we've had quite a few bosses added to the game (even though they're technically just the enhanced versions of their base-game counterparts). If you're even remotely as into Nightreign as I am, you've probably beaten everything the game has to offer and are itching for something new to fight. Well, Fromsoftware will add a hard mode starting next week, and I can't wait to try it out. Named Deep of Night, this mode will apparently add random bosses, buffed enemies, and a progression system, wherein the game gets progressively harder the deeper you go into the mode. Me? I just want to equip more relics and create the most broken builds possible. Leaks revealed Deep of Night allows up to six relics for each Nightfarer, and I'll probably spend the first couple of days farming the relics exclusive to this mode.

I'm starting to grow fond of FreeBSD distros
TrueNAS Core was the first FreeBSD distro I tinkered with, and it was (and low-key still is) a surprisingly robust distribution for a DIY storage server. But after transitioning to TrueNAS Scale, OPNsense was my only link to the FreeBSD world for a long time.
However, all that changed when I came across GhostBSD earlier this year. Contrary to my expectations, it's a rock-solid general-purpose distro, and it's what pushed me into the FreeBSD scene yet again. I also recently installed NomadBSD on a flash drive, and I've been loving it so far.

Self-hosting your own VPN on Proxmox is easy - here's how it's done
Thanks a lot for the feedback. :)Realized I forgot to mention anything about routing the traffic through an external VPN. Or even port-forwarding, to access the WireGuard VPN from another network like an untrusted public Wi-Fi (which is precisely the point of the article).Have modified the article accordingly!

What's your favorite PC peripheral?
Monitor arm fanboy reporting in! This thing changed the way I work and game.The Uperfect UGame K118 portable monitor has also become an indispensable part of my home lab, mostly because I can move it around the house if (and when) I need to troubleshoot something.

What PC form factor is your primary computer?
My primary system is a full-tower desktop, and I don't think I'll switch to a different form-factor anytime soon.

What's the first game you remember playing?
Dangerous Dave was probably the first PC game I ever played, though it was the first entry in the Just Cause series that turned me into a gaming nerd.
