It's been 40 years since Super Mario Bros. came out and the titular plumber is still going strong
Seriously, 40 years is a long time, and Mario has been curbstomping Goombas for every minute of it. Whether he's running around with his brother Luigi or pairing up with dinosaurs, talking hats and more, Mario has been a part of the gaming landscape for young, and the young-at-heart. I can't wait for the next outing (and his first on the Nintendo Switch 2), because I've played every game to date and Nintendo's first-party titles are always worth picking up. Is Mario your favorite or is another Nintendo character in that top slot?

Someone figured out how to use SSDs in an unmodded Xbox 360
The Xbox 360 has been around for two decades now, and in all that time, the internal storage drive has always been mechanical hard drives. That's down to Microsoft putting security restrictions on the console so that only a few hard drives would work. Console modders figured out how to firmware mod hard drives to use non-approved ones, but it took until this week for those modders to figure out how to modify SSD firmware so that the Xbox 360 can finally get the speedy storage as a solution. After so many years, it's incredible to see enthusiasts still finding new ways to improve these consoles.

It's been 34 years since the first iteration of Linux
Thirty-four years ago, Linus Torvalds announced his "free" operating system to the world, with just a few more than ten thousand lines of code inside it. Now, that many lines are added to the kernel daily, with over 34 million lines of code contributed to by thousands of dedicated developers worldwide. It powers everything from gaming consoles to routers, servers, the top 500 supercomputers, and more, and it will only grow from here. Who knows what the next few decades will hold, especially once Torvalds retires and other maintainers take control, but Linux isn't going anywhere.

The iMac is 27 years old and boy do my knees hurt reading that
The iMac's enduring place in the market is a far cry from the Macintosh machines that nearly sank Apple as a company in the 1980s and 90s. Those were beige, soulless boxes with confusing options, while the iMac was an instant design classic, and every iteration has been a banger. Bright colors, high performance thanks to the deep integration of macOS with the hardware it's running on, and everything you need in one box, including speakers, a mouse, and a keyboard. Throw in good networking, and you had the fastest and easiest way to get on the fledgling internet in the late 1990s. Now you have Apple Silicon and fantastic display quality, wrapped in a super slim chassis, and the iMac virtually sells itself. Here's to the next quarter century!

It's been 25 years since the first ATI Radeon GPU
ATI was still its own company at the turn of the millennium, long before AMD folded them into its graphics division. The venerable ATI Rage line of graphics processors was getting long in the tooth and lacked hardware geometry acceleration and efficiency. And then, in August 2000, the Radeon R100 was unleashed on the world in a flurry of reviews. Those reviews are (mostly) gone from the net now, as is the ATI branding, but the Radeon name lives on as the graphics division for AMD. I've lost count of how many AMD GPUs I've used in those decades, how about you?

I'm kinda over my desire for a rackmount server
I've always wanted a rack-mount server for storage and home lab use, and now I finally have space for one. But I'm rethinking those plans, because recent Mini PCs I've used have shown me that I can run most of the things I want on power-efficient hardware. I'm sure I'll end up with a rack mount at some point because my NAS is running out of space and the next storage upgrade is going to need more bays, but until then, I'm going to host as many things as possible on Mini PCs and see how things go.

NotebookLM is my favorite tabletop role-playing companion
Yeah, me too, although it's still quicker than me when there's more than one rulebook involved. Maybe Google will let us self-host it at some point, or there will be a similar tool that we can so can leverage more hardware resources.

Please stop using your ISP's DNS
North America being.. Mexico? The United States (or Canada for that matter) has no laws stipulating data retention by ISPs, it's done on a voluntary basis by the ISPs and then handed over to law enforcement and federal agencies as requested. That doesn't sound very consumer-friendly to me.

I ditched my dual monitor setup for an ultrawide monitor, and here's what I regret
It wasn't an option on the first ultrawide I owned, and I've found it inconsistent on my new one, especially for things like games.

5 home lab tweaks that save my electricity bill from ruin
That's awesome! I'm going to make sure ESPhome support is on the feature set next time I expand my smart plugs. Was it a big brand or a no-name?
