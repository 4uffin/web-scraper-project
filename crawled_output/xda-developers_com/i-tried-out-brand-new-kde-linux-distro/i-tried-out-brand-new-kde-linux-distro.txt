Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
If you've been following along with my Linux adventures, you'll know that I recently ditched Windows and found my new home over on Fedora KDE Plasma. The biggest reason it kept me around was that I really enjoyed KDE, and out of all the distros I used that came with a desktop environment, Fedora was the most stable. And all was happy. However, I was then informed that the people who created KDE were also developing their own distribution, called, surprise surprise, KDE Linux. So, I grabbed one of my older laptops, threw KDE Linux on it, and gave it a spin. And you know what? I think they're onto something very cool.
KDE Linux is, well...KDE
And that's perfect
So, if I told you that using KDE Linux looked and felt like using a different distro with KDE, how surprised would you be? Hopefully, not very, because that's what it's like. You make a bootable KDE Linux drive, boot it up, go through the setup process, restart your PC, and bam - all the familiar KDE features and UI that you know and love. Given how the part I loved most about Fedora KDE Plasma was the latter half, having a system that's just all KDE is great for me. Not that I dislike Fedora (I don't), but I like that the UI that I enjoy is a core part of the OS and not just a desktop environment.
KDE Linux is nice and lightweight
My aging laptop loves it
Before I put KDE Linux on it, I had Windows 11 installed on my laptop, which I purchased back in 2018. It's by no means a powerful device; it has an i3-7100U CPU and 4GB of RAM. You may be asking yourself, "Simon, why did you install Windows 11 on such a device?" to which I can only respond with a shrug and say, "Because I could." The point is, my laptop hated Windows 11. When I booted it up to prep it for KDE Linux, it would sit there idle with Windows 11 loaded, and the fans would be spinning. It sounded like I was using it to stream something or play a gam,e except I was just looking at the desktop. I wasn't even moving the mouse. Honestly, I should have expected it. So, when I got KDE Linux on this device, it felt like a whole new computer. It was responsive, it didn't spin up its fans during idle, and the OS didn't tax its hardware at all. Granted, it's still an i3-7100 with 4GB of RAM, so it's not like I can suddenly use it to render high-quality video and play Cyberpunk 2077 on it, but it's now a very decent workstation that doesn't lag like crazy.
It's still in development, though
Don't grab it unless you're brave
That all being said, KDE Linux is still very much in its early stages. The fact that the "current state" section of the KDE Linux wiki happily declares that "Getting apps from Flathub works" shows you what kind of state the operating system is in right now. The wiki also says that the "manual partition" feature in the installer just flat-out doesn't work, and when you update the OS, it downloads the whole thing. Also, I had a nasty surprise when I booted up Konsole and tried using Fedora commands in it. Of course, they didn't work; I've been far too used to using Fedora KDE Plasma that I forgot this operating system doesn't have Fedora on it. However, from what I saw, I really, really liked KDE Linux. For now, I'm going to keep it on my laptop and see how it evolves over time. Once the operating system gets up and running, I can easily see myself making the jump and using pure KDE Linux instead of Fedora.
I can't wait until KDE Linux is fleshed out
Right now, I'm in a strange paradox where KDE Linux is my favorite distro so far, but I'm not using it as my workhorse OS. While I really love KDE, the Linux distro is still missing some features that I'd really like to see. Fortunately, it seems the KDE team is hard at work ironing out all the wrinkles, so once that's done, I'll be more than ready to make the jump.

It would have been nice to read about the differences with KDE Neon distro, which I like a lot.

Agreed. I like KDE Neon a lot too and it's odd how ever since the immutable KDE linux went into public alpha, the conversations seem to always be comparing KDE immutable to Fedora KDE with no mention of Neon.KDE Neon has been rock solid for me for over a year.
And, one does not need to download the entire distro for updates like one needs to with KDE immutable.
I've read that Neon might go away after KDE is fully released which would be a shame. Certainly there must be room and market share for both to coexist?

Another KDE NEON user here. Switched after years of being an Ubuntu gnome user, and while I liked the idea of PopOS, it just isn't quite what I want. KDE Neon is what I've been dreaming for for years.

The article didn't mention the 'immutable base' is created using Arch, maybe because that would lead Arch snobs linux users to turn to an actual Arch distro instead? Although I guess it shouldn't surprise anyone that a distro that concentrates on UI would
be great for someone looking for an OS that's not a daily driver.
Looking back, Windows 3 to Windows Me were, in a way, UI-developers' desktops, if not immutable. It wasn't until XP, with WinNT kernel, that it was a serious OS. Before that, Windows were "transitional" code OSes to get to NT.
KDE Linux sounds like it's also in transitional state, and it's practically guaranteed it won't take 8 years to finish! PS packages can be installed with Homebrew, which I loved years ago, before I abandoned Apple products altogether.

I also thought that that it was somewhat odd, if not disingenuous, of the author to deliberately choose not to mention Arch. Even implicitly. Did he really think that he was hiding something? I won't presume to understand his motives since I've never used Arch, and I'm happy with Fedora Atomic. Though everyone's aware that Arch, as a platform, has a bit of a bad-boy reputation. Faster than most, but also less stable than most. But surely he knew that such a glaring omission would stick out to readers like a red flag.

There's something eternally magical about suddenly making a slow computer fast again with Linux. I've been using KDE via Bazzite and love it, it's fun to recognize so much of the UI lol

Ever since my complete migration from Windows Power User to Linux at the beginning of this year, it's the cooling that stuck out to me the most: On Windows when the fan stops whirring, it's basically guaranteed that a BSOD is coming in the next few seconds. Now, on Linux, when the fan starts whirring I pull open my resource monitor to see what is eating all my CPU

This is in alpha? And why conflate that KDE is a desktop environment, not a distro? Just use archinstall and add KDE Plasma. Done.

The difference is that is an immutable distro comparing with plain arch install. And there are other features. Of course you can achieve the same with arch if you have enough time and experience but it is a ready-to-go distro based on arch.
