I recommend people use these apps when moving from Windows to Linux

Simon is a Computer Science BSc graduate who has been writing about technology since 2014, and using Windows machines since 3.1. After working for an indie game studio and acting as the family's go-to technician for all computer issues, he found his passion for writing and decided to use his skill set to write about all things tech.
Since beginning his writing career, he has written for many different publications such as WorldStart, Listverse, and MakeTechEasier. However, after finding his home at MakeUseOf in February 2019, he has been working with it and its sister website, XDA, to bring the latest and greatest in Windows, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity topics.

Give me a lighthearted recap
I recently moved over from Windows to Linux by dual-booting my PC. I've had a ton of fun with my Fedora KDE Plasma installation, to the point where I'm forgetting I even have Windows installed. However, I'd be lying if I claimed that the migration was as simple as installing Linux, booting into it, and using it like I would my Windows PC. There was a lot of learning about how Linux works and what could and couldn't be transferred from Windows, but I managed to make it in the end. Part of my exploration and settlement onto Linux was made a ton easier thanks to a few apps. So, here are some apps that I recommend you check out if you're also considering moving from Windows to Linux.
Ventoy
A crucial tool in my distro hopping
So, part of my adventures into exploring Linux involved what's called "distro hopping." It's when you jump between different iterations of Linux to find the one you can call home. Linux distros come in different forms, some of which are drastically different from one another. As such, it's a good idea to poke around at different distros to find the one you like the most. Fortunately, Linux distros usually have a demo version you can try; just chuck it on a USB, boot off of it, and you can give it a spin without any commitment. If you dislike it, you can delete it from your USB and return to normal; otherwise, you can install it on your PC via the demo itself. The thing is, swapping out those installation media can be a little annoying. Fortunately, there's the Ventoy app. This turns a USB into a special operating system launching device; all you need to do is load the image file of your system of choice, plug it in, and boot off of it. Ventoy handles the rest. It was a huge help to me when finding my favorite Linux distro.
KDE Plasma
Bringing the Windows vibe to your operating system
Linux has these cool things called "desktop environments." They completely revamp how your computer looks and feels without changing the core that runs everything. If you've ever used an app that completely revamps the look of Windows, it's similar, albeit Linux officially supports it and doesn't require you to take a crowbar to your operating system. My favorite desktop environment is called KDE Plasma. The "KDE" stands for "K Desktop Environment," and it's pretty similar to Windows. In fact, I believe it does certain things better than Windows. You can either download a distro that comes with KDE Plasma bundled in, or you can install it yourself. Either way, you'll find that KDE Plasma is very similar to Windows, except you can actually customize it. Shocking, I know!
WinBoat
Trying to bridge the gap as much as possible
These days, Linux is pretty good in terms of adapting to the apps you've gotten used to on Windows. For instance, apps like Google Chrome, Bitwarden, and Discord work just fine on Linux. Some apps don't have an official Linux version, but there are alternatives; for example, while ShareX is Windows-only, the default Fedora KDE Plasma screenshotting tool took over its job just fine for me. However, there will be some apps that don't run on Linux and don't have a suitable replacement, especially niche apps. For these, you'll want to give WinBoat a try. WinBoat allows you to run a Windows virtual machine, through which you can install the apps you need and boot them up when you need them. It may not be a perfect solution, but it's a good way to tide yourself over while you figure stuff out. We have a guide on how to use WinBoat for you if that sounds like something you want. However, as our editor Joao discovered, it's not exactly perfect, so don't expect too many miracles.
There's no need to go into Linux alone
While these tools won't magically make Linux as simple to use as Windows, it does alleviate some of the roadblocks that keep people from getting comfortable with a distro. If you ask me, the ideal way to migrate is to grab a distro that comes with KDE Plasma pre-installed, slap it on a USB drive with Ventoy, install it, then use WinBoat to grab the apps you can't be without. However, the cool thing about Linux is that there's no "right path" for finding the distro you'll gel with, so feel free to stray from these apps if they don't resonate with you.

Welcome to Linux we are a broad family you will get as many different bits of advice depending on who you ask,, the biggest thing to remember is if you don't like it change it... find a distro that works on your machine but don't like the DE [desktop environment] change it. don't like the browser change it, don't like the mail client then change that as well, this is Linux not Windows no one tells you what to do, you make up your own mind.Have a Windows app [we don't call them programs] that you can't do without, then use a VM or one of the compatibility layersyou are not alone we were all users of other operating systems before we found Linux.[Brickwizard linux.org]

I've been using Kubuntu with is its rock solid Ubuntu underpinnings for more than 12 years. I was wondering why do other Linux users, especially KDE plasma users, feel the need to distro hop? Isn't KDE plasma, KDE plasma on arch, fedora or whatever? What are you getting that's different apart from the distro it's built on?

I wanted to Steam O/S on my gaming machine, but Valve is taking forever to get a desktop version out that is stable.
I went with Bazzite which hosts the Steam gaming environment and I am able to drop to a KDE desktop for other activities.
If I hadn't done some distro hopping, I'd be wasting my time trying to get a similar environment running on Kubuntu or Mint.
I have plenty of Windows 10 hardware to use as test beds ;)

Given this site, no distro hopping would mean no articles being written and no authors getting paid.
