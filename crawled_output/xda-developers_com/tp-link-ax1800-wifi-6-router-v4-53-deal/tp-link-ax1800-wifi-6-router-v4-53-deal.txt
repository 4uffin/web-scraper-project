While using a free router from your ISP isn't a bad thing, there's a pretty good chance you're losing out on performance and features. And although it used to be fairly costly to upgrade or buy something new, that really isn't the case anymore if you're looking for more modest improvements. That's where this TP-Link Archer AX21 router comes in delivering Wi-Fi 6 speeds and coverage for just $53. We like what this router offers, and we think the newly discounted price that drops it to a record low makes it worth taking a look at.
A cheap router with great performance

This is one of those routers that gets a lot right and doesn't hurt your wallet. It's a dual-band Wi-Fi 6 router with a total bandwidth of up to 1.8Gbps. It's great for all uses, and can even excel with things that require more bandwidth, like streaming and gaming.
The range is good enough for a large home or medium-sized office, and the device can also accommodate multiple devices at once. There's also excellent management and security features, with support for VPN services as well. You can even network multiple TP-Link devices to create a mesh network later down the line if you need more coverage. The best part is that the set up is simple, and only requires the user to download the TP-Link app to a phone or tablet for easy control of all devices on the network.
For most people, this is going to be a great upgrade. You get a router that is easy to set up and use, while also being extremely versatile as well. Those that need more, will want to look through the specifications to see if this router will work for your purposes. But grab it now for just $53 from Amazon.
