Summary
Lenovo paused Legion Go 2 preorders and canceled some orders after demand far exceeded projections.
More units are en route to retailers; Lenovo.com will reopen ordering once online inventory is replenished.
If you preordered on Lenovo.com, check your order; canceled preorders might be filled by local retailers.
Are you excited for the Lenovo Legion Go 2? If you are, you're definitely not alone. The company opened pre-orders for its next portable console, and it definitely generated the interest it wanted. In fact, one may say they got a little too much interest, as the company has stated that it has had to shut down preorders from the time being and cancel some that have already been made.
Lenovo pulls the plug on Legion Go 2 preorders because people really, really want one
Over on the Legion Go subreddit (thanks, Notebook Check!), the Lenovo Legion Team held an AMA about their newest console back on September 15th. Things started off positively; the team took questions from interested gamers and answered them to the best of their ability. For instance, they confirmed that, while a SteamOS variant of the Lenovo Legion Go 2 isn't available for sale, adding support post-launch is not entirely off the table. However, the fun and fanfare slowly faded over the coming days, with the team editing the post on September 17th, stating that they hadn't been paying much attention to the thread because they "had to get [their] stuff together behind the scenes." They also said that the preorders for the new handheld had "substantially exceeded [their] projections," so I can imagine a red siren going off somewhere within Lenovo HQ as they scrambled to contain the flood. Unfortunately, on September 19th, the company confirmed that the floodgates had burst:
We wanted to share an update after connecting with our Lenovo retail colleagues around the world. The good news is that more units are already on their way to major retailers globally, so you can expect to see availability in retail outlets and websites improving in the coming weeks.
That said, we will need to cancel some pre-orders placed directly on Lenovo.com. We don’t believe in holding onto customer payments for products we can’t ship in a timely manner. As soon as our online inventory is replenished, Lenovo.com will show updated availability and ordering will reopen.
The team signs off by saying that they will "improve and ensure a better process moving forward," which is good to hear. However, if you recently placed a preorder for the Legion Go 2 on the Lenovo website, you may want to double-check that it's still around. If it did get cancelled, you may have better luck with a retailer near you.
