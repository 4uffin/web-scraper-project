5 weirdest things I've 3D printed that I actually use

When you start 3D printing, it’s easy to get caught up making practical items like enclosures, stands, or organizers. What I didn’t expect was how many of the strangest prints would become part of my daily routine. Some of them solve problems in ways I never imagined, and others just add a bit of fun to everyday life. Here are some of the weirdest things I’ve printed that I still use regularly.
Where possible, I've provided links to the models I've listed. However, some of these designs are available exclusively to those with commercial seller rights from the designer. As such, no links are available to provide.
A box turtle with a removable shell
A strange but perfect way to store hair ties
This little turtle has a removable shell that works like a lid, and I use it to keep hair ties neatly tucked away. The design is whimsical but surprisingly functional, turning a cute print into a handy container. Instead of digging through drawers or misplacing ties around the house, I just lift the shell and grab one when I need it. It keeps everything in one place while adding a bit of charm to the bathroom shelf. I originally printed it just because it looked fun. I didn’t think it would be more than a decorative trinket, but it quickly found a real purpose. Now it sits where it’s both easy to reach and easy to notice, making it far more useful than I anticipated. What started as a novelty has turned into one of those small conveniences I wouldn’t want to do without. What makes it one of my weirdest prints is how unlikely it seemed at first. A cartoonish turtle doesn’t sound like a storage solution, but it solved a small problem in a memorable way. It’s proof that the strangest models can end up being the most practical. The odd design is precisely why it stuck, because it’s impossible to ignore and easy to enjoy.
A ramen noodle bowl and spoon rest with chopstick grooves
Turning kitchen quirks into daily convenience
Source: Brake916/Printables
I printed this because I was tired of balancing chopsticks on the edge of bowls or having spoons clatter onto the counter. The model has grooves that hold chopsticks neatly in place while a spoon rests alongside them, which makes it ideal for noodle dishes. It’s meant for ramen nights, but I’ve found myself using it whenever I cook anything that requires multiple utensils. Once it landed on the counter, it never really left. It’s not something you’ll find in most kitchens, which makes it feel somewhat unusual. But once you have it, you realize how much sense it makes. Instead of juggling utensils or dirtying extra plates, I can keep everything together in one spot. That small convenience adds up to a smoother, cleaner cooking experience each time I use it. The best part is how much of a conversation starter it becomes. Friends laugh when they see how specific it is, but then they try it and suddenly understand why it exists. What started as a weird experiment quickly turned into something essential for my kitchen routine. It proves that even the quirkiest prints can find a permanent role in daily life.
Desk organizers disguised as miniature coffins
Morbid but surprisingly practical gadget management
My desk is all too often a cluttered mess, and I’ve tried plenty of solutions to tame it. When I stumbled across some designs shaped like coffins, I had to give them a try. There are lots of choices, from open-cavity designs to bookshelves and more.You tuck your gear inside to keep it neat and tidy. Most aren't large enough for everything, but I've found models that stash away pens, penciles, small USB devices, charging cords and earphones with ease.
Each of these models reminds me that usefulness isn’t always about being conventional, and sometimes the oddest designs make life a little easier.
The shape definitely makes it weird. A tiny coffin sitting on my desk isn’t what most people expect to see, and they often get comments from visitors. This sort of thing is equal parts quirky and macabre, but it’s also highly effective at what it does. That combination is why I never replaced it with something more ordinary. I like that these prints take something mundane and make them memorable. Every time I stash a cable in one, it gives me a grin, which makes it more enjoyable to use than any store-bought option. This proves that you don’t always need to print something sleek or conventional for it to be useful. Sometimes the strangest design ends up being the most satisfying one.
A T. rex skull keychain with a moving jaw
Prehistoric fidget toy meets everyday carry
This print is part accessory, part toy, and part stress reliever. It’s a miniature T. rex head that works as a keychain, and the jaw actually opens and closes like a little clamp. I didn’t think it would hold up to daily use, but the design has been surprisingly durable over time. My keys get tossed around every day, and the little dinosaur keeps snapping away without breaking. The movable jaw makes it a natural fidget toy. When I’m waiting in line or stuck on hold, I find myself clicking it open and closed without even realizing it. It’s silly, but it works better than most purpose-made fidget gadgets I’ve tried in the past. That dual role of being both practical and entertaining is what makes it stand out. It also makes a great conversation starter. People always ask about it when they notice the detail, and more than a few have wanted one of their own. For something that started as a weird little experiment, this T. rex head has become one of my most-used prints. I never expected such a strange design to become such a daily companion, but here we are.
A cat-head planter with leafy greens
Whimsical design that doubles as home décor
This planter started as a fun print, but it quickly turned into one of the strangest yet most cheerful items in my home. It’s a cat head with big eyes and rounded cheeks, designed with playful details that make it stand out. I printed both the head and the tray beneath it using a rainbow gradient filament, which shifts from one vivid color to another. Now it holds a pothos plant, and the leaves spill out like wild hair, giving the cat an almost animated personality. Initially, I created it solely to test the gradient filament and observe how the colors would blend across a large, rounded surface. I didn’t expect it to be much more than a showpiece, but once I placed the plant inside, it felt like a natural fit. The character design and bold colors make it impossible to overlook, and it always grabs attention when people see it for the first time. It’s one of those prints that started as an experiment but quickly found a permanent home on my counter. The extra detail that really makes it unique is the articulated tail, which curls out from the back like a playful accent. It doesn’t need to move to function as a planter, but the motion adds to its charm. I could have gone with a plain pot, but it never would have sparked the same joy. This cat-head planter manages to be both whimsical and practical, and that’s precisely why it belongs on my list of weirdest 3D prints I actually use.
Weird prints can be the most useful ones
The funny thing about 3D printing is that you never know which designs will take off. Some of my most practical prints started as the weirdest ideas. From a turtle that hides hair ties to a cat planter with a rainbow finish and an articulated tail, these quirky projects have proven their worth. Each of these models reminds me that usefulness isn’t always about being conventional, and sometimes the oddest designs make life a little easier.

IMO if you are not learning a CAD program to make simple replacement parts and dodads you are missing most of what is awesome about having a 3D printer

Yeah idk who is approving these. I feel like XDA suddenly lost all their appeal lately.
