Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Borderlands 4 may have been a highly anticipated game release for 2025, but the launch has been anything but smooth. Many people picked up the game on PC and consoles, hoping to dive into another crazy misadventure, this time taking place on the planet Kairos. But not everybody has been able to play the game without something unusual or buggy happening in it. What was supposed to be a great new release to kick off the fourth quarter of the year ended up becoming a hot debate about new game launches and quality. This isn't something new or exclusive to the release of Borderlands 4. There have been plenty of new game releases that had a very rough or buggy launch, often with updates that come shortly after the official release of the games. But this isn't something that players should continue to ignore, especially when things are in a similar bad state to what Borderlands 4 was experiencing. New games may always have a bug that can pop up occasionally when they first hit the market, but it's not something to give a pass when people are paying full retail price for a brand-new experience that is supposed to be high quality. Here's why Borderlands 4 is a big example of why we all need to stop making excuses for buggy launches.
Big problems from the start
It's just not good to see
One of the biggest issues that comes with buggy launches is how it can totally deflate the release of a new game. The conversation about a new release can center around everything that's wrong or becoming wrong about it, rather than the intended experience that developers want players to have. And while there are aspects of the development process that can remedy issues that pop up before a game hits the market, it's not the sole answer to the problem. However, it's made all the worse when there's an expectation of this being the case with every major launch. It's something that is casually implied all too often and is not good to see. Borderlands 4 having recurring bugs and glitches isn't something to brush off, nor should it be expected to happen on its launch week. The problems people are encountering are not a series of annoying graphical bugs that happen infrequently, but rather major things that greatly affect the core experience for players on PC and consoles. On the PlayStation 5, it's been noted by many people on social media that the game becomes more prone to encountering bugs and other major issues the longer one plays, especially on a PlayStation 5 Pro console. It progressively gets worse, which can result in the game crashing in some instances. On the PC, things like frequent crashes, terrible performance with stuttering, and progress loss are only a few of the problems that PC users find themselves running into.

These are all things that nobody should have to experience at a game's launch, and it should not be given a pass. Patches and updates will definitely be made and released to fix these issues in due time, but players shouldn't just be OK with this right now. They end up paying full retail price or more at launch and end up with a broken experience. And new games really shouldn't be released in a state where they feel broken from the start.
Similar to other rough releases
Doesn't make it better
The common excuse often shared is that most big-budget games, which are typically large, often have buggy releases. Some of them may even have the same hurdles that Borderlands 4 finds itself in. But that doesn't make things better or demand more from games, so they work when players first pick them up. It almost makes the case that everyone who wants a brand-new game should wait until weeks after it releases to buy it, which can be around the time when the first group of patches are released to clean up what's messy about it. But shouldn't a game that's on store shelves feel like it's complete enough to play through from beginning to end without major issues? This is why it's so disappointing to see Borderlands 4 in the state it is in at launch. Gearbox Software has acknowledged the issues and has pledged to release new updates to fix everything, with a major update coming to PC first before the console versions. But in reality, the studio probably should've delayed the game and allowed for more time to iron out the terrible issues on this level. It's very hard to spot every technical problem a game can have, but some of the issues that Borderlands 4 players are running into at launch feel like they could've been spotted way earlier.

Other popular titles like Cyberpunk 2077, No Man's Sky, and even Halo: The Master Chief Collection all suffered from broken releases. They later got multiple patches and updates that made them more stable to play, but the damage at their launches was done. It's a recurring problem that continues to persist with the release of more games, with the general expectation that something will be broken initially until it's fixed later on. This should not be the case, and players shouldn't be fine with that. Just because other games had this same scenario occur doesn't mean we should give a pass to new and upcoming games when the exact same thing happens. At some point, enough has to be enough.
What comes next?
Looking for answers and solutions

With Borderlands 4 finally out now, the game will eventually get the necessary updates it needs to solve its most glaring shortcomings on consoles and PC. However, the need for games to be better at launch will require gamers to demand more from studios, and studios to be willing to take more time to double-check their work. Whether that means delaying a release a little longer or not will be different for every company, but people want experiences that are not riddled with bugs and glitches. And more importantly, they want their games to work well when they buy and play them. And yet, part of this also requires gamers not making excuses for when these kinds of things happen with new releases. We can't be quiet when a game frequently crashes so many times on a PC setup that is built to play everything smoothly, nor when our Xbox Series X/S or PlayStation 5 struggles to run a game correctly. These aren't things that anybody should be content with. And the more people stay loud about that, the more likely studios will think harder about their games launching in a more stable state.
Trying to play more Borderlands 4
For the time being, everyone is going to have to enjoy playing through Borderlands 4 the way it is. Gearbox has already said it's their priority to work on patches for the biggest problems that have been showing up, especially some of the crazier things in the PC version. Those on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S may have to hold on a little longer until those same updates carry over into the game on all platforms. For many, diving into Kairos for the first time now, it is what it is for the moment. But eventually, rough game launches like this are going to need to stop taking place, and what's happened with Borderlands 4 is a good example of why studios need to do better.

Let's face it, this whole 'releasing broken games' has been around since hard drives were standardized in consoles during the PS3 era. Publishers want holiday sales, and most of the developer staff wants to sleep somewhere besides under their desk. Couple that with companies like Bethesda (who almost never release a crash-free game) that get praised for releasing games that are essentially in their beta stage, and here we are. This isn't going anywhere, folks. The only way to mitigate it is to wait until the game stabilizes to buy, letting the publishers specifically feel it in their share price. Unfortunately, most won't learn, and devs that begged for a few more months will instead be laid off for missing unrealistic deadlines and/or budgets.

Denuvo is notorious for creating massive performance issues due to the nature of it's DRM.
It's why years ago I stopped buying any game using Denuvo.
This is nothing new.

Completely agree its why I didn't buy it , that and randy . I know gearbox this is thier mo !! Tons of issues blame the people who buy it
, and they still buy it .. they also should not be able to get a refund .. maybe then they will learn .. look at the day after !! It was a known scam and people still bought it .and got refunded!! So they learned nothing!! Also you can't cry about the game if you bought it .. no of this is new behavior from them!!

Yea but let’s be realistic big publishers like EA are the reason for these buggy launches. The publisher puts so much pressure on the devs to release, even though they’re told the game isn’t ready it’s the publishers (mostly) that scream “just launch it and fix it later” because they’re told to only care about the profits. A good solution for this is to stop preordering. It’s 2025 we literally have no reason to preorder games anymore. It was necessary back in day like 2002 when GameStop or Walmart etc… wouldn’t have enough copies on day of launch. Now the preorders are strictly based on value projections of said game. Thats why I respect rockstar because they absolutely refuse to launch a buggy game. They’ve been this way since the start of the company. Which is also why it’s taking YEARS to release gta 6. They are constructing a whole new engine and want to make sure we get the best experience possible at launch. GTAO was a pure example of why you don’t rush the devs. GTAO was a disaster at launch, but they fixed it promptly, vs Diablo 3 for example where it took them almost 2 years to fix. The gaming industry use to care about their consumers and were proud of the work they accomplished. But now with publishers like EA its Profits > People.

I'm on the flip side of all of this.
My game has been a smooth experience since day 1.
I'm capped at 120fps the intended way.
I've yet to crash.
4080s, 285k (24cores), 32gig.People who are barking about denuvo effecting performance?
If it does, I'm not seeing it.
I feel like this is a very "Karen" reason to not buy a game.Next, people do not take Steam Reviews seriously anymore.
Most of the time, reviews are not even about the actual gameplay.
Most of the time, its people playing an hour and leaving 1 liner negative reviews that don't explain what was up, and that constitutes to the total.
It's completely skewed.As for the article, I assume the author did or didnt do something to their pc that is causing issues for them.
Also, CP2077 and NMS had beautiful comeback stories.
So saying "the damage was already done" was only temporary.

Negative steam review, and don't change it.
DO NOT change it just because they fixed it.
Companies need to learn a buggy launch is unacceptable.

A negative review is one thing.
But if people really want to send a message,
the answer is to stop buying the games. Refuse to put out money until it's proven to be acceptable. In the case of this game,
my son and I both pre-ordered. Him in PC, me on Series X. He had some graphical issues with a roughly 2 year old rig,
but nothing a little tweaking couldn't fix. I am about 30 hours in on the Series X and I've yet to see a thing to complain about. Having said that,
I don't understand a company wanting to put something out that's unfinished and buggy.
Just wait a couple of months and release it when it's ready. They'll make far more money that way when it gets glowing reviews than they would buy releasing something that just pisses off half their player base at launch.
