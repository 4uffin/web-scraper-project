4 self-hosted services I regret trying to rely on

I love the idea of self-hosting all my apps and services. Not being reliant on commercial cloud services is a dream. The idea of cutting out big tech, taking back control and running my own slice of the internet from my own server excites me. It smells of freedom. No subscriptions or being tied to terms and conditions, or being at the back and call of a third party service's uptimes. All that sounds incredible, but it isn't how it always pans out. When you're running a self-hosted stack, you're the IT guy, you're the support and you're the maintenance. Updates break things, usually at the worst possible time, services become unreliable, and you're spending more time fixing things than enjoying them. I've tried enough self-hosted apps to know that some are simply not worth the effort to me and maybe to you. These are the four self-hosted services that I regret trying to rely on the most.
4
Bitwarden
Password management needs rock-solid reliability
On paper, self-hosting Bitwarden sounds like the best possible move for security. When it comes to passwords, I shouldn't have to trust a third-party company's servers. It's easy enough to self-host and I made sure that I secured my vault as best as I could. But that's the issue. I'm not a security expert and every update was a potential security crisis. If a browser extension stopped syncing, and often it did, I had to take out the time to figure out why, instead of just logging into the website I was trying to check out. If there was a vulnerability, it was my headache to ensure the patches were applied, or I'd risk putting my entire digital presence at risk. The convenience of password managers comes from being secure workhorses that are always available. Once you've committed to one, you don't think all that much about them until you need them. Meanwhile, a self-hosted version becomes a liability. It demands constant awareness and attention, which is the exact opposite of what I want from a tool that is supposed to make life easier. After a few scares where software updates went sideways and syncing completely stopped working on my phone, I just went back and switched over to the cloud-hosted version out of frustration.
3
Nextcloud
Sync conflicts, sluggish performance, and upgrade issues
I know Nextcloud gets a lot of love in the self-hosted community, but it's one service that nearly broke me. On paper, it's everything you could want. An all-in-one productivity app if you will. It does everything from file syncing to document editing, calendars, contact sync. Basically, the works. But, trust me, it's no Google Drive alternative. I was spending more time solving sync conflicts between devices than uploading files. Performance wasn't great either. And trying to upgrade the system resulted in too much of downtime. In fact, I've had to spend entire weekends diagnosing and fixing database issues when I could have been getting stuff done instead. Despite its popularity, Nextcloud was clearly not for me. Since then, I've switched over to a combination of cloud-first services, as well as my Synology NAS drive's built-in apps. They might not be as feature complete, but atleast they work.
2
Jellyfin
If you want simplicity and ease of access, Plex still wins
This one's going to be controversial. I really wanted to rely on Jellyfin, and I almost did. The service is close to perfect. I'm all aboard the idea of a free and open-source self-hosted media server that can stream my media collection anywhere I want. Except it just didn't work all that well for me. I watch a lot of off-beat cinema and Jellyfin's metadata scraping wasn't up to scratch for me. Transcoding files often got stuck. But the worst offender was remote access. I need a reliable solution and Jellyfin can't match Plex's simplicity when you're trying to share media with family members who aren't tech nerds. Even though Jellyfin worked, it just required too much hand holding from me to be worth my time.
1
Self-hosted email
It's a losing battle
I thought I was adept at self-hosting. That's before I tried to self-host email. It didn't take me long to get a crash course in the nitty gritties of DMARC, SPF and DKIM. Let's just say, it was way above my paygrade. Moreover, the technical side is just the beginning of self-hosting email. Even if you cross that hurdle, there's the challenge of spam filters and deliverability. With the sheer amount of spam on the internet, most large providers like Google and Microsoft will outright deny your email. It's all too easy to land up on an email block list as well if you've misconfigured your server accidently. Email is one of those services that I simply cannot afford to have going down, and I quickly came back running to my Google Workspace subscription.
There's a time to self-host, and a time to step aside
Self-hosting is great. I live and breathe it every day and a very significant portion of my tech stack is still self-hosted. But not everything is worth running on your own. When you need absolute reliability, like say emails and passwords access, it's probably a good idea to let the experts handle the job. I'd still recommend spinning up an instance to tinker around and learn. There's a lot of knowledge to be gained. But I don't think I'd ever switch back to self-hosting any of these services again.

Can plex still revoke their services if they don't like how you acquired your media? Yes? Then plex is a no go and jellfin wins hands down.

I don't get why jellyfin is on this list. It just works. Compared to what I was doing with Kodi and a SQL server, you just set up the docker container and point it at your media. That's about it. Put the jellyfin app on your smart TV and away you go. The only issues I've ever had with it were because I got a bad stick of memory and it kept corrupting everything.

Let us know when that happens... Which will be never. And if they somehow were compelled to, switch to the inferior Jellyfin.

I agree on some points, and others I'll take your word for it because I've not tried them.But one I have to strongly disagree on is Plex v Jellyfin. Plex now want extortionate amounts of money to stream your media library externally.I'd also argue that Jellyfin is easier to grant external access to than Plex. Instead of having to make my friend set up a Plex account, verify their email address, then send them an invite to my media server which they then have to accept, then locate my server amongst
all of all the random public libraries that Plex offer, with Jellyfin I create them an account myself, tell them the server address and credentials, and they have instant access. Literally it's one extra field on the app, or on the web they just use my server address as the URL.Jellyfin, unlike Plex, also supports things like hardware transcoding and HDR out the box, which Plex, again, want extortionate amounts of money to allow you to utilise. I've had no issues with Jellyfin transcoding etc, it actually seems to work better than Plex, which I've had crazy amounts of transcoding issues with. The only issue I've found with Jellyfin is it sometimes seems to buffer when direct playing 4K, but that's likely a performance issue of my ancient server than an issue of the software itself.The *only* reason I even still run Plex, which runs alongside Jellyfin, is because my smart TV and PlayStation doesn't have a native Jellyfin app, but even then I can just use my Chromecast to access Jellyfin.If I'm going to pay £400 towards my media server, it's going to be towards storage & performance upgrades, not a Plex Pass.

Did you use the official Bitwarden self hosting? I've been using Vaultwarden as my server for Bitwarden and have had absolutely zero issues in three years.

Came here to say that. Vaultwarden in container and watchtower that keeps it up-to-date for me. Zero issues.I was sceptical about it at first but the fact that you can export bitwarden configuration out of devices without bitwarden host available basically makes it countless backups on all devices that uses it (in addition to actual backups)

NextCloud's bloated and bleeding-edge nature is what makes it unstable and unreliable. I tried moving to NextCloud twice and gave up, keeping my OwnCloud self-host, instead. OwnCloud (from which NextCloud was forked) has been rock solid for me for years, upgrades included. Everyone forgets about OwnCloud, but NexCloud wouldn't exist at all without it. Did you know that OC supports self-hosted Collabora for an integrated document editing experience similar to NextCloud?As for password management, I switched to KeePassXC paired with my OwnCloud storage for self-hosted password vaults years ago after LastPass got hacked. KeePassXC works on everything and maintains local caches of vaults on devices, syncing with the cloud copy only when changes are detected. Again, I've been using it for years without a single incident. Since the vault is just a file in my OwnCloud storage, I only have to worry that OC is secure, instead of 2 different attack surfaces. I see no reason to trust cloud password managers, as they are huge targets for the hacking community, as has been demonstrated many times. With KeePassXC, the headaches of self-hosting are no worse than dealing with the quirks of your favorite cloud option.I will also take this time to remind everyone that Emby is another alternative to Plex. Emby is what Plex *used to be* before they got greedy, and I prefer it over Jellyfin. Never had a problem self-hosting Emby. Yes, Emby has a paid side (Premier) for things like easy remote access and TV Guide data for tuners, but they still offer something Plex doesn't...a one-time lifetime license! 😎The ONLY service on this list I agree with, wholeheartedly, is self-hosted email. In this age of strict sender validation and other anti-spam/anti-phishing policies, getting the major services to recognize your little dyamically IP'd SMTP server as legit is a perpetual exercise in failure management. It is still one of the only hosted services I pay for to this day.

With yunohost, nextcloud and jellyfin are problem-less... basically works out of the box, email, its very very easy, but not so straightforward... give yunohost a chance... it solve most of the problems you mentioned

I skipped right past Plex and went for Jellyfin when I first set up my homelab, and I have zero regrets. If you use tailscale, you're not losing out on much.

Emby for media. Jellyfin originally forked from Emby and became complicated. Ive heard Nexcloud via Windows VM is much easier to manage than docker

Jellyfin remote access really isn't bad if you forward 443 from your router to a reverse proxy in front of it. Throw a pair of nginx and cert bot containers into your compose file next to Jellyfin itself, point 80 & 443 at them, give it a DNS name (dynamic if you're feeling adventurous), and you're done. Reliable public access without any NAT traversal shenanigans or cloud middleware you don't control.

Agreed with you about Nextckoud. Mine is going in the bin shortly. Jellyfin I will reserve judgement but with recent breaches in Plex and them laying off staff, how much longer will they go for.

Honestly , it sounds like you just aren’t built for self-hosting. There are plenty of other hobbies out there, though.

Allow me to introduce everyone to CopyParty, the ultimate file transfer/hosting solution.Dead simple, no bloat, it's what you expect Owncloud/Nexcloud to be when you first try it but discover it's far too bloated for your needs.

Jellyfin in the cloud (seedbox) works excellent. But stop transcoding, its never a good idea. Plex is not the solution. Plex is on a downward trajectory since several years by now.

Finally one of these that gets it right.I probably won't make the self hosted password management or file/picture hosting because of the risk.But seeing Plex recommended over Jellyfin on here is a new one. Jellyfin probably will never have the same amount of app support, which makes them very hard to compare

I am surprised nextcloud is on here! For me it has completely replaced all Google services (except Gmail) completely and has been extremely stable and sync has been flawless and I'm working with projects that are 100gb or more. But it adds up, you were trying to run off a Synology NAS, I built my own! I'm glad I went my direction because the performance gains (and the cost being cheaper than a pre built) are worth the time to build it yourself if you want to run services, a pre built NAS just isn't speced out to run tons of apps like nextcloud, jellyfin, game servers, rustdesk simultaneously!
