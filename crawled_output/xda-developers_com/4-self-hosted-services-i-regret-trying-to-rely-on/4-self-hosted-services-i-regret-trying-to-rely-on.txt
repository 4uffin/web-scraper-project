4 self-hosted services I regret trying to rely on

I love the idea of self-hosting all my apps and services. Not being reliant on commercial cloud services is a dream. The idea of cutting out big tech, taking back control and running my own slice of the internet from my own server excites me. It smells of freedom. No subscriptions or being tied to terms and conditions, or being at the back and call of a third party service's uptimes. All that sounds incredible, but it isn't how it always pans out. When you're running a self-hosted stack, you're the IT guy, you're the support and you're the maintenance. Updates break things, usually at the worst possible time, services become unreliable, and you're spending more time fixing things than enjoying them. I've tried enough self-hosted apps to know that some are simply not worth the effort to me and maybe to you. These are the four self-hosted services that I regret trying to rely on the most.
4
Bitwarden
Password management needs rock-solid reliability
On paper, self-hosting Bitwarden sounds like the best possible move for security. When it comes to passwords, I shouldn't have to trust a third-party company's servers. It's easy enough to self-host and I made sure that I secured my vault as best as I could. But that's the issue. I'm not a security expert and every update was a potential security crisis. If a browser extension stopped syncing, and often it did, I had to take out the time to figure out why, instead of just logging into the website I was trying to check out. If there was a vulnerability, it was my headache to ensure the patches were applied, or I'd risk putting my entire digital presence at risk. The convenience of password managers comes from being secure workhorses that are always available. Once you've committed to one, you don't think all that much about them until you need them. Meanwhile, a self-hosted version becomes a liability. It demands constant awareness and attention, which is the exact opposite of what I want from a tool that is supposed to make life easier. After a few scares where software updates went sideways and syncing completely stopped working on my phone, I just went back and switched over to the cloud-hosted version out of frustration.
3
Nextcloud
Sync conflicts, sluggish performance, and upgrade issues
I know Nextcloud gets a lot of love in the self-hosted community, but it's one service that nearly broke me. On paper, it's everything you could want. An all-in-one productivity app if you will. It does everything from file syncing to document editing, calendars, contact sync. Basically, the works. But, trust me, it's no Google Drive alternative. I was spending more time solving sync conflicts between devices than uploading files. Performance wasn't great either. And trying to upgrade the system resulted in too much of downtime. In fact, I've had to spend entire weekends diagnosing and fixing database issues when I could have been getting stuff done instead. Despite its popularity, Nextcloud was clearly not for me. Since then, I've switched over to a combination of cloud-first services, as well as my Synology NAS drive's built-in apps. They might not be as feature complete, but atleast they work.
2
Jellyfin
If you want simplicity and ease of access, Plex still wins
This one's going to be controversial. I really wanted to rely on Jellyfin, and I almost did. The service is close to perfect. I'm all aboard the idea of a free and open-source self-hosted media server that can stream my media collection anywhere I want. Except it just didn't work all that well for me. I watch a lot of off-beat cinema and Jellyfin's metadata scraping wasn't up to scratch for me. Transcoding files often got stuck. But the worst offender was remote access. I need a reliable solution and Jellyfin can't match Plex's simplicity when you're trying to share media with family members who aren't tech nerds. Even though Jellyfin worked, it just required too much hand holding from me to be worth my time.
1
Self-hosted email
It's a losing battle
I thought I was adept at self-hosting. That's before I tried to self-host email. It didn't take me long to get a crash course in the nitty gritties of DMARC, SPF and DKIM. Let's just say, it was way above my paygrade. Moreover, the technical side is just the beginning of self-hosting email. Even if you cross that hurdle, there's the challenge of spam filters and deliverability. With the sheer amount of spam on the internet, most large providers like Google and Microsoft will outright deny your email. It's all too easy to land up on an email block list as well if you've misconfigured your server accidently. Email is one of those services that I simply cannot afford to have going down, and I quickly came back running to my Google Workspace subscription.
There's a time to self-host, and a time to step aside
Self-hosting is great. I live and breathe it every day and a very significant portion of my tech stack is still self-hosted. But not everything is worth running on your own. When you need absolute reliability, like say emails and passwords access, it's probably a good idea to let the experts handle the job. I'd still recommend spinning up an instance to tinker around and learn. There's a lot of knowledge to be gained. But I don't think I'd ever switch back to self-hosting any of these services again.

Can plex still revoke their services if they don't like how you acquired your media? Yes? Then plex is a no go and jellfin wins hands down.

I don't get why jellyfin is on this list. It just works. Compared to what I was doing with Kodi and a SQL server, you just set up the docker container and point it at your media. That's about it. Put the jellyfin app on your smart TV and away you go. The only issues I've ever had with it were because I got a bad stick of memory and it kept corrupting everything.

Let us know when that happens... Which will be never. And if they somehow were compelled to, switch to the inferior Jellyfin.

Nathaniel you literally just described a Plex setup and Plex outperforms Jellyfin in all manners. Thats why jellyfin is on the list. I was in Mexico recently and was able to watch media from my plex server. Jellyfin is limited to local. Kodi is mostly dead and shouldn't exist outside of librelec niche usage.

Michael Crazy how insanely ignorant you are. Just because you don't know about or understand how to use anything outside of Plex doesn't mean something is "dead" or inferior. It's ok to just be quiet instead of humiliating yourself.

Did you use the official Bitwarden self hosting? I've been using Vaultwarden as my server for Bitwarden and have had absolutely zero issues in three years.

Came here to say that. Vaultwarden in container and watchtower that keeps it up-to-date for me. Zero issues.I was sceptical about it at first but the fact that you can export bitwarden configuration out of devices without bitwarden host available basically makes it countless backups on all devices that uses it (in addition to actual backups)

@johnny why's that? I've had no issues with Bitwarden clients and Vaultwarden. I can't imagine what would make a password manager significantly better.

I agree on some points, and others I'll take your word for it because I've not tried them.But one I have to strongly disagree on is Plex v Jellyfin. Plex now want extortionate amounts of money to stream your media library externally.I'd also argue that Jellyfin is easier to grant external access to than Plex. Instead of having to make my friend set up a Plex account, verify their email address, then send them an invite to my media server which they then have to accept, then locate my server amongst
all of all the random public libraries that Plex offer, with Jellyfin I create them an account myself, tell them the server address and credentials, and they have instant access. Literally it's one extra field on the app, or on the web they just use my server address as the URL.Jellyfin, unlike Plex, also supports things like hardware transcoding and HDR out the box, which Plex, again, want extortionate amounts of money to allow you to utilise. I've had no issues with Jellyfin transcoding etc, it actually seems to work better than Plex, which I've had crazy amounts of transcoding issues with. The only issue I've found with Jellyfin is it sometimes seems to buffer when direct playing 4K, but that's likely a performance issue of my ancient server than an issue of the software itself.The *only* reason I even still run Plex, which runs alongside Jellyfin, is because my smart TV and PlayStation doesn't have a native Jellyfin app, but even then I can just use my Chromecast to access Jellyfin.If I'm going to pay £400 towards my media server, it's going to be towards storage & performance upgrades, not a Plex Pass.

Michael for starters, it's not $95 any more lol, it's $250, but also why pay for Plex when Jellyfin does everything Plex does but has a nicer and more intuitive UI, and is free?Yes, my argument is I don't want to pay for it, because why on Earth would I when Jellyfin meets my needs perfectly?Your argument is to spend $250 for literally no reason? Unless there's a specific niche feature that Plex has that I'd not be able to live without, of course I'm not going to pay for it.I have no idea if Plex has many or any features that Jellyfin doesn't, because if it does then they're features I don't use and have never heard of and don't care about.In fact what I have found is that Plex wouldn't automatically sort my music library, I had to import cover art, artist, albums etc manually, then create artist folders with album sub folders to put the songs in, but Jellyfin seems to just find this info itself without any trouble as long as the file name is correct. So from my experience using both, Jellyfin has *more* features than Plex. Not to mention after all the hassle of sorting my music Plex removed the music section from the Plex app. It's a good job I had Jellyfin or I'd be without my music library!The only thing I can think of that Plex had that Jellyfin didn't was obscure free TV channels I'd never heard of not did I ever use, it seemed to mostly be old public domain TV shows and movies, but ironically I can actually add Plex's channels to Jellyfin if I really wanted them anyway, which I don't.

Honestly , it sounds like you just aren’t built for self-hosting. There are plenty of other hobbies out there, though.

The Plex over Jellyfin or Emby is wild. I was onboard, now I doubt everything about this post. I literally just rebuilt my Jellyfin server on a Proxmox LXC and can't fathom why anyone would want to deal with Plex over it. It would cost hundreds of dollars with Plex to come close.

I skipped right past Plex and went for Jellyfin when I first set up my homelab, and I have zero regrets. If you use tailscale, you're not losing out on much.

Jellyfin remote access really isn't bad if you forward 443 from your router to a reverse proxy in front of it. Throw a pair of nginx and cert bot containers into your compose file next to Jellyfin itself, point 80 & 443 at them, give it a DNS name (dynamic if you're feeling adventurous), and you're done. Reliable public access without any NAT traversal shenanigans or cloud middleware you don't control.

Michael not really if you're already setting up jellyfin in docker. Nginx proxy manager is even easier to set up and you just tell it where you want what addresses to go.

NextCloud's bloated and bleeding-edge nature is what makes it unstable and unreliable. I tried moving to NextCloud twice and gave up, keeping my OwnCloud self-host, instead. OwnCloud (from which NextCloud was forked) has been rock solid for me for years, upgrades included. Everyone forgets about OwnCloud, but NexCloud wouldn't exist at all without it. Did you know that OC supports self-hosted Collabora for an integrated document editing experience similar to NextCloud?As for password management, I switched to KeePassXC paired with my OwnCloud storage for self-hosted password vaults years ago after LastPass got hacked. KeePassXC works on everything and maintains local caches of vaults on devices, syncing with the cloud copy only when changes are detected. Again, I've been using it for years without a single incident. Since the vault is just a file in my OwnCloud storage, I only have to worry that OC is secure, instead of 2 different attack surfaces. I see no reason to trust cloud password managers, as they are huge targets for the hacking community, as has been demonstrated many times. With KeePassXC, the headaches of self-hosting are no worse than dealing with the quirks of your favorite cloud option.I will also take this time to remind everyone that Emby is another alternative to Plex. Emby is what Plex *used to be* before they got greedy, and I prefer it over Jellyfin. Never had a problem self-hosting Emby. Yes, Emby has a paid side (Premier) for things like easy remote access and TV Guide data for tuners, but they still offer something Plex doesn't...a one-time lifetime license! 😎The ONLY service on this list I agree with, wholeheartedly, is self-hosted email. In this age of strict sender validation and other anti-spam/anti-phishing policies, getting the major services to recognize your little dyamically IP'd SMTP server as legit is a perpetual exercise in failure management. It is still one of the only hosted services I pay for to this day.

With yunohost, nextcloud and jellyfin are problem-less... basically works out of the box, email, its very very easy, but not so straightforward... give yunohost a chance... it solve most of the problems you mentioned

You're doing self-hosted NextCloud & password manager wrong.
I was in the same boat as you with sluggish performance. I added a SSD cache to my Synology with existing RAID5, along with tmpfs mounts for logs and that instantly changed.
The logging and write operations, which NextCloud does a lot, take basically no time at all. As for self-hosted password managers, bitwarden does everything on a server.
The server should just be a place to sync encrypted data.
Enpass works locally and syncs to your server of choice. You get local options like local folder where you can use a shared drive, Google Drive Desktop, OneDrive, or WebDav, or NextCloud.
They support DropBox or other locations as well.
The point here is you've got your password file encrypted, then encryption-in-transit, and your choice of storage location.
Personally I use WebDav on NextCloud.

Emby for media. Jellyfin originally forked from Emby and became complicated. Ive heard Nexcloud via Windows VM is much easier to manage than docker

Agreed with you about Nextckoud. Mine is going in the bin shortly. Jellyfin I will reserve judgement but with recent breaches in Plex and them laying off staff, how much longer will they go for.

Nah Plex is way more simple than Jellyfin. You dont even really have to set it up besides choosing library names like Movies, TV Series, etc. Jellyfin requires a full set up.

Allow me to introduce everyone to CopyParty, the ultimate file transfer/hosting solution.Dead simple, no bloat, it's what you expect Owncloud/Nexcloud to be when you first try it but discover it's far too bloated for your needs.

Jellyfin in the cloud (seedbox) works excellent. But stop transcoding, its never a good idea. Plex is not the solution. Plex is on a downward trajectory since several years by now.

This was why I ended up using Emby. Didn't like Plex at the time giving me for ads for other live streaming stuff. Jellyfin was great but I initially had issues with the hardware transcoding and it just worked on Emby so I never went back. That being said I do have lifetime premium on both Plex and Emby so if price was a concern then Jellyfin is the clear winner.

Michael This was years ago, so it might not be the case anymore but Plex seemed to want to show media from lots of non local sources when I just wanted it to show my media library. Perhaps not ads but still things I didn’t want to see.

Finally one of these that gets it right.I probably won't make the self hosted password management or file/picture hosting because of the risk.But seeing Plex recommended over Jellyfin on here is a new one. Jellyfin probably will never have the same amount of app support, which makes them very hard to compare

I am surprised nextcloud is on here! For me it has completely replaced all Google services (except Gmail) completely and has been extremely stable and sync has been flawless and I'm working with projects that are 100gb or more. But it adds up, you were trying to run off a Synology NAS, I built my own! I'm glad I went my direction because the performance gains (and the cost being cheaper than a pre built) are worth the time to build it yourself if you want to run services, a pre built NAS just isn't speced out to run tons of apps like nextcloud, jellyfin, game servers, rustdesk simultaneously!

Sounds like all of self-hosting is above your pay grade due to crying because you have to do the backend work , well buddy boy that's part of "self-hosting" and keeping your host / servers / vm's / containers safe is way more easier than you think it is but seeing to as you are just some blogger I can't really expect too much. Haha I did like reading your post but now go cry me a River.
