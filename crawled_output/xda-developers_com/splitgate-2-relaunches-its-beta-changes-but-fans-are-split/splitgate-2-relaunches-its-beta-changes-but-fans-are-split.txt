Give me a lighthearted recap
Splitgate 2 is relaunching its beta, and this time the team at 1047 Games wants to get it right. The first launch in June 2025 was a stumble: the game arrived with technical issues, awkward balancing, and mechanics that drifted away from what made the original Splitgate stand out. Player counts dropped fast, and the studio made the choice to hold off on fully releasing the game until they worked on it more. This past weekend, August 29–30, marked the first public playtest. So, here’s how it went.

What changes did 1047 Games make?
Reworking the core systems of the game
The relaunch playtest wasn’t just a technical test; it was a chance for the developers to update the game's UI, experiment with game modes, and show players that their feedback had been listened to. During the playtest, the developers reworked how factions and ability-based perks worked. Faction abilities like Hypersight, Rush, and Smart Wall were disabled during the playtest while the developers rethought how to better implement the system in Splitgate 2. Maps were another big focus during the playtest, with arenas like Academy, Core, and Eden given more portal walls, making players think creatively about portal placement. 1047 brought back fan-favorite game modes like King of the Hill and Domination, leaning harder into the competitive FPS genre. And Splitball, a mode that lacked team coordination, was adjusted so that carrying the ball disables portal use, stopping players from simply setting up portals and camping at enemy goalposts. Gunplay itself received tuning, too; recoil patterns are smoothed out, and weapons feel more predictable.
How the Community Responded
Mostly positive

Reaction to the playtest was a mixed bag, but in a way that reflects just how passionate the Splitgate community still is. On the one hand, many players appreciated the tighter focus and the clear attempt to simplify systems that felt bloated in the first launch. The ability to mix and match weapons/perks between characters gives players much more freedom. And the map and game mode fixes do a lot to improve the overall gameplay. On the other hand, there’s a lingering concern that Splitgate 2 has lost some of the magic of the original. A common sentiment was that portals don’t feel as central as they once did. In the first game, using portals was the difference between victory and defeat, and with all the added perks and superhero powers, Splitgate 2 started to feel more like a hero shooter than a competitive one. Steam reviews reflected this divide. Around 60% of players rated the new experimental build positively, with comments praising the pace and balance. While others expressed disappointment that the identity of the game still feels missing. The test didn’t convince everyone, but it did show that 1047 is willing to put in the work to implement community feedback.
What Comes Next
A long road ahead

This beta playtest was just one step in a long road to launch. The Splitgate community has lost a lot of trust in 1047 Games, and they will have to work hard to win that trust back. But if 1047 Games plans to keep running these limited tests, gathering feedback, and iterating upon them, then there's a good chance they can bring Splitgate 2 back from the dead.
Splitgate 2 may just have a revival
Splitgate 2’s relaunch this weekend showed players that 1047 Games is listening, willing to admit mistakes, and course-correcting for their community's sake. Yet the mixed reception proves that rebuilding trust won’t be easy. Some fans welcome the changes, while others feel the sequel still hasn’t captured the spirit of Splitgate.
