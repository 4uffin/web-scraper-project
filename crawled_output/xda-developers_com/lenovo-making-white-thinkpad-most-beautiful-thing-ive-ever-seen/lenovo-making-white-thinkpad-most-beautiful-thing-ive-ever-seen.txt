Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
IFA 2025 officially starts today, and Lenovo is kicking things off with a wide range of announcements, as the company usually does. From the Think brand, we're getting a new ThinkBook concept and a few new ThinkPads. Even though ThinkBook concepts are always fun, the best thing about this series of announcements is definitely the new Glacier White ThinkPad X9. Let's break down what's new.
A white ThinkPad
Miracles can happen, it seems
There are many things Lenovo's ThinkPads are known for, but fun has never been one of them. These laptops have boring designs that are as standard as can be, and they usually come in either black, or black. Some ThinkPad models have grey options, but that's the furthest you'll see the company go. Well, until today, at least. Lenovo has announced a new Glacier White version of the ThinkPad X9, and it looks absolutely glorious. Mind you, the ThinkPad X9 — which we reviewed earlier this year — already broke the mold for ThinkPads by removing the TrackPoint, and now, we're seeing the brand explore even more variations of its signature look. The new colorway combines white and some light grey accents, and it'll be coming in October. Looks aside, it's the same model you already know, featuring Intel's latest processors to deliver top-notch performance, and it comes in both 14-inch and 15-inch models. Official pricing starts at $1,889, but you can likely expect that to drop very quickly, as ThinkPads usually do.
Lenovo ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept
And a couple of smaller ones
Lenovo's ThinkBook brand is always home to some crazy concepts, and this time around, Lenovo is introducing something a little more basic, but still interesting. The ThinkBook VertiFlex Concept, also known as Project Pivo, is a laptop with a 14-inch display that can easily transition from the typical landscape orientation to a vertical one. It might make sense if you're using your screen primarily for reading or writing, though it's certainly not the same kind of "wow" product we've seen from previous ThinkBooks, such as the most recent ThinkBook Plus with a rollable display. It's not clear yet whether Lenovo will be selling this as a real product, but most ThinkBook concepts usually turn into real products a few months later, so we might see something come of this at CES 2026, or maybe later around MWC in March. There's another concept from Lenovo at the show, called Project Ballet. This isn't a laptop, but it's a laptop stand that uses AI and various sensors to track the user and rotate the laptop in that direction so that it's always in a convenient position. Another concept is the NaturaSynth Display, which Lenovo claims mimics natural light to the point where blue light is reduced to under 1%, making the display much easier on the eyes.
New ThinkPad workstations
Power on the go
Along with the announcements above, Lenovo also introduced a handful of new mobile workstations for those who need more powerful hardware while on the go. The leader of the bunch is the new Thinkpad P16 Gen 3, with Intel Core Ultra 200HX series processors and up to an Nvidia RTX Pro 5000 Blackwell GPU for heavy workloads. This will start at $3,339 in October. Then there's the ThinkPad P1 Gen 8, which is a slightly less powerful machine, maxing out with an RTX Pro 2000 Blackwell GPU, but coming in a more compact format. This one will launch later this month and start at $2,819. Other workstations include the more affordable ThinkPad P16v Gen 3, as well as the more mobility-focused P16s i Gen 3 and P14s i Gen 3. All these will also launch this month and start at $2,249, $1,859, and $1.819, respectively.
There's some desktop news, too
New monitors and more

Finally, there are some news for those using proper desk setups. Lenovo announced the new ThinkVision P40w-40 monitor, a 21:9 ultrawide monitor with super-sharp 5120x2160 resolution, 98% coverage of DCI-P3, and an IPS Black panel that promises higher contrast than a typical IPS display. It also supports a 120Hz refresh rate, plus it comes with single-cable Thunderbolt connectivity, which can handle video and audio while also delivering up to 140W of power to a connected laptop. Plus, it has a built 2.5G Ethernet port to deliver faster internet to your PC. The monitor will be available in October starting at $2,182. Other accessories include a new Thunderbolt 5 dock and a Thunderbolt 4 dock as well, along with a cheaper USB4 dock. All three will be available before the end of the month, priced at $549.99, $379.99, and $269.99, respectively. Lenovo is also upgrading its TinkCentre neo-Ultra Gen 2 desktop PC with an option for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti discrete GPU, delivering more power for AI workloads.

I was excited about this until I saw it has no TrackPoint. It looks more like an IdeaPad with ThinkPad branding. This is no ThinkPad if it has no TrackPoint. "Boo!", I say.

The ThinkPad X9 isn't a ThinkPad, it's a MacBook running Windows. No trackpoint? That terrible arrow-key layout? Ultra-shallow key travel? That's not a damned ThinkPad. It's a crappier Intel MacBook.

White laptop and computer cases are not used anymore because the plastic they use fades with time due to UV damage. They also attract finger oils which attract dirt and dust. How many computer cases from the early 2000's have you seen where the white has turned into a beige patina. So if Lenovo found a supplier who can overcome all of this, more power to them.

That's the most basic a**, dell looking, cookie cutter type laptop I've ever seen. If you thought the new gen thinkpads were trash, this took it to a new level.At some point, ThinkPads were, and in some cases, are works of art, some waiting to become it, others born that way. Over time newer models were released, and with each release, a little of the ThinkPad's identity was forgotten by the company that bought the name. This just straight threw it in the trash after ripping out the name tag and plastering it onto some basic and brittle laptop.Truly disappointed. Has the author ever owned a loved thinkpad??

I have an older Lenovo laptop and they truly are works of art, and solid machines (physically), too.
