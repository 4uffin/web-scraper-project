Here is a fact-based summary of the story contents:
Try something different:
Show me the facts
Explain it like I’m 5
Give me a lighthearted recap
Obsidian has great default features, such as Graph View, which gives you a visual of how your notes are connected. You can also create folders and subfolders to keep everything easy to find. Those tools cover the basics, but sometimes you want more than the default setup to manage your projects and ideas efficiently. That’s where Make.md comes in. The Obsidian plugin has popular features such as boards to help you track your projects, outlines to break down complex notes, and tabs to help you navigate faster. Together, these features make it easier to see what you’re working on, what still needs your attention, and what you've finished.
Boards keep my Obsidian notes moving
From brainstorm to draft to finish work
One of the first things I tried in Make.md was setting up a board, and it’s something I’ll continue to use. I created a property called Stage with four options: Brainstorm, Drafting, Polishing, and Submitted. Any new idea I’m not sure about goes straight into Brainstorm. Once I decided to work with it, I moved it to Drafting. When the draft is close to ready, I put it in Polishing, and once I've pitched or turned it in, it lands in Submitted. I also created a Space and put my notes in Board view, where I lined up drafts, such as Windows 11 security updates and perfect responses, to see how they looked side by side. This setup makes it easy to glance at a project and know exactly where each idea stands. Instead of digging through folders or trying to remember what I last touched, I can drag notes between columns and see my progress. Now I can see where everything stands without second-guessing myself.
Make titles stand out with emojis and colors
Find important notes at a glance
Make.md also gives you the option of giving your notes some personality. A quick right-click lets you drop in an emoji or pick a color, so your drafts don’t all blur together. I like using a green checkmark for finished pieces, a pencil for something still in progress, or a bold red shade when a deadline is close. It takes only a second to set up, and you can change it whenever your projects shift. You can still add emojis to the notes by using the Emoji Toolbar plugin, if you want, but adding color and emojis directly in Make.md makes your notes feel less like a wall of text. Your eye goes straight to the icon or color you picked, which makes it easier to spot the file you want. It’s a small change that saved me time when looking for a file.
Spaces give you a broader view of your notes
Different layouts help you see them from new angles
Spaces can also go beyond simple views. You can add blocks such as dividers, labels, or notes to shape the page, which makes it feel closer to a workspace. Dividers and labels keep sections clear. You can use images and stickers to get a better visual of your notes. Buttons and links are helpful because they act like shortcuts, letting you run a command. Spaces also lets you add progress blocks so you can see the progress between two values. That way, you can see how far you’ve come. I built a Space around my writing folder to see how it would handle everyday work. In table view, I could scan titles with their status and due dates side by side. Switching to board view made it easy to drag drafts into a Draft or Ready column, which felt quicker than bouncing between folders and searching for notes.
The setup can feel like extra work
Some features ask for properties and steps before they work
Make.md doesn’t always feel effortless due to the extra details when setting something up. To get a board working the way I wanted, I had to create a property called Stage, set its options, and then connect it to a board view. The same thing happens with other features. Adding emojis is built in, but you can also get that from the Emoji Toolbar plugin. Kanban already offers a board system, while Make.md builds boards into a broader setup. The difference is that you need to create properties and link them before the view works. The plugin brings a lot together, but it also raises the bar for how much tinkering you need to do before it feels smooth.
The effort up front saves time later
A little setup leads to smoother projects down the line
The setup can feel complicated at first, but that doesn’t mean the plugin isn’t worth your time. The trick is not to dive into every option at once. Start with the features you’re going to use every day, the ones that actually help you get things done faster. For me, that was Boards and Spaces, because they help track drafts and deadlines. Once those are set up, I could add smaller touches like emojis and colors. If you begin with the basics you’ll actually use, the extra effort pays off quickly. Over time, Make.md feels less like another plugin and more like a central hub for your notes. If you have trouble the first time, take a break and come back to the setup with a rested mind for another try.
Make.md pulls it all together
Obsidian works well on its own, but Make.md makes organizing projects easier without stacking a dozen plugins. Boards, Spaces, and visual cues sit in one place, adding structure while keeping everything in Markdown. For anyone who wants Obsidian to feel less like storage and more like a working system, Make.md is the plugin to try.
