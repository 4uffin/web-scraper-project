Give me a lighthearted recap
When it comes to video games about James Bond, the one release that everybody universally loves is GoldenEye 007 for the Nintendo 64. It was not only one of the most influential first-person shooter titles in modern gaming, but it had a significant impact on multiplayer gaming across all genres. Those who owned a Nintendo 64 back then most likely owned a copy of GoldenEye 007 to play with their friends, even if they weren't a big fan of James Bond stories. But many people often forget that there have been many James Bond video games released over the years, and some of them were better than GoldenEye 007 in different ways. While the first Pierce Brosnan film remains one of the most popular video games based on the popular British spy, it's not the only one to make big moves for the franchise. At the same time, GoldenEye 007 isn't the only first-person James Bond game that people have been able to enjoy, either alone or with friends. Because of how much critical and commercial praise GoldenEye 007 often gets, there are many other games related to James Bond that get lost in the mix. There's almost a sense of denial that some games out there may do things a little better than what was accomplished with the N64 classic. Here are some 007 games that were better than GoldenEye 007, but hardly anybody remembers them often.
The World is Not Enough (N64)
A sequel that took things further
The follow-up to GoldenEye 007 on the Nintendo 64 was always going to struggle with player impressions. So many people love the game and have personal memories tied to it that almost nothing could deliver on expectations, nor overshadow those good times. But the next game on the N64 for James Bond actually has the building blocks to solidify itself as a step above GoldenEye 007. Based on the film of the same name, The World is Not Enough takes everything that people loved about the previous game and improves upon it. This includes the gameplay, the presentation, the multiplayer, and even the unlockables. While there was a version of The World is Not Enough for the original PlayStation, it is a very different title that is often considered inferior to the Nintendo 64 version. On the Nintendo 64, this Bond game implements voice acting for the first time, which was something that GoldenEye 007 didn't include. Hearing Pierce Brosnan's Bond and the many other characters from the plot of the film speak in real-time adds a layer of authenticity to the experience, especially with dialogue pulled straight from the film. At various times, M can be heard giving Bond orders to accomplish different objectives, which makes playing through missions sound even better, despite the voices being done by impersonators and not the film's actors. The level design of the main campaign authentically recreates many of the locations that were featured in the movie, including some of the bigger set pieces with major action scenes. Everything from gadgets to weapons, as well as other tech that Bond uses in the film, make some sort of appearance to lend real credibility to this not only being a solid movie tie-in game, but a solid James Bond experience as well.

Multiplayer for The World is Not Enough is just as good, if not better than, what players had with GoldenEye 007. Stages are very different from the previous game, but many of the game types from GoldenEye 007 are included, including new ones to try out. Completing mission objectives and difficulty challenges in the single-player campaign could also unlock various bonuses for multiplayer, including things like new modes, characters, and weapons. Unfortunately, The World is Not Enough never truly got the credit it deserves over the years because of it coming out after GoldenEye 007. Many critics at the time gave it positive reviews, but it wasn't enough to truly stand alongside the previous game in the eyes of some fans.

James Bond 007: Bloodstone
An original Daniel Craig adventure
Source: Activision
While many of the 007 video games that featured Daniel Craig in the title role weren't received well, one of the underappreciated titles was Bloodstone: 007 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game is an original story that has Bond and MI-6 taking on an international terrorist group known as Greco. The game is set in-between the events of two Daniel Craig movies, specifically Quantum of Solace and Skyfall. Gameplay for Bloodstone: 007 switched to third-person action, which was popular at the time with games like Splinter Cell that had many similarities to James Bond stories. What makes Bloodstone: 007 so interesting is how well it incorporates many unique traits of Bond into a game, but keeps it feeling original with Daniel Craig's version of the character. An adrenaline-like system during shootouts allowed Bond to take down multiple enemies with well-placed shots, provided he had enough adrenaline to use. Like Pierce Brosnan's James Bond, Daniel Craig's version has the benefit of being involved with an original story beyond the boundaries of the film, allowing for some wild moments that were exclusive to the game. The driving sequences were tense, which included multiple types of vehicles that Bond would pilot during various points of the story.

The multiplayer in this game also had up to sixteen players fighting in death match game modes. Objective game types had teams of spies and mercenaries working together to protect or attack key objectives, which could get chaotic online. For the more current James Bond of the era, it was a solid game that was wrongfully labeled as average at the time by many critics. It didn't have any traits of a bad game, it just didn't do anything out of the ordinary for action games released at that moment in time.

007: Nightfire
Shaking up what we loved
As much as people loved GoldenEye 007 as the quintessential Pierce Brosnan James Bond game, it wasn't the only hit his version of the character had in video games. 007: Nightfire is often seen as a true successor to the legacy of GoldenEye 007, but on a totally different platform. This James Bond game is another original title for the Pierce Brosnan version of the British spy, but does a number of different things that weren't really possible before. The PC version of the game had online multiplayer for up to twelve people, including bots, which upped the level of action from previous Bond games before it. Some of the stages included in multiplayer were also based on various James Bond film locations, including places based on movies like Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved Me. This James Bond game came out a year after another title that featured Pierce Brosnan's likeness as James Bond, which was 007: Agent Under Fire. Both games are often compared to GoldenEye 007 because of the first-person perspective and the approach to completing objectives within stages. Although 007: Agent Under Fire is very similar in the right ways, 007: Nightfire is often given more credit because of the bigger Bond moments within it's story, which are highlighted in the game with tokens that players are rewarded with for executing them. If GoldenEye 007 was going to be developed in the year of 2002 for the PlayStation 2 and original Xbox, it would most likely be similar to how Nightfire turned out.

007: Everything or Nothing
Bringing in big talent for Bond
One of the other forgotten Bond games, which is another Pierce Brosnan escapade, is 007: Everything or Nothing from 2004. This was one of the last games to feature this version of the character, but it had a big blowout of talent involved with its development. Pierce Brosnan himself would voice James Bond, along with his likeness included in the game. With him was an all-star cast of actors and actresses that were involved with previous 007 projects, including Judi Dench as M and John Cleese as Q. Other Hollywood talent to voice parts of the game included Heidi Klum and Willem Dafoe, among others in different parts for the story. The game felt like a big budget Bond film, but delivered onto a video game console. The gameplay of 007: Everything or Nothing was third-person action, and was the second James Bond game to do so since the prior release of The World is Not Enough on the original PlayStation. Bond could shoot and fight enemies in this perspective, while also using a variety of gadgets to get around obstacles during missions. Some button sequences broke up parts of the action while on foot, but driving sections in vehicles also mixed things up throughout the story, including an Aston Martin car. The brand has been synonymous with the series, and continues into many of the different game releases for James Bond.

The game also features 2-player cooperative missions for the first time in the franchise, but the characters that you play as are not James Bond himself but unnamed MI-6 agents. Together, players need to complete objectives using the same mechanics from the single-player mode. On the Nintendo GameCube, 007: Everything or Nothing can be linked with the Game Boy Advance version of the game to unlock exclusive content, which includes bonus mini-games and upgraded gadgets for the GBA version.

The name is always Bond
The legacy of GoldenEye 007 and its place in gaming history can never be questioned or undermined. It's one of the most important modern video games that influenced generations of titles that came after it. But as much as that beloved game is important to the legacy of James Bond, it's not the apex video game of the entire franchise. GoldenEye 007 was definitely the game that walked so that future Bond games could run further with everything. James Bond 007 has a rich library of video games that have many highs and lows, but have always delivered a style and flair that is unique to the iconic character. And no matter what type of game it comes from, the name on the box is always going to say Bond... James Bond.

There's not enough Bond games that were good. Let's hope this new one is worthy of being on this list.Otherwise, we might need Teyon (RoboCop Rogue City) or Machine games (Indiana Jones, Wolfenstein) to create something magical.
