Although your life doesn't necessarily depend on it, the
M.2 slot roulette is real, and you need to take note of all the available slots, ensuring you make the most of your expensive NVMe SSD. This standard has become the norm for connecting super-fast storage to your PC, be it a range-topping desktop system, portable laptop, or compact mini PC. Depending on which PCI generation you have available on the motherboard — this all boils down to your CPU and motherboard chipset — you could experience speeds up to 15,000 MB/s. The issue is that not all PCIe M.2 slots are the same, and you could end up hampering your PC's performance.
The Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) is at the heart of most M.2 SSD slots, though you will find a few that support the slower SATA interface. Depending on the interface and the
generation of PCIe, this determines the speed at which data can be transferred between the SSD and motherboard, effectively shortening load times for games and ensuring your OS and apps boot up quicker. Although PCIe generations have evolved significantly over the years and are largely backward compatible, SATA isn't, and it's still a bad idea to use a PCIe 5.0 SSD with a PCIe 3.0 M.2 slot. This is why it's vital to understand your motherboard's SSD slots and choose the right one.
Not all M.2 slots are the same
PCIe vs. PCIe vs. SATA
An NVMe SSD won't work with a SATA M.2 slot, and a SATA SSD won't play ball with a PCIe M.2 slot. This is why they're keyed differently, which means the physical pin layouts are different. It's similar to DDR4 and DDR5 to help prevent accidental installation of the wrong component. SATA SSDs use what's known as a B-Key layout, and NVMe drives use an M-Key layout. SATA SSDs using the same M.2 slot are restricted to 550 MB/s or so, whereas PCIe allows Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) SSDs to stretch their legs and climb well into the thousands. It's evident just how different these interfaces are, with SATA III capping at just 6 Gb/s and PCIe supporting up to 4 GB/s (not Gb/s) per available PCI lane. This is why it's important to use the right SSD with the right slot. For SATA and NVMe drives, there's a risk that you could damage the drive or motherboard. And for NVMe drives, the PCIe generation could affect how fast the SSD can run, hampering performance compared to manufacturer marketing materials. A PCIe 4.0 SSD installed in a PCIe 3.0 slot will be limited to the slower 3.0 speeds, resulting in underwhelming performance.
This is why it's important to use the right SSD with the right slot. For SATA and NVMe drives, there's a risk that you could damage the drive or motherboard.
Conversely, a PCIe 3.0 SSD in a PCIe 4.0 slot will not benefit from the faster interface.
PCIe 5.0 is the current generation of SSD storage (at the time of writing). Launching in 2019, we're still seeing a flurry of new drives launch with incredible speeds, though prices continue to play a role in many PC owners holding out and sticking to older generation hardware. Before PCIe 5.0, we had PCIe 4.0 and PCIe 3.0, which launched in 2017 and 2012, respectively. PCIe 3.0 tops out at around 3,500 MB/s, and PCIe 4.0 can achieve speeds of 7,000 MB/s. As you can see, we're effectively doubling performance with each new standard.
Where it becomes M.2 roulette
Multiple slots to choose from
Modern motherboards, even the more affordable ones, usually have more than one M.2 slot. These are often with different configurations, resulting in a size and PCIe generation mismatch. Just because a slot looks the same doesn't mean it will work well with your SSD. It has even caught me off guard a couple of times, believing I knew best about the motherboard in question, only to realize I was using a PCIe 4.0 drive with a PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSD slot. It's not the end of the world, but you're effectively hampering the performance of your SSD for no reason, especially if you have a better slot available. Motherboards will have different PCIe generation slots (or even just SATA) to cater to different use cases. A primary SSD slot may be designed for OS and game storage. Secondary M.2 slots may be geared for long-term storage and
something like a Wi-Fi card — yes, you can install Wi-Fi modules on M.2 slots. So long as the keying of the slot matches your SSD, you're usually good to go since mix-matching PCIe generations won't damage anything. Sure, your SSD will run slower and your ego shattered upon discovering this fact, but it's psosible to re-arrange SSDs to get the most from your PC.
Secondary M.2 slots may not have passive cooling for SSDs, potentially hampering performance.
Depending on the motherboard and how the PCIe slots are configured, you may even find that slots are limited depending on what's installed on the board. If you have a super-fast GPU and SSD installed, another slot may have its PCI lanes reduced, resulting in slower performance. Some slots may have fewer PCIe lanes assigned by default. This is usually discovered on a motherboard specifications page or manual, and is worth considering if you plan to use more advanced hardware with your PC. That's what this all boils down to. You should always consult your motherboard manual and official documentation. This goes for selecting the right M.2 slot for your super-fast NVMe drive, picking the right RAM for your CPU (checking the
QVL list of verified kits to ensure stability and performance), and deciding just what you can connect to the motherboard. Even if you're experienced with putting together desktop systems, not everything may be printed on the board itself. If you have just one high-speed SSD, ensure it's installed in the primary M.2 slot, which is usually kitted out with the most PCIe lanes. Also consider cooling with higher-generation NVMe drives, which require some sort of cooling to prevent throttling.
Create the ultimate PC
So long as you're aware of all the M.2 slots your motherboard supports, you shouldn't have any trouble using super-fast SSD storage. It's only when you look to use anything outside of the primary slot is when you can run into problems with either incompatibility or limited performance. Always consult your motherboard’s manual, prioritize high-speed slots for NVMe SSDs, and ensure that your hardware is properly cooled, especially for PCIe 5.0 hardware. As newer generations are developed and released, this will only continue to become more important.

None of that describes a roulette.There's no randomness, or chance.It's all labeled, published, and rationally explained.It maybe be unintuitive, or uncertain, but not at all a roulette.This isn't like ordering a part with multiple revisions and not being able to know which one you receive in the mail.

It should be standard practise to check that your components are compatible.If you just buy things at random without checking them then you'll find that sometimes you've bought the wrong thing.

Hi I fell to lack of transparency of Gigabyte advertising of their Motherboards. I have just built two new computers one using the X870 Aoura Elite and the B850 Gaming X which had more than two NVMe SSD slots 4 and 3 yet when I placed SSD's in the slot some didn't seem to show the SSD basically not working.
Trying to find out why I found a note saying that these will not work due to CPU and other criteria yet none of theirs was mentioned in their advertising blurb or the CPU blurb regarding if suitable for this board. So basically I wasted the extra money I paid for these higher rati﻿ng board. Regards Kevin

My upgrade process from the nvme that was originally installed in the mini pc I purchased failed. I contacted the manufacturer and they explained it must be an m.2 sata drive. So I had to verify that with the amazon description as well as the physical slot image. Quite a learning experience.

Some m.2 slots will support sata and nvme drives, and sometimes will disable sata ports, it comes down to read the manual and understand what does what.
