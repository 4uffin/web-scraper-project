Summary
Google is testing a new Windows desktop app in Labs that works much like Spotlight on macOS, offering a floating search bar you can summon with a shortcut.
The app integrates Google Lens and AI features, letting users instantly search anything on screen and continue with follow-up questions.
Currently, the app is only available as an experiment in the United States, supports Windows 10 and above, and requires users to sign in after installation.
Whether it's a research assistant like NotebookLM, a new foldable, or a handy Gmail feature, Google is always working on something or another. But one thing we don't see the tech giant do often is drop a dedicated Windows app. Think about it — it's 2025 and there's still no native Google Docs, Gmail, or even YouTube desktop app for Windows or macOS. Well, this is exactly what makes the company's decision to launch a Windows desktop app so surprising. Though it’s still experimental, Google’s new desktop app seems aimed at finally making it simple to find files on Windows.
Google is testing a new Spotlight-like search app for Windows
As announced via a post on The Keyword, Google is currently testing a new search app for Windows in Labs. If you've used macOS before, you're likely familiar with Spotlight. If not, Spotlight on macOS is a system-wide search tool that lets you quickly find and open files and apps, and even do simple tasks like unit conversions. Spotlight can be accessed just by pressing the Command and Space bar keys. Now, why did I even bring Spotlight up in an article about a new Windows app? Well, it's because Google's new Windows app works in a very similar way. It brings a Spotlight-like floating search bar you can summon anytime with a shortcut, and then use to search without needing to leave what you’re doing. All you need to do is hit the Alt and Space keys on your device, and you can then search for information from your computer files, installed apps, Google Drive files, and the web too. ​​​
Thanks to Google Lens, the company's visual search feature, you can select anything on the screen and search for it instantly. Instead of needing to open a new browser tab or pick up your phone to look something up when you spot something interesting, you can highlight it and get results right where you are. Of course, it wouldn't be an announcement in 2025 without some mention of AI. When using Google's new desktop app, you can switch to AI Overviews, enable AI Mode, and keep asking follow-up questions. As mentioned above, Google's new Windows app is currently being tested as a Labs experiment and isn't widely available yet. Users in the United States can try the app by opting into the experiment in Labs. It's available on Windows 10 and above, and is currently only offered in English.
