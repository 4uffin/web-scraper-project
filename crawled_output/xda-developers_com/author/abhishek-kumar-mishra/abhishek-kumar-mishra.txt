He closely follows the Windows Insider program and tests new Insider builds to discover upcoming experimental features and upgrades. His past work includes long-term collaborations with reputed publications like Tom's Hardware, and Windows Latest.

Windows OS excites me the most. I frequently explore new and hidden features, especially the AI integration in some native apps.
What was your first computer?
A Lenovo G570 laptop with discrete graphics that helped me play Assassins Creed Revelation at decent FPS.

I was a curious kid in my teens but got involved more with tech when I got my first laptop in 2012, making it more than a decade of trying apps, OS tweaking tricks, and virtual machines.
