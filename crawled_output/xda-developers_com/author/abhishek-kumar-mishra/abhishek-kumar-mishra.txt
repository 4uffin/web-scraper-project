About Abhishek Kumar Mishra
Abhishek is an author at XDA who covers computing.
He has loved computers since he got the Lenovo G570 in 2012. Abhishek holds a master's degree in computer applications and began his writing career in 2018. He loves writing how-to articles, listicles, and informational posts on popular operating systems and web services.
He closely follows the Windows Insider program and tests new Insider builds to discover upcoming experimental features and upgrades. His past work includes long-term collaborations with reputed publications like Tom's Hardware, and Windows Latest.

What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
Windows OS excites me the most. I frequently explore new and hidden features, especially the AI integration in some native apps.
What was your first computer?
A Lenovo G570 laptop with discrete graphics that helped me play Assassins Creed Revelation at decent FPS.
How long have you been interested in technology?
I was a curious kid in my teens but got involved more with tech when I got my first laptop in 2012, making it more than a decade of trying apps, OS tweaking tricks, and virtual machines.
