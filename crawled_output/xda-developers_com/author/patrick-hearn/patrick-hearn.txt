How long have you been interested in technology?
I've had an interest in technology for as long as I can remember, from the time I was gifted my first game console at three years of age.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I love virtual reality and the entire concept of creating another real-yet-not world, and the advances seen in that field fascinate me.
What was your first computer?
My first PC was an old machine running Windows 95. I have fond memories of playing dozens of old DOS games and those free floppy-disk games found in breakfast cereal, like Chex Quest.
