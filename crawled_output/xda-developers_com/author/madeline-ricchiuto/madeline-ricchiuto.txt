About Madeline Ricchiuto
Madeline (She/Her) is a PC Author at XDA with 13 years of experience in tech journalism. She focuses on gaming, computer hardware, components, and software.
Her byline has appeared at multiple publications including Laptop Mag, Tom's Guide, Bleeding Cool, and Diver Mag.
Madeline is also a photographer and scuba instructor.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
As a life-long gamer, I'm always interested in gaming hardware and that includes laptops, desktops, game consoles, and hardware components.
But I'll also see if I can run Final Fantasy XIV on just about any machine, because I can't ever let that subscription go to waste.
How long have you been interested in technology?
I've been playing video games as long as I can remember, and that goes hand-in-hand with my love of technology. I've started focusing more on the hardware side of things for the last five years.
What was your first computer?
I mostly grew up using the family computers, and we had a classic Apple Macintosh which was then replaced by a Sony Vaio PCV-RX540. But my first personal computer was a 2006 Apple MacBook. So I've spent my whole life switching between Windows and macOS.
