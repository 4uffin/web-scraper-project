About Dylan Turck
Dylan Turck is a PC hardware, software, and gaming reporter who loves writing how-to guides and in-depth features on the latest tech products. When he's not shocking himself by pulling electronics apart or trying to get 100% achievements in a game, you can find him in a country far away, learning about new people and cultures.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I enjoy writing about all types of tech products, but my favorite would have to be gaming PC hardware, especially graphics cards and processors. If my computer isn't currently in pieces, you'll find me working on programs like Blender and Unreal Engine or editing photos and videos in Adobe.
How long have you been interested in technology?
I have been interested in technology ever since I was a child. At a young age I was taught how to take apart a computer and put it back together. Ever since then, I have been taking apart computers and consoles for friends, family, and colleagues alike. Now I spend my days asking people if they've "tried turning it on and off again?".
What was your first computer?
I remember my first computer as a white/beige box that looked oddly similar to a dinosaur fossil, it was probably covered in the same amount of dust too. If it wasn't being used for work by my family, you would probably find me feeding guests to my animals in Zoo Tycoon or solving puzzles in Portal.
