How long have you been interested in technology?
My earliest memory is paying for 8-bit game consoles at a friend's place and fixing them for free playtime. In 1998, after crashing his friend's Windows 98 PC, he managed to revive it with the help of a technology magazine. Over time, I have reconstructed many hard drives with Linux-based rescue discs and enjoyed Mac since 2010. Since the first generation of Android, I have been modding and hacking firmware files to optimize smartphones. I've also hacked firmware on people's Phones and iPads out of curiosity. Slow Wi-Fi and network speeds irk me, so I often end up tweaking router settings at my home and even at strangers' places.
What was your first computer?
After living off computers belonging to friends, university, and company, I finally bought my first computer in 2009 - a used Dell Studio 14. When it died in 2014, I tried to work on the company-provided Intel MacBook Air. But in 2019, I missed Windows too much and assembled my desktop besides using my M1 MacBook Air.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I'm most passionate about PC hardware, Macs, Raspberry Pi (and other single-board computers), game consoles (PS5 and portable), gaming peripherals, mechanical keyboards, home networking, smart homes, and audio products.
