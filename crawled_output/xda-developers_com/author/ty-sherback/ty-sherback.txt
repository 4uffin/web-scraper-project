About Ty Sherback
His love of PCs and their components was born out of trying to squeeze every ounce of performance out of the family computer. Tinkering with his own build at age 10 turned into building PCs for friends and family, fostering a passion that would ultimately take shape as a career path.
Besides being the first call for tech support for those close to him, Ty is a computer science student, with his focus being cloud computing and networking. He also competed in semi-pro Counter-Strike for 8 years, making him intimately familiar with everything to do with peripherals.
What was your first computer?
I was introduced to computers far too young to remember the first one I had used, but my first build was cobbled together from my dad's old parts bin. Pentium 4, some ATI Sapphire card, and no more than 4 GB of RAM. If you could get past the artifacting and rattling case fans, it wasn't a half-bad experience.
How long have you been interested in technology?
Ever since my dad sat me down on his lap to watch him play Half-Life. Probably a bit early to be exposed to a violent FPS, but once I learned that all the cool stuff on the screen came from a black box, I wanted nothing more than to learn everything there was to know about computers and how they functioned.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I'm most excited by desktop PC components. There's something really novel about buying all the parts and putting it together yourself, but it doesn't end there. The process of upgrading, tinkering, and personalizing a build doesn't ever get old to me, even if the PC isn't mine.
I also really enjoy working with peripherals due to my esports background. Anything to do with mice, keyboards and mousepads.
