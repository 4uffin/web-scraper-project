About Mahnoor Faisal
Mahnoor is a News Writer at XDA who has been in the professional writing game since her sophomore year of high school. While pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, she also has bylines esteemed publications like XDA's sister site, MakeUseOf, SlashGear, Laptop Mag, and Android Police.
Whether she's spending hours debugging code or staying up all night to watch a tech event, Mahnoor’s passion for technology is undeniable. She loves writing about all things tech, with a particular focus on iOS and macOS.
What was your first computer?
My first computer was a clunky hand-me-down Dell laptop from my father. The laptop had been through everything—it refused to work unless plugged in, took hours to boot up, and even stopped connecting to WiFi at one point.
Despite all that, I’d be lying if I said it didn’t spark my curiosity about technology and set me on the path I’m on today. In fact, I started my tech writing journey on that very laptop. Now, I’ve come a long way and upgraded to an M2 MacBook Air!
How long have you been interested in technology?
I’ve been passionate about technology for as long as I can remember. My fascination with the Apple world, in particular, began when I received an iPod Touch for my 8th birthday.
I started programming at nine, and while I eventually forgot most of what I learned back then, my passion for tech never wavered. Even at seven, if someone asked what career path I wanted to pursue, the answer was always computer science—which I’m now studying!
I’ve always been the go-to for tech questions from friends and family, and I’m grateful I get to do the same for an online audience.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
Since the iPod Touch I received for my birthday sparked my passion for tech, I’ve always been a huge fan of all things Apple. I never miss an opportunity to splurge on a new Apple product whenever I can. As a student by day, I also enjoy exploring ways to integrate technology into my academic life, which is why I use an iPad and Apple Pencil for college. Beyond that, I’m particularly fascinated by Aritificial Intelligence, and I'm excited to see how it will change the world.
