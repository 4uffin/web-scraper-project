About Judy Sanhz
Judy is an author at XDA with over a decade of experience writing about digital media. She's written for some of the largest names such as MakeUseOf, Android Central, Android Police. She always has an Windows computer handy and is always looking into upgrading. When she's not writing about tech, she's watching Return of the Jedi or playing with her Yorkie.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I love PCs with Windows 11, but I'm always reading about others too. I can spend hours on end exploring them. It's not uncommon for me to use my computer long after I'm done working.
How long have you been interested in technology?
I have been interested in technology for over ten years. I am always reading about the latest rumors and computing news. If I don't read something about Windows, my day is not complete.
What was your first computer?
A Dell desktop with a CRT monitor, but I can't remember the model name.
