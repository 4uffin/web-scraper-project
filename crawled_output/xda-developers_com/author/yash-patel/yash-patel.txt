How long have you been interested in technology?
From playing Road Rash on XP pc to playing Bounce Tales on Nokia 6610, I have been connected to the technology since my childhood. However, my true passion for technology blossomed with the evolution of mobile apps and software.
What was your first computer?
My earliest memories of personal computing revolve around a Zenith desktop that arrived in our home around 2003, when I was just six. I don't remember the specifications, but I definitely remember flexing about using Windows XP while at school we were using Windows 98.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
Without a doubt, my passion is centered around software, apps, and the art of maximizing productivity through technology. Sharing practical tips and tricks that help others get the most out of the technology is something I find incredibly rewarding.
