About Parth Shah
Parth, a seasoned tech writer, wields the keyboard (or pen) with finesse to unravel the intricacies of both Windows and Mac operating systems. He has covered evergreen content on mobile devices and computers for multiple publications over the last six years. You can find his work on AndroidPolice, GuidingTech and TechWiser. Whether it’s demystifying system updates, deciphering error codes, or exploring hidden features, Parth’s prose guides readers through the binary maze. When not immersed in tech jargon, you’ll find him sipping chai, pondering the next software review, and occasionally indulging in a friendly debate about mechanical keyboards.
What was your first computer?
A Compaq desktop was our first computer during my childhood days. Me and my brother used to play games like GTA: Vice City, NFS and Cricket from EA.
How long have you been interested in technology?
Nokia's groundbreaking 41MP camera on the Nokia 808 PureView got me interested in mobile tech. Since then, I have been closely following all the latest happenings in the mobile, desktop and smart products space.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I'm a huge fan of smartwatches. The amount of tech these wearables pack is truly fascinating. I'm also looking forward to upcoming smart rings from Samsung and Apple so I can occasionally put aside my smartwatch and flaunt a Seiko on my wrist.
