About Jeff Butts
Jeff's been involved in the IT industry since before the Internet and spent more than 20 years working in technical support, system administration, network administration, and consulting roles. He holds an undergraduate degree in English, a Master's degree in English with a focus on professional writing and editing, and another Master's degree in Computing & Information Systems.
After teaching university English and computer science for a few years, Jeff launched his writing career. He's written for Macworld, Tom's Hardware, groovyPost, The Mac Observer, and more before beginning here at XDA.
How long have you been interested in technology?
I've loved electronics and technology for as long as I can remember, and always enjoyed looking "under the hood." I can remember in the early 1980s, when I was about 12, taking apart my uncle's 286 and trying to overclock it (even though I had no idea that word even existed at that point.)
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I absolutely love Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and other SBCs and microcontrollers. Seeing the amazing projects people can realize using these inexpensive components is a ton of fun, and is probably what I enjoy learning about the most. I'm also a huge fan of anything related to 3D printing.
