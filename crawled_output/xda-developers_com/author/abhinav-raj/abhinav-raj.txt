About Abhinav Raj
Abhinav pivoted from a career in banking to pursue his first love in writing. Even while working full-time, he continued contributing as an editor-at-large, a role he has held for more than 7 years. A lifelong tech enthusiast who has built three gaming and productivity powerhouse PCs since 2018, his passion for technology keeps him closely following the semiconductor industry, from NVIDIA and AMD to ARM. His MSc dissertation explored how artificial intelligence will reshape the future of work, reflecting his curiosity about the wider social impact of emerging technologies.
What was your first computer?
I still vividly remember the day my dad brought home a 1997 IBM Aptiva, because it came with weeks of pure joy. Captain Claw was the very first video game I ever played, and the chime of Windows 95 booting up sparks nostalgia to this day if I hear it. I spent hours on MS Paint drawing funny little cats and houses, only to watch in horror as a single misstep spilled paint across the entire canvas--long before I discovered the magic of the ‘undo’ button!
How long have you been interested in technology?
I don’t know whether it was getting my hands on the Game Boy Advance SP and playing Pokémon FireRed as a 7-year-old, falling in love with an iPad 2 and watching every Apple keynote starting in 2011, writing about consumer technology as an editor-at-large beginning in 2017, or finally building my first gaming PC in 2020. Somewhere along the way, I became fascinated with all things tech!
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I don’t know what I’m more obsessed with, the software that shapes our daily lives or the hardware, from GPUs to CPUs, that powers it and gives it life. As long as Moore’s Law continues to drive advances in silicon, pushing the boundaries of what we can achieve with technology, I remain fascinated, constantly looking out for the next big leap!
