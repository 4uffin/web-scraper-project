About Adam Conway
I’m Adam Conway, an Irish technology fanatic with a BSc in Computer Science and I'm XDA’s Lead Technical Editor. My Bachelor’s thesis was conducted on the viability of benchmarking the non-functional elements of Android apps and smartphones such as performance, and I’ve been working in the tech industry in some way or another since 2017.
In my spare time, you’ll probably find me playing Counter-Strike or VALORANT, and you can reach out to me at adam@xda-developers.com, on Twitter as @AdamConwayIE, on Instagram as adamc.99, or u/AdamConwayIE on Reddit.
What was your first computer?
My first PC was some kind of Dell office PC when I was a kid. I don't remember any of the specs aside from it struggling to run Portal and Minecraft, which inspired me to build my first PC for my 12th birthday! It had an i3-2120 and a GTX 560 Ti, but aside from that, I haven't a clue about the rest of the specs, but I know that it solved my Portal and Minecraft woes.
How long have you been interested in technology?
I've been following technology for as long as I can remember. I remember playing with homebrew on my Nintendo DS when I was around the age of 10, and hacking the family Wii around the same age. I'm amazed I didn't break it!
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I absolutely love gaming and am an avid esports follower and competitor. I also find the mobile technology and smart home sectors incredibly interesting, and my gaming interests fuel my love for computers.

I saved my Home Assistant setup by building my own Bluetooth dongle with an nRF52840
Phones, smartwatches, and everything else
My new server didn't have a Bluetooth adapter I could pass through to my virtual machine, so I built my own instead.

This NAS supports up to 120TB of storage, and it runs on Arm
That's a lot of storage for a power efficient NAS.

Tines and n8n look the same from the outside, but actually using them tells a different story
automation
Tines and n8n are both automation platforms you can deploy at home or in a business, but they're built for entirely different people.

Arm skipped the NPU hype, making the CPU great at AI instead
ARM
Arm's SME2 is designed to live in a heterogeneous platform, but it reduces how much you'll need your GPU.

You might not know it, but IRC predates most of the internet and directly influences it today

IRC is a very important part of internet history, but you'd be forgiven for knowing little about it.

ESP32 counterfeit devices technically exist, but that's not the full story
Phones, smartwatches, and everything else
If you're worried about getting a counterfeit ESP32, you shouldn't be... though they do technically exist, but maybe not in the way you're thinking.

"Vibe coding" is everywhere, but you should still know what the code does before you use it.
