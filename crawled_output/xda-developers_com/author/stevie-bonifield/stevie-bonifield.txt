About Stevie Bonifield
I'm Stevie Bonifield, a freelance tech journalist covering gaming, Linux, Apple, and everything in between. I've written for PC Gamer, Tom's Guide, XDA, and Laptop Mag. When I'm not writing, you can find me playing Elden Ring and building way too many custom keyboards.
How long have you been interested in technology?
I've always had an interest in tech, but it really took off for me when I got into gaming as a kid on the Nintendo DS (and later the Wii).
What was your first computer?
My first computer was a chunky 17-inch HP laptop that couldn't run much besides Minecraft, but it inspired me to build my first custom gaming PC, a ship of Theseus that lives on in my current PC build.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I love tech you can customize, whether that's a gaming PC or a mechanical keyboard. If a device is designed to be tinkered with or personalized, it'll probably get my attention. That also extends to software. Part of why I love using Linux is because of all the freedom it allows to tweak the operating system however you like (my main PC runs on Fedora 41).
