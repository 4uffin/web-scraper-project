About Simon Batt
Simon is a Computer Science BSc graduate who has been writing about technology since 2014, and using Windows machines since 3.1. After working for an indie game studio and acting as the family's go-to technician for all computer issues, he found his passion for writing and decided to use his skill set to write about all things tech.
Since beginning his writing career, he has written for many different publications such as WorldStart, Listverse, and MakeTechEasier. However, after finding his home at MakeUseOf in February 2019, he has been working with it and its sister website, XDA, to bring the latest and greatest in Windows, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity topics.
What was your first computer?
The first computer I ever used was an ACORN, which my dad owned. We spent a lot of hours playing video games on it using a cassette tape player to load the data. I finally got a Windows 3.1 machine that I had at the end of my bed, which I experimented with, played games on, and found my love for tech.
How long have you been interested in technology?
Ever since I was a kid, I've always been glued to some kind of electronic device, whether it was a PC or a Gameboy. I eventually rose to the auspicious rank of "family tech support" and found my love for explaining all things tech .
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
Given that I started with Windows, I've always loved to see how the operating system develops over time. Microsoft has made some excellent and some strange moves over its lifetime, so you'll often find me reporting on all the things the Redmond tech giant does.
