How long have you been interested in technology?
I've always had an interest in technology for most of my life. I enjoyed using computers, playing video games, and trying out new products at home. New tech is always fun to explore and try out for the first time.
What was your first computer?
The first computer I ever worked with at home was a Windows desktop. As a young kid, I used older Apple computers in the lab, where I got to play many classic and iconic PC games from that time.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I love using different gaming accessories and headsets. I jokingly refer to myself as a Set Head, since I have collected different gaming headsets over the years. I like using them as I play different games across multiple platforms.
