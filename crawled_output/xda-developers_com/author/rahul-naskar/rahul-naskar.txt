What was your first computer?
Assuming we're talking about laptops and desktops, my first computer was Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD, AMD Radeon graphics card ( I don't remember the model).
How long have you been interested in technology?
I've been interested in tech since childhood, but my love for tech blossomed when I got my first Windows Phone in 2013.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I was obsessed with Windows Phone back in the day, but that was almost a decade ago. While I still love the Windows Phone UI, I like to explore new laptops running different operating systems. I'm equally excited about foldable phones.
