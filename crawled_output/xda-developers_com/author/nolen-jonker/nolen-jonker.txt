About Nolen Jonker
Nolen began their writing career in 2019, with three years dedicated to editing the Creative section at MakeUseOf. Their expertise lies at the crossroads of technology and creativity, covering areas like photography, video editing, and graphic design.
Outside of work, you'll often find Nolen diving into a good book, writing their own stories, or playing video games.
What was your first computer?
My first introduction to the world of computers was when my grandma got me an old clunky machine for school projects when I was eight, which I would later come to know as a Windows XP desktop.
How long have you been interested in technology?
My interest in technology can be traced back to receiving an old keyboard as a gift when I was seven. Already playing piano, I was captivated by the effects all the cool buttons had on the notes. This curiosity in electronic music eventually led me to pursue a diploma in sound engineering, which set off a domino effect of discovering all sorts of creative software like Audacity, DaVinci Resolve, and the Adobe suite. All I wanted to do was create stuff using modern tools.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I'm passionate about tools that keep creation accessible and stress-free, no matter your skill level or budget. This includes software like Canva for quick designs, DaVinci Resolve for polished videos, and Photopea as a free alternative to Photoshop. I'm also an avid PC gamer with a collection of over 70 games in my Steam library.
