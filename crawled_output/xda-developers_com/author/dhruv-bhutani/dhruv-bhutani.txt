About Dhruv Bhutani
Dhruv Bhutani has been writing about consumer technology since 2008, offering deep insights into the personal technology landscape through features and opinion pieces. He writes for XDA-Developers, where he focuses on topics like productivity, networking, self-hosting, and more. Over the years, his work has also appeared in leading publications such as Android Police, Android Authority, CNET, PCMag, and more.

How long have you been interested in technology?
I started building radios when I was five, fixing consoles for pocket money when I was ten, and hacking iPod firmwares when I was fifteen. Suffice it to say that technology has been a part of my life for practically as long as I've been born. However, it took smartphones for me to realize the sheer unrealized potential of democratizing mobile computing to the masses.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
Networking hardware, smart home equipment, and backup, storage solutions intrigue me the most.
