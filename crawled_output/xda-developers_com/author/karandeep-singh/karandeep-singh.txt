About Karandeep Singh
I am a Senior Author at XDA with a decade of experience covering consumer tech. I care more about the impact of technology on people’s everyday lives than the superfluous features companies keep adding each year, which is central to my reviews and product recommendations.
How long have you been interested in technology?
I have been a consumer of gadget reviews ever since I was in my early teens. And guess what, I haven't looked back since!
What was your first computer?
It was a desktop PC made by an Indian brand called Wipro. The computer came with Windows Vista preinstalled but later saw the days of Windows 7 and then the radical Windows 8. Tired of all the newness, I soon decided to go back to and settle with the trusty Windows 7.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I talk about and cover a range of tech products, but what I'm really interested in is how to make the most of your existing devices. For instance, if the goal is to be more productive, I'd find and fine-tune the tools and services to my needs.
