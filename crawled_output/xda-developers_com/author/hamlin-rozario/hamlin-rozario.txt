About Hamlin Rozario
Hamlin has been in the tech field for over seven years. Since 2017, his work has appeared on MakeUseOf, OSXDaily, Beebom, MashTips, and more. He served as the Senior Editor for MUO for two years before joining XDA. He uses a Windows PC for desktop use and a MacBook for traveling, but dislikes some of the quirks of macOS. You're more likely to catch him at the gym or on a flight than anywhere else.
How long have you been interested in technology?
The moment I got my first PC as a kid was when it all started. But a few years later, in 2010, smartphones started getting popular, and my interest peaked. Right after I got my very first phone, the Google Nexus One, I started going through the old XDA Developers forums to learn how to mod it with custom ROMs and stuff.
What was your first computer?
I started off with an assembled PC in 2005. I don't remember all the components, but as far as I can tell, I had a Samsung SyncMaster CRT monitor, an integrated 128MB ATI Radeon GPU, and an Intel Pentium 4 series CPU.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
Gaming hardware excites me the most since I've been gaming for almost two decades at this point. So, I'm always interested to be in a conversation about graphics cards, processors, the latest advancements in monitors, and so on. Besides that, I'm mostly an Apple fanboy, but you'll never catch me trying to game on a Mac. Trust me.
