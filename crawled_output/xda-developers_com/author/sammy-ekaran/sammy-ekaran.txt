What was your first computer?
It was an Hp laptop. I can remember vividly the moment I got it I dismantled and reassembled it out of curiosity to see what was inside. This encounter laid the foundation for my passion for computers.
How long have you been interested in technology?
I have been interested in technology ever since I got my first computer over a decade ago. Over the years I have explored other areas of technology like 3D printing after coming across an interesting timelapse video showcasing a product "growing" from the 3D printer bed. This inspired me to get my first 3D printer which was Anet A8 and I immersed myself in the technology.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I am interested in anything related to computing, 3D printing and 3D scanning, CNC machining, and Raspberry Pi. In addition to owning two gaming computers and an ultra wide monitor, I also have 5 3D printers, three FDM and two resin-based and I have Two Trees TTC450 router machine.
I also own a Raspberry Pi 5 which I oftenly use for creating interesting projects at home.
