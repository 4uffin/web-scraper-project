About Joe Rice-Jones
Maker, meme-r, and unabashed geek, Joe has been writing about technology since starting his career in 2018 at KnowTechie. He's covered everything from Apple to apps and crowdfunding and loves getting to the bottom of complicated topics. In that time, he's also written for SlashGear and numerous corporate clients before finding his home at XDA in the spring of 2023.
He was the kid who took apart every toy to see how it worked, even if it didn't exactly go back together afterward. That's given him a solid background for explaining how complex systems work together, and he promises he's gotten better at the putting things back together stage since then.
What was your first computer?
This is probably dating me, but my first computer (and indeed the first in the family) was an Apple IIc with a monochrome screen. I remember playing games such as Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Tapper, a host of educational games from Scholastic, and the noisy dot-matrix printer.
How long have you been interested in technology?
I've always been interested in technology, and how it can be used as a tool to interact with and experience the world in a fuller way. I also run the beta versions of most software on my computer, tablets and phones, as I love seeing the new features before other users, even if it does occasionally cause issues.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I love gadgets of all descriptions, especially ones that are niche or designed for doing one specific task well. It's no secret that I also have a love for anything in aluminum, from laptops to phones and audio equipment of all descriptions.
