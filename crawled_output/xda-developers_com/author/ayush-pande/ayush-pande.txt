About Ayush Pande
Ayush Pande is a PC hardware and gaming writer. When he's not working on a new article, you can find him with his head stuck inside a PC or tinkering with a server operating system. Besides computing, his interests include spending hours in long RPGs, yelling at his friends in co-op games, and practicing guitar.
How long have you been interested in technology?
I thank (read: blame) the Dell Inspiron 8500 for beginning my obsession with technology. By my early teens, I'd turned into a hardcore PC nerd and would spend hours fixing any defective laptop or computer that came my way.
What was your first computer?
The first system I ever used was a Dell Inspiron 8500 laptop that included an Intel Pentium 4-M Mobile processor and 128 MB of memory. It served my family pretty well until 2009, when it was replaced by a Dell Studio 15. Fast-forward to 2014, and my fantasies of owning a PC came true when I assembled a gaming rig comprising an Intel i5-4670K processor and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 760 graphics card.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I've been a part of the computing world since I was a kid and have fixed my fair share of PCs over the years. So, composing troubleshooting articles and how-to guides is my forte. On the hobbies front, I'm a fan of long single-player games, especially RPGs that can take an eternity to beat.

I ran my NAS in Proxmox and set up an SMB share so my LXCs can access it
While it may sound weird, this setup works well when you have a single node and a bunch of unprivileged LXCs
