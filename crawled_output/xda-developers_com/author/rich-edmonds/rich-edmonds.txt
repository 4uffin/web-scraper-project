About Rich Edmonds
Richard is the PC Hardware Lead at XDA and has been covering the technology industry for almost two decades. He's been building PCs since young, and when not creating content, you can often find him inside a chassis somewhere.
What was your first computer?
It was a beige tower of some form or another. I recall it being a model from Tiny Computers, a British PC manufacturer. It had a small HDD that I had to carefully use as Dungeon Seige 2 would take up most of the available space, causing problems with Windows XP.
How long have you been interested in technology?
I have been interested in technology as soon as I was exposed to electronics in the late 1990s. It only grew since then with my first PC, taking technology as a subject through school and kickstarting my career with a position at a tech agency in London.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I appreciate just about everything that makes a PC work. Be it the mainboard, a processor, graphics card, storage, power supply, or even the case.
