About Victor Awogbemila
Victor Awogbemila is a tech enthusiast whose passion for tech, gadgets, and writing dates back to about two decades. His passion for writing started when he earned recognition as the best essayist in high school. Later, he ventured into creative writing, which got him featured in literary journals like Kalahari Reviews, Pink Cover Zine, Botsoso, and Bakwa.
Thereafter, he decided to venture into tech writing since it harmonized better with his background as a graduate from a university of technology. His tech guides, news, and articles have featured in The Mac Observer, HotHardware, Bravelab, Qodeca, Chapin Industries, and High Score Labs. He observes nature or watches football when he is not writing about tech.
What was your first computer?
My first computer was a Zinox Desktop computer with Windows XP pre-installed. It was a gift from my dad in 2006.
How long have you been interested in technology?
My earliest interest in technology dates back to 2001, when I realized I could create wonders with rotors and carbon zinc batteries. Exploring these components helped me understand that technology is also a form of art, and we can arrive at the same result through different methods.
What tech products or categories are you most passionate about?
I love writing about PCs, software, MacBooks, iPhones, and Android devices. Of these, I'm passionate about PCs and software. I enjoy breaking the news about cool new techs or vulnerabilities detected and reported by ethical hackers. I'm also interested in creating articles on Windows, cybersecurity, operating system updates, and how-to guides on using software, PC, or Smartphone features.
