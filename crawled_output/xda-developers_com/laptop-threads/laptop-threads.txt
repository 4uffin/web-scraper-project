It's time to say goodbye to my old laptop
Despite getting a lot of review units and having newer laptops of my own, I've been holding on to my 9-year-old laptop I bought straight out of college for all this time. I don't really use it, but it has been a decent test bed for when I need to try something risky or old.
Unfortunately, the other day, it shut off randomly while I was using it, and I've been unable to boot anything off of it, as it freezes during the setup process no matter what I do. I've opened it up to remove the SSD, RAM, and Wi-Fi card to have as spares, and it's time to say goodbye. Thankfully, some local stores have recycling programs, and if you have some old broken electronics of your own, I recommend looking into similar programs to give things a new life or ensure waste is processed properly.

An Arm-powered gaming laptop would be amazing to see
Arm-based Windows devices have improved by leaps and bounds in the last year, thanks to the Snapdragon X family of chips, but one area that's still hard to succeed in is gaming. Qualcomm's chips are capable of running many modern games, but there are far too many limitations right now.
That's why the recent report that Nvidia may be entering the fray with its own Arm-based chip is exciting. The chip would be featured in an Alienware-branded laptop, and these are two brands that know all about gaming, so I imagine there will be a lot of weight behind this product. With this kind of pedigree, I could see the push for gaming on Arm being taken to a whole new level, and Nvidia could even be leveraging some of its technology used for the Nintendo Switch 2. I may not be a PC gamer, but this would be truly groundbreaking for the Windows scene.

I hope Qualcomm's next Snapdragon X chip goes all-out
Qualcomm made waves in the PC industry just a year ago when it launched the Snapdragon X Elite chip. This SoC marked the debut of a true Arm-based powerhouse in the Windows space, after years of subpar experiences that failed to justify the price tag.
But a lot has happened since then, and now that Qualcomm has teased the next generation of Snapdragon X, I'm very excited to see what's next. The Snapdragon X Elite is fantastic, with a CPU that puts Intel to shame and competes head-to-head with the competition from Apple and AMD. But the GPU fell a little short of the competition, so that's one area I'd love to see improved. I also want even more efficiency, I'd love to have a laptop as quiet and fast as a MacBook, or a mini PC as quiet as the Mac Mini. That seems like a distant dream right now, but if anyone can do it, it's Qualcomm.

Microsoft's Surface lineup is more boring than ever
When Panos Panay left Microsoft back in September 2023, it clearly signaled that the Surface lineup was going down a much more boring route. His departure came just before a Surface event that featured what would seemingly become the last whisper of uniqueness in the Surface family with the Surface Laptop Studio 2.
Microsoft hasn't made a new Surface Studio in years, the Surface Duo lineup is clearly dead and buried, and now, it looks like the Surface Laptop Studio family has also now gone the way of the dodo. All Microsoft wants to make now are its best-selling, basic devices: the Surface Pro and the Surface Laptop. I get that this is what makes the most money, but I'm going to miss the fun era of Surface.

Microsoft's new Surface devices are disappointing and lame
Microsoft today unveiled two brand-new Surface devices with the 12-inch Surface Pro and the 13-inch Surface laptop, both powered by the Snapdragon X 8-core chip. On paper, this sounds like a great move to get Surface devices down to a lower price segment of the market, but in reality, these devices cut far too many corners for the prices Microsoft is still charging.
$799 for the 12-inch Surface Pro with a lower resolution and refresh rate, plus far worse performance and specs across the board is crazy considering you don't even get a keyboard. And for the Surface Laptop, starting at $899 for a Full HD display at 60Hz and such low-tier specs, it's arguably even worse.
I have to believe these prices are driven by the U.S. tariffs, because Microsoft has also raised the price of the existing Surface Pro 11 by $200, which helps justify the difference in specs.

Having left the Apple ecosystem, the company still manages to seduce
I've stopped using my M2 MacBook Air and iPhone 12 in favor of Android and Linux, but that doesn't seem to have stopped the allure Apple manages to conjure up with each product launch. Just when I thought we'd be at the point where the next iPhone, iPad, or MacBook wouldn't impress me, I was struck again by the impressively capable MacBook Air M4. Have you upgraded to the latest Apple gear?

I'm excited to finally see some color in the MacBook Air
Apple has just introduced the M4 MacBook Air, almost a full year after the processor itself launched inside the iPad Pro. It's a long-overdue launch that's not overly exciting for the performance upgrade itself. However, what is exciting to me personally, is the new selection of colors the laptop is available in.
Most of the colors are the same, with Silver, Midnight, and Starlight. However, Apple has replaced the boring Space Grey with a new Sky Blue color, and I absolutely love it. I've been begging manufacturers for more colorful laptops, and Apple was one of the first to go all-in on boring colors, so it's great to see that finally change. The lineup of MacBook Air colors looks pretty good now, with Midnight and Silver as the safer options, while Starlight and Sky Blue have some actual personality. I might actually be tempted to get one.

I don't actually mind Samsung's bloatware
Okay, so usually, I hate bloatware in all its forms and wipe any laptop I get to reinstall without any of it. But I've been using a Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro for the last couple of weeks, and the deluge of Samsung apps is growing on me. There are apps for quickly sharing files between my devices, and no fewer than two of them let me control my Galaxy Z Flip 5 with my mouse cursor and drag files between the two. If those sound familiar, it's because they're inbuilt features in Apple devices, but because of how Windows and Android work, Samsung has to build apps to achieve the same thing. Anyway, I'm softening my position on bloatware, as long as it isn't adding subscription-laden antivirus or other things I might never use or want. Does anyone else have multiple Galaxy devices and feel the same?

I want to see more laptops with mechanical keyboards
As someone who primarily uses a desktop, I've got plenty of nitpicks that stop me from venturing into the laptop ecosystem. Aside from the slow processors and lack of repairability, the chiclet-style keyboard is my biggest complaint with modern laptops. After switching to a mechanical keyboard, I've grown so accustomed to their tactile feedback that I can't imagine typing on a normal membrane keyboard, let alone a low-profile chiclet one. In the past, Dell and ASUS have released high-profile gaming laptops with mechanical keyboards, so it's not like there's anything stopping manufacturers from adding them to their laptop lineups. I hope we start seeing more laptops with mechanical keyboards in the budget-friendly price tier.

Any techno nomads out there?
While I'm normally a desktop user, I'm using a laptop this week, and I have to ask: Do any of you regular laptop users actually like the keyboard experience? Even on a decent chiclet-style keyboard like the one I'm using, the keys feel too far apart, and the spacebar has zero tactile feedback to help me type with confidence. Will I get used to it as I go on? Are all laptops like this or are some better? I'm not above the answer, also being, "I'm just too used to the one keyboard I've used for years."

Do you keep your laptop plugged in all the time?
As someone who works off of a laptop most of the day, I tend to be pretty mobile. I'll move around my living room with my laptop, I'll turn my chair around, or I'll even head out for a bit and work somewhere like a coffee shop. When I'm by my desk, I tend to keep it plugged in, which is better for the battery if I keep it at 100% as it then runs off of the mains. I don't always though, as I still like the freedom of being able to turn my chair around. What about you?

Dell might have done a dumb branding move but this USB-C port is super smart
Whatever your thoughts on Dell's new branding move, the company still has some smart people working there, because these replaceable USB-C ports are amazing. The "Pro" tier of laptops will feature screw-on, modular USB-C ports, so you'll be able to fix them yourself. Given how often USB ports get jostled and broken, this is a huge leap forward, turning an annoying soldering job into something as simple as unfastening two screws. The batteries are user-replaceable, too, something we always love to see.

When choosing to set up a PC, I always start fresh
I recently picked up a new MacBook Pro, and I had the dilemma of figuring out whether I want to transfer my files or start it from new. I eventually decided to start from new. Over time, things just build-up, and it's a lot nicer to start from scratch. After all, I can just copy over anything important manually. I don't need everything copied over, and it's so much nicer. What about you?

More laptops should have detachable webcams
Laptop webcams have been a problem for a few years now. Companies want to make bezels as small as possible, so the webcam quality has to suffer, but ever since 2020, the standards for webcam quality have increased a bit, so cutting too many corners is also a major issue.
I think Honor found the best solution yet (in concept) with the MagicBook Art 14. Having a camera that attaches magnetically to the top of the laptop and can be stowed away inside the chassis makes perfect sense to me, and it could allow for a slightly larger sensor to provide better image quality. Sadly, Honor fell short in terms of image quality with its implementation, but I'd love to see what can be done if a company like HP or Lenovo gave this idea a fair shot. I think we'd get something really cool out of it.

It's about time under-screen cameras came to laptops
CES 2025 is winding down, but one device caught my eye again and again. Although laptops have become boring in recent years, Lenovo often surprises me with unexpected features. The Yoga Slim 9i is the first time an under-screen webcam has been used on a laptop after being used on several notable smartphones in recent years. Lenovo must have found a way to improve the image quality here, as it has a reputation for decent webcam performance. That also means no bezels, which are a distraction around the display at best. The only concern I have is that the bezels give the screen some level of protection when closed, so this might mean more broken laptops as a result.

My MacBook Pro is the best charging hub I have
I'll preface this by saying that I travel quite a lot, but not even to other countries, simply just to friends and family. I typically bring my laptop, my phone, a couple of chargers, and maybe my Steam Deck with me, and that's it from a tech point of view. Over time, I've realized that all I really need is my laptop, my laptop charger, and my USB-C chargers to keep everything powered. That's thanks to the USB-C ports that are on my Mac, which are capable of outputting 15W or so each. It's not the fastest charger in the world, but if I'm only staying out for a day or two, it's more than good enough as I'll typically only charge my phone and my watch at night. It means I can travel a decent bit lighter with fewer plugs, and it's significantly more convenient as it means I keep everything charged with just one plug, too. If you're looking to cut down on how much you travel with, give it a try!

I wish we had more companies like Lenovo at CES
Another CES edition is currently underway, but the biggest announcements are pretty much all out there already, and it's safe to say that Lenovo pretty much won... again. I've said it before and I'll say it again, but I love that Lenovo is always willing to try something a little crazy. Most of the other companies do pretty much the same thing every year, introducing a redesign here or there, but rarely anything too out there, especially if it's a product you can actually buy.
But Lenovo surprises time and time again with cool products. Last year we had a Windows laptop and Android tablet all in one, and this year we have a laptop with an expandable display. These are concepts that almost certainly don't sell much (or they would get updated every year with new specs), but Lenovo does them just to show off what it can do, and I love that.
Heck, even some more mainstream products get cool stuff, like an under-display camera for the Yoga Slim 9i, or the dual-screen Yoga Book 9i that som

Dell's new branding is one of the worst ideas I've ever seen
When HP decided to change up its branding last summer, I was skeptical, but returning to a classic brand made some sense. Dell decided to counter HP's branding change with one of its own, and it's possibly the worst rebranding I've ever seen.
Essentially, you'll soon be seeing laptops called Dell Premium and Dell Pro Max on the company's website. You might think these are related enough, but these two machines are the farthest things from each other, being aimed at completely different markets and different tiers within those markets. Not to mention that names like XPS, Latitude, and Precision had frankly become iconic and almost anyone would recognize at least an XPS laptop.
A lineup as confusing as what Dell is aiming for is not just silly, it means it's going to be harder than ever to memorize. The names will be forgettable, and I think the strategy is going to backfire.

CES is coming — what are you most excited for?
At the start of every year, we can always count on CES to deliver a barrage of news for tech fans, and it's looking like 2025 will be no different. Rumors have been swirling about new Nvidia GPUs for a while now, and we can definitely expect a whole lot more.
Personally, I always look forward to the new laptops getting announced, especially from Lenovo, who always knows how to put on a show at CES. The 2024 edition was packed with cool products (the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is still awesome), so I can't wait to see what's in store.
What about you? What announcements are you most hopeful for this year?

Is a fanless laptop really that important to you?
I use a MacBook Pro, so I never really hear the fans spin up unless I'm really pushing laptop. However, I remember having laptops that had fans that were quiet, and laptops with fans that were loud. With news that Ventiva's ICE9 can keep laptops cool without any fans whatsoever, I'm pretty intrigued. I don't know if I'd like to go back to using a loud laptop when there are better alternatives out there, and I'm really hopeful that it works as well as the company says it does.
