Give me a lighthearted recap
The Xbox Series consoles have a lot of features that console owners can enjoy. Not only is there a large library of games to play via Xbox Live and through Xbox Game Pass, but the console can be a multimedia device for a variety of applications. However, most of the capabilities of Xbox consoles aren't limited to software that people can engage with, despite the majority of it being incredibly fun. The consoles can have accessories connected to them via USB connection to expand or enhance whatever software is being played. Whether you're going online with your friends for some multiplayer matches or relaxing at home with a good movie and some music, there are many ways to enjoy what your Xbox console is capable of. So what are the best or most interesting accessories to connect to your Xbox console's USB port? Some items enable you to play games a little differently, while others let you experience software through a different lens. And yet, others can improve upon what you have access to on the Xbox console itself, especially when you may not know what you're in the mod for at the moment. Here are six things that you can connect to the USB port of your Xbox console, and why they're so useful.

Arcade fight sticks and controllers
Switching up styles
Source: 8BitDo
With fighting games being such a massive trend these days, some players like to feel like they're playing on an arcade machine, just like they did back in the day. This has been something unique to the fighting game genre that is part of the fan culture when playing them, either competitively or casually. Because of this, multiple companies offer their own branded arcade-style controllers and fight sticks for the most hardcore fighting game players. These are often connected to consoles, like the Xbox Series X, via USB instead of Bluetooth connection. Most players feel that going with a hardwired connection via USB is the best way to stay competitive in games, since the connection via USB removes any possibility of latency or Bluetooth interference. While most of these arcade-style controllers are geared towards fighting game players, they are also meant to be used for any game that can be played as if it were on an arcade machine. Companies like Hori, 8BitDo and PDP often have arcade fight sticks available for multiple platforms, including Xbox Series consoles and the PlayStation 5. They have button setups and offer options for customization that players can take advantage of, showcasing their personality or favorite series. While not always having a specific model name, the majority of them have similar functions and extra features for players to feel comfortable when engaged in a match of their favorite fighting game. Models like the Fight Stick Alpha from HORI sport extra features like a 3.5 mm audio jack, switches to lock the Start and Select buttons, and easy access to the front frame to put customized artwork inside. For those who want to take their fighting game experience to a different level, getting a USB fight stick is a great option.

Elite controllers and gamepads
A better way to control
When a standard controller isn't enough to remain competitive, you sometimes have to get an upgrade. Recent consoles like the Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 have controllers released that are a bit more premium than what comes with their standard boxes. Elite Controllers are an expensive accessory that has extra functions that you don't find on a regular controller. This includes additional buttons on the back that can be programmed for different applications, customizable parts that can be interchanged, adjustable thumbsticks, and multiple D-pad options. Some of the modifications that can be done are focused mostly on comfort when gaming, such as the tension on thumbsticks and easier access to certain actions via the back buttons. Elite Controllers can be connected via USB to the console, often with a USB-C cable. And while the controllers can still connect to an Xbox via wireless connection, the option for the hardwired connection is still there. Most players who get competitive with games like Halo Infinite and Call of Duty: Warzone will often stick to the USB connection for quicker responses to the game, as well as eliminating any wireless interference that might happen during gameplay. Currently, Xbox has the second series of the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller as their premium option for Xbox Series X/S, which is a mild improvement on the original Elite Controller.

External hard drives
Having more storage
Source: Western Digital
Sometimes, you just need a little extra space to save all of your favorite games for later. Luckily for Xbox owners, connecting an external hard drive to the console is pretty easy. So if you're unhappy with the amount of storage space on your console, you can always go pick up a 1TB or 2TB external drive to give yourself more room. Most external drives are compatible with the Xbox Series X/S, and an update from Xbox as recent as 2025 allows for very large external drives to be compatible with the system. This includes drives that are larger than 16TB, so you're guaranteed to never run out of space when saving your games. However, there are a few limitations to connecting an external drive to your Xbox. One of the biggest is that you cannot run any Xbox Series X/S games directly from the external drive when you want to play them. This means games optimized for more recent consoles need to be started from the internal drive. So if you were planning on saving any new games to your large drive you just picked up, you'll have to keep that in mind before you go crazy downloading everything. Yet at the same time, older Xbox One games that are stored on your external drive can still be played directly from it. This can help out greatly when you still want to keep some of your favorite older Xbox titles, yet need room on your console's internal drive.

USB hubs
Getting more USB ports
Source: Anker
What if you're expecting a ton of friends over for a long session of multiplayer games and need extra USB ports for them? The Xbox consoles only have 2 ports open for whatever accessories you need to connect. This is when a USB Hub comes in handy, especially if you're already taking up space on your Xbox Series X with an external drive and other accessories. The extra slots that come from a hub can open up more options to console owners that find themselves needing to connect multiple things at a time. Almost any USB 3.0 or higher compatible USB Hub will work with an Xbox Series X/S, so it's not difficult to find one that can get the job done. A good, cheap and efficient choice among Xbox players is the Anker 4-port Ultra Slim USB 3.0 Datahub, which has enough ports to connect up to four controllers or accessories for any gaming session. Other companies like Power-A can give alternative options to people who want to make sure they're getting a USB Hub that can function properly and last for a long time.

Keyboard and mouse
When you require the big hardware
There's a lot of crossover between Xbox gaming and PC gaming. Some titles that originated on the PC platform often make the jump over to being released on Xbox Series X/S, and vice versa in different cases. But these kinds of games also offer multiple control options for players that want to feel like they're playing on a computer, rather than using a traditional controller. This is why the Xbox Series X/S is compatible with most keyboards and mice that are also compatible with current versions of Windows OS. If you're able to connect a keyboard and mouse to a computer running Windows 11 right now, chances are it will also work with your Xbox console when connected via USB. Using a keyboard and mouse on Xbox is similar to a PC, with some games and applications taking advantage of it in all the right ways. Games like Diablo IV, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Minecraft all have support for using a keyboard and mouse. But many others on the platform also have support for it as well, including games that you wouldn't expect, like Assassin's Creed: Shadows and others. But using a keyboard and mouse on Xbox also applies to navigating some of the other applications on the console, just like you would on a standard PC with Windows. Good keyboards and mice for Xbox consoles can be commonly found in retail or online via places like Amazon.

Headsets for Gaming
Lock in with your set-up
One of the most popular accessories for Xbox consoles, and most other current consoles as well, are headsets for gaming. Whether you prefer playing with an ASTRO Gaming or Turtle Beach headset, chances are you're going to connect a headset via USB while gaming. There are numerous brands that offer different kinds of USB and wireless headsets that are compatible with Xbox Series X/S, and all of them fulfill the same purpose. THe differences with most, however, come from the additional features and sound quality they offer for those who like to play games, either offline or online. Companies like SteelSeries, Logitech, Turtle Beach, and Razer all have their own selection of USB headsets that also connect via wireless connection. The best options for the console usually come down to personal preference, despite some brands being more recognizable and popular than others. Competitive players for games like Call of Duty, Halo, Fortnite, and other big titles usually go with ASTRO Gaming or Turtle Beach USB wired headsets for major events. These can be better than Bluetooth options because of wireless interference and better reaction times while mid-game. But if you want something that gives you great sound quality and comfort while gaming for a long time, there are so many options to browse through for Xbox Series X/S that can work out well.
Connected via USB
The Xbox Series consoles are solid devices that have a lot of great experiences to offer players looking for something fun. And while it can be a little confusing to find what USB accessories are compatible with Xbox Series X/S, the majority of products available are usable with the console. Whether you're someone that loves to get competitive online or just enjoy the experience alone at home, you can expand your game with many different kinds of items connected to your console's USB ports. They can expand upon and enhance what you experience with your favorite games to play, and get the most out of being an Xbox owner.
