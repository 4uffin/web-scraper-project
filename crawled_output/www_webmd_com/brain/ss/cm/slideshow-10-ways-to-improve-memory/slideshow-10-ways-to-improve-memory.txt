Nazario,Â MD on October 14, 20241/10Take Your VitaminsYou need certain nutrients to keep your memory working well. While itâs possible to get what you need through diet, supplements can make a difference if you have deficiencies. Studies show low levels of vitamin D are linked to an increased risk of dementia. And higher vitamin K levels in your brain are associated with a 17% to 20% lower risk of dementia. Taking B vitamins can slow cognitive decline. Always talk to your doctor before taking any supplements.2/10Adopt MnemonicsAsk any doctor how they made it through medical school, and youâll probably hear the word âmnemonics.â Itâs a technique you can use to boost your ability to remember something. Mnemonics can be in the form of an acronym (âHOMESâ to remember the Great Lakes: Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior), or a sentence (âEvery good boy does fineâ to remember the notes on a treble clef in music: E, G, B, D, F). It may rhyme for even easier recall (âThirty days hath September, April, June, and Novemberâ). By storing info in creative âpackagingâ like this, your brain can more easily pull up the information.3/10Challenge Your TickerYour brain needs exercise just like your muscles do. Scientists believe mental exercise may activate processes that help with upkeep of your brain cells and keep them communicating with each other. Make a point to engage your mind with activities that keep it working well, such as crossword puzzles, reading, playing games, or playing a musical instrument. Studies show crossword puzzles help keep your mind sharp, even if you start the habit late in life.4/10Choose Brain-Boosting FoodsHave you heard âeat the rainbow?â Studies show foods rich in flavonoids, the natural chemicals in fruits and vegetables that give them bright colors, help you have sharper thinking and memory. Researchers found that people with higher daily flavonoid intake were up to 19% less likely to have trouble with memory and thinking, compared to those with low flavonoid intake. Flavonoid favorites include strawberries, blueberries, peppers, celery, apples, bananas, oranges, and grapefruit. No matter which colorful fruits and vegetables you choose, aim for five a day on your plate for the most benefit.5/10Learn Something NewEven if your job or hobbies already keep you mentally active, your brain will benefit from picking up a new skill. Your brain has less plasticity as you age, meaning it can be harder to learn new things. When you take on an activity youâve never done before, you help train your brain to keep learning and build up a reserve for later on. But donât overwhelm yourself. Pick one activity to learn and dive in. Take a class and schedule time to practice. You can even become more advanced at something you already enjoy. Like golf? Take lessons and set goals. Play piano? Find a teacher and sign up for lessons. The learning process is a healthy workout for your mind.6/10Move Your Body OftenItâs no secret your body relies on regular exercise for good cardiovascular and emotional health. But your brain also gets a boost when you make physical activity a routine part of your life. Studies show adults with a high fitness level are 88% less likely to develop dementia than those with a medium fitness level, and delayed dementia onset by 11 years. In fact, the parts of your brain that control your thinking and memory are larger in people who exercise than in those who don't. Exercise can also improve your sleep and decrease your stress, both of which improve your memory, too. Thereâs no perfect exercise for memory improvement, but choose a combination of aerobic workouts like walking, swimming, or biking, and strength training with resistance bands, weights, or your own body weight. The key is to be consistent and do something you enjoy so you want to do it.7/10Have a Social CalendarSpending time with friends or family on a regular basis and being active in your community are important ways to keep up social connections and avoid becoming isolated. A study by the National Institute on Aging shows that social isolation is associated with a 50% increased risk of dementia. An easy way to increase your connections is to think of the things you already do and add a friend. If you take daily walks, find a walking buddy. If you like to read, ask a few friends to form a book group. Volunteering is a mutually beneficial way to connect with others, too. Use the skills you have and fill a need while reaping the brain benefits.8/10Forego GPS From Time to TimeYour carâs GPS helps get you where you want to go, especially if time is of the essence or youâre headed somewhere new. But a study in Nature found that using these tools can have a profound impact on your brainâs spatial memory, or the ability to store and recall information about your environment. In short, itâs good to look up and even get lost from time to time, if it means better cementing your ability to know where you are and how to get to where you want to go.Â 9/10Use Repetition and RetrievalAnother way to âtrainâ your brain into storing information is to repeat out loud (or write down) something youâve just heard, read, or thought about that you want to recall later. Repetition reinforces the connection your brain forms as you learn a new piece of information. You can also âchunkâ bigger bits of information into smaller pieces for easier retrieval. For example, think of phone numbers as three chunks of numbers instead of 10 numbers to remember at once.Â 10/10Get Your ZsResearchers link lack of sleep, restless sleep, and disturbed sleep with memory loss. If you havenât been getting 7 to 9 solid hours a night, make it a priority. Go down the sleep hygiene checklist: keep your bedroom cool, dark, and free of distractions (such as TV or phones); avoid caffeine, heavy meals, and alcohol in the hours before bed; get enough movement in the day that your body naturally wants to rest; and go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. If other issues such as snoring or sleep apnea are in the way, make an appointment with your doctor to get to the bottom of the problem and better your shuteye.SourcesUpdate HistorySharePrintHarvard Health: âMemory,â â7 ways to keep your memory sharp at any age,â âHarvard finds flavonoids linked to sharper thinking and memory,â âTrain your brain.âUSDA: âConsumption of Vitamins D and K May Keep Memory Diseases Away.âNutrition Reviews: âB vitamins and prevention of cognitive decline and incident dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.âLoma Linda University: âUsing Mnemonic Devices to Make Memorization Easier.âMayo Clinic: âMemory loss: 7 tips to improve your memory.âJournal of the International Neuropsychological Society: âAssociation of Crossword Puzzle Participation with Memory Decline in Persons Who Develop Dementia.âJournal of Alzheimerâs Disease Reports: âThe Impact of Loneliness and Social Isolation on Cognitive Aging: A Narrative Review.âScientific Reports: âHabitual use of GPS negatively impacts spatial memory during self-guided navigation.âCDC: âAbout Sleep.â View privacy policy, copyright and trust info SharePrint View privacy policy, copyright and trust info FEATURED Top doctors in , Find more top doctors on Search Related LinksBrain & Nervous System NewsBrain & Nervous System ReferenceBrain & Nervous System SlideshowsBrain & Nervous System QuizzesBrain & Nervous System VideosFind a NeurologistADHDAlzheimer's DiseaseAutismConcussionCreutzfeldt-Jakob DiseaseEpilepsyGuillain-BarrÃ© SyndromeAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)Multiple SclerosisParkinson's DiseaseRestless Legs SyndromeSpinal Muscular AtrophyStrokePoliciesPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyEditorial PolicyAdvertising PolicyCorrection PolicyTerms of UseAboutContact UsCareersNewsletterWebMD AppCorporateSite MapFor AdvertisersAdvertise with UsMarket Research Â© 2005 - 2025 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.
