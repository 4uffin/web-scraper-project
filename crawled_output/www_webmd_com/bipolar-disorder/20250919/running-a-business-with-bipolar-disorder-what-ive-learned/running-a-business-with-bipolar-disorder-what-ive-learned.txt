Subscribe Bipolar DisorderRunning a Business With Bipolar Disorder: What Iâve Learned ByEmily MendezSeptember 19, 2025Diagnosed since 2022In 2021, I built a small but amazing team and founded a boutique mental health marketing company, Priceless Copy. One year into running my business, life took an unexpected turn. I discovered a relentless drive that pushed me to stay up really late and work 80+ hours a week. I was hyper-focused on my goals.Â If Iâm being honest, this surge of energy is what propelled my business idea forward at first. At the time, I thought this change was just ambition. In reality, these were the first signs of bipolar disorder.It wasnât just excessive energy that I was experiencing. I began having pretty severe brain fog. I went to my doctor concerned about this, and he brushed it off as normal aging. Eventually, I fell into a severe manic episode. After several hospital stays, I was ultimately diagnosed with bipolar I disorder.Hospitalized and Hopeless: My Fight to Rebuild My BusinessBipolar nearly took my business â and my life â down with it. While building my company, I was hospitalized multiple times. There were many times when I could barely function due to mania or depressive symptoms. Mania left me unable to focus or follow through on simple tasks, and depression made it hard to even get out of bed.Â  Despite this, there was always a hope that I could manage a business with bipolar disorder. Founding this agency was my dream, and I wanted it to keep going. Somehow, it did.Very slowly, I was able to rebuild both my life and my business.Â How I Run a Business and Manage Bipolar DisorderRunning a business is already difficult. Bipolar definitely adds to the complexity. It took some time for me to figure out what works. But over the past few years, Iâve developed several strategies that help me run my business while also taking care of my mental health. They include:Strict boundaries around work-life balance.Â There are many times that Iâm tempted to stay up extremely late working. But I know that overworking can trigger episodes. Iâve learned that I have to maintain strict work hours. At a certain point each day, I put away my laptop. I resist the urge to respond to just one more email.Â  Therapy and medication. These are two cornerstones of bipolar disorder treatment. I know that I need these to stay well and continue to work. They are vital.Delegating to my team. I have built a wonderful team that manages to keep things running smoothly when I need a break or am hospitalized. I have to be present for my business to thrive. But I trust my team to take over during short breaks.Â Daily mood tracking. I use an app to track sleep, anxiety, and mood changes. Patterns emerge quickly. When I notice changes that signal an episode, I prepare. I reach out to my treatment team and plan ahead in case I need to take time off work.Â Life outside of work. My hobbies â dance, pickleball, and time with my cat, Lucy â bring me joy outside of work each day. This helps me stay well mentally and physically, which are essential when running a company.Â Leading With BipolarSometimes people ask if having bipolar disorder makes it harder to run a business. The truth? In many ways, yes. There are days when my brain and body simply demand rest. But it also makes me a stronger entrepreneur. Iâve learned that while bipolar disorder is part of my story, I can still build a life that I want despite it.Â Â Photo Credit: Johner Images/Getty ImagesShareShare on FacebookShare on XShare on PinterestTell us what you think of this post reactionsTell us what you think of this post?0Like0Sad0Cheered up0Empowered 0CareDisclaimer More blog posts from Emily Mendez Follow Read Full BioThe Bipolar 1 Warning Signs I Ignored Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that is characterized by dramatic mood episodes that include mania or hypomania.By Emily MendezMay 30, 2025Read MoreMore blog posts from Emily Mendez Follow Read Full BioThe Bipolar 1 Warning Signs I Ignored Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that is characterized by dramatic mood episodes that include mania or hypomania.By Emily MendezMay 30, 2025Read MoreFEATUREDPoliciesPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyEditorial PolicyAdvertising PolicyCorrection PolicyTerms of UseAboutContact UsCareersNewsletterWebMD AppCorporateSite MapFor AdvertisersAdvertise with UsMarket Research Â© 2005 - 2025 WebMD LLC, an Internet Brands company.
