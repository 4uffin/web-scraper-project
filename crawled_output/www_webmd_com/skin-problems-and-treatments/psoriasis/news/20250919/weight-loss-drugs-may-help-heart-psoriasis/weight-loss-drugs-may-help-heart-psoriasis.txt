Research shows that bothÂ obesity andÂ diabetes are more common in people with psoriasis than in the general population. âWe actively encourage discussion of GLP-1RAs as part of a whole-patient psoriasis strategy,â Merola said.Â  What the Research ShowedIn the study, researchers looked at medical records from more than 6,000 psoriasis patients with obesity or diabetes. Half the patients were on GLP-1 drugs, while the other half took other medications.Â Those on GLP-1s had a 78% lower risk of dying over the two-year period. They also had a 44% lower risk of major cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke, a 65% lower risk of alcohol abuse, and a 49% lower risk of substance abuse.Â The researchers also analyzed records from GLP-1 patients without psoriasis -- and found that the drugsâ benefits were particularly strong in the psoriasis patients. This suggests that factors beyond just weight loss or diabetes management -- such as psoriasis-related biology -- may be contributing to the effect, Merola said.Â GLP-1s are thought to reduce inflammation and calm the immune system, which is important in psoriasis because itâs linked to inflammation and skin-damaging immune activity, Merola said.Â  The effect on drinking and substance use aligns with otherÂ research suggesting the drugs may help people with alcohol use disorderÂ reduce alcohol consumption. Scientists think the medication influences brain reward circuits involved in cravings and addictive behaviors. âAlcohol use has been shown to worsen psoriasis severity [and] increase flares,â Merola said, so cutting back on drinking could translate to better disease control. That, along with overall weight loss efforts, could help reinforce healthier habits (like more consistent use of topical treatment), as well as energize patients and improve their life outlook, said dermatologistÂ Steven Feldman, MD, PhD, a professor at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, who was not involved with the study. âYou donât have to change your adherence to topical therapy very much for the topical therapyâs effectiveness to change,â Feldman said.Â Psoriasis Patients: Should You Ask Your Doctor About GLP-1s? Â While more research is needed to confirm these latest findings, you may consider talking to your doctor now about whether the medications fit your treatment plan, particularly if you also have obesity or diabetes, Merola said.No known contraindication exists between GLP-1s and biologics for psoriasis, such as IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors and TNF-alpha inhibitors, Merola said. Two studies are now underway testing these drug combinationsÂ --Â "so this integrated approach is already moving into trials.âLilly, the maker of the GLP-1 Zepbound and the injectable biologic Taltz, offers aÂ savings program when you buy both. Depending on insurance coverage, the combo may cost as little as $30 out of pocket. (TheÂ list price for Taltz is aboutÂ $7,200 per dose without health insurance.Â The price of GLP-1s can vary widely depending on insurance, butÂ Ozempic andÂ Zepbound are typically about $500 a month out of pocket.)Just remember to loop in your entire health care teamÂ -- dermatologist, primary care doctor, endocrinologist, and cardiologist. âGLP-1RAs are an adjunct, not a substituteâ for regular screenings and managing heart risks like high blood pressure or lipids, Merola said.Â SourcesSharePrintSOURCES:Joseph Merola, MD, professor of dermatology, UT Southwestern Medical Center.Steven Feldman, MD, PhD, professor of dermatology, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
