"As long as the body can do it, you can rehabilitate them."Above all, Millan stressed the importance of staying calm and quiet during training."If you want to change the behavior of a dog, practice a little bit more silence, practice a little bit more calmness, and understand how the mind of a dog works," he said. "Then you can have the best relationship with a dog."Related TopicsPetsArtificial IntelligenceSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsPregnant woman crosses street, fatally struck by car: PoliceSep 23, 3:30 PMTeens charged after social media car stunts leave 1 dead, 1 with brain damage: DASep 24, 5:07 PMNew York Liberty part ways with championship-winning coach Sandy BrondelloSep 23, 11:22 AMWhat to know about endangered gorillas and tourist tours tracking themSep 24, 12:20 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us Â© 2025 ABC News
