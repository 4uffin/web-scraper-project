(AP Photo/Rahmat Gul, file)The Associated PressJALALABAD, Afghanistan -- A Taliban crackdown to “prevent immorality” is spreading across Afghanistan, with more provinces losing access to fiber-optic internet after the country's leader imposed a complete ban on the technology. It’s the first time a ban of this kind has been imposed since the Taliban seized power in August 2021, and leaves government offices, the private sector, public institutions, and homes without Wi-Fi internet. Mobile internet remains functional, however. Officials say alternatives are being found “for necessities.”The northern Balkh province confirmed a Wi-Fi shutdown on Tuesday, with reports of severe disruption in other parts of the country. On Thursday, officials in the east and north said internet access was cut off in the provinces of Baghlan, Badakhshan, Kunduz, Nangarhar, and Takhar.Siddiqullah Quraishi, from the Nangarhar Culture Directorate, confirmed the shutdown to The Associated Press. The governor’s office in Kunduz shared a message in an official WhatsApp group. The Afghanistan Media Support Organization condemned the ban and expressed its concern.Popular ReadsCharlie Kirk leaves behind wife, 2 kids: What to knowSep 22, 10:34 AMTrump admin updates: Trump at Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 4:09 PMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PM“This action, carried out on the orders of the Taliban’s leader, not only disrupts millions of citizens’ access to free information and essential services but also poses a grave threat to freedom of expression and the work of the media," it said.Last year, a spokesman for the Communications Ministry, Enayatullah Alokozai, told the private TV channel TOLO News that Afghanistan had a fiber-optic network of more than 1,800 kilometers (1,125 miles) and that approval had been given for an additional 488 kilometers (305 miles).Most Afghan provinces have had fiber-optic services until now.Related TopicsAfghanistanSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsCharlie Kirk leaves behind wife, 2 kids: What to knowSep 22, 10:34 AMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PMTrump admin updates: Trump at Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 4:09 PMCharlie Kirk memorial updates: 'I forgive him,' Erika Kirk says of alleged shooterSep 21, 7:22 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
