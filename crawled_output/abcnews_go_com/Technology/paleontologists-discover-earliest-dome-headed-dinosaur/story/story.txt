"It is remarkable for being the oldest definitive pachycephalosaur, pushing back the fossil record of this group by at least 15 million years, but also because of how complete and well-preserved it is."Zavacephale skull.North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences During its life, the Gobi Desert was a valley dotted with lakes and surrounded by cliffs or escarpments, the researchers said.The newly discovered remains likely belonged to a small "teenaged" juvenile, measuring about 3 feet long and weighing nearly 13 pounds, said Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig, a paleontologist at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences who found the fossils and lead author of the paper, in a statement. It had a well-developed dome, suggesting it was sexually mature.MORE: New dinosaur species related to T.

The absence of early records impeded efforts to determine the origins and early evolution of the dinosaur species with dome-shaped heads."Z. rinpoche is an important specimen for understanding the cranial dome development of pachycephalosaurs, which has been debated for a long time due to the absence of early diverging or pre-Late Cretaceous species and the fragmentary nature of nearly all pachycephalosaurian fossils," Chinzorig said.Related TopicsHistorySponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsHurricane Gabrielle intensifies to major Category 4 storm: Latest path, forecastSep 22, 12:29 PMChina cancels schools and flights as it braces for typhoonSep 22, 11:01 PMMaui officials sound emergency sirens, evacuate residents as wildfire threatens townSep 23, 9:23 PMJudge weighing whether to overturn Sean 'Diddy' Combs' convictionsSep 25, 3:00 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
