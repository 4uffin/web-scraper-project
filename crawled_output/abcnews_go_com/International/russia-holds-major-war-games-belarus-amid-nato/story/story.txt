Reconnaissance, kamikaze FPV drones and bomber drones all took part, as did ground-based robots used for recovering wounded troops.Following the exercise’s finale, two drones carrying Russian and Belarusian flags hovered in front of spectators.Servicemen attend joint Russian-Belarusian military drills at a training ground near Barysaw, Belarus, Monday, Sept. 15, 2025.Pavel Bednyakov/APThe drills come less than a week after around two dozen Russian long-range drones crossed into Poland, which shares a 260-mile border with Belarus and a 130-mile border with Kaliningrad. At least three drones were shot down by responding Polish F-16 and Dutch F-35 fighters, Warsaw said.The incursion was by far the largest-ever of Russian drones into NATO airspace, a move that has alarmed allied countries and fueled fears the war is escalating and spreading. Polish and allied officials have said that the incursion was intentional.Zapad is expected to host demonstrations by Russia's nuclear forces, launches of Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles and operations related to Russia's Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile, which is a nuclear-capable weapon and has been used to strike Ukraine.NATO countries are on heightened alert. Poland has closed its border and airspace with Belarus and deployed 40,000 troops in response.Lithuania and Latvia have also closed their airspace along their Belarusian borders for the duration of the drill.Poland, Romania scramble jets as NATO ally records new Russian drone violationThe Zapad drills are taking place amid an apparent thaw in U.S.-Belarusian relations. The U.S. placed heavy sanctions on the regime of Belarus' dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine and in response to Lukashenko's brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2020. But last week, U.S. presidential envoy John Cole visited Belarus where he announced the lifting of American sanctions on the state-owned airline Belavia and stated the intention to re-open the shuttered U.S. embassy in Minsk. In exchange, Lukashenko has freed dozens of political prisoners.In perhaps a sign of the shift, two U.S. military officers attended Monday’s exercises as observers. The two Americans watched alongside attachés from states friendly to Moscow, such as Myanmar and Pakistan. The only other NATO countries to send observers were Turkey and Hungary, the latter a key Kremlin ally in Europe.Belarusian state media filmed the two U.S. officers shaking hands with Belarus' Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin."We are very glad that you have responded to our invitation," Khrenin told them. "We will show you everything that interests you."A helicopter gunship participates in joint Russian-Belarusian military drills at a training ground near Barysaw, Belarus, Monday, Sept. 15, 2025.Pavel Bednyakov/APThe Zapad -- meaning "West" -- exercises simulate a defense against an attack on Belarus by Western forces, are long-running and are normally held every two years.Popular Reads3 killed in US strike on 2nd alleged Venezuelan drug boat, Trump saysSep 15, 6:19 PMBritish politicians condemn Elon Musk's comments at anti-migrant rallySep 15, 5:52 AMNorth Korea nuclear weapons status 'irreversible,' state saysSep 15, 2:49 AMThe last time Russia held these exercises in 2021, it used them as cover to build up its troops to invade Ukraine months later. The ill-fated Russian thrust toward Kyiv was launched from Belarus, reaching the city's suburbs before collapsing under the strain of supply shortages and Ukrainian counter attacks.This year's installment is drastically diminished. Russia is unable to spare manpower from Ukraine, where its forces are prosecuting grinding offensives at multiple points along the front. Only a few thousand Russian troops are believed to be taking part in this week's drills.The 2023 exercises were canceled entirely under the strain of Russia's war.Russia this year may put the focus on nuclear weapons, including drills relating to its Oreshnik missile.What to know about 'Eastern Sentry,' NATO's response to Russian dronesRussian and Belarusian officials have framed the drills as purely defensive maneuvers.Khrenin on Monday noted the exercises were long-planned and claimed Minsk was responding to the "militarization" on its western borders, saying special attention was being paid to Poland’s troop deployment."We are demonstrating our openness, our peace-loving nature, but we must always keep our powder dry," he told journalists.Belarusian officials noted this year's exercise had been moved deeper into Belarus away from the border with Poland, a sign perhaps that the Kremlin and Lukashenko don’t want to risk undercutting the growing détente with Trump.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters last week that the Zapad drills are not directed against "any third country."A tank rolls during joint Russian-Belarusian military drills at a training ground near Barysaw, Belarus, on Sept. 15, 2025.Pavel Bednyakov/AP"This is about continuing military cooperation and practicing coordination between two strategic allies," he told reporters at a briefing. "We will continue along this course, which is by no means a secret to anyone."Still, Peskov told reporters on Monday as the drills commenced that NATO "is fighting with Russia -- that is obvious and requires no additional evidence.""NATO is de facto engaged in this war," both "indirectly" and "directly" with its aid to Ukraine, he added.The exercises appear to hint at Russia's resolve to maintain its military pressure on Ukraine and on Kyiv's foreign backers, despite the Kremlin's claimed readiness to engage in U.S.-led peace talks.U.S. President Donald Trump again pushed back any threat of sanctions on Russia over the weekend, saying he will only impose new measures so if NATO countries stop buying Russian oil and heavily tariff China.As Poland downs drones amid Russia strike, NATO braces for new era on eastern frontOne month after his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, Trump's proposed in-person meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has yet to come to fruition.Ukrainian officials, meanwhile, are continually urging the White House to deliver on its threat of new sanctions on Moscow.Trump also raised concerns along NATO's eastern frontier when he said Russia's drone incursions into Poland "could have been a mistake" -- a suggestion quickly contested by Warsaw."We would also wish that the drone attack on Poland was a mistake. But it wasn’t. And we know it," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on social media.Related TopicsRussiaBelarus ProtestsSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular Reads3 killed in US strike on 2nd alleged Venezuelan drug boat, Trump saysSep 15, 6:19 PMBritish politicians condemn Elon Musk's comments at anti-migrant rallySep 15, 5:52 AMNorth Korea nuclear weapons status 'irreversible,' state saysSep 15, 2:49 AMAlleged shooter in Charlie Kirk killing had 'obsession' with influencer: FBISep 15, 10:38 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
