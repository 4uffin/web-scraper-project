Microsoft said while it has not accessed the Israeli government's data in its review, it has found "evidence that supports elements of The Guardian’s reporting.""We do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians. We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades. This is why we explained publicly on August 15 that Microsoft’s standard terms of service prohibit the use of our technology for mass surveillance of civilians," Smith said. Microsoft said its review was based in part on information the Guardian collected from outside of Microsoft that the company "could not access in light of [its] customer privacy commitments.""We therefore have informed IMOD of Microsoft’s decision to cease and disable specified IMOD subscriptions and their services, including their use of specific cloud storage and AI services and technologies. We have reviewed this decision with IMOD and the steps we are taking to ensure compliance with our terms of service, focused on ensuring our services are not used for mass surveillance of civilians," Smith said.11:25 AM EDTIron Dome failed to intercept Houthi drone strike on Israel, IDF saysIsrael's Iron Dome failed to intercept the drone attack launched by the Houthis on southern Israel Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces said.

The cause for that has been identified, and corrective measures were implemented," the IDF said Thursday. "The Commander of the Israeli Air Force has instructed several additional steps to strengthen readiness, detection, and interception capabilities, and will provide an enhanced defensive response in the area," the IDF said.10:51 AM EDTPalestinian president calls Israeli incursion on Gaza a 'genocide'Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the Israeli aggression in the Gaza Strip a genocide and called for an end to the incursion."I speak to you today after almost two years in which our Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip have been facing a war of genocide, destruction, starvation and displacement waged by the Israeli occupation forces," Abbas said speaking at the United Nations General Assembly."What Israel is carrying out is not merely an aggression, it is a war crime and a crime against humanity that is both documented and monitored and it will be recorded in history books and the pages of international conscious as one of the most horrific chapters of humanitarian tragedy in the 20th and 21st centuries," Abbas said.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas appears on a screen as he addresses the 80th United Nations General Assembly through a video link, at the U.N. headquarters in New York City, September 25, 2025.Jeenah Moon/ReutersA committee has began its work to draft a constitution for the state of Palestine as a nation-state and that will be completed within three months.
