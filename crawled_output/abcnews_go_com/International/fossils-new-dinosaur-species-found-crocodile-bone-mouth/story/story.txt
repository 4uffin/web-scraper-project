The set of fossils included much of the skull, fore and hind limbs, ribs and vertebrae, and included a fossilized bone of a crocodile leg pressed against its lower jaws.MORE: New iguanodontian dinosaur discovered in PortugalThe individual likely lived between 66 million and 70 million years ago during the Cretaceous period, making it one of the most recently surviving species of megaraptorans, according to the paper.Joaquinraptor bones found in the quarry.Marcelo Luna, Lab.

J. casali likely lived in a humid floodplain climate, based on sedimentary evidence, the researchers said.MORE: New massive dinosaur measuring at 39 feet discovered in ChinaThe presence of the crocodile bone within the fossils offer clues to the feeding behaviors of J. casali, suggesting that it may have been the apex predator of the region, the scientists hypothesized.Joaquinraptor skeletal reconstruction.T.K. Robinson and Andrew McAfeeJ. casali and other megaraptorans were likely the dominant predators in the region, according to the paper. The group went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, as did other non-avian dinosaurs.More research is needed for further insights into J. casali's ecological role and behavior, the scientists said.Related TopicsHistoryAnimalsSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTrump admin live updates: In major shift, Trump says Ukraine can win back seized landSep 24, 11:03 AMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PM'Your countries are going to hell': Trump bashes UN, world leaders in speechSep 23, 12:55 PMJimmy Kimmel to return to air on TuesdaySep 22, 4:01 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
