Following a string of national approvals more than three years after its adoption, the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies is designed to help limit the depletion of fish stocks caused by excessive fishing. The Geneva-based trade body touts the deal as its first focusing on the environment, and the first broad and binding multilateral agreement on ocean sustainability. The deal, championed by WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, formally took effect on Monday after four more countries — Brazil, Kenya, Tonga and Vietnam — adopted it. The approvals mean 112 countries are on board, clearing by one country the requirement that at least two-thirds of WTO's 166 members give formal acceptance. China, the United States, and the European Union's 27-member states are among those that have signed on, while India and Indonesia have been among the holdouts. The Pew Charitable Trust, an advocacy group, say the agreement will require countries to limit some of the $22 billion in subsidies worldwide that encourage practices by fleets that deplete fish stocks, and will create a “fish fund" that can help developing countries implement it.Popular ReadsEx-British soldier goes on trial for Bloody Sunday killingsSep 15, 12:44 AMHuge piles of rusty WWII ammunition are poisoning the Baltic SeaSep 15, 8:11 AMMalawi counts votes in presidential election where economic turmoil is the top issueSep 16, 12:32 AMOnly part of the agreement — focusing on subsidies for illegal fishing and overfished stocks — has taken effect. A second part, which concentrates on subsidies that produce overcapacity in the large-scale fishing industry, such as for building ships, has not been finalized. The economic reason that the second part is important is because the more that the world's fleets have ships to fish, the lower those ships will cost — making it cheaper and more appealing to fish on a large scale and thus further threaten global fish stocks. Experts hope the first approval will build momentum for the second part.Oceana, a top advocacy group devoted to ocean conservation, says that fish populations were already declining because of overfishing more than a generation ago — and today the situation is “even more dire” with some 38% of global stocks overfished. “Without fish, it’s game over for the hundreds of millions of people who depend on the ocean,” said Rashid Sumaila, an Oceana board member and head of the Fisheries Economics Research Unit at the University of British Columbia.He said the first phase of the deal “won’t stop the billions in subsidies that fuel overfishing and overcapacity," adding: "But it does create a foundation that must be built on further.”Related TopicsEnvironmentSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsEx-British soldier goes on trial for Bloody Sunday killingsSep 15, 12:44 AMMalawi counts votes in presidential election where economic turmoil is the top issueSep 16, 12:32 AMHuge piles of rusty WWII ammunition are poisoning the Baltic SeaSep 15, 8:11 AMGerman court convicts suspect of murder in police killing, sentences him to life in prisonSep 16, 6:59 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
