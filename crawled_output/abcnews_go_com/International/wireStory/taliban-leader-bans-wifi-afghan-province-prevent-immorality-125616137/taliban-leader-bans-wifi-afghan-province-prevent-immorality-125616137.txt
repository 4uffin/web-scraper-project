(AP Photo/Rahmat Gul, file)The Associated PressJALALABAD, Afghanistan -- JALALABAD, Afghanistan (AP) — The Taliban leader banned fibre optic internet in an Afghan province to “prevent immorality,” a spokesman for the administration said Tuesday.It’s the first time a ban of this kind has been imposed since the Taliban seized power in August 2021, and leaves government offices, the private sector, public institutions, and homes in northern Balkh province without Wi-Fi internet. Mobile internet remains functional, however.Haji Attaullah Zaid, a provincial government spokesman, said there was no longer cable internet access in Balkh by order of a “complete ban” from the leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.“This measure was taken to prevent immorality, and an alternative will be built within the country for necessities,” Zaid told The Associated Press. He gave no further information, including why Balkh was chosen for the ban or if the shutdown would spread to other provinces.One Balkh resident noticed connectivity issues a few days ago at home and contacted his service provider, which said it was a technical issue that would be resolved.“Blocking the internet is beyond my comprehension in such an advanced era,” said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of Taliban reprisals. He told The Associated Press that he rarely used mobile internet because it was slow and expensive. There were six people in his household, including a student, and they all used and needed Wi-Fi.

I might have to move from Mazar-e-Sharif (the capital of Balkh) to another province because I cannot afford the loss.”Afghan authorities sometimes suspend the mobile phone network for security reasons, usually during religious festivals, to prevent detonations of explosive devices.—Associated Press writer Abdul Qahar Afghan in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.Related TopicsAfghanistanSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsHaitians yearn for home as gangs welcome them and police warn it's too dangerousSep 16, 1:24 AMJapan's most sacred Shinto shrine has been rebuilt every 20 years for more than a millenniumSep 23, 12:02 AM'Dancing with the Stars' season 34: Everything to know2 hours agoMissing elk hunters were killed by lightning that struck nearby tree: OfficialSep 23, 1:52 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
