(AP Photo/Fernando Llano)The Associated PressMEXICO CITY -- MEXICO CITY (AP) — President Claudia Sheinbaum became the first female leader to preside over Mexico's independence celebrations in 215 years, with a message that she won’t accept foreign intervention, a significant statement as she negotiates pressure from the United States.Sheinbaum led a traditional ceremony from the balcony of the National Palace in Mexico City known as the “grito,” or “shout” in English, Monday night. It’s an annual tradition when on Sept. 15, the president rings a bell marking the call to arms during the 1810-1821 fight to win independence from Spain.Independence Day is formally celebrated Sept. 16, but the “grito” ceremony has been performed the night before for over a century.A traditional military parade followed Tuesday, and Sheinbaum reiterated that “No foreign power makes decisions for us.”In a speech before her Cabinet and thousands of soldiers, Sheinbaum added that “no interference is possible in our homeland” and although she didn’t mention any particular country, her words come at a moment when the U.S government has asked Mexico to do more to crack down on drug cartels and strengthen border security.Popular ReadsS.

But Sheinbaum insists that the actions have been carried out because they’re good for Mexico, not because of U.S. pressure.Sheinbaum took power in October as Mexico's first female president.Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsS.
