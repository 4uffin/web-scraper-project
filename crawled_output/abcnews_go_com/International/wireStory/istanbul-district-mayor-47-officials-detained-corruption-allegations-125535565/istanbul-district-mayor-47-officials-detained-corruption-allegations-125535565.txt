Be assured that, together with you, the valued residents of Bayrampasa, we will overcome these slanders and these acts of dishonesty,” Mutlu said.More than a dozen mayors from the main opposition Republican People’s Party, or CHP, and hundreds of municipal officials have been arrested in recent months for alleged corruption, including Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. The arrest of Imamoglu, viewed as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s main challenger in the next presidential elections, led to widespread protests.Popular ReadsIsrael-Gaza live updates: France, UK, Canada recognize Palestinian statehoodSep 21, 12:39 PMNepal's new prime minister urges calm after deadly protestsSep 14, 3:46 AMLuigi Mangione's lawyers say possible death penalty 'based on politics, not merit'Sep 20, 1:25 PMThe CHP says the arrests and allegations are part of a government offensive to weaken the opposition and clear the way for another five years in office for Erdogan.
