Ethiopian national Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu was found guilty of five offenses, including sexual assault, inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity and harassment.Kebatu’s arrest and prosecution prompted thousands of people to protest outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, northeast of London, where he was staying along with other newly-arrived migrants. Multiple protests targeting other hotels housing migrants followed in other British cities and towns, with some demonstrations attended by far-right activists. Prosecutors said Kebatu, 41, had arrived in England by boat just over a week before he approached the 14-year-old, attempted to kiss her and put his hand on the girl's thigh during incidents in Epping.The hearing heard that Kebatu said he wanted to be deported after serving his time in prison.

Critics say it costs taxpayers millions of pounds, while the hotels become flashpoints in communities and leave migrants feeling targeted by local residents.Related TopicsUnited KingdomSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTurkish authorities detain 13 in latest probe targeting opposition-run municipalitiesSep 23, 2:56 AMCrimes against humanity charges against former Philippine President detailed by courtSep 23, 2:43 AMNATO warns Russia it will use all means to defend against airspace breachesSep 23, 7:20 AMJaguar Land Rover says shutdown will continue until at least Oct 1 after cyberattackSep 23, 3:56 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
