Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets, particularly young people, angry about widespread corruption and poverty, while the children of political leaders, known as "nepo kids," seemed to enjoy luxurious lifestyles.The protests soon turned violent, with protesters attacking the parliament building and police opening fire, and led to the resignation of Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli, who fled his official residence.
