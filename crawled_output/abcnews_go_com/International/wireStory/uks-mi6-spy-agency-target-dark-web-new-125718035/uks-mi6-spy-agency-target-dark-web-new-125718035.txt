The platform will enable anyone, anywhere in the world who has access to sensitive information relating to terrorism or hostile intelligence activity to securely contact the U.K. and offer their services.“As the world changes, and the threats we’re facing multiply, we must ensure the U.K. is always one step ahead of our adversaries," new Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. “Our world-class intelligence agencies are at the coalface of this challenge, working behind the scenes to keep British people safe.”Popular ReadsFirst migrant flown back to France in UK's 'one in, one out' policySep 18, 8:57 AMRobert Irwin melts hearts teaching niece Grace adorable dance movesSep 22, 3:32 PM'Beefiest bruins': Fat Bear Week to crown a new heavyweight championSep 23, 9:35 AMThe portal will be available from Friday, with instructions on how to use it publicly available on MI6’s verified YouTube channel. Users are recommended to access it through trustworthy VPNs and devices not linked to themselves.“Our virtual door is open to you," outgoing MI6 chief Richard Moore is expected to say in Istanbul at the portal's launch. The launch follows a similar approach by the U.S.’s Central Intelligence Agency, which published videos on social media channels to target potential Russian spies in 2023.Related TopicsUnited KingdomSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsRobert Irwin melts hearts teaching niece Grace adorable dance movesSep 22, 3:32 PM'Beefiest bruins': Fat Bear Week to crown a new heavyweight championSep 23, 9:35 AMFirst migrant flown back to France in UK's 'one in, one out' policySep 18, 8:57 AMEducators fired after Charlie Kirk posts file lawsuits, allege free speech violationsSep 23, 5:24 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
