The platform will enable anyone, anywhere in the world who has access to sensitive information relating to terrorism or hostile intelligence activity to securely contact the U.K. and offer their services.“As the world changes, and the threats we’re facing multiply, we must ensure the U.K. is always one step ahead of our adversaries," new Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. “Our world-class intelligence agencies are at the coalface of this challenge, working behind the scenes to keep British people safe.”Popular ReadsGuinea counts votes in a referendum that could allow junta leader to run for presidentSep 21, 3:03 AMUkrainian and Russian attacks kill 3 civilians as Zelenskyy prepares to meet TrumpSep 21, 9:49 AMEU chief urges bloc members to sanction Russia's LNG exportsSep 19, 8:52 AMThe portal will be available from Friday, with instructions on how to use it publicly available on MI6’s verified YouTube channel.
