The platform will enable anyone, anywhere in the world who has access to sensitive information relating to terrorism or hostile intelligence activity to securely contact the U.K. and offer their services.“As the world changes, and the threats we’re facing multiply, we must ensure the U.K. is always one step ahead of our adversaries," new Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. “Our world-class intelligence agencies are at the coalface of this challenge, working behind the scenes to keep British people safe.”Popular ReadsTo repel Russia, Ukraine wants Western allies to invest in its defense industrySep 19, 1:11 AMRussia appeals global aviation agency's decision blaming it for downing MH17 in 2014Sep 19, 6:40 AMMagnitude-7.8 earthquake shakes Russia's far east Kamchatka regionSep 18, 6:07 PMThe portal will be available from Friday, with instructions on how to use it publicly available on MI6’s verified YouTube channel.
