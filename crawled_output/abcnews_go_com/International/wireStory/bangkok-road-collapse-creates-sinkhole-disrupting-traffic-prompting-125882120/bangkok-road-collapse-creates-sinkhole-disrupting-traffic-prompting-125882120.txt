There were no casualties but three vehicles were damaged by the collapse in Thailand's capital, Bangkok city Gov. Chadchart Sittipunt said, adding that officials believe the collapse was caused by construction work at an underground train station.Videos of the collapse showed the face of the road slowly sinking, pulling down several electricity poles and damaging water pipes. Cars tried to back away as the hole grew larger and completely severed the four-lane road. One edge of the hole stopped in front of a police station, exposing its underground structure.Popular ReadsSniper opens fire on Dallas ICE facility, killing 1 detainee, wounding 2: DHSSep 24, 6:39 PMTrump admin live updates: Trump announces new tariffs on cabinets, trucks, drugsSep 25, 4:37 PMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PMPeople were evacuated from the police station and other buildings.
