He said officials believe the collapse was caused by an ongoing construction of an underground train station.Videos of the moment of the collapse show the face of the road slowly sinking down, pulling down several electricity poles and damaging water pipes. Cars tried to back away as the hole grew larger and completely severed the four-lane road. One edge of the hole stopped right in front of a police station, exposing its underground structure.Popular ReadsUN says Trump's team to blame for nonworking escalator and teleprompterSep 23, 10:06 PMSniper opens fire on Dallas ICE facility, killing 1 detainee, wounding 2: DHS3 hours agoWhat Jimmy Kimmel said as he returned to the air after show was preemptedSep 24, 12:18 AMA nearby hospital said it would close the outpatient services for two days.
