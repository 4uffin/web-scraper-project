Regarded as president Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s main rival, Imamoglu was arrested and detained in March, triggering widespread protests.Popular ReadsDrones spotted near 4 Danish airports but authorities say no threat to the publicSep 25, 2:25 AMBritish judge sentences asylum-seeker to 12 months in a case that triggered protestsSep 23, 8:14 AM'Top Chef' champion Melissa King's recipes for shiso pea pappardelle and moreSep 23, 6:50 AMThe CHP has rejected the allegations, describing the legal actions as politically motivated efforts by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s government to undermine the opposition through judicial means.The government insists that Turkey’s judiciary operates independently, and that the investigations are solely focused on uncovering corruption.The CHP achieved sweeping victories in last year’s local elections, holding onto major cities like Istanbul and Ankara, while also making significant advances in regions traditionally dominated by Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development Party.Related TopicsTurkeySponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsDrones spotted near 4 Danish airports but authorities say no threat to the publicSep 25, 2:25 AM'Top Chef' champion Melissa King's recipes for shiso pea pappardelle and moreSep 23, 6:50 AMClimate change results in rare hybrid bird between green jay and blue jaySep 22, 4:20 PMBritish judge sentences asylum-seeker to 12 months in a case that triggered protestsSep 23, 8:14 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
