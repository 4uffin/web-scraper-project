(Carsten Koall/dpa via AP)The Associated PressLONDON -- A man in his 40s was arrested in southern England over an alleged cyberattack that disrupted several European airports in recent days, including at London Heathrow, law enforcement officials said Wednesday.The U.K.'s National Crime Agency said the suspect was held in West Sussex on Tuesday on suspicion of offenses involving the misuse of computers and was released on conditional bail. “Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing," said Paul Foster, head of the NCA’s national cybercrime unit. “Cybercrime is a persistent global threat that continues to cause significant disruption to the U.K." Starting late Friday and lasting through the weekend, airports in Berlin, Brussels and London were hit by disruptions to electronic systems that snarled up check-in and sent airline staffers trying options like handwriting boarding passes or using backup laptops. Many other European airports were unaffected.Popular ReadsSouth Dakota to replace one of the country's oldest prisonsSep 24, 12:42 PMOregon police recover partial remains of dismembered woman in 80-year-old cold caseSep 24, 7:55 AMPope identifies successor for New Orleans archbishop after sex abuse settlementSep 24, 7:12 AMThe cyberattack affected the software of Collins Aerospace, whose systems help passengers check in, print boarding passes and bag tags, and dispatch their luggage.
