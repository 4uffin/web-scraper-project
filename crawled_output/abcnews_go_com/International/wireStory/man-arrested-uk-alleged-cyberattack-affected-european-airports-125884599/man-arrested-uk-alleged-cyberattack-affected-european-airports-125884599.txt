Many other European airports were unaffected.Popular ReadsSniper opens fire on Dallas ICE facility, killing 1 detainee, wounding 2: DHS3 hours agoTrump demands investigation into alleged 'sabotage' of UN escalator, teleprompter3 hours agoSchumer mocks Trump’s negotiating skills after he backs out of meeting with DemsSep 23, 6:41 PMThe cyberattack affected the software of Collins Aerospace, whose systems help passengers check in, print boarding passes and bag tags, and dispatch their luggage.
