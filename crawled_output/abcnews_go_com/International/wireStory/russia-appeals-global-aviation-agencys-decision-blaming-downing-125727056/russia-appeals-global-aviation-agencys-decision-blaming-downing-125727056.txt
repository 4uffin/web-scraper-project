Moscow has denied any involvement in the MH17 tragedy.Popular ReadsTo repel Russia, Ukraine wants Western allies to invest in its defense industrySep 19, 1:11 AMEU chief urges bloc members to sanction Russia's LNG exportsSep 19, 8:52 AMBritain's outgoing spy chief highlights Russia, China and Iran as threatsSep 19, 9:09 AMThe Russian Foreign Ministry charged that the Montreal-based global aviation agency had failed to carry out a “comprehensive, thorough and independent” international probe into the crash and relied instead on the “highly questionable conclusions” of the criminal investigation “carried out under the auspices of an interested party, the Netherlands, and on the basis of adulterated facts that were mostly provided by another interested party, Ukraine.”“We hope that the International Court of Justice will take an entirely impartial stance on this high-profile case,” the ministry said.Related TopicsRussiaSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTo repel Russia, Ukraine wants Western allies to invest in its defense industrySep 19, 1:11 AMEU chief urges bloc members to sanction Russia's LNG exportsSep 19, 8:52 AMChina says it wants to protect coral reefs in South China Sea.
