Moscow has denied any involvement in the MH17 tragedy.Popular ReadsDefense in Vatican 'trial of the century' asks prosecutor to recuse himself for questionable conductSep 22, 8:48 AMTo repel Russia, Ukraine wants Western allies to invest in its defense industrySep 19, 1:11 AMTrump says he will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Ben CarsonSep 20, 10:13 PMThe Russian Foreign Ministry charged that the Montreal-based global aviation agency had failed to carry out a “comprehensive, thorough and independent” international probe into the crash and relied instead on the “highly questionable conclusions” of the criminal investigation “carried out under the auspices of an interested party, the Netherlands, and on the basis of adulterated facts that were mostly provided by another interested party, Ukraine.”“We hope that the International Court of Justice will take an entirely impartial stance on this high-profile case,” the ministry said.Related TopicsRussiaSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsDefense in Vatican 'trial of the century' asks prosecutor to recuse himself for questionable conductSep 22, 8:48 AMTrump says he will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Ben CarsonSep 20, 10:13 PMTo repel Russia, Ukraine wants Western allies to invest in its defense industrySep 19, 1:11 AMDozens arrested and hurt in clashes with police near Philippine presidential palaceSep 21, 1:39 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
