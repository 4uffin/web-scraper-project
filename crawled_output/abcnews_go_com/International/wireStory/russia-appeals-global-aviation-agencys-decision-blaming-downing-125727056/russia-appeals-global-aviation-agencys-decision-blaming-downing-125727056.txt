Moscow has denied any involvement in the MH17 tragedy.Popular ReadsParis court rules former President Sarkozy will have to go to prison even if he appealsSep 25, 3:17 AMMoldovan prime minister accuses Russia of using country's election to 'take power'Sep 24, 9:19 AMEU chief urges bloc members to sanction Russia's LNG exportsSep 19, 8:52 AMThe Russian Foreign Ministry charged that the Montreal-based global aviation agency had failed to carry out a “comprehensive, thorough and independent” international probe into the crash and relied instead on the “highly questionable conclusions” of the criminal investigation “carried out under the auspices of an interested party, the Netherlands, and on the basis of adulterated facts that were mostly provided by another interested party, Ukraine.”“We hope that the International Court of Justice will take an entirely impartial stance on this high-profile case,” the ministry said.Related TopicsRussiaSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsParis court rules former President Sarkozy will have to go to prison even if he appealsSep 25, 3:17 AMMoldovan prime minister accuses Russia of using country's election to 'take power'Sep 24, 9:19 AMSaudi Arabia's grand mufti, Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Abdullah al-Sheikh, diesSep 24, 1:12 AMEU chief urges bloc members to sanction Russia's LNG exportsSep 19, 8:52 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
