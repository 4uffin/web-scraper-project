(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)The Associated PressTAIPEI, Taiwan -- China’s defense minister renewed threats that his country would take over self-ruled Taiwan as he opened a security forum in Beijing on Thursday.The “restoration” of Taiwan to China “is an integral part of the post-war international order,” Dong Jun told an audience of international military officials attending the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, an annual event where China aims to project regional leadership and boost military cooperation.Beijing considers Taiwan — a democracy of 23 million people that has been governed separately from China since 1949 — to be a breakaway province, and has not ruled out the use of force to bring it under its control. China puts military pressure on Taiwan by sending warships and aircraft near the island almost daily.Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te and his ruling Democratic Progressive Party reject Beijing’s assertions and maintain that Taiwan is a sovereign country whose future should be decided by its people.Dong said China would “never allow any separatist attempts for Taiwan independence to succeed” and that it is ready to thwart “any external military interference.”“The Chinese military stands ready to work with all parties to serve as a force for global peace, stability and progress,” he said.Popular ReadsLithuanian prosecutors allege Russia-linked network planned arson attacks in EuropeSep 18, 3:34 AMParis court rules former President Sarkozy will have to go to prison even if he appealsSep 25, 3:17 AMTrump administration rehires hundreds of federal employees laid off by DOGESep 23, 5:49 PMWhile not mentioning the United States by name, Dong chided “behaviors such as external military interference, seeking spheres of influence and coercing others into taking sides.” He called those a means to “plunge the international community into chaos and conflict.”The security forum comes after Beijing earlier this month held a massive military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. China’s army, the world's largest, showcased its advanced weaponry at the parade, including Chinese-made hypersonic missiles and tanks.Dong stressed the importance of upholding the “UN-centered international system” as a framework for global peace and stability.“We must defend the post-war order,” he said. “We do not intend to overturn the existing order or to create a new one. Rather the goal is to reinforce the cornerstone and pillars of the system."Related TopicsChinaSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsLithuanian prosecutors allege Russia-linked network planned arson attacks in EuropeSep 18, 3:34 AMParis court rules former President Sarkozy will have to go to prison even if he appealsSep 25, 3:17 AMTrump administration rehires hundreds of federal employees laid off by DOGESep 23, 5:49 PMIran starts rebuilding missile sites hit by Israel, but experts say a key component is missingSep 24, 5:10 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
