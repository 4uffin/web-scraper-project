There was no immediate word on injuries or arrests. Dutch media showed rioters also attacking an office of a centrist political party, D66.“Scum. You keep your hands off political parties,” the party's leader Rob Jetten said in a message on X. “If you think you can intimidate us, tough luck. We will never let extremist rioters take our beautiful country away.”A smaller group of rioters headed for the Dutch parliament complex, which is currently fenced off as it undergoes a years-long renovation.Popular ReadsThousands evacuated in Hong Kong after discovery of large WWII-era bombSep 20, 4:01 AMWoman reveals new details about relationship with dentist who killed wifeSep 19, 6:10 AMEgypt announces pardon for top activist who's spent 6 years behind barsSep 22, 8:28 AMThe violence erupted at a demonstration attended by hundreds of people, many of them wearing black and waving flags, that called for tougher asylum policies.The unrest comes weeks before an Oct. 29 general election that was called after anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders pulled his party out of the ruling coalition in a dispute over moves to rein in migration.In a statement, Wilders condemned the rioters for blocking a highway and attacking police, calling them “idiots” and “scum.”Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsThousands evacuated in Hong Kong after discovery of large WWII-era bombSep 20, 4:01 AMWoman reveals new details about relationship with dentist who killed wifeSep 19, 6:10 AMEgypt announces pardon for top activist who's spent 6 years behind barsSep 22, 8:28 AMMilitary-run Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger pull out of key international courtSep 23, 3:45 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
