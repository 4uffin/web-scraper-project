(Daniel Karmann/dpa via AP, File)The Associated PressBERLIN -- Air force fighter jets from Germany and Sweden were scrambled Sunday to intercept and track a Russian surveillance plane that was flying unidentified over the Baltic Sea, military officials said. Two Swedish Gripen jets and two German Eurofighter jets deployed in international airspace to monitor and photograph the Russian IL-20 reconnaissance aircraft. It had been flying without providing a flight path or radio contact that could signal its presence, Swedish and German air force officials said. The monitoring, which ended without incident, came as NATO and European Union member countries have been on heightened alert for Russian military and reconnaissance activities in and around their airspace.On Friday, three Russian fighter aircraft entered Estonia’s airspace without permission and stayed there for 12 minutes, the Estonian Foreign Ministry said. That happened just over a week after NATO planes downed Russian drones over Poland and heightened fears that the war in Ukraine could spill over.Popular ReadsAustralia to overhaul comms after Optus emergency call failure linked to 4 deathsSep 22, 12:51 AMUkrainian and Russian attacks kill 3 civilians as Zelenskyy prepares to meet TrumpSep 21, 9:49 AMOn World Rhino Day, South Africa marks progress but still loses a rhino daily to poachersSep 21, 9:08 PM"Today, (Swedish) JAS 39 Gripens and (German) Eurofighters were scrambled over the South Baltic Sea, identifying and monitoring a Russian IL-20 reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace," the Swedish air force said on its X account.The German Luftwaffe said its jets had initially followed the Russian plane before handing off monitoring to the fighters from NATO ally Sweden, and then returning to Rostock-Laage airfield in northern Germany.Related TopicsRussiaSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsAustralia to overhaul comms after Optus emergency call failure linked to 4 deathsSep 22, 12:51 AMOn World Rhino Day, South Africa marks progress but still loses a rhino daily to poachersSep 21, 9:08 PMUkrainian and Russian attacks kill 3 civilians as Zelenskyy prepares to meet TrumpSep 21, 9:49 AMIran's supreme leader rejects direct talks with US over his country's nuclear programSep 23, 12:12 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
