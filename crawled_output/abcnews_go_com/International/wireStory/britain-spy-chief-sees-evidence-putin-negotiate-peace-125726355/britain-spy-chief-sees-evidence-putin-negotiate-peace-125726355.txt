(Vyacheslav Prokofyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP)The Associated PressISTANBUL -- There is “absolutely no evidence” that Russia’s President Vladimir Putin wants to negotiate peace in Ukraine, the head of Britain’s foreign intelligence agency said Friday in an outgoing speech.Sir Richard Moore, chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6 as it is more commonly known, said Putin was “stringing us along.”“He seeks to impose his imperial will by all means at his disposal. But he cannot succeed," Moore said. "Bluntly, Putin has bitten off more than he can chew. He thought he was going to win an easy victory. But he – and many others – underestimated the Ukrainians.”Moore was speaking at the British consulate in Istanbul after five years as head of MI6. He leaves the post at the end of September.During his tenure, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a war that has seen tens of thousands killed and still rages, principally in eastern Ukraine.Moore said the invasion had strengthened Ukrainian national identity and accelerated its westward trajectory, as well as pushing Sweden and Finland to join NATO.“Putin has sought to convince the world that Russian victory is inevitable. But he lies. He lies to the world. He lies to his people. Perhaps he even lies to himself,” Moore told a news conference.Popular ReadsRussia and Ukraine fire drones, missiles and bombs as Zelenskyy seeks help at UNSep 23, 5:50 AMWoman reveals new details about relationship with dentist who killed wifeSep 19, 6:10 AMTo repel Russia, Ukraine wants Western allies to invest in its defense industrySep 19, 1:11 AMHe said that Putin was “mortgaging his country’s future for his own personal legacy and a distorted version of history” and the war was “accelerating this decline.”Moore, who previously served as the U.K.’s ambassador to Ankara, the Turkish capital, added that “greater powers than Russia have failed to subjugate weaker powers than Ukraine.”Analysts say Putin believes he can outlast the political commitment of Ukraine’s Western partners and win a protracted war of attrition by wearing down Ukraine’s smaller army with sheer weight of numbers.Ukraine, meanwhile, is racing to expand its defense cooperation with other countries and secure billions of dollars of investment in its domestic weapons industry.Related TopicsUnited KingdomUkraineRussiaSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsRussia and Ukraine fire drones, missiles and bombs as Zelenskyy seeks help at UNSep 23, 5:50 AMTo repel Russia, Ukraine wants Western allies to invest in its defense industrySep 19, 1:11 AMWoman reveals new details about relationship with dentist who killed wifeSep 19, 6:10 AMTyphoon Ragasa hits Hong Kong, southern China after deaths in Taiwan, PhilippinesSep 23, 8:58 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
