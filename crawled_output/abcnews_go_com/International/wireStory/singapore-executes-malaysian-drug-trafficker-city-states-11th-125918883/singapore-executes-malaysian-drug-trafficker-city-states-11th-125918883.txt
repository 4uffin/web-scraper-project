Datchinamurthy was arrested in 2011 and later convicted of trafficking about 45 grams (1.6 ounces) of heroin into Singapore. He was to be hanged in 2022, but won a last-minute reprieve pending a legal challenge that was dismissed by a court in August.Surendran K.Nagarajan, a Malaysian lawyer representing his family, said the family was informed early Thursday that the execution due at dawn had been halted. But hours later, Singapore’s prison authorities reversed the decision, informing the family that the execution would proceed and asking them to collect his body in less than two hours, he said. No reason was given for the brief postponement.Singapore's Central Narcotics Bureau announced his execution in a statement, saying Datchinamurthy had been given the full legal process and that his petitions for presidential clemency were unsuccessful. It said the amount of drugs he carried could feed the addiction of about 540 people for a week.“Capital punishment is imposed only for the most serious crimes, such as the trafficking of significant quantities of drugs which cause very serious harm, not just to individual drug abusers, but also to their families and the wider society,” according to the statement.

He was the third Malaysian and 11th person to be executed so far this year in Singapore, up from nine executions for the whole of 2024, the activists said. More than 40 remain on death row in the city-state.Over 30 human rights and civil society groups this week reiterated calls for Singapore to halt executions. They said three other Malaysians and a Singaporean man, who had been on death row for drug offenses ranging from 7 years to 10 years, face imminent executions after recently losing their latest appeals.Singapore’s strict laws mandate the death penalty for anyone caught carrying more than 15 grams of heroin and 500 grams of cannabis. Critics say that Singapore’s death penalty has mostly snared low-level mules and done little to stop drug traffickers and organized syndicates. Singapore’s government defends it as necessary to protect its citizens.Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsAustralia's iconic beach boxes lack comforts of home but can cost more than a houseSep 24, 10:10 PM6.1-magnitude earthquake hits northwest VenezuelaSep 24, 6:44 PMA centuries-old map is returned to Mexico after it was recovered in Santa FeSep 24, 11:05 AMSeychelles holds early voting as many worry about a drug crisis and environmentSep 25, 7:26 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
