Alexander Drago/ReutersLONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised his "productive meeting" with U.S. President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, after which Trump appeared to jettison his long-held skepticism of Kyiv's battlefield ambitions.Shortly after the meeting, Trump wrote on social media, "After getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation and, after seeing the Economic trouble it is causing Russia, I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form."It was not immediately clear whether Trump's rhetorical shift would be matched with a policy pivot. But the post was met with cautious optimism in Kyiv, Oleksandr Merezhko -- a member of the Ukrainian parliament representing Zelenskyy's party and chair of the body's foreign affairs committee -- told ABC News.Trump's statement marked a dramatic pivot away from the White House's established position that Kyiv will not be able to liberate the 20% or so of its internationally-recognized territory occupied by Russian forces since 2014.Trump has repeatedly suggested that Zelenskyy will have to cede -- or "swap" -- some territory to achieve a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, telling the Ukrainian president at a fractious February Oval Office meeting, "You don't have the cards."President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during the 80th United Nations General Assembly, in New York City, September 23, 2025.Alexander Drago/ReutersWhy a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting matters -- and why it might not happenBut on Tuesday, the president appeared to have changed his tune. "With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, Nato, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option. Why not?" Trump wrote."Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years, a war that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win," he continued, suggesting Moscow was a "paper tiger" citing its battlefield failures.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov disputed Trump's comments, telling the RBC news agency on Wednesday, "Russia is not a tiger; Russia is more closely associated with a bear. There are no paper bears. Russia is a real bear."Peskov also rejected Trump's suggestion that the Russian economy was struggling. "Let's not forget that the world has entered a stage of completely unpredictable macroeconomic conditions," he told RBC."We are continuing our special military operation to protect our interests and achieve the goals" set by Putin, Peskov said. "We are doing this for the present and future of our country. For many generations to come. Therefore, we have no alternative."Trump, Peskov said, "heard Zelenskyy's version of events. Apparently, this version was the reason for the assessment we heard. We cannot agree with everything here."Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is expected to meet with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the UNGA on Wednesday.Noting that planned meeting, Peskov said that Russia-U.S. "channels of dialogue are working, we are talking to the Americans, and President Putin still highly values Trump's willingness to help, Trump's willingness to seek a solution together."A Russian soldier stands outside a school in the town of Kurakhove, in the occupied Donetsk region, on Sept. 23, 2025.Alexander Ermochenko/ReutersZelenskyy calls on US to impose 'strong' sanctions on Russia at UN General AssemblyOn Tuesday, Zelenskyy said in a post to Telegram that he was "grateful to President Trump for strong cooperation with the United States.""The president clearly understands the situation and is well informed about all aspects of this war," Zelenskyy added. "We highly appreciate his determination to help end this war."Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Zelenskyy described Trump's pivot as "a big shift, a really big shift."Popular ReadsWhat Jimmy Kimmel said as he returned to the air after show was preemptedSep 24, 12:18 AMTrump demands investigation into alleged 'sabotage' of UN escalator, teleprompterSep 24, 6:33 PMSniper opens fire on Dallas ICE facility, killing 1 detainee, wounding 2: DHSSep 24, 6:39 PMAsked if the social media post by Trump is a "game changer" for the war, Zelenskyy responded: "Trump is a game changer by himself."Zelenskyy added that he thinks the president is now aware of "more details" of what is happening on the battlefield, and suggested that U.S. intelligence on the situation is aligned with Ukraine's.Zelenskyy also said it was "good news" that Russia's economy is struggling amid the strains of its full-scale invasion, but that it was "bad news" that Moscow still has the resources to fund its war.President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the 80th United Nations General Assembly, in New York City, New York City, September 23, 2025.Evan Vucci/APAs Poland downs drones amid Russia strike, NATO braces for new era on eastern front"Trump agreed with me that Putin won't wait for the war in Ukraine to end," he added. "He will try to exploit weak places in Europe, in NATO countries, he will try to do it."Merezhko said he saw Trump's statement as a "pleasant surprise, giving some hope that he finally is starting to view Russia's war against Ukraine in a different light.""At the same time, knowing how often Trump might change his stance, we should be cautiously optimistic," Merezhko added. "What matters are his actions, concrete steps to help Ukraine, not only rhetoric, however good it might be.""Trump's statement implies that the U.S. will continue to sell weapons to the European and NATO countries for Ukraine," he added. "And also it can be inferred from this statement that Ukraine won't be restricted in the use of American weaponry in the territory of Russia."Oleksiy Goncharenko, a prominent opposition member of parliament, was less sanguine.Russian President Vladimir Putin attends an online meeting with leaders of BRICS group of states from Sochi, Russia, on Sept. 8, 2025.Vyacheslav Prokofyev/via ReutersUkraine drones attack Moscow as NATO condemns 'irresponsible' Russian incursions"Trump's statement is not about Ukraine's victory, it is about washing hands of the war," he wrote on Telegram. "He directly says: 'You deal with the EU there. I hope you succeed. Good luck to everyone!'""Obviously, right now Russia does not want to stop," Goncharenko added. "But our task is not to risk the lives of hundreds of thousands, but to be on the defense.""The reality is that we are neither losing nor winning," he continued, warning that embarking on a costly "war of attrition" would be "idiocy."ABC News' Karen Travers, Michelle Stoddart, Hannah Demissie, Mariam Khan, Anna Sergeeva and Joe Simonetti contributed to this report.Related TopicsRussiaTrump AdministrationSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsNewly appointed US attorney will attempt to charge James Comey: SourcesSep 24, 5:45 PMTrump demands investigation into alleged 'sabotage' of UN escalator, teleprompterSep 24, 6:33 PMSniper opens fire on Dallas ICE facility, killing 1 detainee, wounding 2: DHSSep 24, 6:39 PMWhat Jimmy Kimmel said as he returned to the air after show was preemptedSep 24, 12:18 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us Â© 2025 ABC News
