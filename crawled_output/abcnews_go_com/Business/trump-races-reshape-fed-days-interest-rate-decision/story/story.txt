Eccles building of the Federal Reserve Board under construction, Aug. 6, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Alex Wong/Getty ImagesTwelve policymakers at the Federal Reserve are set to take a high-stakes vote this week on the nation's benchmark interest rate, attempting to steer the economy through a stormy bout of slow hiring and rising inflation.In a highly unusual circumstance, however, two of the policymakers stand in limbo – uncertain if they will vote at all – with little more than 48 hours before the announcement.In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has moved to fire one member of the Fed's board of governors and secure Senate confirmation for another. The race to reshape the Fed comes after Trump railed for months against the central bank and its Chair Jerome Powell for declining to heed his call for lower interest rates.MORE: Charlie Kirk killing: Suspect had 'obsession' with the conservative influencer, FBI saysThe clash over the composition of the Fed board casts uncertainty over the Fed's meeting on Wednesday, where officials are expected to announce the central bank's first rate cut since December.In a social media post on Monday, Trump reiterated his criticism of Powell, saying the Fed chair "MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND."Trump recently moved to fire board member Lisa Cook, who sued Trump over her attempted ouster, saying the decision violated her legal protections as an employee at the independent federal agency. Trump said he removed Cook over mortgage fraud allegations against her.Federal law allows the president to remove a member of the Fed board "for cause," though no president has attempted such a removal in the 112-year history of the central bank.Last week, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Fed to let Cook continue serving in her role as a governor of the Federal Reserve System as her lawsuit moves through the courts.Days later, the Trump administration filed a request with an appeals court asking to remove Cook by Monday, before the scheduled vote on interest rates. In a court filing over the weekend, Cook asked the appeals court to reject Trump's bid.Last month, Trump called on Cook to resign on the same day that Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, posted on X part of an Aug. 15 letter sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of falsifying bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, "potentially committing mortgage fraud," the letter stated.In a statement provided to ABC News at the time, Cook said she learned from the media about Pulte's letter seeking a criminal referral over the mortgage application, which predated her time with the Federal Reserve.Popular ReadsSmart ways to shop Thanksgiving sales before the holiday rush hitsSep 25, 1:41 PMTrump signs memo calling for crackdown on alleged 'organized political violence'Sep 25, 5:59 PM3 killed in US strike on 2nd alleged Venezuelan drug boat, Trump saysSep 15, 6:19 PM"I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet," Cook said in the statement last week. "I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts."President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell tour the Federal Reserve's $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project, July 24, 2025, in Washington, D.C.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe Senate voted 48-47 Monday night to confirm White House economic adviser Stephen Miran's nomination to serve as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.Miran has vowed to safeguard central bank independence but said earlier this month that he does not plan to resign from his position within the Trump administration. Miran is filling a vacancy created by the early retirement of Fed board member Adrianna Kugler, whose term was set to end in January.Miran said he plans to take an unpaid leave of absence from his current role. Miran reached the decision after "advice from counsel," since his term on the Fed board would last four months, Miran said at a Senate hearing this month.MORE: Trump admin live updates: Bessent says 'framework' for TikTok deal has been reachedFive meetings and nine months have elapsed since the Fed last adjusted interest rates. The federal funds rate stands between 4.25% and 4.5%, preserving much of a sharp increase imposed in response to a pandemic-era bout of inflation.That posture is expected to shift, however. Powell recently hinted at the possibility of an interest rate cut, appearing to indicate greater concern for flagging employment growth than for rising prices.Investors peg the chances of a quarter-point rate cut this week at 96%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment.Related TopicsPresident TrumpSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular Reads3 killed in US strike on 2nd alleged Venezuelan drug boat, Trump saysSep 15, 6:19 PMSmart ways to shop Thanksgiving sales before the holiday rush hitsSep 25, 1:41 PMTrump signs memo calling for crackdown on alleged 'organized political violence'Sep 25, 5:59 PMFormer student sues University of Southern Mississippi and Omega Psi Phi over alleged hazingSep 23, 5:01 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
