(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)The Associated PressMCLEAN, Va. -- The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage ticked up this week, ending a four-week slide that brought down borrowing costs for homebuyers to the lowest level in nearly a year.The rate rose to 6.3% from 6.26% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.08%.Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also edged higher. The average rate rose to 5.49% from 5.41% last week. A year ago, it was 5.16%, Freddie Mac said.Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors’ expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4.19% in midday trading Thursday, up from 4.16% late Wednesday.Starting in late July, mortgage rates mostly declined in the lead-up to the Federal Reserve’s widely anticipated decision last week to cut its main interest rate for the first time in a year amid growing concern over the U.S. job market.Popular ReadsTexas man facing execution for fatally beating 13-month-old girl during 'exorcism'Sep 24, 11:44 PMTropics heating up as new tropical storm forms in Atlantic: What to knowSep 25, 9:23 AMUS economy grew 3.8% in 2nd quarter, far exceeding previous estimateSep 25, 10:03 AMThe recent downward trend bodes well for prospective homebuyers who have been held back by stubbornly high home financing costs.The housing market has been in a slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. And, so far this year, sales are running below where they were at this time in 2024.This week’s rise in rates could signal a repeat of what happened about a year ago after the Fed cut its benchmark rate for the first time in more than four years. Back then, mortgage rates fell for several weeks prior to the when the Fed cut rates at its September 2024 policy meeting. In the weeks that followed, however, mortgage rates began rising again, eventually reaching just above 7% in mid-January.Like last year, the Fed’s rate cut doesn’t necessarily mean mortgage rates will keep declining, even as the central bank signals more cuts ahead.Related TopicsReal EstateEconomySponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsFewer Americans file for jobless benefits despite signs of slowing labor marketSep 25, 8:40 AMTropics heating up as new tropical storm forms in Atlantic: What to knowSep 25, 9:23 AMUS economy grew 3.8% in 2nd quarter, far exceeding previous estimateSep 25, 10:03 AMTexas man facing execution for fatally beating 13-month-old girl during 'exorcism'Sep 24, 11:44 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
