(NASA via AP)The Associated PressCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A supply ship arrived at the International Space Station on Thursday after a day’s delay due to a premature engine shutdown.Astronauts used the space station’s robot arm to pluck Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus capsule from orbit as they soared over Africa.The 11,000-pound (5,000-kilogram) shipment should have reached the space station Wednesday, three days after blasting off from Florida. But when the capsule tried to climb higher, its main engine shut down too soon. Engineers traced the problem to an overly conservative software setting.This is the first flight of the extra-large version of the Cygnus, which is packed with food, science experiments and equipment for the space station's toilet and other systems. NASA holds contracts with Northrop Grumman as well as SpaceX to keep the orbiting lab well stocked. Russia also sends supplies, and Japan is about to resume deliveries as well.Popular ReadsNASA launches urgent mission to protect GPS, power grids from solar stormsSep 22, 6:37 PM'Your countries are going to hell': Trump bashes UN, world leaders in speechSep 23, 12:55 PMUS jobless aid applications retreat to 231,000 after surging to nearly 4-year highSep 18, 8:42 AMNorthrop Grumman named its latest capsule the S.S.
