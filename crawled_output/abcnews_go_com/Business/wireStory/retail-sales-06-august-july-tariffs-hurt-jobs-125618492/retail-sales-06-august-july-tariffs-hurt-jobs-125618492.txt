(AP Photo/LM Otero)The Associated PressNEW YORK -- Shoppers increased their spending at a better-than-expected pace in August from July, helped by back-to-school purchases, even as President Donald Trump’s tariffs are starting to hurt the job market and lead to price hikes.Retail sales rose 0.6% last month from July, when sales were up a revised 0.6%, according to the Commerce Department’s report. The performance, announced Tuesday, was also likely helped by the continued efforts by Americans to keep pushing up purchases ahead of expected price increases. Moreover, higher prices could be bolstering the number as well. The increases followed two straight months of spending declines in April and May.Popular ReadsTrump admin live updates: In major shift, Trump says Ukraine can win back seized landSep 24, 11:03 AM'Your countries are going to hell': Trump bashes UN, world leaders in speechSep 23, 12:55 PMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PMExcluding auto sales, which have been volatile since Trump imposed tariffs on many foreign-made cars, retail sales rose 0.7% in August.
