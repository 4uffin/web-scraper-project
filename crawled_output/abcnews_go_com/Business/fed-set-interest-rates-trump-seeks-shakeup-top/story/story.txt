The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), a policymaking body at the Fed, projected two additional quarter-point rate cuts over the remainder of the year.Five meetings and nine months have elapsed since the Fed last cut interest rates. The federal funds rate stands between 4% and 4.25%, preserving much of a sharp increase imposed in response to a pandemic-era bout of inflation.The Fed is guided by a dual mandate to keep inflation under control and maximize employment. Speaking at a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a simultaneous hiring slowdown alongside an inflation uptick had put stress on both sides of the central bank's mandate."It's a challenging situation when our goals are in tension like this," Powell said, but he added that the balance of risks had shifted toward greater concern over the labor market."Job gains have slowed and downside risks to employment have risen," Powell said.The high-stakes announcement marks a flashpoint in the monthslong pressure campaign directed at the Fed by Trump.In recent weeks, Trump has moved to fire one member of the Fed's board of governors and secure Senate confirmation for another. Both officials were on track to be among the 12 policymakers who cast votes on the interest-rate decision, though their status remained uncertain days before the Fed meeting.Stephen Miran, a top White House economic advisor who joined the Fed board this week, cast the lone dissenting vote. Miran voted in favor of a larger half-point rate cut.MORE: Trump admin live updates: Trump says group of companies wants to buy TikTokThe race to reshape the Fed comes after Trump railed for months against the central bank and its Chair Jerome Powell for declining to heed his call for lower interest rates. On Wednesday, Powell said the Fed remains "strongly committed to maintaining our independence."In a social media post on Monday, Trump reiterated his criticism of Powell, saying the Fed chair "MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND."In recent months, the economy has suffered a sharp hiring slowdown alongside a rise of inflation, setting the conditions for what economists call "stagflation."Popular ReadsCharlie Kirk shooting suspect's conditions for surrender had to be 'gentle': SheriffSep 17, 4:48 PMTrump admin live updates: Trump at Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 4:09 PMIsrael-Gaza live updates: France, UK, Canada recognize Palestinian statehoodSep 21, 12:39 PMThe economic conditions have put Fed policymakers in a bind. If the Fed raises interest rates as a means of protecting against tariff-induced inflation, it risks tipping the economy into a downturn. On the other hand, if the Fed lowers rates to stimulate the economy in the face of a hiring slowdown, it threatens to boost spending and worsen inflation.Donald Trump points to a cost sheet as he speaks with Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell (R) as he visits the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC, on July 24, 2025.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty ImagesTrump recently moved to fire board member Lisa Cook, who sued Trump over her attempted ouster, saying the decision violated her legal protections as an employee at the independent federal agency. Trump said he removed Cook over mortgage fraud allegations against her.Federal law allows the president to remove a member of the Fed board "for cause," though no president has attempted such a removal in the 112-year history of the central bank.Last week, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Fed to let Cook continue serving in her role as a governor of the Federal Reserve System as her lawsuit moves through the courts.Days later, the Trump administration filed a request with an appeals court asking to remove Cook by Monday, before the scheduled vote on interest rates. That day, an appeals court rejected Trump's bid, clearing the path for Cook to vote at the Fed meeting. Trump may appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.Last month, Trump called on Cook to resign on the same day that Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, posted on X part of an Aug. 15 letter sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Cook of falsifying bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, "potentially committing mortgage fraud," the letter stated.In a statement provided to ABC News at the time, Cook said she learned from the media about Pulte's letter seeking a criminal referral over the mortgage application, which predated her time with the Federal Reserve."I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet," Cook said in the statement last week. "I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts."MORE: Kash Patel grilled on Charlie Kirk investigation, Epstein files during congressional hearingThe Senate voted 48-47 on Monday to confirm White House economic adviser Stephen Miran's nomination to serve as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, paving the way for Miran to cast a vote on interest rates.Miran has vowed to safeguard central bank independence but said earlier this month that he does not plan to resign from his position within the Trump administration. Miran is filling a vacancy created by the early retirement of Fed board member Adrianna Kugler, whose term was set to end in January.Miran said he plans to take an unpaid leave of absence from his current role. Miran reached the decision after "advice from counsel," since his term on the Fed board would last four months, Miran said at a Senate hearing this month.Related TopicsEconomyTrump tariffsTrump AdministrationSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTrump admin live updates: Trump at Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 4:09 PMIsrael-Gaza live updates: France, UK, Canada recognize Palestinian statehoodSep 21, 12:39 PMCharlie Kirk shooting suspect's conditions for surrender had to be 'gentle': SheriffSep 17, 4:48 PMCDC panel abandons COVID vaccine recommendation, saying it's a personal choiceSep 19, 6:55 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us Â© 2025 ABC News
