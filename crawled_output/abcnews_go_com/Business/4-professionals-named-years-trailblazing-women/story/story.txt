Below are their answers, edited for length and clarity.What do you know now that you wish you knew when you were first starting out in your career?"I wish I knew earlier on that there is so much to learn from failure. As I progressed in my career, I learned that the growth I'd gain from understanding mistakes would shape me as a leader. Rather than run away or hide from mistakes, I challenged myself to lean in and to learn and reflect deeply from them. If I could go back, I'd tell myself not to fear failure. It's where some of the most meaningful insights come from."-Jessica Ling"No matter your role, you have the ability to create opportunities for others. For me, that has meant making sure underrepresented voices are included in the conversations shaping the future of technology. Who's in the room today will determine what that future looks like."-Leah Seay AniseWhat has your journey taught you about yourself?"My journey has taught me that I am stronger than I initially believed. I've learned to push myself despite self-doubt, recognizing that discomfort often signals growth."-Danielle Wallis"My journey has taught me to value real relationships. In business, and especially as women, one of our greatest superpowers is building true friendships. Don't be transactional. Deals come and go, but relationships last a lifetime. So much of success is built on the trust and connections we create."-Talia Bender SmallWhat was your "aha moment" in your career?"My 'aha moment' came while working abroad in places like Japan and Australia and leading projects across the UK, Mexico, Brazil, India, Korea and Canada. I realized the companies that thrive are the ones that deeply understand culture and are willing to learn from the people who know it best. It taught me to lead with empathy, to listen first, and to adapt my storytelling so it resonates across borders."-Leah Seay Anise"My 'aha moment' occurred earlier in my career, when I was considering an internal role that was unfamiliar to me. I was uncertain about how my skills would translate and whether I would excel in the position. A senior leader at the time advised me that feeling uncomfortable was actually a good thing because it meant that I would learn and grow in the role. Since then, I've used my comfort level as a gauge for taking on new challenges, which has helped me grow as a marketer and leader."Popular ReadsGuardians' David Fry hospitalized after being hit in face by pitch during crucial win over TigersSep 23, 8:43 PM'Dancing with the Stars' season 34: Everything to know3 hours ago'Friends' Central Perk coffee shop to open in New York CitySep 16, 3:25 PM-Danielle WallisWhat scares you the most, and how do you overcome it?"Ironically, public speaking. While I'm confident in one-on-one conversations, pitches, and presentations, standing in front of a large crowd hasn't always come naturally to me. What's helped is investing in coaching, preparing thoroughly, and most importantly, lots of reps. Like anything else, the more you do it, the more second nature it becomes."-Talia Bender Small"Feeling stagnant and becoming complacent. To push past that fear, I try to run toward the challenges, lean in when things get hard, continue to add to my learning agenda, move at pace through a changing and dynamic industry, all while keeping a long-term view of growth."-Jessica LingWere there any surprises (good or bad) along the way?"One of the best surprises has been how much mentors and sponsors can change your trajectory. They've pushed me to think differently and advocated for me in rooms I wasn't yet in. Their impact has been transformative, and it's why I now mentor a group of young women in communications and public relations."-Leah Seay Anise"My first job out of college was at a digital ad agency producing banner ads. 20+ years later, and what's surprised me the most is the trajectory that my career would take and the wide-ranging relationships I've built within this industry. I never imagined building a network around me that now feels like home."-Jessica LingWhat's the one thing you can't live without?"Post-it notes! I rely heavily on post-it notes, using them to "mind sweep" my thoughts at the end of each day. This system helps me capture ideas and tasks, preventing them from lingering in my mind overnight. It's more therapeutic than organizational. I go through A LOT of them a week."-Danielle Wallis"This is really hard! Can I pick a few? My faith, community, ChatGPT, Coca-Cola and ranch dressing."-Leah Seay AniseWhat advice would you give to other women climbing their own ladder of success?"Build a peer set. We talk often about mentors and mentees, but not nearly enough about the power of peers - the friends and colleagues who are navigating the same challenges and opportunities you are. That kind of support network is invaluable for sharing ideas, swapping best practices, and brainstorming solutions together. Don't settle for the status quo. Growth often comes from raising your hand for the project no one else is taking on, bringing new ideas to the table, and creating something that didn't exist before. That's how you accelerate your own path forward."-Talia Bender Small"The ladder is not always vertical. The ladder might be horizontal for a period of time as you collect new skills, have life changes or move companies. And the rungs aren't always going to be equidistant. There will be times in which the rungs are close and you're moving fast, and other times when it will be spread out and take time. In the end, it evens out, but the most important thing you can do is to know where you want it to take you in the long run."-Danielle WallisSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsGuardians' David Fry hospitalized after being hit in face by pitch during crucial win over TigersSep 23, 8:43 PM'Dancing with the Stars' season 34: Everything to know3 hours agoToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on bedding, coffee makers and moreSep 24, 10:39 AM'Friends' Central Perk coffee shop to open in New York CitySep 16, 3:25 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us Â© 2025 ABC News
