"I don't know if I ever figured that out, but at a certain point -- and you can guess what that point was -- I realized that in some ways we were doing a late night comedy show about loss. And that's related to love because sometimes you only truly know how much you love something when you get a sense that you might be losing it."Stephen Colbert accepts the Outstanding Talk Series award for 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' during the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards, in Los Angeles, September 14, 2025.Valerie Macon/AFP via Getty ImagesHe added, "Ten years later, in September 2025 my friends, I have never loved my country more desperately.
