"Now I know that Bruce has the best care 100% of the time. His needs are met 100% of the time, as well as our two young daughters, so I'm not going to take a vote on that."Willis' family shared publicly in 2023 that he had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, a type of dementia that impacts one's personality and may cause behavioral changes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The actor has since lost much of his ability to communicate, according to Heming Willis, 49, who has been by her husband's side since his diagnosis.Bruce Willis' wife Emma Heming Willis opens up about being his caregiver, need for more supportHeming Willis said she anticipated that speaking about her family's living situation would invite criticism, which motivated her to share it publicly."I knew it would, which is why I shed the light on that, because I feel like caregivers are so judged, and it just goes to show that people sometimes just have an opinion versus really having the experience, and I'll say that dementia plays out differently in every household. If you've seen one case of dementia, it is one case of dementia. So you have to do what is right for your family and what is going to keep your loved one safe, as well as your young children," she said.Bruce Willis and wife Emma Heming Willis attend the "Motherless Brooklyn" arrivals during the 57th New York Film Festival, October 11, 2019, in New York City.Theo Wargo/Getty ImagesIn addition to his two daughters with Heming Willis, who are 13 and 11, Willis is also a father to three older daughters -- Tallulah, Scout and Rumer -- with his ex-wife, actress Demi Moore.Heming Willis said that for her, it was her husband's neurologist who delivered what she described as a "wake up call" to her that she needed to get more caregiving support.Bruce Willis’ wife Emma Heming Willis shares update on actor's healthShe added that when Willis was first diagnosed, the family was given no resources, which left Heming Willis to provide much of the support to Willis on her own."Bruce's neurologist shared a statistic that sometimes caregivers die before their loved one," Heming Willis said. "That was my wake up call to realize that I need to get help, and I'm not a failure because I need help. It's OK for me to raise my hand."Popular ReadsSeth Rogen, 'The Studio' win big at Emmys: What to know about the showSep 14, 9:45 PMEd Sheeran reveals he is moving to the US with wife and kidsSep 9, 5:13 PMNepal's new prime minister urges calm after deadly protestsSep 14, 3:46 AMShe continued, "I didn't realize that. I really needed permission for someone to tell me that it's OK to get help. And that's what I hope that this book does for caregivers, that it just gives them the permission to be able to care for themselves, because if they don't, how will they be able to show up and continue to care for the person that they love?"Heming Willis' book, "The Unexpected Journey," is on sale now.Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsSeth Rogen, 'The Studio' win big at Emmys: What to know about the showSep 14, 9:45 PMNepal's new prime minister urges calm after deadly protestsSep 14, 3:46 AMChase Stokes celebrates Kelsea Ballerini's 32nd birthday with sweet Instagram tributeSep 13, 1:20 PMEd Sheeran reveals he is moving to the US with wife and kidsSep 9, 5:13 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
