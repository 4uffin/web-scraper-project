Rinse the pork in cold water. In a medium saucepan, over high heat, combine the meat, water, garlic, and salt. Bring everything to a boil, and reduce heat to medium. Cook uncovered, stirring once in a while, until all the water has evaporated, about 1 hour. Remove the garlic cloves from the saucepan and discard.2. At this point, the pork pieces will begin to render their own fat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook the pork pieces until golden, about 15 minutes. Stir often to brown evenly on all sides. Remove the chicharrónes from the saucepan and set aside.3. In the same saucepan and drippings, and over low heat, add the onion, stir and cook for about 30 seconds. Add the tomato, green bell pepper, black pepper, and the fried pork; combine well and correct the salt. Cover and cook everything for about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let it cool.4. Place this mixture in a food processor and grind until very fine, almost like a paste. Put on a plate, cover and use right away. It is important that the filling is at room temperature. If it is too cold, it will not spread evenly.5. In a shallow and large dish, combine the corn masa flour and water. Knead by hand for about 5 minutes, until the masa is moist and fluffy. If needed, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time. You can also knead the masa in your KitchenAid, using the flat beater attachment.6. Over medium to high heat, start heating a non-stick griddle or large heavy skillet. Have 1 cup (237 ml) of water ready to moisten your hands.7. Divide the masa into 8 equal small balls. Hold one masa ball in the palm of your hand, and using both hands, flatten it like a thin pancake. With your fingers, grab about 1 heaping tablespoon of chicharrón and spread evenly on top of the circle, but not all the way to the edges. To close the pupusa, bring the edges together to form a ball.8. Wet your hands, then gently press and pat the pupusa between your palms, keeping the edges thin. Flatten into a round about 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter and about ¼ inch (.6 cm) thick. Do not worry if a bit of the filling comes out. Gently place the pupusas on the hot griddle or skillet and cook for about 6 minutes on each side. Turn over often to ensure even cooking. The pupusas are ready when they puff up and turn slightly golden.9. Serve with Curtido (pickled cabbage, onions, and carrots) and House Tomato Sauce.TEXTHouse Tomato Sauce"This versatile tomato sauce is served with many dishes, including traditional favorites like Pupusas, Salvadoran Empanadas, and Fried Yuca," Maher writes. "It also makes a delicious dipping sauce. You can store it in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."Yields about 3 cupsIngredients 2 cups chopped ripe Roma tomatoes1 cup water2 garlic cloves, whole½ cup chopped onion½ cup chopped green bell pepper½ cup chopped cilantro¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder1 teaspoon ground annatto seeds½ teaspoon salt½ teaspoon dried oreganoDirections1. In a medium saucepan over high heat, combine the water, tomatoes, chicken bouillon, garlic cloves, onion, cilantro, annatto, salt, and pepper. Bring all the ingredients to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and cook for about 30 minutes. Remove from the stove and let cool. Pour the cooled tomato mixture into a blender or food processor and blend on high for 2 minutes or until smooth. 2. Return the blended tomato sauce to the stove over medium to high heat, continue stirring, and bring to a boil. Reduce flame to medium-low, cover, and cook for 10 minutes. Correct the salt, and let cool. Sprinkle the dried oregano on top before serving. It can be kept in the refrigerator for up to five days.Pickled Cabbage, Onions, and Carrots"This recipe is a must when serving Pupusas, Crispy Fried Yuca and Pork or Empanadas," Maher writes. "The sour-pickled flavor of the cabbage, onions, and carrots is a perfect complement to savory foods."Serves 6Ingredients 2 cups shredded green cabbage½ cup shredded carrots½ cup thinly sliced onion2 cups white or apple cider vinegar1 teaspoon dried oregano1 teaspoon salt½ teaspoon whole black peppercorns (optional)1 teaspoon dried chili flakes or 1 Serrano pepper, finely chopped (optional)Directions1. ​​Using a large ceramic bowl or glass jar with a lid, combine and stir all the ingredients.2.
