Prepare an ice bath in a large bowl (half ice, half water).Cook peas in boiling water until tender but still vibrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain in a sieve, then transfer to the ice bath. Stir briefly and let sit 10 minutes. Lift sieve to drain.Reserve half a cup of peas. Transfer the rest to a blender with lemon oil, shiso, garlic, and remaining 2 teaspoons salt. Blend on low to high until smooth, about 1 minute. Measure 3/4 cup puree for the pasta; store leftover in fridge up to 2 days.Make the pasta: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add a generous pinch of kosher salt. Cook pasta until slightly underdone, about 1 minute less than package instructions.Meanwhile, in a large pan, combine butter, 1/4 teaspoon salt, several turns of pepper, and 3/4 cup pea puree. Transfer pasta to the skillet with 1/2 cup pasta water. Simmer, stirring gently, until sauce tightens slightly, 30 seconds to 1 minute.Add reserved peas, lemon zest, and shiso (tear as you add). Cook, stirring frequently and adding pasta water as needed, until pasta is al dente and sauce coats the noodles, about 1 minute more. Add lemon juice and toss well.Serve pasta with dollops of burrata. Drizzle with lemon oil and sprinkle with additional pepper and flaky sea salt.Tips and tricksThis is a great way to use frozen peas, and I actually prefer frozen over fresh for this recipe. They are frozen at peak season for a reason, and I find it yields a sweet, smooth pea puree. I like leftover pea puree on toast with ricotta. Or add veg stock or coconut milk and turn it into a pea soup.You can use an variety of pasta from fresh or store bought dried papardelle, fettuccine, tagliatelle.If you can't find Japanese shiso they can certainly use mint.You can top with burrata for more richness.This can be a quick vegetarian friendly pasta, can add mushrooms or other spring vegetables: asparagus, artichokes, or ramps.Scallion Hash Browns with Crème Fraîche and Asian PearShiso pea pappardelle pasta from chef Melissa King's new cookbook, "Cook Like a King."Ashley Batz/Random HouseServes: 4 to 6IngredientsAsian Pear Sauce: 2 pounds Asian pears (about 2), peeled, cored, and sliced1 pound Fuji or Gala apples (about 2), peeled, cored, and sliced1/4 cup white sugarPinch of Diamond Crystal kosher salt1/2 cup water1 teaspoon lemon juiceScallion Hash Browns:2 pounds russet potatoes (about 4)1 small yellow onion, halved lengthwise and peeled6 scallions, cut into 2-inch julienne1 large egg2 tablespoons potato starch1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling1/4 teaspoon finely ground black pepper, plus more for sprinklingCanola oil (about 2 cups), for shallow-fryingFlaky sea saltThinly sliced scallions, for garnishCrème fraîche, for servingDirectionsMake the Asian pear sauce: In a medium pot, combine pears, apples, sugar, salt, and water.

Line a large bowl with two layers of cheesecloth. Grate onion into the cheesecloth-lined bowl, then grate potatoes into the same bowl.Gather cheesecloth around potatoes and onion and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Return mixture to a large bowl and add scallions, egg, potato starch, salt, and pepper; toss well.Line a large sheet pan with paper towels. Heat 1/2 inch oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat for about 2 minutes. When ready, the end of a wooden chopstick or spoon submerged in oil will release small bubbles.Working in batches, spoon a scant 1/4 cup of potato mixture per hash brown into the oil and gently flatten to a 3-inch round, leaving space around each one. Fry, flipping once, until deep golden brown and crispy on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a rack and immediately sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Between batches, remove any bits from the oil and allow it to reheat.Serve warm, sprinkled with flaky salt and sliced scallions, alongside the Asian pear sauce and crème fraîche.Tips and tricksYou can substitute scallion for leeks.You can substitute the Asian pear sauce for apple sauce. The sauce is my favorite, adds a nice sweetness and cold element to a hot hash brown/latke.Bring this to next level by topping these with crème fraiche, smoked salmon and caviar or trout roe.You can make a few at a time and hold in a warm oven.Make sure to use Idaho potatoes or potato with high starch and low moisture content for best and crispiest results.Later, on "GMA3," King showed us how to make two more dishes with her recipes for pork lettuce wraps and charred peaches with feta cheese.
