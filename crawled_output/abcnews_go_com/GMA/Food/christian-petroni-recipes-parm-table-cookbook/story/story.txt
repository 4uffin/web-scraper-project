Instead, you fry slices of it, then layer them into a casserole dish: fried eggplant, tomato sauce, Parmigiano-Reggiano; fried eggplant, tomato sauce, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and so on until the pan is full. Then you bake it and cut squares out of it," the recipe's intro in the cookbook states."One thing to know about traditional eggplant Parm Neapolitan-style: When you have that square block of essentially eggplant lasagna in front of you, you don't use your fork to cut it all the way through; instead, you peel layers of eggplant off the top and work your way down. It's really quite lovely. Romantic, even."Ingredients3 large eggplants1 cup kosher salt, for sprinklingExtra-virgin olive oil, for frying, plus more for drizzling3/4 cup all-purpose flour2 tablespoons freshly ground pepper1 quart 8-Hour Marinara Sauce (see below)1 chunk Parmigiano-Reggiano (the size of a large orange)1 basil plant from the supermarketSpecial equipment: a deep-fry thermometerDirectionsPeel and cut the eggplant into 1/4-inch slices. Salt and let sit for 20 minutes, then pat dry.In a heavy or cast-iron pan, add enough olive oil for a shallow fry, about 1/2 inch. Heat oil to 350 F.In a medium bowl, add the flour. Season with pepper, then lightly flour the eggplant. Fry until light golden brown.Preheat the oven to 400 F.In an 8-inch casserole dish or brownie pan, add a layer of marinara (about 1/4 inch).Arrange eggplant slices to cover the sauce. Top with more marinara, a generous dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano, and torn basil leaves.Repeat layers: eggplant > sauce > cheese > basil, until the dish is full. Leave basil off the top layer (it will burn). Instead, drizzle generously with olive oil.Bake for 30 minutes, until browned and bubbly.Allow to sit for 30 to 60 minutes before serving.8-Hour Marinara8 Hour Marinara from Christian Petroni's new cookbook "Parm to Table."Tom McGovernIngredients2 cups extra-virgin olive oil2 onions1 large carrot12 garlic cloves10-pound can peeled tomatoes1 tablespoon crushed red chile flakes2.25 ounces tomato paste (1/2 of a 4.5-ounce tube)1 tablespoon kosher salt2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon sugarDirectionsIn a heavy-bottomed pot, heat oil over medium heat.Grate onion on the largest holes of a box grater and add to the pot.

I can still remember Sunday mornings as a kid, being in my room upstairs with the door closed, and I could smell the meatballs frying in my mother's kitchen, the aroma making its way all the way up the stairs, under the door, through the sheets, and into my nose, beckoning me just like in the cartoons," Petroni writes alongside this recipe. "That's when I would get out of bed, go down the stairs into the kitchen, and pluck a fried meatball off a mappine draining it of its oil before my mother would dunk it to braise in that delicious sauce."Ingredients14 ounces white bread (not sourdough)2 cups milk2 cups finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley1 quart grated sharp pecorino (preferably Locatelli)2 large eggs1 tablespoon kosher salt2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper1 pound ground beef1 pound ground pork6 garlic cloves, mincedExtra-virgin olive oil, for fryingSpecial equipment: a deep-fry thermometerDirectionsIn a large bowl, tear the bread into small pieces.
