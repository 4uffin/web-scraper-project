Then add enough olive oil to coat the bottom generously -- don't skimp! Lay in a slice or more of bread, leaving ample room between pieces. Once the first side is well coated with oil, flip it and add more oil as needed to saturate the second side. Cook over medium-high heat, rotating and tending to the bread to ensure even browning. After 2 to 3 minutes, when the bread is browned, flip it and repeat on the other side.New York Times bestselling cookbook author shares banana bread recipeSamin Nosrat's Confit of Little TomatoesSamin Nostrat shares recipes from her cookbook "Good Things" on "Good Morning America" on Monday, Sept. 15.Aya BrackettIngredientsSweet cherry or ping-pong-ball-size tomatoesBasil leavesPeeled garlic clovesExtra virgin olive oilSaltDirectionsPlace 4 cups of stemmed cherry tomatoes or 2 pounds of little tomatoes in a single layer in a shallow roasting dish over a bed of basil leaves and a handful of peeled garlic cloves. Add about 2 cups of extra-virgin olive oil -- the tomatoes don't have to be submerged, but they should all be in contact with oil. Season them liberally with salt, give them a stir, and cook at 300 F for about 35 minutes. At no time should the dish ever boil -- a simmer, at most, is fine. You'll know the tomatoes are done when they're tender all the way through and the first skins start to split. Pull them from the oven and let them cool a bit.Serve warm, or at room temperature. Keep tomatoes refrigerated, in their oil, for up to 5 days. Toss the still-warm tomatoes and a bit of their oil with just-cooked pasta, torn basil, and marinated goat cheese or Parmesan for a simple pasta dish. Spoon confit and oil over rice or eggs, or serve as a saucy vegetable with fish, chicken, meat, or tofu. Strain, save, and reuse the oil for a second round of confit, a vinaigrette, or a truly amazing pan of Refried Beans.Samin Nosrat's Pickled OnionsIngredients1 1/2 pounds red onions (about 3)1 2/3 apple cider vinegar1/2 cup water2 tablespoons kosher salt1/4 cup sugar1 bay leaf1 dried Calabrian chile1 teaspoon dried oregano1 few black peppercornsDirectionsUse a sharp knife or mandoline to thinly slice the onions and tightly pack them in a sterilized 1-quart canning jar.In a nonreactive medium saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, salt, bay leaf, chile, oregano and peppercorns.

Cover and refrigerate overnight before using.Popular ReadsAcross the US, cities combine art, shade and education to help people beat the heatSep 12, 9:13 AMSmart ways to shop Thanksgiving sales before the holiday rush hitsSep 25, 1:41 PMPastelitos, pork pupusas, corn and cheese arepas recipes to trySep 24, 8:19 AMSamin Nosrat's Creamy Oregano DressingIngredients1/3 cup aquafaba1 tablespoon red wine vinegar1 teaspoon Dijon mustard2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil1 packed tablespoon finely grated lemon zest1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced1 tablespoon sugar2 teaspoons dried oregano, crumbled1 teaspoon onion powder1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepperDirectionsIn a liquid measuring cup or wide-mouth jar, combine the aquafaba, vinegar, and mustard.

Use one hand to generously season with salt, and the other hand to turn the chicken over. Then use your dry hand to season the second side with salt.In a medium bowl, stir together the garlic, lemon zest, and oil. Add the chicken to the bowl and stir to coat. Cook right away or marinate for up to 12 hours in the refrigerator. Bring up to room temperature before cooking.When ready to cook, prepare a grill. If using charcoal, light a fire, let the flames die down, and wait until the coals ash over. Push the coals over to one side of the grill to create a medium-high zone and an indirect-heat zone. If using a gas grill, set up a medium-high-heat zone and an indirect-heat zone.Scrub the grill grates clean, then rub the grates with a well-oiled kitchen towel. Begin the chicken over the hot part of the grill, moving to a cooler zone as needed if browning too fast, until well browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side.Transfer to a cutting board and let rest at least 5 minutes before slicing.Excerpted from Good Things by Samin Nosrat.
