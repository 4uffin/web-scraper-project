I don't want this for anybody else," Gilbert said. "I don't want them to have to find out in the ER … because I feel like there has to be something else that can be done, just so we can change people's outcomes."Ovarian cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute, refers to cancer that develops in the tissues of the ovaries, the reproductive organs responsible for multiple functions, including producing eggs and hormones.Jessica Gilbert and her partner, Harry Kershaw IV, are parents of two — 11-year-old Mia and 7-year-old Harry V.

"And ovarian cancer is really sneaky. It is a cancer that does not have one thing that is very easy to tell, 'Oh, this is definitely ovarian cancer.' And it's very slow initially, in terms of the symptoms, but then very fast growing on the inside."Doctors treat ovarian cancer in various ways, including with surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation and immunotherapy.Jessica Gilbert is receiving treatment for ovarian cancer at UC Medical Center in Ohio.Courtesy Jessica GilbertGilbert said she underwent multiple cycles of chemotherapy and surgery and is currently on targeted maintenance therapy with medications.Despite all of the immense challenges she's gone through this year, Gilbert said she's making sure to stay hopeful and prioritize what's important to her."[I] just try to be in the present and just enjoy life. I went on the roller coaster with my son a couple weeks ago … and that meant the world to me," Gilbert said. "I missed out on some things but I still was at my daughter's dance recital during chemo with my mask on, so I could be there for her."Speaking to others also living with the disease, she added, "Take care of yourself, but get out there and still live your life."Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsAmazon to pay $2.5B to settle allegations it duped customers into enrolling in PrimeSep 25, 11:35 AMWilliam Shatner breaks silence on viral hospitalization reports: Here's what he saidSep 25, 5:03 PMWomen confront ‘Golden Bachelor’ Mel Owens about his ageist remarksSep 25, 9:01 AMBaby food pouch recall expanded: Where they were sold and what to knowSep 25, 11:29 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
