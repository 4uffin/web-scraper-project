Doctors may treat this type of cancer in a variety of ways, including with chemotherapy, radiation and stem cell transplants, and for Mondek, he said another stem cell transplant ended up being his last option after undergoing chemotherapy and radiation.Dr. Nick Mondek with his wife Danielle Boyer.Courtesy of the Mondek familyMondek and his wife Danielle are parents of sons Stephen, 10, and John, 6, and during a particularly dark period in June, Mondek said he thought of his family. He also remembered a good friend who had lymphoma, another type of cancer that impacts the lymphatic system, had found a donor in his own 18-year-old son."I wasn't sure if my son would be an option, but I did bring it up to my physician," Mondek recalled. "I said, 'Could a 9-year-old who's only 70 pounds potentially get us enough stem cells to make this a successful transplant?' And that's when the conversation started."Stem cell transplant restores vision in patient who was blinded in left eye after injuryAs a doctor and parent, Mondek said starting the conversation with his young son was "nerve-wracking" but ultimately led to the best outcome."The biggest factor that I had in my brain was [that] I don't want him to feel forced. I don't want him to feel obligated," said Mondek. "So I didn't even tell him that we were down to him as our last option. I told him we were still looking at candidates and [said], 'Would you consider potentially getting tested to see if maybe you could be a donor?' And he was all for it."Mondek describes his son Stephen as "very shy" and "quiet" but altruistic and someone who is always looking out for others."Without batting an eye, he said, 'When do we go?'"

Instead, he put on a hospital gown and gave me hope," Mondek said. "I'm not just honored to call this boy my son, I am just as honored to call him my hero."Robin Roberts marks 12 years since 'GMA' return after stem cell transplantStephen told ABC News' Los Angeles station KABC that he had support from his peers as well."It feels good to do that, because all my friends are proud of me," the 10-year-old said.Both father and son are now out of the hospital, and Mondek said Stephen is doing great. The Mondek family – mom Danielle Boyer, John, Stephen, and dad Dr. Nick Mondek.Courtesy of Cedars-Sinai"Within three or four days, he was already back at baseball practice," said Mondek.Mondek said he's on a long road to a new normal, but currently, his prognosis looks promising. "They did a blood test last week for the first time to screen my blood for any of the DNA of my leukemia cells, and they couldn't find any," said Mondek. "So, as of right now, I'm still in remission, and there's no sign of cancer."Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsThe remarkable life of influencer Zuza Beine, dead at 14Sep 24, 4:33 PMWhy Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner's daughter Violet spoke at the United NationsSep 24, 7:21 PMRihanna welcomes baby No. 3 with A$AP RockySep 24, 5:13 PMFamily of man who died after riding roller coaster speaks outSep 24, 3:20 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
