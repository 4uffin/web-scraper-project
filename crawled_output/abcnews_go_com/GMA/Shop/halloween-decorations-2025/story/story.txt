Wayfair, Anthropologie, The Home Depot, Michael's, Crate & Barrel, AdobeAs Summerween comes to a close and we head into fall, traditional Halloween decorations are everywhere at tons of your favorite retailers.Stores like HomeGoods -- a favorite of Halloween fanatics on the in-person shopping prowl -- and TJ Maxx are stocked to the gills with the scary goods, while last month, Michaels dropped a totally unique "Alice in Wonderland"-themed line that's great for Halloween or year-round dark decor, a trend that popular ghost tour company Ghost City Tours told "GMA" is "no longer seasonal," but rather "mainstream" and perfect for "haunted lifestyle devotees ... creating year-round communities."For those looking to entertain this season, Anthropologie's Halloween line is always a hit. A spike in Google search activity for the brand's Halloween wares shows collectors are back for more in 2025 as the store's partner brand, Terrain, unveils a host of adorable creepy creatures, glassware and more for the holiday.And speaking of glassware, beverage company Angry Orchard recently dropped a Jason Universe short film titled "Sweet Revenge" to celebrate its seasonal hard cider offerings, including a blood orange cider emblazoned with the "Friday the 13th" killer's haunting masked face. You can watch the latest installment in the franchise -- the first in 16 years -- on YouTube.Some of the most special pieces you can invest in this year come from fine China purveyors Lenox, whose Peanuts "Welcome Great Pumpkin" figure and Halloween tree are two instant classic additions to your collection that will continue to charm and delight the whole family each year when you pull them out to display.Disney's new Haunted Mansion collection is here: Shop Halloween home decor and moreLooking to decorate your yard?

New additions to the family include Skelly's new 5-foot-long cat and a 6.5-foot Ultra Skelly, who has animated eyes that give him a lifelike appearance and, in a special app, 30 programmable recordings using various voices, so he can hand out eerie greetings to every trick-or-treater.Of course, the epicenter of everything Halloween related, Spirit Halloween, has made its official return for the 2025 season with physical store openings and online offerings ready to be shipped straight to your door. One exciting update to Spirit Halloween's offerings is the first-ever Jack the Reaper animatronic, which is modeled after the store's famous mascot and stands an impressive 7.5 feet tall.Shop all of this and much more below, and check back as we continue to add to the Halloween 2025 offerings throughout the season!By clicking on these shopping links, visitors will leave ABCNews.com and Goodmorningamerica.com, and these e-commerce sites are operated under different terms and privacy policies.
