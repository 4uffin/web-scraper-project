Think cozy and expensive-looking swallow-you-up sweaters, elevated barn jackets, relaxed denim, academia-inspired blazers and riding boots or wellies as daily wear. Often overlapping with its older, more aristocratic style cousin, British Countryside, pile on these classics for a stately air while dressing this fall.Macy'sLauren Ralph Lauren Bullion Jacquard Blazer$265Macy'sShop NowUrban OutfittersHunter Original Tall Rain Boot$190Urban OutfittersShop NowTuckernuckBarbour x Tuckernuck Black Barbour x Tuckernuck Miley Quilt$440TuckernuckShop NowMadewellThe Dakota Longline Straight Jean$178MadewellShop Now37% offL.L.

Go high-end with a Aknvas Fiore cocktail dress or get luxury for less with a cashmere sweater from NYDJ for under $100. Feeling less bold? Try a splash of red with ankle boots that peek out from under your favorite fall trousers or pick up one of Old Navy's trendy new bracelet bags in Rich Red to replace your standard black carryall.10% offRevolveAknvas x REVOLVE Fiore Mini Dress$979$1100RevolveShop NowDSWJournee Haylinn Boot$69.99DSWShop NowNYDJCashmere Turtleneck Sweater$99NYDJShop Now76% offRevolveAknvas Flor Satin Button Down Shirt$108$450RevolveShop NowOld NavyRomantic Bracelet Bag$29.99Old NavyShop Now34% offAnthropologieHutch Button-Front Mini Skirt$89.95$138AnthropologieShop NowFaux furFaux fur jackets and accessories are going to start popping up everywhere in the coming months, as we saw on the Autumn/Winter 2025 runways during various Fashion Weeks earlier this year. Get in on the trend now with the Karl Lagerfeld Paris leopard jacket below -- a classic motif that's spent multiple seasons on an upward trajectory -- or go super bold with a red, fluffy bucket hat that instantly turns up the heat on any cool weather ensemble. If that's still too bold, try just a touch of fluff with a faux fur bag charm that recalls Lagerfeld's infamous Fendi monster bag charms from 2014.Macy'sKARL LAGERFELD PARIS Women's Leopard-Print Faux-Fur Coat$350Macy'sShop NowUrban OutfittersFluffy Faux Fur Bucket Hat$30Urban OutfittersShop NowAnthropologieFaux-Fur Beaded Bag Charm$48AnthropologieShop NowSilk and satinThe silk/satin skirt trend has been holding strong throughout this decade, allowing well-heeled dressers to add pumps and a beautiful blouse for an upscale vibe or throw on sneakers and a tee for a casual but elevated feel. Those skirts have moved from "trendy" to "staple" territory, but try the fabrics in a variety of other pieces as well, like a gorgeous Elie Tahari silk button-down that's well worth the investment, thanks to impeccable tailoring and a soft, alluring sheen, or a classic silk or satin scarf that looks fantastic tied at the waist, neck or around the handle of your handbag.Elie TahariSilk Button Down Shirt$298Elie TahariShop NowAnthropologieLarge Satin Polka Dot Scarf$40AnthropologieShop NowDSWKelly & Katie 3D Flower Satin Satchel$39.99DSWShop NowTransitional jacketsFor a more detailed breakdown of what jackets to shop, make sure to read our roundup of the best fall jackets broken down by category. In addition to the beauties recommended there, here are some more trends to browse that work great for layering as the warm weather winds down including oversized bombers, stylish windbreakers, a cropped tweed number with faux leather pockets, and a quilted chambray topper that offers a twist on the standard denim layering piece. And don't miss Cole Haan's picture-perfect waxed cotton jacket inspired by British countryside clothes, making it the perfect piece to fit in this category or our preppy suggestions above.Cole HaanWomen's Waxed Cotton Hunter Jacket$198Cole HaanShop NowQuince100% Leather Oversized Bomber Jacket$250QuinceShop Now30% offNordstromAlpenhaus Women's Marmande Short Windbreaker with Removable Sleeves and Branded Extendable Hood$208$298NordstromShop Now16% offQVCRM Studio x Rebecca Minkoff Plaid Tweed Jacket with Faux Leather$123.98$149QVCShop NowAnthropologieThe Hazel Quilted Chambray Jacket by Maeve$158AnthropologieShop NowEasy sophisticationDuring a recent trip to QVC headquarters to check out the brand's "Fall into Fashion" launch, "GMA" spoke with designer and TikTok superstar Carla Rockmore, whose recent collection with the brand offers relaxed sophistication that can be dressed up or down depending on the wearer's preference."I call it 'sexy with a seatbelt,'" Rockmore explained, pointing out the multiple neckline options on her Draped Jacquard Blouse. "It's a demure cut, but because of the drape and because of the shine and because of the fabrication in jacquard leopard, it's for the girl who may not want to go full-on but rather dabble in the leopard."Stacy London and Jennie Garth were also included in the lineup of designers with QVC launches this season. Standout pieces include London's green leopard velvet blazer, a structured, eye-catching top layer that offers plenty of stretch for comfort, and Garth's Laurel Plaid Blouse with a waist-cinching tie that can be adjusted to create the shape you want.10% offQVCCarla Rockmore Collection Draped Jacquard Blouse$69.98$78QVCShop Now9% offQVCby Stacy London Single Breasted Velvet Blazer$99.98$110QVCShop NowQVCMe by Jennie Garth Laurel Plaid Blouse with Self Belt$72QVCShop NowMixed metalsMixing silver and gold used to be considered a fashion faux pas, but recent seasons have been all about piling on both in the form of jewelry and accessories, plus adding in dashes of brass and other metals as they fit. The key to pulling off this trend is intentionality: Fully commit to the look by mixing gold- and silver-tone bracelets, mismatch your ring stacks and wear a silver stud with a gold hoop for interesting lobes. You can also take the easy route with one of our suggestions and pick a piece with multiple tones built in -- Kendra Scott's ultra chic hoops or bangles are a great place to start!And if it feels out of your wheelhouse when starting to mix metals, keep some rules in place. For example, keep the hardware in your belt, shoes and bag all the same -- let's say gold -- then add in dashes of silver like you're "seasoning" the look. It's a fantastic way to look more carefree and modern, and you won't have to agonize about changing out your wearables while putting the rest of your look together.Kendra Scott Quinn Cuff Bracelet in Mixed Metal$85Kendra ScottShop NowKendra ScottWren Hoop Earrings in Mixed Metal$160Kendra ScottShop Now30% offWhite House Black MarketMariner Links Mixed Metal Chain Belt$55.30$79White House Black MarketShop NowUp Next in Shop—'GMA' Deals & Steals for a September SpectacularSeptember 16, 202540 Boxes: Save up to 40% on Del Sol sun-changing accessories and moreSeptember 16, 2025Stylish fall athleisure from Abercrombie, Spanx and moreSeptember 15, 2025Old Navy debuts trendy handbags under $50, and celebs are wearing themSeptember 15, 2025Shop GMA FavoritesABC will receive a commission for purchases made through these links.Sponsored Content by TaboolaThe latest lifestyle and entertainment news and inspiration for how to live your best life - all from Good Morning America.ContestsTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My InfoChildren’s Online Privacy PolicyAdvertise with usYour US State Privacy RightsInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementPressFeedbackShop FAQsABC NewsABCAll VideosAll TopicsSitemap© 2025 ABC NewsPrivacy Policy— Your US State Privacy Rights— Children's Online Privacy Policy— Interest-Based Ads— Terms of Use— Do Not Sell My Info— Contact Us— © 2025 ABC News
