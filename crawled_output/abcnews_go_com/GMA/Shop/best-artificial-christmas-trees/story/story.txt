If you're not into using a real one, artificial Christmas trees are a great, reusable choice.But what are the best options for you? "Good Morning America" tapped Antoinette Boston, a holiday decor expert and pro tree-decorator, as well as Josephine Kim, Balsam Hill director of merchandising for trees and greenery, to help us find the best trees and learn how to style them.By clicking on these shopping links, visitors will leave Goodmorningamerica.com.

"Other considerations are determining the space you'll be placing your tree -- do you have the space for a small tree or a tall one?""A good rule of thumb is to have at least 6 inches between the top of your tree and the ceiling," she continued. "This also accounts for a topper or any decorative stand that adds height to the tree. So, if you have the standard 9-foot ceiling and a 12-inch angel topper, you'd want a 7.5-foot Christmas tree. We measure our trees from the stand to the topmost tip."Kim also pointed to factors like levels of realism, species, color and pre-lit trees versus unlit ones.In terms of realism, Balsam Hill offers trees ranging from traditional to most realistic."PVC needles are flat and papery while polyethylene, or PE, needles have more dimension," Kim said. "Some trees feature a combination of both -- the more realistic the tree, the higher the PE count."20% offBalsam HillBalsam Hill Vermont White Spruce, 7.5', lit, "Most Realistic"$1349$1699Balsam HillShop NowAs with finding a real tree, the experts said you should consider the species that suits your style best, from spruces to pines as well as their colors (a noble fir has a grey tint to it, for example, whereas a blue fir leans blue-green).Editor’s PicksShop the best Advent calendars of 2024: Beauty, chocolate, jewelry, toys and moreNov 11, 2024Christmas decor expert predicts the hottest holiday trends for 2023Dec 01, 2023Shop matching holiday family pajamas from Old Navy, Kohl's and moreDec 05, 2023Additionally, Boston recommended considering your intended decor."If you enjoy a heavily decorated tree, the type of tree is less important because you'll hardly see it," Boston told "GMA" in an email. "If you enjoy more tree showing, pick an option that has wispy tips that extend past the branches."How to decorate your artificial Christmas treeBoston said her favorite decorations for artificial trees are larger ornaments -- round baubles measuring 4 to 8 inches that "fill the tree quickly." Boston said she also adds ribbon for a "touch of luxury" and floral or themed stems inserted into the tree to "add a layer of dimension and fill empty spots."Additionally, Boston suggested using real or faux cedar branches throughout the tree to make it look more realistic. "The real branches will also give your tree the nostalgic Christmas tree smell," she said.As for those with a green tree who want a snowy or flocked tree instead, she recommended adding flocked stems and sprays. "This will give the illusion of a flocked tree and allow for either green or flocked in the future without having to purchase a second tree," she said.To help save time, Boston recommended buying a pre-lit tree.Related ArticlesMORE: Christmas decor expert predicts the hottest holiday trends for 2023"After purchasing lights separately, you've now spent the same amount as a pre-lit tree, and you still have to spend an hour or more stringing the lights," she said.The Home Depot9 ft.
