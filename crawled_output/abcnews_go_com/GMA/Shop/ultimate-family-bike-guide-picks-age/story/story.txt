A lightweight frame with kid-friendly geometry allows children to sit upright and ride with more control, while brakes should be simple to use and stop with precision.Parents shopping for the whole family should also think about where they'll ride together most often.Editor’s PicksThe benefits of smartwatches for kids: Expert insights and top picksJul 29, 2025The Right Stuff: Shop top back-to-school picks for lunch essentialsAug 19, 2025Shop top kids shoes for the 2025 back-to-school seasonAug 15, 2025"For neighborhood rides, school commutes, and park paths, a hybrid or comfort-style bike will suit almost everyone," Khakshouri said.Families who love trails might lean toward all-terrain bikes, while parents hauling groceries or little ones may want the extra boost of an e-bike.For kids, Khakshouri suggests sticking with pedal-only models. "Any opportunity for them to get their wiggles out and exercise is a win," he said.Even the right bike needs a proper fit. Children should be able to place their feet on the ground, reach the handlebars comfortably, and use the brakes with ease. Simple adjustments like raising the seat or angling handlebars can make all the difference.Here's a guide to help you pick the perfect bike for every rider, age by age.Get more shopGMA!

They help children master balance and steering before pedals come into play, making the transition to "big kid" bikes seamless.
