"Placing their own, and their administration's, political agendas above the constitutional safeguards assured to every criminal defendant, and especially one facing a death sentence, they serially violated the constitution, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, this court's local rules and traditional notions of fairness."The defense pointed to public statements, social media posts and television appearances by Attorney General Pam Bondi that they said made clear the decision to seek the death penalty was based on politics and not merit.In April, Bondi directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Mangione if he is convicted of Thompson's murder.Popular ReadsRussia carries out 'massive' attack across UkraineSep 20, 2:15 PM3 killed in 3rd US strike on alleged drug boat in international waters, Trump saysSep 19, 9:50 PMUS attorney resigns amid pressure from Trump over NY AG probe: SourcesSep 20, 3:20 PM"Mangione’s murder of Brian Thompson -- an innocent man and father of two young children -- was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America," Bondi said in a statement at the time."The Attorney General of the United States is telling the public that based on her personal experience as a capital prosecutor who tried death penalty cases throughout her career that Mangione is guilty and should be executed," the defense said. "In addition, she also called the incident 'an act of political violence' even though Mr. Mangione was charged in a complaint with stalking a single person who was not a politician, or an activist, and who was not otherwise engaged in politics."Meanwhile, a judge this week dismissed two state murder charges related to acts of terrorism as Mangione made his first Manhattan courtroom appearance in five months.Judge Gregory Carro tossed out first and second-degree murder charges that accused Mangione of murder as a crime of terrorism. The judge said the evidence presented to the grand jury was insufficient to support the terrorism charge.The rest of the indictment remains, with the judge refusing to dismiss another second-degree murder charge, to which Mangione has pleaded not guilty."We respect the Court's decision and will proceed on the remaining nine counts, including Murder in the Second Degree," the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said in a statement following the ruling.Mangione's next court appearance is in December.Related TopicsUnitedHealthcare CEO shootingSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsRussia carries out 'massive' attack across UkraineSep 20, 2:15 PMWhat officials found at site where Travis Decker's suspected remains were locatedSep 19, 8:25 PM3 killed in 3rd US strike on alleged drug boat in international waters, Trump saysSep 19, 9:50 PMUS attorney resigns amid pressure from Trump over NY AG probe: SourcesSep 20, 3:20 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
