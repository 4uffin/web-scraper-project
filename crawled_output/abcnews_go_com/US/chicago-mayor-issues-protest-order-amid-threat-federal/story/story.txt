"This executive action is about being proactive so that we are prepared for any possible large-scale demonstration in response to the increasingly reckless federal government."Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson speaks during a press conference amid reports of federal deployments to Chicago on September 2, 2025, in Chicago Illinois.Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty ImagesJohnson emphasized the city's long history of civic activism."Chicago remains a center of civic action, as it has been since our founding whether it's the abolitionist movement led by Chicagoans like John and Mary Jones, the uprisings for an eight-hour workday in the Haymarket era, the industrial union movement, led by the CIO, the women's rights movement, the civil rights movement and other collective actions over the last two centuries," he said to media Tuesday after signing the order.MORE: Chicago braces for expanded ICE enforcement over the weekendSpeaking to reporters earlier this week Trump discussed his plans to send federal personnel to Chicago as part of his anti-crime push after announcing he was first deploying the National Guard to Memphis.Donald Trump delivers remarks before signing a Presidential Memorandum in the Oval Office on September 15, 2025 in Washington, DC.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images"We're going to be doing Chicago, probably next," Trump said from the Oval Office on Monday.

Shapiro slams Oval Office's 'cherry picking' of recent political violenceSep 16, 5:03 PMTrump's announcement marked his latest attempt to intervene in the city's affairs, despite strong opposition from Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.The conflict intensified after Trump's Aug. 25 remarks, where he called Chicago a "disaster" and its governor "a slob," while suggesting some people might prefer "a dictator."Pritzker responded by calling Trump's proposed actions "illegal," "unconstitutional," and "un-American."In response, Chicago began preparing for potential federal intervention. On Aug. 30, Johnson signed an executive order rejecting any attempts to deploy U.S. Armed Forces or National Guard troops in the city. That order created the "Protecting Chicago Initiative," aimed at defending residents' rights.Chicago officials pointed to recent crime statistics showing a 31% reduction in murders and 33% decrease in robberies compared to 2024, challenging Trump's description of the city as a "killing field."The city also launched a new website, chicago.gov/protect, providing resources for residents planning peaceful protests and updates about federal intervention.Related TopicsChicagoSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular Reads6 children, including infant, locked in Milwaukee storage unit: PoliceSep 16, 5:30 PMGov.
