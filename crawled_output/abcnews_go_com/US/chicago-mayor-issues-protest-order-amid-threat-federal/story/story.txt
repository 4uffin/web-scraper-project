JB Pritzker.The conflict intensified after Trump's Aug. 25 remarks, where he called Chicago a "disaster" and its governor "a slob," while suggesting some people might prefer "a dictator."Pritzker responded by calling Trump's proposed actions "illegal," "unconstitutional," and "un-American."In response, Chicago began preparing for potential federal intervention. On Aug. 30, Johnson signed an executive order rejecting any attempts to deploy U.S. Armed Forces or National Guard troops in the city. That order created the "Protecting Chicago Initiative," aimed at defending residents' rights.Chicago officials pointed to recent crime statistics showing a 31% reduction in murders and 33% decrease in robberies compared to 2024, challenging Trump's description of the city as a "killing field."The city also launched a new website, chicago.gov/protect, providing resources for residents planning peaceful protests and updates about federal intervention.Related TopicsChicagoSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsPentagon steps up media restrictions, now requiring approval before reporting even unclassified infoSep 20, 8:51 PMCanada joins others recognizing a Palestinian state before UN General AssemblySep 21, 9:12 AM6 children, including infant, locked in Milwaukee storage unit: PoliceSep 16, 5:30 PMRelays in the rain!
