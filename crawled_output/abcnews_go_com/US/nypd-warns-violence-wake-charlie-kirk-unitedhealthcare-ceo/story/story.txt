These individuals likely remain vulnerable at open-air speaking engagements and public events, which have been targeted by malicious actors seeking to advance political or ideological agendas and/or draw attention to unique personal grievances through violence," the document, obtained by ABC News, said.Mugshot of Tyler Robinson, the suspect in the shooting of Charlie Kirk.Courtesy of Gov. Spencer CoxMORE: Charlie Kirk killing: Suspect had 'obsession' with the conservative influencer, FBI says"This attack, along with a series of recent high-profile assaults linked to actors with a host of grievances, underscores the continued need for heightened vigilance among law enforcement officers and private-sector security personnel with dignitary/executive protection responsibilities. Rather than aligning with a single extremist ideology, malicious actors may adopt a personalized, hate-filled worldview drawn from a mix of beliefs, amplifying the risk of future attacks by lone offenders that glean tactical/targeting inspiration from prior acts of high-profile violence and find support in permissive online environments," the bureau said in the document.Robinson, the suspected gunman in Kirk's killing, is expected to face capital murder charges in Utah on Tuesday. Authorities have said Robinson may have been "radicalized" online and that ammunition found in the gun used to kill Kirk included anti-fascist and meme-culture writings.Luigi Mangione, who has been indicted on federal charges in the shooting of Thompson in Midtown, Manhattan on Dec. 4, 2024, is due in a New York court on Tuesday when the judge is expected to rule on several outstanding motions, including defense motions to dismiss state murder charges and exclude certain evidence.

Additionally, the high-profile nature of this assassination will likely be amplified in propaganda messaging and heavily exploited by malicious actors as well as adversarial nation-states in mis/dis/mal-information aimed at fomenting division," the assessment said.Related TopicsCharlie Kirk shootingUnitedHealthcare CEO shootingNew YorkSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsKamala Harris says she 'had a certain responsibility' to argue against Biden running againSep 22, 10:01 PMABC News anchors, correspondents to run 2025 New York City MarathonSep 24, 8:10 AMAnnunciation Catholic School to 'resume some on-campus activities' this weekSep 15, 4:33 PMDOJ probing FBI agent who sued Alex Jones in Sandy Hook defamation caseSep 23, 7:59 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us Â© 2025 ABC News
