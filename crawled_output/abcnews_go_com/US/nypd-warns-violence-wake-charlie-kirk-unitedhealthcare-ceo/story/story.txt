These individuals likely remain vulnerable at open-air speaking engagements and public events, which have been targeted by malicious actors seeking to advance political or ideological agendas and/or draw attention to unique personal grievances through violence," the document, obtained by ABC News, said.Mugshot of Tyler Robinson, the suspect in the shooting of Charlie Kirk.Courtesy of Gov. Spencer CoxMORE: Charlie Kirk killing: Suspect had 'obsession' with the conservative influencer, FBI says"This attack, along with a series of recent high-profile assaults linked to actors with a host of grievances, underscores the continued need for heightened vigilance among law enforcement officers and private-sector security personnel with dignitary/executive protection responsibilities. Rather than aligning with a single extremist ideology, malicious actors may adopt a personalized, hate-filled worldview drawn from a mix of beliefs, amplifying the risk of future attacks by lone offenders that glean tactical/targeting inspiration from prior acts of high-profile violence and find support in permissive online environments," the bureau said in the document.Robinson, the suspected gunman in Kirk's killing, is expected to face capital murder charges in Utah on Tuesday. Authorities have said Robinson may have been "radicalized" online and that ammunition found in the gun used to kill Kirk included anti-fascist and meme-culture writings.Luigi Mangione, who has been indicted on federal charges in the shooting of Thompson in Midtown, Manhattan on Dec. 4, 2024, is due in a New York court on Tuesday when the judge is expected to rule on several outstanding motions, including defense motions to dismiss state murder charges and exclude certain evidence.
