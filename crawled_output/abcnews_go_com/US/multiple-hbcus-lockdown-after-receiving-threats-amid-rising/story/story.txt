Al Sharpton released a statement on Thursday, calling for an end to threats to HBCU campuses and all forms of violence amid tensions after the killing of Kirk.Sharpton said in his statement that he "condemned the shooting of Donald Trump last year, the murder of Charlie Kirk yesterday, and the threats to HBCUs today."

It is unclear what type of threat was made to the schools at this time.The schools stressed "if you see something, say something," asking for their communities to alert the authorities to any suspicious activity.The alleged threats follow a history of threats to HBCUs in the past several years. In 2022, multiple schools received anonymous bomb threats, causing shelter-in-place notices or evacuations of the majority-Black institutions.However, no real bombs were found after each incident. At the time, the FBI identified one juvenile believed to be responsible for a "majority" of the "racially motivated" threats.Related TopicsEducationSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsWhat to know about Tyler Robinson, Charlie Kirk shooting suspectSep 14, 2:32 PMTrump poised to fire US attorney for resisting effort to charge NY AG: SourcesSep 19, 5:44 PMFederal agencies are tracking security threats to Charlie Kirk's funeralSep 18, 9:11 PM5 officers shot, 3 fatally, while serving warrant in Pennsylvania: OfficialsSep 18, 10:21 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
