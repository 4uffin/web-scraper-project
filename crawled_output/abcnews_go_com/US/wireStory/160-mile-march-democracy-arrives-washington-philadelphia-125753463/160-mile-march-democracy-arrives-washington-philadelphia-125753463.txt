Along the way they were housed in churches, where they slept in pews, or at people’s homes. One night the group camped outdoors.Founding member Maggie Bohara said the marchers were warmly greeted in every community they entered, given food, water and shelter.“It really showed that there are people who believe in what we believe in and that we’re not alone in this,” Bohara said.80-year-old Dianne Shaw-Cummins and her son Ted Regnaud were members of the march. Shaw-Cummins, who lives in Arizona but spends the summer in Minnesota with Regnaud, said one morning her son asked how she felt about walking from Philadelphia to Washington, to which she replied, “I can do that.”Popular ReadsHegseth unveils new restrictions on Pentagon press accessSep 19, 8:50 PMWoman reveals new details about relationship with dentist who killed wifeSep 19, 6:10 AMToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on beauty, tech, home and moreSep 25, 1:39 PM“I want better for my grandchildren.

Al Green, D-Texas, likened the march to Bloody Sunday, the day in 1965 when civil rights activists marched from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, and were attacked by law enforcement on the Edmund Pettus Bridge.“You marched on 160 miles, and today you are now bringing the Edmund Pettus Bridge moment to Washington, D.C. You’re bringing it to fruition,” Green said.The marchers carried a version of the U.S. Constitution with them that was created by children from across the country. They gifted it to Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., after they arrived in Washington. Van Hollen sprang into the national spotlight in April when he flew to El Salvador to meet with his constituent, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported by the Trump administration in March.Founding We Are America member MJ Tune said they carried the Constitution to remind elected officials of their oath to defend it against enemies, both foreign and domestic.“We also wanted to build a sense of community on this March. Right now we feel like so many people in America have lost a sense of community, and community is essential to creating a movement that can sustain long-term nonviolent action, which is our ultimate goal,” Tune said.Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsWoman reveals new details about relationship with dentist who killed wifeSep 19, 6:10 AMHegseth unveils new restrictions on Pentagon press accessSep 19, 8:50 PMToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on beauty, tech, home and moreSep 25, 1:39 PMTrump admin live updates: Trump announces new tariffs on cabinets, trucks, drugsSep 25, 4:37 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
