(Cape Hatteras National Seashore via AP)The Associated PressBUXTON, N.C. -- A beachfront stilt home along the Outer Banks in North Carolina has collapsed into the surf, bringing the total number of houses claimed by the Atlantic Ocean to 12 in the past five years.The two-story, wood-shingled home at the north end of Hatteras Island collapsed Tuesday afternoon, littering the sand with nail-studded debris. The house was unoccupied, said Mike Barber, a spokesman for the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.“Seashore staff are out today, cleaning up the beach to the south of the collapse site,” Barber said in an email Wednesday. He said the homeowner has also hired a contractor to “work primarily near the house collapse site to remove the bulk of the remaining house structure and nearby debris associated with the collapse.”Popular ReadsAmazon Prime Big Deal Days: When it's happening and early deals to shop nowSep 22, 9:35 AMToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on fall shoes, headphones and moreSep 22, 2:30 PM29-year-old man attacked by bear in Yellowstone National ParkSep 17, 4:04 AMThe previous 11 home collapses since May 2020 were all in the tiny village of Rodanthe, the eastern-most point in North Carolina, and made famous by novelist Nicholas Sparks.
