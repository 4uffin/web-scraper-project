The house was unoccupied, said Mike Barber, a spokesman for the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.“Seashore staff are out today, cleaning up the beach to the south of the collapse site,” Barber said in an email Wednesday. He said the homeowner has also hired a contractor to “work primarily near the house collapse site to remove the bulk of the remaining house structure and nearby debris associated with the collapse.”Popular Reads5 officers shot, 3 fatally, while serving warrant in Pennsylvania: OfficialsSep 18, 10:21 PMCharlie Kirk shooting suspect's conditions for surrender had to be 'gentle': SheriffSep 17, 4:48 PM4 soldiers believed to be dead in military helicopter crash, officials saySep 19, 4:47 PMThe previous 11 home collapses since May 2020 were all in the tiny village of Rodanthe, the eastern-most point in North Carolina, and made famous by novelist Nicholas Sparks.
