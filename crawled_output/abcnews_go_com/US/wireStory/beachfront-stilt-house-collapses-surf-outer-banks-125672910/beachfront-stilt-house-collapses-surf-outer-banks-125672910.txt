(Cape Hatteras National Seashore via AP)The Associated PressBUXTON, N.C. -- A beachfront stilt home along the Outer Banks in North Carolina has collapsed into the surf, bringing the total number of houses claimed by the Atlantic Ocean to 12 in the past five years.The two-story, wood-shingled home at the north end of Hatteras Island collapsed Tuesday afternoon, littering the sand with nail-studded debris. The house was unoccupied, said Mike Barber, a spokesman for the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.“Seashore staff are out today, cleaning up the beach to the south of the collapse site,” Barber said in an email Wednesday. He said the homeowner has also hired a contractor to “work primarily near the house collapse site to remove the bulk of the remaining house structure and nearby debris associated with the collapse.”Popular ReadsKate Middleton dazzles in Lover's Knot Tiara at state banquetSep 17, 4:19 PM'Pay attention': Controller admonishes Spirit pilot flying near Air Force OneSep 17, 2:33 PM5 officers shot, 3 fatally, while serving warrant in Pennsylvania: OfficialsSep 17, 6:49 PMThe previous 11 home collapses since May 2020 were all in the tiny village of Rodanthe, the eastern-most point in North Carolina, and made famous by novelist Nicholas Sparks.
