LEDERER Associated PressSeptember 23, 2025, 10:06 PM1:53UNITED NATIONS -- President Donald Trump broke from his prepared remarks at the United Nations on Tuesday to bemoan an inoperable escalator and a defective teleprompter, using the incidents to portray the global body as dysfunctional.“All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that on the way up stopped right in the middle,” he mused, chopping the air with his hand.But it turns out the cause was closer to Trump.Stephane Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said a videographer from the U.S. delegation who ran ahead of him triggered the stop mechanism at the top of the escalator.“The safety mechanism is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing,” Dujarric said in a statement. “The videographer may have inadvertently triggered the safety function.”As he began his speech, Trump also noted that the teleprompter wasn't working. He joked that whoever was running the teleprompter “is in big trouble.”Popular ReadsWhat Jimmy Kimmel said as he returned to the air after show was preemptedSep 24, 12:18 AMSchumer mocks Trump’s negotiating skills after he backs out of meeting with DemsSep 23, 6:41 PMSpecial election winner in Arizona could be key vote to release Epstein filesSep 23, 11:53 PMA U.N. official speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue contributed that one to his side as well, saying the White House was operating the teleprompter for the president.Regardless of the cause, it's not unusual for escalators at the UN to stop working, as staff and visitors know quite well.In recent months, U.N. offices in New York and Geneva have intermittently turned off elevators and escalators as part of steps to save money because of a “liquidity crisis” at the world body.That’s due in part to delays in funding from the United States, which is the top donor of the world body.Related TopicsPresident TrumpSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsWhat Jimmy Kimmel said as he returned to the air after show was preemptedSep 24, 12:18 AMSpecial election winner in Arizona could be key vote to release Epstein filesSep 23, 11:53 PMSchumer mocks Trump’s negotiating skills after he backs out of meeting with DemsSep 23, 6:41 PMSniper opens fire on Dallas ICE facility, killing 1 detainee, wounding 2: DHS3 hours agoABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
