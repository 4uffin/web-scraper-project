The players have been targeted because of the high-end products believed to be in their homes and sometimes the thefts happen when they are away with their teams for road games.The FBI has warned sports leagues about crime organizations targeting professional athletes. The NFL and NBA have also issued security alerts after burglaries at the homes of such star athletes as Kansas City Chiefs stars Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce. Seven people were charged in connection with those burglaries in February.In the Seattle area, another man, Earl Henderson Riley IV, was previously arrested in some of the same break-ins Maisonet has been charged in. Police said Maisonet sometimes carried digital frequency jammers to disable cellphone calls — including to 911.The athletes targeted included Seattle Mariners pitcher Luis Castillo, whose home was hit twice; Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell, who is from Washington; and former Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman. Snell had two Rolex watches stolen, each worth $75,000. Sherman also had a Rolex taken.Popular ReadsGang attack on armored vehicle in Haiti leaves 2 police officers injured, driver deadSep 15, 10:30 AMThe EU Parliament rejects Hungary's bid to lift immunity for its lawmaker and main Orbán rivalSep 23, 7:44 AMToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on bedding, coffee makers and moreSep 24, 10:39 AMSherman posted camera images of three people breaking into his house on his birthday in March, at least one armed with a pistol.“House being robbed at gun point with my family in it isn’t what anyone wants for a birthday gift.

He featured the two championship rings in his 2022 music video for the song “Chant.”Phone location records traced Maisonet from his home and grandmother’s house to the homes of robbery victims, according to court documents. They also connected him to a Seattle jewelry store where police said they recovered some of the stolen items.Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsGang attack on armored vehicle in Haiti leaves 2 police officers injured, driver deadSep 15, 10:30 AMThe EU Parliament rejects Hungary's bid to lift immunity for its lawmaker and main Orbán rivalSep 23, 7:44 AMToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on bedding, coffee makers and moreSep 24, 10:39 AMTropical activity to ramp up in the Atlantic BasinSep 23, 5:02 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
