Growler Pines Tiger Preserve said in a statement that Ryan Easley died Saturday in “an accident" involving a tiger at the property near Hugo, not far from the Texas border. “This tragedy is a painful reminder of both the beauty and unpredictability of the natural world,” the preserve said on its Facebook page. “Ryan understood those risks — not out of recklessness but out of love. The animals under his care were not just animals to him, but beings he formed a connection with — one rooted in respect, daily care and love.”Popular ReadsTrump admin live updates: Trump announces new tariffs on cabinets, trucks, drugsSep 25, 4:37 PMIsrael-Gaza live updates: Palestinian Authority ready to govern Gaza, president saysSep 25, 3:49 PM21-year-old man found dead after going missing in Great Smoky Mountains: NPSSep 22, 10:43 AMAll tours have been canceled until further notice, the statement said.The preserve is a private facility where visitors can book tours to view tigers and see demonstrations on how the animals are trained and cared for, according to its website.Related TopicsAnimal AttacksSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTrump admin live updates: Trump announces new tariffs on cabinets, trucks, drugsSep 25, 4:37 PM21-year-old man found dead after going missing in Great Smoky Mountains: NPSSep 22, 10:43 AMIsrael-Gaza live updates: Palestinian Authority ready to govern Gaza, president saysSep 25, 3:49 PMOregon police recover partial remains of dismembered woman in 80-year-old cold caseSep 24, 7:55 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
