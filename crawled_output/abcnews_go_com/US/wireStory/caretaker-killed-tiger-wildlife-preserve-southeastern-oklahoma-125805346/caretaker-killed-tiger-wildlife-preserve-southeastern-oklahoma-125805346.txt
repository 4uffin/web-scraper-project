Growler Pines Tiger Preserve said in a statement that Ryan Easley died Saturday in “an accident" involving a tiger at the property near Hugo, not far from the Texas border. “This tragedy is a painful reminder of both the beauty and unpredictability of the natural world,” the preserve said on its Facebook page. “Ryan understood those risks — not out of recklessness but out of love. The animals under his care were not just animals to him, but beings he formed a connection with — one rooted in respect, daily care and love.”Popular Reads3-year-old, 6-year-old die in hot car outside their home, mom arrestedSep 22, 12:00 PMTrump admin live updates: In major shift, Trump says Ukraine can win back seized landSep 24, 11:03 AM4.3 magnitude earthquake jolts San Francisco Bay Area, people report feeling shakeSep 22, 6:40 AMAll tours have been canceled until further notice, the statement said.The preserve is a private facility where visitors can book tours to view tigers and see demonstrations on how the animals are trained and cared for, according to its website.Related TopicsAnimal AttacksSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular Reads4.3 magnitude earthquake jolts San Francisco Bay Area, people report feeling shakeSep 22, 6:40 AM3-year-old, 6-year-old die in hot car outside their home, mom arrestedSep 22, 12:00 PMTrump admin live updates: In major shift, Trump says Ukraine can win back seized landSep 24, 11:03 AMJimmy Kimmel to return to air on TuesdaySep 22, 4:01 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
