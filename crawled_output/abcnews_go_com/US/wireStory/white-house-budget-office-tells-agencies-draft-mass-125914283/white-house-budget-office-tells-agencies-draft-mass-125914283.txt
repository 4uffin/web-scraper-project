With just days to go before federal money runs out with the end of the fiscal year on Tuesday, Sept. 30, Congress has failed to pass legislation to keep the government running after becoming deadlocked during votes late last week. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)The Associated PressWASHINGTON -- The White House is telling agencies to prepare large-scale firings of federal workers if the government shuts down next week. In a memo released Wednesday night, the Office of Management and Budget said agencies should consider a reduction in force for federal programs whose funding would lapse next week, is not otherwise funded and is “not consistent with the President's priorities.” That would be a much more aggressive step than in previous shutdowns, when federal workers not deemed essential were furloughed but returned to their jobs once Congress approved government spending.A reduction in force would not only lay off employees but eliminate their positions, which would trigger yet another massive upheaval in a federal workforce that has already faced major rounds of cuts this year due to efforts from the Department of Government Efficiency and elsewhere in the Trump administration. Once any potential government shutdown ends, agencies are asked to revise their reduction in force plans “as needed to retain the minimal number of employees necessary to carry out statutory functions," according to the memo, which was first reported by Politico. This move from OMB significantly increases the consequences of a potential government shutdown next week and escalates pressure on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The two leaders have kept nearly all of their Democratic lawmakers united against a clean funding bill pushed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans that would keep the federal government operating for seven more weeks, demanding immediate improvements to health care in exchange for their votes. In statements issued shortly after the memo was released, the two Democrats showed no signs of budging. “We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings,” Jeffries wrote in a post on X. “Get lost.” Jeffries called Russ Vought, the head of OMB, a “malignant political hack."

The budget office plays point in managing federal government shutdowns, particularly planning for them ahead of time. Past budget offices have also posted shutdown contingency plans — which would outline which agency workers would stay on the job during a government shutdown and which would be furloughed — on its website, but this one has not. The memo noted that congressional Democrats are refusing to support a clean government funding bill “due to their partisan demands,” which include an extension of enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, plus a reversal of Medicaid cuts that were included in Republicans’ big tax and spending cuts law."As such, it has never been more important for the Administration to be prepared for a shutdown if the Democrats choose to pursue one," the memo reads, which also notes that the GOP's signature law, a major tax and border spending package, gives “ample resources to ensure that many core Trump Administration priorities will continue uninterrupted.” OMB noted that it had asked all agencies to submit their plans in case of a government shutdown by Aug. 1. “OMB has received many, but not all, of your submissions,” it added. “Please send us your updated lapse plans ASAP.” Related TopicsGovernment ShutdownSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsStarbucks to lay off hundreds of workers, close stores in North AmericaSep 25, 8:38 AMMystery drones over Denmark are 'hybrid attack,' defense minister saysSep 25, 5:00 PMProsecutors' memo to new US attorney found no probable cause to charge Comey: SourcesSep 25, 1:19 PM'Tragic irony': Dallas ICE shooter was targeting agents, not detaineesSep 25, 3:07 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
