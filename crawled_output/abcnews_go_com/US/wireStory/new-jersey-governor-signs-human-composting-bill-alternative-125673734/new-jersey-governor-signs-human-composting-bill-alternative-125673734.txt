Phil Murphy signed the legislation last week. It authorizes a practice called natural organic reduction, which involves putting a body into a large tank that also holds straw, wood chips or other natural materials. The human remains and organic materials mix with warm air and are periodically turned until the body is reduced to a soil-like material that can then be given to the dead person’s family.Supporters of the practice say it is an environmentally friendly and less costly alternative to traditional burials and cremation that uses less energy and doesn’t involve the use of formaldehyde or the release of carbon dioxide and mercury into the atmosphere. They also say it helps reduce the amount of land needed for cemeteries and the amount of timber harvested for caskets.Popular ReadsDisney’s Animal Kingdom gorilla with ‘playful spirit’ dies at 44Sep 17, 10:59 AMWhat to know about Typhoon Ragasa, the strongest storm of the yearSep 24, 9:46 AMTrump's misleading comments on autism validate the 'MAHA' movement and reveal its political potencySep 23, 6:21 PMOpponents have argued that human composting is disrespectful or goes against traditional religious beliefs.Murphy signed the bill on Sept. 11.Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsDisney’s Animal Kingdom gorilla with ‘playful spirit’ dies at 44Sep 17, 10:59 AMWhat to know about Typhoon Ragasa, the strongest storm of the yearSep 24, 9:46 AMTrump's misleading comments on autism validate the 'MAHA' movement and reveal its political potencySep 23, 6:21 PMToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on beauty, tech, home and moreSep 25, 1:39 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
