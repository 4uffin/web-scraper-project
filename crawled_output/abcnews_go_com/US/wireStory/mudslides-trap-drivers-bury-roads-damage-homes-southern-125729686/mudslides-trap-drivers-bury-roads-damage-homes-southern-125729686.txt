A group of about 10 people traveling in at least six vehicles was stranded on state Route 38 in the area of Jenks Lake, near the San Bernardino National Forest, the fire district said. “Though cut off by debris in both directions, the group is safe and their needs are being evaluated by emergency crews,” the district said. The route was still closed as of Friday morning, the California Highway Patrol said.
