(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson, File)The Associated PressFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A South Florida judge on Thursday cleared a police officer of wrongdoing in the shooting death of a UPS driver who had been taken hostage during a 2019 robbery.Broward Circuit Judge Ernest Kollra ruled that Jose Mateo, who had been charged with manslaughter in the death of UPS driver Frank Ordonez, could not be prosecuted because Florida's so-called “stand your ground” law justified the shooting, the South Florida SunSentinel reported.The Broward State Attorney's Office said they will appeal the ruling. “It is our belief that Stand Your Ground immunity does not apply in matters involving innocent bystanders, like Frank Ordonez and Richard Cutshaw, who presented no danger to officers. In this incident, two innocent men were killed and the lives of numerous other innocent bystanders were endangered,” the state attorney's statement said. Cutshaw was also killed in a barrage of gunfire that afternoon.Ordonez, 27, had been delivering packages in Miami-Dade County on Dec. 5, 2019, when police said two would-be jewelry store robbers abducted him and forced him to drive from the scene. A rush-hour police chase ended at a busy intersection in neighboring Broward County. Prosecutors said Mateo fired the shots that killed Ordonez. The two robbers and a passerby were also killed in a hail of gunfire at an intersection in Miramar, Florida.Popular ReadsDemond Williams Jr. leads Washington over Washington State 59-24 in Apple CupSep 20, 11:16 PMNebraska completes Hail Mary to tie No. 21 Michigan as half expiresSep 20, 5:32 PMKansas deputy charged with murder in the death of a man in custodySep 18, 8:06 PMBody-worn camera footage that was played in court showed Mateo's pursuit of the UPS truck that afternoon.
