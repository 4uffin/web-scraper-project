(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)The Associated PressWASHINGTON -- As a possible federal shutdown looms, the Democratic leaders of Congress are demanding a meeting with President Donald Trump to negotiate an end to what they call “your decision” to shutter government offices if no action is taken by the end-of-the month deadline.Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries said Saturday that Republicans, at Trump's insistence, have refused to enter talks. Democrats are pushing to preserve health care programs as part of any deal to keep government running past the Sept. 30 funding deadline."We write to demand a meeting in connection with your decision to shut down the federal government because of the Republican desire to continue to gut the healthcare of the American people," the two New York Democrats wrote.“Democrats have been clear and consistent in our position,” they said. “We are ready to work toward a bipartisan spending agreement that improves the lives of American families and addresses the Republican healthcare crisis.”Trump, in an exchange with reporters on Saturday evening, suggested that he remains open to a potential meeting but was dismissive of the Democratic leadership.“I’d love to meet with them, but I don’t think it’s going to have any impact,” he said.Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, failed to address the funding issue before lawmakers left town Friday for a break.The House approved a Republican proposal to keep the federal government funded into November, but the measure failed in the Senate. A Democratic proposal that would have boosted health care funds also failed.It all leaves Congress and the White House with no easy way out of the standoff that threatens a shutdown in less than two weeks when the current budget year and funding expires. Trump's first term in office saw a monthlong shutdown, the longest in federal history, in 2018-2019.Trump predicted Friday that there could be “a closed country for a period of time.” He said the government will continue to “take care” of the military and Social Security payments in a closure.Republicans have insisted they are not to blame for any possible shutdown, turning it back on Democrats.Popular ReadsWoman reveals new details about relationship with dentist who killed wifeSep 19, 6:10 AMTrump admin live updates: In major shift, Trump says Ukraine can win back seized landSep 24, 11:03 AMTrump says he is appointing former defense attorney to lead key prosecutor's officeSep 20, 11:05 PMHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., have put forward the short-term measure, which is a typical way that Congress resolves such logjams. That would keep government operations running at current levels as talks get underway.While the House was able to narrowly pass the temporary funding measure on a mostly party-line vote, in the Senate the process can require a higher 60-vote threshold that means support is needed from Republicans and Democrats.Democrats are working to protect health care programs. The Democratic proposal would extend enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, plus reverse Medicaid cuts that were included in Republicans’ big tax break and spending cut bill enacted earlier this year.Republicans have said the Democrats' demands to reverse the Medicaid changes are a nonstarter, but they have also said there is time to address the health insurance subsidy issue in the months ahead.___Associated Press writer Aamer Madhani contributed to this report.Related TopicsTrump AdministrationGovernment ShutdownSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTrump says he is appointing former defense attorney to lead key prosecutor's officeSep 20, 11:05 PMWoman reveals new details about relationship with dentist who killed wifeSep 19, 6:10 AMTrump admin live updates: In major shift, Trump says Ukraine can win back seized landSep 24, 11:03 AMIsrael-Gaza live updates:
