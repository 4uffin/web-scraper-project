(AP Photo/Mahesh Kumar A.)The Associated PressBEIJING -- The United States and China are talking past each other on key issues, said a U.S. lawmaker leading a bipartisan congressional delegation to Beijing on Tuesday.The visit, led by Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, is the first from the House of Representatives to China since 2019, and comes as tensions have risen between the two countries over trade, technology and opposing views on global conflicts.The aim of the trip, Smith said, is to increase dialogue between the two sides.“You have to be willing to start the process of saying, ‘Okay, this is where I’m coming from, where are you coming from?’ And we’re not even at that point yet. We’re still sort of talking past each other,” Smith said Tuesday.The U.S. delegation said they hoped China would take meaningful action to reduce the inflow of fentanyl into the U.S. and they expressed concern over China's restrictions on the global supply of rare earths, according to a readout from the House Armed Services Committee on Monday.Smith also said Tuesday he is concerned that the U.S. and Chinese militaries are coming too close to each other operationally, and that he wants the Chinese side to engage in more dialogue.“We’ve seen this with our ships and our planes, their ships, their planes, coming entirely too close to one another,” he told reporters. “At the height of the Cold War, we had regular conversations, regular treaties with the Soviet Union.”In October 2023, the U.S. military said that a Chinese fighter jet came within 10 feet of an American bomber over the South China Sea.Smith added he hoped for more engagement overall with Beijing. “Many things that seemed intractable and impossible — once you actually start talking from the standpoint of ‘Let’s try and resolve this’ — it is unbelievable what you can accomplish,” he said.The delegation met with Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun and separately with Vice Premier He Lifeng on Monday after holding talks with Premier Li Qiang on Sunday.Popular ReadsUkraine faces new test as Russia steps up its drive to seize Donetsk’s fortress beltSep 23, 1:12 AMChina cancels schools and flights as it braces for typhoonSep 22, 11:01 PMChina's Xi takes a step back, putting a lieutenant in the limelight at UN meetingSep 24, 1:05 PMThe U.S. and Chinese militaries suspended communications with each other for over a year starting in August 2022, following a visit by then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.

The lawmakers are in China until Thursday.Related TopicsChinaSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsChina cancels schools and flights as it braces for typhoonSep 22, 11:01 PMChina's Xi takes a step back, putting a lieutenant in the limelight at UN meetingSep 24, 1:05 PMUkraine faces new test as Russia steps up its drive to seize Donetsk’s fortress beltSep 23, 1:12 AMUS accuses a powerful Haitian businessman detained by ICE of ties to violent gangsSep 24, 5:57 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
