Speakers also called for people to dedicate themselves to building a less violent American society.Harper and another student at Annunciation Catholic School, 8-year-old Fletcher Merkel, were killed and 21 others were injured in the Aug. 27 shooting. Authorities said a 23-year-old former student, Robin Westman, was armed with a rifle, pistol and shotgun and fired more than a hundred rounds through the church's windows during a Mass. Westman was found dead of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot.Harper's mother, Jackie Flavin, told the mourners that their support had lifted the family when it felt as if it had been dropped at the bottom of an ocean “where it's pitch black and the pressure is crushing.” She said Harper, who loved dogs and hoped to be a veterinarian, taught them “how to be a light in the dark.”“She had her own point of view, her own sense of style, her own way of being. She didn't wait for permission. She didn't water herself down," Flavin said. “And she really taught us to show up exactly as you are.”Flavin also called Harper “extra in the very best way.”Popular ReadsSee the looks that stole the show at the 2025 EmmysSep 14, 8:31 PMAssault charges dismissed against NYC man who said he was beaten by Egyptian officialsSep 18, 5:05 PMToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on fall sweaters, headphones and moreSep 19, 11:00 AM“Harper didn't do anything halfway,” she said. “Always choosing the premium versions, always going for the extra scoop.”The event in Minneapolis came only four days after the fatal shooting of conservative activist and leader Charlie Kirk as he spoke at Utah Valley University. During the celebration of Harper's life, speakers expressed frustration and anger that gun violence — particularly shootings that kill schoolchildren — hasn't stopped. Another extended family member, Rabbi Jason Rodich, urged people to avoid the acrimony of social media and “the scorched earth of these times.”“Turn just a little to the warm soul beside you,” he said. "Do it for Harper. Do it for you."Related TopicsMinneapolis school shootingSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsAssault charges dismissed against NYC man who said he was beaten by Egyptian officialsSep 18, 5:05 PMToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on fall sweaters, headphones and moreSep 19, 11:00 AMSee the looks that stole the show at the 2025 EmmysSep 14, 8:31 PMHow to watch the Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 19, 1:23 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
