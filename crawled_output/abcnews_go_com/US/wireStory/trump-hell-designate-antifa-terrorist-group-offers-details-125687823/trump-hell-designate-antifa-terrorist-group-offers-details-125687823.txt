(Jordan Pettitt/Pool Photo via AP)The Associated PressWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said early Thursday that he plans to designate antifa as a “major terrorist organization.”Antifa, short for short for “anti-fascists,” is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups and is not a singular entity. They consist of groups that resist fascists and neo-Nazis, especially at demonstrations.It’s unclear how the administration would label what is effectively a decentralized movement as a terrorist organization, and the White House on Wednesday did not immediately offer more details.Trump, who is on a state visit to the United Kingdom, made the announcement in a social media post shortly before 1:30 a.m. Thursday local time. He called antifa a “SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER.” He also said he will be “strongly recommending” that funders of antifa be investigated.Popular ReadsTrump admin updates: Trump at Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 4:09 PMIsrael-Gaza live updates: France, UK, Canada recognize Palestinian statehoodSep 21, 12:39 PM5 officers shot, 3 fatally, while serving warrant in Pennsylvania: OfficialsSep 18, 10:21 PMTrump’s previous FBI director, Christopher Wray, said in testimony in 2020 that antifa is an ideology, not an organization, lacking the hierarchical structure that would usually allow it to be designated as a terror group by the federal government.After Trump's post, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., praised the announcement, saying: "Antifa seized upon a movement of legitimate grievances to promote violence and anarchy, working against justice for all. The President is right to recognize the destructive role of Antifa by designating them domestic terrorists.” In July 2019, Cassidy and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, introduced a resolution in the Senate to condemn the violent acts of antifa and to designate the group a domestic terror organization.Related TopicsTrump AdministrationSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular Reads5 officers shot, 3 fatally, while serving warrant in Pennsylvania: OfficialsSep 18, 10:21 PMTrump admin updates: Trump at Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 4:09 PMIsrael-Gaza live updates: France, UK, Canada recognize Palestinian statehoodSep 21, 12:39 PMCyberattack disrupts check-in systems at major European airportsSep 20, 4:42 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
