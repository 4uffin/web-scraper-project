Overjoyed, UNCF President and CEO Michael L. Lomax said he nearly "lost it" when he received the news of the donation -- which was seven times the amount of Scott's 2020 gift."She is Saint MacKenzie Scott," Lomax told ABC News, adding, "She is rewriting the book on philanthropy, not just in this country, but in the world."In this Jan. 1, 2016, file photo, the Harry Elson Memorial Gate is shown at Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn.Raymond Boyd/Getty Images, FILEMORE: SCOTUS struck a 'blow' to Black students, but it puts 'spotlight' on HBCUs: AdvocatesThe Associated Press was first to report the news of Scott's recent gift. Thus far, the billionaire philanthropist and author has given $80 million in blind, unrestricted financial support to the nation's largest private scholarship fund for historically Black higher education institutions.Sending his heartfelt thanks to Scott, Lomax added: "[Scott] is choosing institutions like HBCUs, which have been starved by major philanthropists, with few exceptions in the past, and she's setting a new standard."Over the years, Scott, who was previously married to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has had an estimated net worth at over $30 billion and has pledged to donate most of her wealth to non-profit organizations like UNCF.MacKenzie Bezos attends the 2018 Vanity Fair Oscar Party hosted by Radhika Jones at Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts on March 4, 2018 in Beverly Hills, California.Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images, FILEThe contribution this week was one of her first to be disclosed in 2025 and boosts the $1 billion UNCF Capital Campaign, a philanthropic effort launched in 2021 to provide HBCUs with critical resources.The organization said the $70 million gift will be invested in the UNCF Members Pooled Endowment Fund, an initiative formed to strengthen the "long-term financial health" of all 37 private UNCF member HBCUs, and a critical component of the broader $1 billion campaign.Popular ReadsPoop-like smell at South Carolina school leads to arrest of assistant teacherSep 23, 5:25 PMTeens charged after social media car stunts leave 1 dead, 1 with brain damage: DASep 24, 5:07 PMPregnant woman crosses street, fatally struck by car: PoliceSep 23, 3:30 PMThe pooled endowment fund's goal is to raise $370 million, which is about a $10 million stake in each school's endowment, for the pooled endowment.UNCF also said Scott's gift brings them "significantly closer" to that goal, as each private member HBCU will receive a $5 million stake from this initiative. Lomax said Scott has raised the bar and now he's sending a call to action to philanthropic organizations.In this May 18, 2025, file photo, the 2025 Spelman College Commencement Ceremony is shown at Georgia International Convention Center in College Park, Georgia.Paras Griffin/Getty Images, FILEMORE: Spelman College receives historic $100M donation"I think it's a challenge to them to do more and to give more," Lomax told ABC News. "We [HBCUs] often say we do more with less. Now it's time for us to do more with more," he said. The announcement comes during HBCU Week 2025, which is honoring the legacy of HBCUs. The schools have been "pillars of excellence" since 1837, according to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon.HBCUs recently received over $400 million from the Department of Education through funding that was redirected to them for their commitment to educational outcomes, according to the department. Long underfunded by the federal government, the move increased HBCU federal funding for fiscal year 2025 to $1.3 billion.In this May 18, 2025, file photo, Dr. Michael Lomax, Ph.D., President & CEO, United Negro College Fund (UNCF) is shown onstage during the 141st Morehouse College Commencement Ceremony at Morehouse College in Atlanta.Paras Griffin/Getty Images, FILEUNCF applauded the federal government's pledge to continue funding the more than 100 HBCUs across the country, including the 37 private HBCUs that it serves. Lodriguez V. Murray, UNCF's senior vice president for public policy and government affairs, called the additional funding "nothing short of a godsend for HBCUs."UNCF President and CEO Michael L. Lomax believes the 2023 affirmative action ruling, which banned race-conscious admissions practices, placed a new "spotlight" on the value of HBCUs, but he remains "guardedly optimistic" about the financial contributions as of late."I thought that, you know, maybe the support will go down, when, in fact, what's happening is that the support is going up," Lomax said.Related TopicsEducationSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsPregnant woman crosses street, fatally struck by car: PoliceSep 23, 3:30 PMPoop-like smell at South Carolina school leads to arrest of assistant teacherSep 23, 5:25 PMTeens charged after social media car stunts leave 1 dead, 1 with brain damage: DASep 24, 5:07 PMFamily of man who died after riding roller coaster speaks outSep 24, 3:20 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
