Tony Gutierrez/APThe sniper who opened fire on the Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, killing one detainee and wounding two detainees, was targeting ICE agents, not detainees, officials said, citing notes the suspect left behind.The suspect -- Joshua Jahn, 29, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after Wednesday's shooting -- wanted to "maximize lethality against ICE personnel and maximize property damage at the facility," Nancy E.

It's clear from these notes that he was targeting ICE agents and ICE personnel," Larson said, calling it "tragic irony" that detainees, not agents, were shot.Joshua Jahn is seen in a 2016 booking photo.Collin County Sheriff's Office Trump, Vance direct blame at Democrats for Dallas ICE shootingEvidence shows "a high degree" of planning from Jahn, of Fairview, Texas, according to FBI Director Kash Patel.He allegedly left behind a note that said, "Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?'"
