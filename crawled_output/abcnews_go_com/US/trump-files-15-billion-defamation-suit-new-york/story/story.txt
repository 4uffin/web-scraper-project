The lawsuit also names Penguin Random House -- the publisher of Craig and Buettner's book "Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father's Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success" -- as a defendant. Trump wants expedited deposition from Rupert Murdoch in WSJ Epstein suit"Today, the Times is a fullthroated mouthpiece of the Democrat Party. The newspaper's editorial routine is now one of industrial-scale defamation and libel against political opponents," the lawsuit claimed. Trump's lawyers allege that The New York Times and Penguin Random House sought to not only damage the president's "hard-earned and world-renowned reputation for business success," but also hurt his chances of winning the 2024 election."President Trump brings this suit to highlight that principle and to clearly state to all Americans exhausted by, and furious at, the decades of journalistic corruption, that the era of unchecked, deliberate defamation by the Times and other legacy media outlets is over," the lawsuit said. "President Trump's transcendent ability to defy wrongful conventions has been vividly reflected in his successful undertaking to restore integrity to journalism, and repair the immense damage caused by legacy media outlets such as the Times for the better part of a decade," the suit said.President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, September 15, 2025.Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty ImagesA New York Times spokesperson said the lawsuit has no merit.Popular ReadsDenmark's leader apologizes to Indigenous girls and women in Greenland for forced contraceptionSep 24, 2:16 AMBondi criticized for saying DOJ will 'target' anyone who engages in 'hate speech'Sep 16, 10:49 AMToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on beauty, tech, home and moreSep 25, 1:39 PM"It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting," the Times spokesperson said. "The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics. We will continue to pursue the facts without fear or favor and stand up for journalists’ First Amendment right to ask questions on behalf of the American people.""This is a meritless lawsuit," said a Penguin Random House spokesperson. "Penguin Random House stands by the book and its authors and will continue to uphold the values of the First Amendment that are fundamental to our role as a book publisher."In July, Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal  after the Journal reported that Trump allegedly sent disgraced financier Jeffery Epstein a bawdy letter in 2003 that was included in a book made for Epstein's 50th birthday, which Trump has denied. In response to that suit, a spokesperson for Journal owner Dow Jones said, "We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit." Related TopicsPresident TrumpSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsDenmark's leader apologizes to Indigenous girls and women in Greenland for forced contraceptionSep 24, 2:16 AMToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on beauty, tech, home and moreSep 25, 1:39 PM'Dancing with the Stars' season 34: Everything to knowSep 24, 6:33 PMBondi criticized for saying DOJ will 'target' anyone who engages in 'hate speech'Sep 16, 10:49 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
