The system, which is bringing winds up to 45 mph, should remain over open waters for several days, the NHC said.ABC NewsABC NewsThe storm is currently located 1,085 miles east of the Leeward Islands, and is likely to remain a tropical storm, but could strengthen into a hurricane by early next week.MORE: It is now peak hurricane season: What to expect for storms in the AtlanticThe storm will move northwest and is not expected to hit any of the Leeward Islands or the Caribbean. If it develops further, the storm could be a hurricane in the vicinity of Bermuda.But a strong area of high pressure will likely steer Gabrielle north and then northwest -- keeping it out to sea.The storm, which was originally described as a disturbance, was expected to become a tropical depression or tropical storm by the end of the week as it churns northwestward across the central Atlantic Ocean.ABC NewsABC NewsThe development of a new tropical cyclone would mark the end of a notably quiet period in the Atlantic Basin, a stretch that included the climatological peak of the hurricane season on Sept. 10.MORE: What to know about monsoon season in the USTropical activity is expected to gradually ramp up over the next few weeks as conditions become more favorable for development, forecasters say.Popular ReadsIsrael-Gaza live updates: France, UK, Canada recognize Palestinian statehoodSep 21, 12:39 PMFamed San Francisco chef arrested for string of bank robberiesSep 15, 5:48 PMEcuador's electoral council approves referendum on foreign military basesSep 20, 3:32 PMNOAA's Climate Prediction Center said the odds of tropical development are increasing across parts of the Atlantic Basin for the second half of September, as large-scale environmental conditions become more favorable.MORE: NASA pilot program to use citizen science to improve hurricane responseTropical weather experts at Colorado State University (CSU) echo these predictions, saying overall atmospheric conditions, including wind patterns, will shift in a manner that supports a notable increase in activity.While the climatological peak of the Atlantic hurricane season has passed, roughly 60% of tropical activity typically occurs after Sept. 10, on average, according to the National Hurricane Center.The remainder of September and October will likely be active, David Zierden, the Florida state climatologist and head of the Florida Climate Center at Florida State University, told ABC News last week.MORE: Above-normal activity predicted for remainder of 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, NOAA saysSeptember and October often see some of the busiest activity for hurricanes because sea surface temperatures can be at their highest, Zierden said. Higher temperatures provide "ample fuel" for the formation and intensification of tropical cyclones, he added.Waters in the Gulf and Caribbean are currently "very warm," Jennifer Francis, an atmospheric scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, told ABC News last week.Historically speaking, about two-thirds of all Atlantic hurricane season activity occurs between Aug. 20 and Oct. 10. In August, NOAA predicted above-normal activity for the remainder of the Atlantic hurricane season.Last year demonstrated that late September and early October can be an active period for tropical development, with multiple threats that may be high-impact and potentially devastating.Hurricane Helene, which caused devastating flooding in North Carolina, formed on Sept. 24, 2024, while Hurricane Milton, which caused widespread destruction in Florida, formed on Oct. 5, 2024.ABC News' Kenton Gewecke and Kyle Reiman contributed to this report.Related TopicsHurricanesWeatherSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsIsrael-Gaza live updates: France, UK, Canada recognize Palestinian statehoodSep 21, 12:39 PMEcuador's electoral council approves referendum on foreign military basesSep 20, 3:32 PMTrump admin live updates: Trump at Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 4:09 PMFamed San Francisco chef arrested for string of bank robberiesSep 15, 5:48 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us Â© 2025 ABC News
