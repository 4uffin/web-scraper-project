But he warns these companies may not fully understand the risks they're taking.Authors Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares discuss their new book, “If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies: Why Superhuman AI Would Kill Us All.”ABC NewsUnlike the chatbots many people use today, superintelligent AI could be fundamentally different and more dangerous, according to Soares."Chatbots are a stepping stone.

When these systems do unexpected things, developers can't simply fix the code."When they threaten a New York Times reporter or engage in blackmail ... that's just a behavior that comes out of these AI's being grown. It's not a behavior someone put in there on purpose," Soares said.STOCK PHOTO/Getty ImagesSoares compared AI abilities to human abilites as a professional NFL team playing against a high school team.Popular ReadsAs UN climate talks loom in Brazil, many fear they can't afford to attendSep 21, 9:10 AMA teen who called 911 was shot by NYPD officers.
