"Although lawyers receive a modicum of expressive latitude in pleading the claim of a client, the complaint in this action extends far beyond the outer bound of that latitude."In tossing the suit because Trump's complaint was procedurally improper, the judge did not weigh in on the merits of Trump's defamation claim, giving his lawyers 28 days to refile it in a "professional and dignified manner."Donald Trump speaks to reporters on Air Force One on September 18, 2025 during a flight to Joint Base Andrews, Maryland.Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesMerryday, who was appointed by President Geroge H. W. Bush, said the complaint contains eighty pages of repetitive claims and praise for President Trump, but fails to establish the two counts of defamation alleged. He lambasted Trump's lawyers for forcing him to "labor through" the "superfluous" praise about Trump's show "The Apprentice," as well as the size of his real estate empire and the "historic fashion" of Trump's 2024 presidential victory.  "Even assuming that each allegation in the complaint is true ... a complaint remains an improper and impermissible place for the tedious and burdensome aggregation of prospective evidence, for the rehearsal of tendentious arguments, or for the protracted recitation and explanation of legal authority putatively supporting the pleader's claim for relief," the judge wrote. "As every lawyer knows (or is presumed to know), a complaint is not a public forum for vituperation and invective -- not a protected platform to rage against an adversary."Popular ReadsTrump admin updates: Trump at Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 4:09 PMTrump admin live updates: Trump and RFK JR make controversial autism announcement2 hours agoSenate fails to advance bills to fund government as shutdown loomsSep 19, 4:05 PMFiled in the Middle District of Florida, the lawsuit named The New York Times and Times reporters Peter Baker, Russ Buettner, Susanne Craig, and Michael Schmidt as defendants.

The newspaper's editorial routine is now one of industrial-scale defamation and libel against political opponents," the lawsuit claimed. Trump's lawyers allege that The New York Times and Penguin Random House sought to not only damage the president's "hard-earned and world-renowned reputation for business success," but also hurt his chances of winning the 2024 election.A New York Times spokesperson said Tuesday that the suit had no merit.Trump wants expedited deposition from Rupert Murdoch in WSJ Epstein suit"It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting," the Times spokesperson said. "The New York Times will not be deterred by intimidation tactics. We will continue to pursue the facts without fear or favor and stand up for journalists’ First Amendment right to ask questions on behalf of the American people.""This is a meritless lawsuit," said a Penguin Random House spokesperson. "Penguin Random House stands by the book and its authors and will continue to uphold the values of the First Amendment that are fundamental to our role as a book publisher."In July, Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal  after the Journal reported that Trump allegedly sent disgraced financier Jeffery Epstein a bawdy letter in 2003 that was included in a book made for Epstein's 50th birthday, which Trump has denied. In response to that suit, a spokesperson for Journal owner Dow Jones said, "We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit." Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTrump admin updates: Trump at Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 4:09 PMSenate fails to advance bills to fund government as shutdown loomsSep 19, 4:05 PMTrump admin live updates: Trump and RFK JR make controversial autism announcement2 hours agoArmed man arrested at stadium ahead of Charlie Kirk memorial: OfficialsSep 20, 10:15 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
