He is aiming to overturn his conviction on the lesser prostitution-related charges ahead of his expected sentencing next week.Sean "Diddy" Combs attends the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala in New York, May 1, 2017.Lucas Jackson/Reuters, FILEJudge Arun Subramanian did not immediately rule on the motion to acquit Combs or grant a retrial, but indicated the parties would have his decision soon.Combs was found guilty of transporting Cassie Ventura, and a woman who testified under the pseudonym "Jane" across state lines and internationally for prolonged sexual performances known as "freak-offs" with male escorts. Federal prosecutors told Subramanian the conviction deserved to be upheld in part because, even as a voyeur, Combs was violent."Ms. Ventura was getting punched in the face," prosecutor Christy Slavik said.  "Regulating prostitution is important because it can include discouraging violence against women."Sean 'Diddy' Combs' attorneys seek sentence close to time servedThe defense also argued the conviction should be tossed because Combs filmed many of the "freak-offs.""He was a consumer of amateur porn," Shapiro said. "Adults have a right to consume pornography."The argument left prosecutors exasperated."It is just not the case the defendant is an amateur porn producer," Slavik said.  "The record does not support an inference of making pornography."Members of the Combs family, including his mother and children, were seated in the gallery during Thursday's hearing. Sean "Diddy" Combs seen in court in New York City, Sept. 25, 2025, in this courtroom sketch.Jane Rosenberg/Reuters"I appreciate y'all.

"The proof at trial showed that he typically hired the services of male escorts or dancers advertised openly through lawful businesses, that the men were paid for their time, and that they enjoyed the activities and had friendships with Ms. Ventura and Jane and were not merely traveling to have sex for money."The defense also argued Combs’ conduct was not criminal but protected by the First Amendment."The freak-offs and hotel nights were performances that he or his girlfriends typically videotaped so they could watch them later. In other words, he was producing amateur pornography for later private viewing," the defense said.Sean 'Diddy' Combs sentencing set for OctoberFederal prosecutors balked, writing in advance of the hearing that Combs' conduct "is clearly not entitled to First Amendment protection."Prosecutors also argued there "was more than a sufficient basis" to support the conviction."The defendant masterminded every aspect of Freak Offs. He transported escorts across state lines to engage in Freak Offs for pay. He directed the sexual activity of escorts and victims throughout Freak Offs for his own sexual gratification. And he personally engaged in sexual activity during Freak Offs," prosecutors said.Combs' sentencing hearing is expected to be held on Oct. 3, according to the court.Also this week, Combs' attorneys argued for a prison sentence of no more than 14 months -- a sentence that would effectively amount to time served.Related TopicsSean 'Diddy' CombsSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTrump demands investigation into alleged 'sabotage' of UN escalator, teleprompterSep 24, 6:33 PMCoast Guard seizes 5 tons of narcotics worth over $64.5 million in Caribbean Sea bustSep 25, 3:27 AMStarbucks to lay off hundreds of workers, close stores in North AmericaSep 25, 8:38 AMBorder Patrol saves life of cyclist who fell 50 feet from cliff into remote canyonSep 25, 2:31 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
