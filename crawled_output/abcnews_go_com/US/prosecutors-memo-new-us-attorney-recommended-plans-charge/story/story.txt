Adam Schiff. A former insurance lawyer turned White House aide with no prosecutorial experience, Halligan has been advised by career prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office that seeking the charges would violate DOJ policy, raise serious ethical issues, and risk being rejected by the grand jury, sources said. She plans to pursue an indictment anyway, carrying out the clear mandate she received when she was installed into the position over the weekend, sources said. On Thursday, Trump called Comey a "bad person" but said the decision to prosecute is up to the Department of Justice. "They're going to make a determination. I'm not making that determination. I think I'd be allowed to get involved if I want, but I don't really choose to do so," Trump told reporters in the White House Thursday, just days after imploring the Justice Department to act.In this June 8, 2017, file photo, former FBI director James Comey speaks during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, on Capitol Hill, in Washington, D.C.Andrew Harnik/AP, FILEHalligan is working against the clock, with the five-year statute of limitations to prosecute Comey for allegedly making false statements expiring on Tuesday. The rapid push for an indictment, despite the recommendation of career prosecutors, comes at a fraught time for the high-profile attorney's office, which handles a bulk of the country's national security cases. Trump's previous pick for the job, Erik Siebert, resigned last week after being pressured to bring mortgage fraud charges against James, and Trump, who said he fired Siebert, placed Halligan in the role -- overruling senior DOJ leadership -- with a clear goal of securing criminal charges against James, Schiff, and Comey. Here's a list of the individuals, including James Comey, targeted so far by the Trump administrationTrump has repeatedly invoked the four criminal cases he faced after losing the 2020 election -- including charges that he mishandled national security secrets and sought to illegally overturn an election -- to justify bringing the cases against the three longtime adversaries of the president. "Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam 'Shifty' Schiff, and Leticia???" Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday evening. "We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING.

Prosecutors specifically examined Comey's testimony about Hillary Clinton's alleged involvement linking Trump to Russia and whether Comey authorized leaks of anonymous information to the media. During his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 30, 2016, Comey defended his conduct and rejected claims that the investigation was politically motivated. "I would say in the main it was done by the book, it was appropriate, and it was essential that it be done," Comey told the senators. "Overall, I'm proud of the work. There are parts of it that are concerning, which I'm sure we'll talk about. But overall I'm proud of the work."Ultimately, prosecutors were unable to find evidence to prove that Comey likely committed either perjury or obstruction during his testimony, sources told ABC News.Not only would the charges fail in securing a conviction, which requires proving the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt, but they also fall short of the much lower probable cause standard for an indictment, prosecutors concluded in a memo provided to Halligan, according to sources. Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsCoast Guard seizes 5 tons of narcotics worth over $64.5 million in Caribbean Sea bustSep 25, 3:27 AMRFK Jr. launches FDA review of abortion pillSep 24, 9:00 PMMystery drones over Denmark are 'hybrid attack,' defense minister saysSep 25, 5:00 PMJudge weighing whether to overturn Sean 'Diddy' Combs' convictionsSep 25, 3:00 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
