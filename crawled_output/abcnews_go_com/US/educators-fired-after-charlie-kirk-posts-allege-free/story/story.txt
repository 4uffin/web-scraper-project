"This is further evidence of the profound crisis in our classrooms and on our campuses."McMahon did not mention free speech in her statement.Related TopicsCharlie Kirk shootingSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsWhat Jimmy Kimmel said as he returned to the air after show was preemptedSep 24, 12:18 AMSniper opens fire on Dallas ICE facility, killing 1 detainee, wounding 2: DHS3 hours agoTrump's announcement on autism and Tylenol: What parents need to knowSep 23, 4:42 PMTrump admin live updates: In major shift, Trump says Ukraine can win back seized landSep 24, 11:03 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
