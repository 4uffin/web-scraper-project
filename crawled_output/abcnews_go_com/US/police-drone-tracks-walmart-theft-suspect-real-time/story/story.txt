The department's "Drone First Responder" (DFR) program proved crucial in the arrest, officials said."The suspect at Walmart stole a bicycle from inside the store, which the staff thought he would, and he took off on that bike," Clovis Police Public Information Officer Ty Wood told ABC News Fresno station ABC30.Clovis Police utilize drone technology to assist in arrests of repeat shoplifters.Clovis Police DepartmentManhunt underway for Oregon murder suspect who was mistakenly released on bail: SheriffThe suspect, identified by police as 19-year-old Sean Baker, was tracked by the drone as he crossed a nearby street.
