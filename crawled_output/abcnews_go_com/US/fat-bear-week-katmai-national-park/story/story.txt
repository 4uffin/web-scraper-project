L.

People can continue to vote on the website through Sept. 30, the NPS said.Some standouts in the race for the crown include 32 Chunk, who perhaps weighs over 1,200 pounds, and 609, who was the 2022 Fat Bear Junior champion, according to the website."Fat Bear Week enables people from around the world to work to actively engage in learning about bears while cheering for their favorite competitor," Katmai Park Superintendent Mark Sturm said in a statement.The annual competition, which is a single-elimination tournament, celebrates these rotund creatures who have successfully scarfed down enough salmon to "endure winter hibernation," the NPS said.Could a government shutdown affect Fat Bear Week?The bears, who live in the Brooks River area of the national park, can gain a few hundred pounds in fat before they retire for the winter, the NPS said.From late June through September, adult male bears in this area typically weigh anywhere from 700 to 900 pounds, but some can reach up to 1,200 pounds. Adult females are slightly smaller by about one-third to one-half of the male's weight, according to the competition's website.2018 Fat Bear Week Champion: 409.A. Ramos/NPSSpecifically at Katmai National Park, bears are "drawn to the large number of salmon readily available" as the fish have long been the "lifeblood of the area," the NPS said.For each matchup, participants are asked to "vote for the bear you believe best exemplifies fatness and success in brown bears." The bear with the most votes advances to the next round, with only one being crowned the fattest, according to the competition's website.Popular ReadsFormer 'The Bear' writer handcuffed on train after alleged complaint from white womanSep 22, 7:39 PM3-year-old, 6-year-old die in hot car outside their home, mom arrestedSep 22, 12:00 PMHandler mauled to death by tiger while performing for a crowd: SheriffSep 22, 5:56 PMAlong with photos of the contestants, live cameras of each bear will also be available once they are announced, according to the competition's website.Fat Beak Week 2019 Champion: 435 Holly.
