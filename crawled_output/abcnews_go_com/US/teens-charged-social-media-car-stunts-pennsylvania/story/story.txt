"It's important for the public to understand that these challenges can have severe, real-world consequences, creating significant risk to participants and sometimes the bystanders as well."Schools, authorities sound alarm over 'Chromebook Challenge' TikTok trendIn one incident, which occurred early on June 1, a 17-year-old boy was sitting on top of an upside-down folding table being pulled using a rope by a vehicle driven by his friend in a high school parking lot, Baratta said."Unfortunately, the juvenile driver recklessly operated the vehicle at a significant speed such that it whipped the rider sitting on the table into another parked vehicle, resulting in the death of the 17-year-old," Baratta said.The alleged 17-year-old driver in that case faces charges in juvenile court, including involuntary manslaughter, the district attorney said.In the other incident, in March, a 20-year-old woman was "surfing" on the back of a vehicle being driven by her friend in a parking lot, according to Baratta."Unfortunately, the friend was thrown from the moving vehicle and received catastrophic head injuries that will be permanent in nature," Baratta said.The alleged 19-year-old driver in that incident faces charges including aggravated assault, aggravated assault by vehicle, careless driving and persons hanging on a vehicle, the district attorney said.Northampton County District Attorney Stephen Baratta speaks during a press briefing, Sept. 23, 2025.WPVI"They were not planning to injure their victims," Baratta said of the two teens charged.

If the teens, who are both first-time offenders, complete court-supervised programs, they could later ask that their criminal charges be expunged, he said.The district attorney said the parents of the victims "struggled a lot" with the cases. They "expressed disappointment" in both their children and their children's friends for participating in the "stunt challenges," and ultimately wanted charges to be brought for accountability and to serve as a deterrent, he said. "These parents do not want other families to go through the same horror and pain that they had to endure," Baratta said. "Ultimately, there needed to be accountability for the death and the permanent brain injury to these two victims." Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsSquirrel attacking residents in California town, sending at least 2 to hospitalSep 23, 6:28 PMPoop-like smell at South Carolina school leads to arrest of assistant teacherSep 23, 5:25 PMOregon police recover partial remains of dismembered woman in 80-year-old cold caseSep 24, 7:55 AM12-year-old Catholic school shooting victim makes 'miraculous' recovery, family saysSep 23, 6:52 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
