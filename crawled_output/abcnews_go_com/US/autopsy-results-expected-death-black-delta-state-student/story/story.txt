"They came here to get an education, and folks who threaten the institution are hurting students, and we don't want that. We are supposed to be a place where students come to feel safe and to learn. That's our mission, and that's what we'll continue to do."Ennis noted that a preliminary report released earlier this week by the Bolivar County Coroner's Office "indicates no evidence of foul play."But Ennis, who is white, added, "We recognize that this is not only about facts, it's about emotions, and it's about feelings and the way this loss and how it was discovered affects people's lives. And I'll further say that I admit that I am not adequate to speak to the imagery that this incident raises. I acknowledge my weakness in that regard."Meanwhile, officials confirmed to ABC News that a second man, identified as 35-year-old Cory Zukatis, who is white, was also discovered on Monday, lifeless and hanging from a tree in Vicksburg, about 100 miles south of Cleveland, Mississippi.MORE: FBI investigates death of Black man found hanging in AlabamaInvestigators have not said if any evidence has been uncovered connecting the two deaths.The FBI field office in Jackson, Mississippi, released a statement on Wednesday, saying it is aware of the incident at Delta State and is "in regular contact with local authorities.""If, during the course of the local investigation, information comes to light of a potential federal violation, the FBI is prepared to investigate," the FBI said in its statement.During Wednesday's news conference, Delta State Police Chief Michael Peeler said the investigation of Reed's death remains an "active investigation."
