As alleged, each incident was calculated: Tabitha Bundrick knowingly provided fentanyl-laced drugs to incapacitate her victims so she could steal their personal belongings. As a result of our long-term investigation, she is now facing significant charges," Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement."I want to be very clear to those who think they can get away with drugging and robbing unsuspecting victims: working with our law enforcement partners, we will uncover and prosecute this conduct," Bragg added.In this April 13, 2025 ,file photo the New York State Supreme Court Building is shown in New York.Anthony Devlin/Getty Images, FILEProsecutors said the first death occurred in April 2023, when Bundrick approached Mario Paullan, 42, and his friend in Washington Heights to sell them soap. She then offered to have sex with them in exchange for money, taking the men to an empty apartment she broke into and giving them cocaine laced with fentanyl, according to the DA's office.The friend told police he woke up the next morning with no memory of what happened, their belongings missing, and Paullan dead beside him, according to the DA's office.Paullan's young son submitted a letter to the court in the federal case expressing the pain his father's death has caused."My Dad's death has been the hardest blow life has given me," wrote the son, who was not named in the filing. "I felt like my world collapsed. He told me I had to be the man of the house, to take care of my mother and sister. Now, even though I feel broken inside, I dry my tears so I can hold them and tell them everything will be okay."MORE: Woman indicted for attempting to send ex-husband fentanyl-laced chocolatesAccording to prosecutors, the second death occurred in September 2023, when Bundrick met Miguel Navez, 39, in Washington Heights and went back with him to his apartment, where she also gave him drugs laced with fentanyl.Navez was found dead three days later by his brother, missing all of his personal belongings, according to the DA's office.Popular ReadsMistakenly released Oregon murder suspect arrested after multi-day manhunt: SheriffSep 25, 6:07 PMCoast Guard seizes 5 tons of narcotics worth over $64.5 million in Caribbean Sea bustSep 25, 3:27 AMJudge weighing whether to overturn Sean 'Diddy' Combs' convictionsSep 25, 3:00 PMThe third incident connected to Bundrick occurred in February 2024, when prosecutors allege Bundrick gave Abrihan Fernandez, 34, fentanyl-laced drugs in his apartment, and he died.
