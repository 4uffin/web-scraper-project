It's only making it harder for everyone involved, including the police who are trying to do their job," Charlene said.Robert's mother, Evie O'Rourke, told ABC News affiliate WCVB that her son put himself between the gunman and his family, losing his life to protect them."He did what I'm sure was his instinct to do. Like I said, he was facing the shooter, not trying to get away, and that's what his wife said," O'Rourke said. "I'm still in shock seeing the shooting, but I know he did this: His thought was to take care of his family."Robert was preparing for his daughter's wedding in six weeks, O'Rourke added.Booking photo of suspect Hunter Nadeau from the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office.New Hampshire Attorney General's OfficeFormella said on Sunday that Nadeau is an employee of the country club who has worked there for about a year.
