Santiago/Getty ImagesThe officers entered the apartment, and Rozario at one point grabbed a pair of scissors from a chair in the kitchen and ran at the officers, as his mother, Notan Ava Costa, tried to restrain him, according to police body cam footage. Alongi and Cianfrocco tased Rozario before shooting him five times."They shot him with the tasers, and my brother didn't really go down," Utsho Rozario, Win Rozario's younger brother, who was present at the shooting, said in an interview. "So one of the cops pulled out a gun and shot him as my mother was still hugging him."MORE: NYC sees 'historic' drop in crime, police commissioner saysInitially, police leaders said the officers' actions had been within departmental guidelines, as found by an investigator in the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the oversight agency that reviews complaints against NYPD officers.Popular Reads4 arrested in alleged hate crime attack on transgender woman: PoliceSep 19, 9:31 PMToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on beauty, tech, home and moreSep 25, 1:39 PMAustralia to overhaul comms after Optus emergency call failure linked to 4 deathsSep 22, 12:51 AMJohn Chell, the department's chief of patrol at the time of the shooting, said the situation was "quite hectic, chaotic and dangerous right away," and the officers were within their authority to tase and shoot Rozario to de-escalate the situation.However, last week, the Civilian Complaint Review Board voted to overrule the investigator who found Alongi and Cianfrocco innocent, finding the pair of officers in violation of using excessive force and abusing their authority.MORE: 16-year-old with a loaded gun threatened to shoot up his NYC high school, police sayPatrick Hendry, the president of the Police Benevolent Association, the union that represents NYPD officers, believes the charges against Alongi and Cianfrocco are unjustified and unfair."The board simply rubber-stamps its investigators' findings in almost every other case. But in this case, they threw those findings away because they didn't fit a predetermined outcome. The data shows that there are only a few board members who are ever willing to stand up and make an independent decision based on the facts and the law. The rest are either too afraid of the anti-police extremists, or they are extremists themselves. Either way, they have deprived these police officers and all police officers of the fairness guaranteed by the (City) Charter," Hendry said.An inquiry into the shooting by New York Attorney General Letitia James's office is ongoing; there have been no criminal charges filed against them.Related TopicsPolice ShootingsNYPDNew YorkSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on beauty, tech, home and moreSep 25, 1:39 PMAustralia to overhaul comms after Optus emergency call failure linked to 4 deathsSep 22, 12:51 AMTrump admin live updates: Trump announces new tariffs on cabinets, trucks, drugsSep 25, 4:37 PM4 arrested in alleged hate crime attack on transgender woman: PoliceSep 19, 9:31 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us Â© 2025 ABC News
