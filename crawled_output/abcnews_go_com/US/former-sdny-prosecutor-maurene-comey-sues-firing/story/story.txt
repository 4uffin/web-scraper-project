Ted Shaffrey/APFormer Southern District of New York prosecutor Maurene Comey alleged in a lawsuit Monday that her ouster from the U.S. Attorney's office was "unlawful and unconstitutional" and likely happened because of who her father is.Comey, who prosecuted high-profile defendants including Sean Combs, Robert Hadden, Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, was fired in July. Her lawsuit said President Donald Trump, the Justice Department, Attorney General Pam Bondi and other defendants did not identify a cause or provide her due process.Maurene Comey, federal prosecutor in Sean 'Diddy' Combs and Ghislaine Maxwell cases, fired: Sources"In truth, there is no legitimate explanation. Rather, Defendants fired Ms. Comey solely or substantially because her father is former FBI Director James B. Comey, or because of her perceived political affiliation and beliefs, or both," the lawsuit said, referring to the former FBI director who Trump fired during his first term as president because he initiated the investigation into allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election."The politically motivated termination of Ms. Comey -- ostensibly under "Article II of the Constitution" -- upends bedrock principles of our democracy and justice system. Assistant United States Attorneys like Ms. Comey must do their jobs without fearing or favoring any political party or perspective, guided solely by the law, the facts, and the pursuit of justice," the lawsuit said.A representative of the Justice Department declined to comment on the suit when contacted by ABC News.Comey said she had just been assigned a high-profile public corruption case when she received an email on July 16 at 4:57 p.m. with a memo informing her that "your employment with the Department of Justice is hereby terminated, and you are removed from federal service effective immediately."Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey arrives at Federal Court for the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, May 19, 2025, in New York.Ted Shaffrey/APAccording to the lawsuit, Comey's supervisors "were visibly shocked and upset," and Jay Clayton, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, provided no explanation.Popular ReadsAlleged shooter in Charlie Kirk killing had 'obsession' with influencer: FBI4 hours agoTrump admin live updates: Senate confirms Stephen Miran to Fed Board of GovernorsSep 15, 9:06 PM3 killed in US strike on 2nd alleged Venezuelan drug boat, Trump saysSep 15, 6:19 PM"All I can say is it came from Washington.
