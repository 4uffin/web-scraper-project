During that time, they monitored 389 species across 2,992 sites.They found that species abundance, or the number of individual fish, and species richness, the number of unique species, declined by 53.4% and 32%, respectively, in cold streams -- where temperatures are typically below 60 degrees Fahrenheit.Communities within these ecosystems became more distinct, the researchers said. The proportion of larger, late-maturing fish increased, but the abundance and richness of smaller fish decreased, likely due to the introduction of large game fish, according to the paper.A field crew from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency conducts electroshock sampling in a stream in Little Hunting Creek in Virginia.Kevin BiallasHowever, the trends reversed for warm streams, with average temperatures above 75 degrees Fahrenheit. The abundance and richness of fish in warm streams increased by 70.5% and 15.6%, respectively, according to the paper.Communities became more similar in warm streams as well, with smaller fish replacing larger fish.Impacts from temperature were likely to be greater in cold streams because those ecosystems are more sensitive to increasing temperatures, the researchers said. When both were present, it resulted in increased rates of degradation to the local fish biodiversity.MORE: Ocean salt water entering Delaware River due to drought and sea level rise, water managers sayIn addition, changes in temperature and abundance of introduced game fish magnified the impacts of each other, according to the paper.Fish biodiversity is under threat globally as a result of warming temperatures and other environmental factors.Field sampling by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency takes place in Oregon.Adam ThompsonMore than 18,000 fish species live in the freshwater systems around the world -- accounting for nearly 25% of all vertebrates on the planet, according to the paper.
