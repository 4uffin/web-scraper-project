He said the encampment is on private property and that the city's attempts to clear it have been met with resistance by the owner of the property."These homeless encampments are not safe either for the people that are in them, nor are they safe for the surrounding neighborhood. With this particular one, we've been saying this for months. We have been met with resistance for trying to clear this particular encampment," Frey said.In addition to the Annunciation Catholic School shooting, in which the suspect, 23-year-old Robin Westman, died by suicide, Minneapolis police investigated an Aug. 26 mass shooting that left one man dead and five other people wounded in southwest Minneapolis.At the time, O’Hara said the shooter walked up to a group of people standing at the corner of East 29th Street and Clinton Avenue South and unleashed a barrage of at least 30 shots with a high-powered rifle before fleeing.No arrests have been announced.ABC News' Jessica Gorman contributed to this report.Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsIsrael-Gaza live updates: France, UK, Canada recognize Palestinian statehoodSep 21, 12:39 PMTrump admin live updates: Trump at Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 4:09 PM3 killed in 3rd US strike on alleged drug boat in international waters, Trump saysSep 19, 9:50 PM6 children, including infant, locked in Milwaukee storage unit: PoliceSep 16, 5:30 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
