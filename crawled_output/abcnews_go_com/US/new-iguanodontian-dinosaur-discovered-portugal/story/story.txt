Victor CarvalhoPaleontologists have discovered a new species of iguanodontian dinosaur that lived 125 million years ago during the Cretaceous period, they said in a research paper.Examination of fossils found in the Papo Seco Formation in Portugal in 2016 uncovered a species dubbed Cariocecus bocagei, a medium-sized iguanodontian, according to the paper, published last week in the Journal of Systematic Paleontology. Iguanodontians were group of herbivores that also included triceratops and stegosaurs.MORE: Paleontologists discover earliest dome-headed dinosaurResearchers first noticed a 20-inch "rock" with what turned out to be a line of fossilized teeth embedded within it, Filippo Bertozzo, a paleontologist at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and lead author of the paper, told ABC News. After that, he said they found more bones in the area.Based on reconstruction, the paleontologists determined that the one they found did not reach full skeletal maturity.A new species of iguanodontian dinosaur called Cariocerus bocagei that lived about 125 million years ago was found in Portugal.Victor CarvalhoThe specimen differs from other iguanodontians in that its zygomatic bone, or cheek bone, is fused to the upper bone of the jaw. The fusion -- or ossification -- is seen in modern birds, according to the paper.One hypothesis is that the dinosaur needed stronger jaws to bite down on harder fruits or seeds, Bertozzo noted."They are fused -- something that we have never seen in any other iguanodontian," he said.MORE: New massive dinosaur measuring at 39 feet discovered in ChinaIguanodontians originated in South America and dispersed through North America through the Upper Jurassic period, according to the paper.
