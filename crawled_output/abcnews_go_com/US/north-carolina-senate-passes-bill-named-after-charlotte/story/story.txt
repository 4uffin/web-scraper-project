Iryna Zarutska/Instagram One month after Iryna Zarutska was fatally stabbed while riding the Charlotte light rail, the North Carolina legislature passed a bill named after the 23-year-old victim that would issue reforms to the state's criminal justice system.House Bill 307, known as Iryna's Law, seeks to modify the law relating to pretrial release conditions -- specifically for those "charged with a violent offense." The bill proposes removing cashless bail, studying the "intersection between mental health and the judicial system," and adding an "aggravated sentencing factor" to those who commit offenses while a victim was using a public transportation system, according to the bill.Iryna Zarutska in a photo posted to her Instagram.Iryna Zarutska/Instagram The bill passed the Senate on Monday night and the House on Tuesday.
