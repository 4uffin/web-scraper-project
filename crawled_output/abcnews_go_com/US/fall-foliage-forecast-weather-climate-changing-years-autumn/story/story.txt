David Ake/Getty ImagesMuch of the country usually does not see peak foliage until October.In some areas, the leaves begin to change as soon as August and peak in September, like parts of the Rocky Mountains, as well as Alaska and spots in the Cascade Mountains.As fall progresses, foliage gradually changes its colors from north to south. Much of the West and Upper Midwest, as well as some spots in the Northeast, see their peak foliage by mid-October.By November, much of the Southeast, lower Midwest and southern Plains will have seen their peak foliage come and go.MORE: Fall 2025 forecast: What to know as most of US set for a warmer fallRegional forecasts for this year's fall foliageExplore Fall told ABC News that they use fall foliage climatology over the past 20 years, weather data, drought and soil moisture information, satellite data, ground reports and their own foliage modeling system to produce their predictions and current reports.Here are their regional forecasts for this year's fall foliage:Northeast: Due to high stress conditions for trees resulting from exceptionally low soil moisture and increasing drought conditions, some popular leaf peeping spots will experience a short-lived and less vibrant peak foliage compared to normal years. Southeast: Although parts of the region are beginning to experience drier conditions, much of the Southeast will experience conditions typical for early fall. Much of the Southeast, especially the southern Appalachians, remains on track for an on-time and vibrant peak foliage.Midwest: Some areas of the southern Great Lakes and Ohio Valley will likely see muted colors during peak foliage due to increasing drought conditions. However, places further north, like the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and most of Wisconsin, look to be in a good spot to see an on-time and vibrant peak foliage.West: Widespread severe drought conditions across much of the Rocky Mountains will likely lead to an early peak foliage with muted colors, with early color already appearing.MORE: How small Northeast towns are combatting fall foliage social media frenzyWhy do leaves change color?As the days get shorter and temperatures cool down during the fall, trees and other plant life get less sunlight needed to stay alive.Chlorophyll is a key part of the plant that turns sunlight into sugars for the plant and is responsible for the green colors seen in plants.Explore Fall, a website that provides resources and tools to track the changing colors of leaves, is predicting an earlier and quicker fall foliage peak for the millions of people looking to see this year's natural spectacle.Explore FallThe chlorophyll begins to gradually break down as the plants prepare for winter, allowing for the yellow and orange colors of the leaves to become more visible.Popular ReadsIsrael-Gaza live updates: Palestinian president can address UN virtuallySep 19, 2:14 PMTyler Robinson said he killed Charlie Kirk because he 'spreads too much hate'Sep 16, 5:18 PMToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on fall sweaters, headphones and moreSep 19, 11:00 AMAccording to the Michigan State University Forestry Extension, the most vivid displays of fall foliage come after a stretch of warm days with plenty of sunshine and cool nights. This allows for more sugars in the leaves to be left behind when the trees begin to transition into winter mode, producing vibrant red and sometimes purple leaves.How the changing climate is impacting fall foliageSeveral experts and groups have made connections between the fall foliage and the weather and climate.The MSU Forestry Extension notes that factors such as late fall warmups or strong winds before peak foliage that knock down leaves can negatively impact fall foliage.An aerial view of colorful fall foliage in Vermont, Oct. 13, 2024. Lokman Vural Elibol/Anadolu via Getty ImagesSoil moisture also plays a huge role, with the MSU Forestry Extension adding that ample precipitation is required for the most robust displays of color. Any drought conditions experienced during the late spring or summer can delay peak foliage and mute the colors."Fall foliage colors are not as bright compared to wet years, where the trees were able to produce a lot of sugars, and where they had a nice growing season and they were quite happy," said Dr. Mukund Rao, assistant research professor at Columbia University."Compared to historical averages, most years have been trending later, but this year is going to be earlier and shorter because of the extreme drought we're facing," said Jim Salge, a meteorologist turned fall foliage photographer and forecaster for Newengland.com and Yankee Magazine.MORE: Almost half of the US is experiencing drought.
