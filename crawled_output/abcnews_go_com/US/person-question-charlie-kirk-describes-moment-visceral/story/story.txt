It was just so visceral what I saw in front of me."Since the shooting death of Kirk on Wednesday, Kozak says that he has since reached out to the police and been questioned by the FBI.Arriving to the event about half an hour before it began, Kozak says that he knew he wanted to ask Kirk a question and had a few different topics prepared. When he got to the event, he told a staff member that he disagreed with Kirk and had a question for him.He was subsequently directed to a specific area where people who had questions were waiting. Kozak says staff came around asking the group for their questions and, when informed that they liked his question, he was told that he would be second up to the podium.When Kozak got to the microphone, he says he was instructed not to touch it and estimates that he was about 5 to 10 feet away from Kirk.Then the shot rang out.A law enforcement officer stands guard in front of the tent where U.S. right-wing activist and commentator Charlie Kirk was shot while speaking during a Utah Valley University event, in Orem, Utah, U.S. September 10, 2025, in this screen grab from social media video.
