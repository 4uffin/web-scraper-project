The second piece of evidence was a letter Erik Menendez wrote to his cousin eight months before the murders detailing his alleged abuse; the cousin testified about the alleged abuse at trial, but the letter -- which would have corroborated the cousin's testimony -- wasn't unearthed until several years ago, according to the brothers' attorney.Erik Menendez attends his Board of Parole hearing online from the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, Calif., August 21, 2025.California Department Of Corrections via ReutersThe judge said the 1988 letter from Andy Cano, the cousin, about alleged abuse was not very strong, even saying it contradicted the brothers' attempts at a new trial."Neither piece of newly discover (sic) evidence is particularly strong," Judge William Ryan wrote in the decision. "The Cano Letter contradicts in part the testimony of Erik and Cano. It also only corroborates what was already discussed at length by both witnesses: the two discussed Jose's abuse. At best, it does not additionally inform the jury of Petitioners' alleged fear at the time of the murders, and at worse, it puts a crack in the credibility of both witnesses."The judge also disputed the relevance of testimony from Roy Rossello, the member of Menudo."As for the Rosello Declaration, it corroborates the general allegation that Jose was sexually abusive of boys and young men, but is not relevant to the Petitioners' state of mind at the time of the murders," he continued. "Neither piece of evidence adds to the allegations of abuse that the jury already considered, yet found that the brothers planned, then executed that plan, to kill their abusive father and complicit mother."MORE: What's next for Lyle and Erik Menendez after they were both denied parole?Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman, who is firmly opposed to the brothers' release, filed a response to the habeas corpus petition this month, stating that he "concluded that this petition does not come close to meeting the factual or legal standard to warrant a new trial.""The central defense of the Menendez brothers at trial has always been self-defense, not sexual abuse. The jury rejected this self-defense defense in finding them guilty of the horrific murders they perpetrated; five different appellate state and federal courts have affirmed those convictions, and nothing in the so-called 'new' evidence challenges any of those determinations," Hochman said in a statement. "Our opposition to this 'Hail Mary' effort to obtain a new trial over 30 years later makes clear that justice, the facts, and the law demand the convictions stand."Popular Reads6 children, including infant, locked in Milwaukee storage unit: PoliceSep 16, 5:30 PMMistakenly released Oregon murder suspect arrested after multi-day manhunt: SheriffSep 25, 6:07 PMSpecial election winner in Arizona could be key vote to release Epstein filesSep 23, 11:53 PMSpeaking at a news conference on Tuesday after the judge's decision, Hochman told reporters the judge's decision amounted to "a full kibosh" on the brothers' habeus petition.Hochman repeated the idea that while he doesn't think the brothers should never be released, it's still too soon. "Not never, but not yet," he said, saying the brothers have never come clean about their "self-defense" in the case.Lyle Menendez attends his Board of Parole hearing online from the Richard J.
