The agencies, though, point to unverified threats they are picking up, as well as recent episodes of political violence and the fact that there have been threats toward political targets in Arizona.Items are displayed in the makeshift memorial for Charlie Kirk outside the headquarters of Turning Point USA on September 17, 2025, in Phoenix, Arizona.Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesLone offenders, according to the document, remain the top threat, but there are also concerns about domestic extremists and foreign terror organizations.William Mack, the Secret Service special agent in charge of the Phoenix field office, said in a statement that the Secret Service has been designated as the federal coordinator for the funeral."Our teams are already on the ground in Phoenix and Glendale, working side-by-side with state, local, and federal partners," Mack said. "Together, we are fully committed to ensuring that these solemn events receive the comprehensive protection and support they require."Some of those local police officers include officers from the Glendale, Arizona, police department.Popular ReadsHow to watch the Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 9:19 AMCharlie Kirk memorial updates: 'I forgive him,' Erika Kirk says of alleged shooterSep 21, 7:22 PMTrump poised to fire US attorney for resisting effort to charge NY AG: SourcesSep 19, 5:44 PMThe department is navigating a heightened security threat amid expectations of a massive crowd at Charlie Kirk's memorial service on Sunday.MORE: Charlie Kirk shooting suspect's conditions for surrender had to be 'gentle': Sheriff"We will not be surprised if more than 100,000 people show up," said Jose Santiago, public information officer for the Glendale Police Department.He says they expect people to travel in from across the country and begin lining up for the first-come, first-served service by 2 a.m. on Sunday, if not before. The parking lot opens at 7:00 a.m., local time. Camping in the area will not be allowed."Officers will be anywhere the eye can see, and in places it can't," said Santiago, referring to aircraft, many drones in the air and helicopters at the ready.The Department of Public Safety and Secret Service will be running the show inside State Farm Stadium.MORE: Security analysts flag rise in Russian-created misinformation posts on social media following Kirk shootingDerek Mayer, the former assistant special agent in charge of the Secret Service's Chicago field office, who oversaw large-scale events, told ABC News the designation allows for a "whole of government approach.""DHS regularly declares events around the nation as SEAR-level to ensure the safety of those in attendance," Mayer, now the chief security officer and vice president of executive protection at P4 said."This designation allows for a 'whole of government' approach, which means many different local, state and federal agencies will supply resources and manpower to guarantee extra security measures are in place. With President Trump and many other high-profile individuals expected to attend, along with the amount of public attention focused on the funeral, it makes sense for DHS to declare this as a SEAR event," Mayer added.The funeral is open to the public, but those who plan to attend are asked to register with Turning Point USA.Related TopicsCharlie Kirk shootingSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsHow to watch the Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 9:19 AMCharlie Kirk memorial updates: 'I forgive him,' Erika Kirk says of alleged shooterSep 21, 7:22 PMArmed man arrested at stadium ahead of Charlie Kirk memorial: OfficialsSep 20, 10:15 PMTrump poised to fire US attorney for resisting effort to charge NY AG: SourcesSep 19, 5:44 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us Â© 2025 ABC News
