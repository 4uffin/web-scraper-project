The largest of the two is the metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP), where the first long bone of the foot (metatarsal) meets the first bone of the toe (phalanx). In turf toe, the MTP joint is injured.The MTP joint is surrounded by important structures that hold it in place and prevent it from dislocating. Together, these structures are referred to as the plantar complex.Injury leads to reduced agility and pain with push-off and walking. It can be a devastating injury in the elite athlete, but also a nuisance in the general population.Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow (9) is assisted to the locker room with an injury in the second quarter at Paycor Stadium.Sam Greene/IMAGN via Reuters ConnectThe Anderson classification system for turf toe is split into three grades.In Grade I, the plantar complex has been stretched, causing pinpoint tenderness and slight swelling.Grade II involves a partial tearing of the plantar complex, which causes more widespread tenderness, moderate swelling, and bruising. Movement of the toe is limited and painful.In Grade III, the plantar complex is completely torn, causing severe tenderness, severe swelling, and bruising. It is difficult and painful to move the big toe.The severity of Burrow's injury is unclear.MORE: Suspects in Joe Burrow's home burglary face additional chargesHow does a turf toe injury occur?A turf toe injury happens when the toe is forcibly bent up into hyperextension, such as when pushing off into a sprint and having the toe get stuck flat on the ground.Turf toe can occur during many sports, such as basketball, soccer and gymnastics. It is most commonly described in football and more common in athletes who play on an artificial field, since it is more rigid than a natural grass field.Between 30 and 45% of professional American football players claim that they have experienced turf toe, according to the National Institutes of Health. Running backs, quarterbacks, and wide receivers were the most common positions to suffer turf toe injuryAthletic shoes designed for artificial surfaces are softer and more flexible, providing the athlete with more agility, but much less stability in the forefoot.However, the prevalence of the injury has decreased with more frequent use of modern turf, which behaves in a way more similar to natural turf.MORE: 4 arrested in connection with burglary at Joe Burrow's houseHow is turf toe treated?X-rays and MRI can help diagnose the disease and determine its severity.

Do not apply ice directly to the skin.-- Compression: To help prevent additional swelling, wear an elastic compression bandage.-- Elevation: To reduce swelling, recline when you rest, and prop your leg up so it is higher than your heart.Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow (9) grimaces aft being sacked by Jacksonville Jaguars defensive tackle Arik Armstead (91) during the first half of an NFL football game, Sept. 14, 2025, in Cincinnati.Carolyn Kaster/APA stiff-sole shoe or rocker bottom sole can also help limit motion. For more severe injuries, a controlled ankle motion (CAM) boot or walking cast can help minimize motion at the joint to allow it to heal. Once the injury is stable, it is important to begin progressive motion.In addition, over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, can help provide symptom relief.Although the vast majority of turf toe injuries can be treated successfully with conservative management, there are instances where surgery is required to allow the athlete to return to play.Physical therapy may be helpful and should begin as soon as symptoms allow. Ask your doctor before returning to physical activity.MORE: Buffalo Bills star Damar Hamlin's on-field collapse puts spotlight on cardiac arrest in young peopleWhat is the prognosis for a turf toe injury?Less severe injuries can take from two to six weeks to heal, but more severe injuries can take up to 12 months to fully recover.Some cases result in incomplete recovery, joint stiffness, or an arthritic toe. Prevention of re-injury is paramount to avoiding long-term effects.Most patients have a good outcome, but future toe protection is highly recommended to prevent a recurrence.Injuries can result in long-term pain and disability if not properly diagnosed and treated.Long-term complications can include lack of push-off strength, stiffness, bunion and cocking up of the big toe.Short-term complications can include infections, scar formation and development of non-cancerous tumor-like growths on a nerve.To prevent turf toe, athletes' athletic footwear must be supportive and appropriate to the surface on which they compete.An injured athlete also needs instruction on flexibility and strengthening exercises for the ankle and foot to increase their ability to withstand the stresses from their athletic activities.Big toes play a critical role for quarterbacks, who rely on the mobility the appendage offers, ESPN reported.Deandre Tate-Drummer, MD, MPH is a General Surgery resident physician in Metro Atlanta, Georgia and a member of ABC News' Medical Unit.Related TopicsNFLSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular Reads'Dancing with the Stars' season 34: Everything to knowSep 24, 6:33 PMEmmy Awards 2025 recap: Best photos from TV's biggest nightSep 15, 9:27 AMSmart ways to shop Thanksgiving sales before the holiday rush hitsSep 25, 1:41 PMToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on beauty, tech, home and moreSep 25, 1:39 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
