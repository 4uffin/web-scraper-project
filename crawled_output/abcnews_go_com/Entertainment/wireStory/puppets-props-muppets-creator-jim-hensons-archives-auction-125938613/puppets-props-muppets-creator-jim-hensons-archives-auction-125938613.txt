The Jim Henson Company said this will be the first auction from its archives, making the announcement Wednesday on what would have been its founder's 89th birthday. Henson, who died in 1990 at age 53, brought to life a host of beloved Muppets characters — from Kermit the Frog to Miss Piggy to the Swedish Chef. He also brought his artistry and creativity to “Sesame Street” and “Fraggle Rock” and to the 1980s movies “The Dark Crystal” and “Labyrinth.”The auction comes as The Jim Henson Company is celebrating its 70th anniversary. More than 400 items — props, costumes, set pieces, autographed memorabilia, posters and puppets — will be available. They were selected from tens of thousands of pieces, said Karen Falk, director of the company's archives.
