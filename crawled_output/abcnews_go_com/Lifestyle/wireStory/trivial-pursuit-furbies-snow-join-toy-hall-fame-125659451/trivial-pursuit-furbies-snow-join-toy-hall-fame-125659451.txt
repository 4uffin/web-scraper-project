(Strong’s National Toy Hall of Fame via AP)The Associated PressLater this year, the National Toy Hall of Fame could induct snow — yes, the cold, white stuff that falls from the sky. But only if it ices out enough of the competition — a group that features hugely popular board games, outdoor favorites and giggling plushies. The Hall of Fame announced its 12 finalists for the Class of 2025 Wednesday and opened voting to the public and a panel of judges who will choose which few will be honored in November.Along with snow, the contenders include tabletop favorites Battleship, Catan, Connect Four, Spirograph and Trivial Pursuit, as well as crowd-pleasers — scooters, slime and cornhole. The “Star Wars” lightsaber, Furby and Tickle Me Elmo round out the finalists chosen from among the thousands of nominees the Toy Hall of Fame receives each year.“This year’s contenders present some playful matchups," said Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator.Along with a slate of board games and tactile materials like snow and slime, he said, “There’s also Tickle Me Elmo and Furby — two technological icons of the 90s toy world — battling it out.” “I’m always excited to see where the judges and public come out in their votes," Bensch said. "At the end of the day, the playful debates just go to show how much personal and cultural relevance these toys have for us all.”The public has a week, until Sept. 24, to vote for their favorites. The three top vote-getters will make up a “Player's Choice” ballot to be counted alongside 22 other ballots from a panel of historians, educators and other experts. The winners will be announced in November by The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York, where the Hall of Fame is located.While anyone can nominate a toy, the ones that make it into the hall have to be considered icons, have engaged multiple generations, fostered creativity, or profoundly changed play or toy design.Last year, My Little Pony, Transformers action figures and the Phase 10 card game were honored, bringing to 87 the number of toys inducted since the Hall of Fame was established in 1998.— Battleship: Milton Bradley has sold more than 100 million copies of the strategy game since introducing its plastic warships and pegboard version in 1967. Originally a pencil-and-paper game, Battleship was among the first board games to be computerized in 1979.— Catan: Known earlier as Settlers of Catan, the game first published by Kosmos in Germany was one of the first German-style board games to achieve popularity outside of Europe. More than 45 million copies in 40 languages have sold since it was introduced in 1995. It has inspired dozens of spinoffs and new editions, including electronic versions, and even a cookbook.Popular ReadsTrump admin live updates: In major shift, Trump says Ukraine can win back seized landSep 24, 11:03 AM'Your countries are going to hell': Trump bashes UN, world leaders in speechSep 23, 12:55 PMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PM— Connect Four: Players drop discs into a grid in hopes of being the first to get four in a row.
