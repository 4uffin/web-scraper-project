Experts weigh inWhite House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller singled out "antifa" as a target the administration is looking to go after, alleging without evidence that "antifa" has been responsible for "riots, the attacks on ICE officers, the doxing campaigns and other political assassinations.""It is sophisticated as well-funded. It is well-planned. There is really no parallel like this, anything to anything else in the country right now," Miller said. "There is an entire system of feeder organizations that provide money, resources, weapons. And when they're attacking ICE officers, they're attacking federal buildings. Whether isolating public officials for harassment, doxing, intimidation, and ultimately attempted assassination, it is all carefully planned, executed and thought through. It is terrorism on our soil."Antifa is not a group, but rather a political philosophy or movement. The term comes from the longer "anti-fascist" and is used as a catchall for groups that oppose the concept of authoritarianism, neo-Nazism and white supremacy.MORE: Trump, Vance direct blame at Democrats for Dallas ICE shootingFBI Director Kash Patel echoed Miller's claims and warned that the combined forces of the law enforcement and other agencies would "root out this new evil that is perpetrating our criminal activities across our societies."
