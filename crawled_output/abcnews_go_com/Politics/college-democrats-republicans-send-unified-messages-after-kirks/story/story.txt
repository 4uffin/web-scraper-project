Anthony Cherry, vice president of the Young Democrats, added that young leaders must "make political nonviolence our pledge," warning that "when our dialogue becomes toxic it has unimaginable consequences."MORE: Erika Kirk delivers emotional remarks to the nation after killing of husband Charlie KirkIn a phone interview, Naylor told ABC News that Kirk's death "hit home with a lot of activists" who came of age watching his videos and campus debates.
