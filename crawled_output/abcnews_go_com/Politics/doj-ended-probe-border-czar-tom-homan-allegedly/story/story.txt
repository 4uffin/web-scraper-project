Officials briefed Justice Department leadership about it in the early days of Trump’s presidency as part of their ongoing efforts to vet personnel who had been appointed to senior leadership posts in his administration, the sources said.Investigators at the time were still working to determine whether Homan would have followed through on arranging the government contracts, as some in the Justice Department questioned the legal viability of charges in a scenario where Homan had proposed the government contract when Trump’s election victory wasn’t yet guaranteed, according to the sources.White House "Border Czar" Tom Homan walks toward reporters before answering questions outside the White House, September 8, 2025.Win Mcnamee/Getty ImagesThe investigation, first reported by MSNBC and The New York Times, began in 2024 and was based out of the Western District of Texas.The Homan encounter was recorded by the undercover agents and the probe stretched into the Trump administration, where internal discussions were held over whether charges were warranted before the DOJ and FBI shut it down, the sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.MORE: Trump says he is appointing Lindsey Halligan, one of his former attorneys, to lead key prosecutor's officeThe shuttering of the investigation, which was formalized in the early days of the Trump administration, has raised concerns among current and former officials about the Trump administration further politicizing the Justice Department by protecting high-profile officials from legal scrutiny.Popular ReadsIndianapolis mass shooting leaves 7 shot, 2 fatally: PoliceSep 21, 4:18 PMSupreme Court allows Trump firing of FTC commissionerSep 22, 4:02 PMTrump says he is appointing former defense attorney to lead key prosecutor's officeSep 20, 11:05 PMABC News requests for comment from the Justice Department, FBI and White House did not receive a response.
