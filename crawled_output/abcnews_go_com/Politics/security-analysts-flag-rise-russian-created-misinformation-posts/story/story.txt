"And in our current threat environment, that is dangerous."Cohen stressed that the threat from these online trolls is growing tremendously with each major news event and law enforcement is playing "catch-up."He warned that social media users need to be extra cautious before they fall for any traps.Analysts with the two groups found that social media sites were on fire with incendiary posts after the shooting.Following the attack, analysts identified roughly 26,000 posts that expressed either concerns about or a desire for civil war. Posts in support of war suggest it to be a necessary retaliation against "the left,” according to the organizations' analysis.A rally attendee holds a sign facing cars as they pass by as people gather during a rally hosted by the Michigan Republican Party to remember conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot during an event at Utah Valley University, in Lansing, Mic., Sept. 15, 2025.Emily Elconin/ReutersMore than 46,000 posts on the social media platform X right after the shooting that discussed the incident contained the word “trans,” a majority of which wrongly speculated the shooter was transgender, according to CIS and ISD.Representatives from X did not return messages for comment.Investigators are still working to probe Kirk's death on Sept. 10 and charged 22-year-old Tyler Robinson Tuesday with several criminal counts, including aggravated murder. Preliminary information has shown that the suspect targeted Kirk, the controversial conservative influencer, over his far-right rhetoric.Tyler Robinson said he killed Charlie Kirk because he 'spreads too much hate': OfficialsThe inflammatory posts identified by the two groups went beyond just words, according to the analysts.One inflammatory post included a video “masquerading” as content from the outlet France24, falsely claiming a French official urged LGBTQ+ Americans to relocate to France to “avoid persecution.”Another post falsely claimed the BBC warned attacks against conservative leaders "would spread to Europe."A social media post manufactured a false quote from actor Pedro Pascal responding to a fabricated statement from President Donald Trump, according to CIS and ISD.Popular ReadsBillionaire MacKenzie Scott gifts $70 million for historically Black universitiesSep 23, 6:34 PMDOJ official directs prosecutors to prepare probes of George Soros' foundationSep 25, 3:22 PMFlorida convenience store worker charged with shooting off-duty police officer deadSep 16, 8:03 PMThe groups said a large bot network has promoted these posts.Thomas Warrick, a senior fellow and director of the Future of DHS Project at the nonprofit think tank the Atlantic Council, told ABC News that the incendiary posts are part of the online misinformation playbook used by foreign adversaries that aims to enrage users across the political spectrum.People participate in a demonstration against the planned deployment of National Guard troops in Chicago, Sept. 6, 2025.Kamil Krzaczynski/AFP via Getty Images"These hostile actors see this as an opportunity and they will weigh in not only on one side," he said.Elected officials have noticed the inflammatory posts and called them out.Utah Gov. Spencer Cox told reporters Thursday that law enforcement officials have seen "bots from Russia, China, all over the world that are trying to instill this information and encourage violence,” by posting disinformation online.In an appearance Sunday on "This Week," Cox referenced social media, saying "I think we have to look really hard at what's just occupying nearly 100% of brain weight of not just the youth, but of all generations, and what's coming across, and actually what we're allowing to come across -- and there's just zero liability for what people are putting out there."Some of the inflammatory posts appear to echo the rhetoric used by elected officials and leaders.Attorney General Pam Bondi claims 'left-wing radicals' killed Charlie KirkAttorney General Pam Bondi blamed "left-wing radicals," for the shooting in an interview with ABC News on Monday, but did not offer any motive.The same day, Vice President JD Vance slammed liberals for Kirk's death in a podcast, claiming there was "festering violence on the far left.""People are feeling strongly about the situation, and that's being amplified," Cohen said. " We have a witches' brew of volatility that, if not calmed, could spark more violence."Warrick said there needs to be a stronger effort from national security officials to combat foreign online influencers and said social media companies need to step up their efforts to remove the accounts and posts associated with the nefarious groups. In the end, he warned, combating misinformation comes down to the social media user.Protesters rally against National Guard deployment and President Trump as they march on Capitol Hill, Sept. 2, 2025.Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Warrick said that no matter how passionate a person is about their personal politics or beliefs, it's important they remain vigilant about what they see online, should not engage with any post or user that appears illegitimate, especially if the post aligns with their opinions, and block and report those posts. "The best thing for most people is to disconnect, don't encourage them by responding, and do not repost," he said. "Try to reduce their metrics. It's one of those things where you don't want to spread inauthentic content, even if you're commenting on the post."Related TopicsCharlie Kirk shootingRussiaSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsBillionaire MacKenzie Scott gifts $70 million for historically Black universitiesSep 23, 6:34 PMFlorida convenience store worker charged with shooting off-duty police officer deadSep 16, 8:03 PMDOJ official directs prosecutors to prepare probes of George Soros' foundationSep 25, 3:22 PMChina cancels schools and flights as it braces for typhoonSep 22, 11:01 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
