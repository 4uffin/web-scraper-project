James Comer speaks to reporters after leaving the House Republicans weekly caucus meetings on Capitol Hill on September 9, 2025 in Washington.Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesHouse Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Republican, rejected calls for a professional handwriting expert to analyze the signature on the letter allegedly sent by President Donald Trump for Jeffrey Epstein's 50th "birthday book.""I don't," Comer said when asked on Wednesday whether he supports calls for an independent analysis.The day before, the White House said it would support a review by a professional handwriting expert.President Trump, in his first extensive comments on the matter since House Oversight Democrats made public the drawing and note, said the signature and note is not his.'It's not my signature': Trump says about alleged Epstein 'birthday book' letter"It's not my signature. And it's not the way I speak. And anybody that's covered me for a long time, knows that's not my language,” Trump said when asked by ABC News on Tuesday evening."It's nonsense," Trump added.Comer on Wednesday said the birthday letter has "absolutely nothing to do with the overall investigation," as committee investigators refocus their efforts and pour through financial records from the Epstein estate in New York."Honestly, when you look at what's the purpose of this investigation, it's to try to provide justice to the victims and try to get the truth about what went on on Epstein Island, and to answer the question, ‘Was the government involved? I don't think a birthday card 20 years ago has any relevance whatsoever," Comer said.Rep.

Sources tell ABC News that committee staff will continue those efforts on Thursday.Trump's alleged letter among 'Friends' section in Epstein's birthday book "When we met privately with the victims and their attorneys, they said that one area they wish we would investigate is the bank records," Comer said.Popular ReadsHegseth unveils new restrictions on Pentagon press accessSep 19, 8:50 PMThis state is the latest to sign orders expanding access to COVID-19 vaccinesSep 10, 2:22 PMTrump says he is appointing former defense attorney to lead key prosecutor's officeSep 20, 11:05 PMComer also said that the committee is prepared to release any illegal activity it uncovers through its investigation, but he cautioned that an individual’s association with the convicted sex offender does not necessarily promise guilt."We want to make sure when we release names or names of people that have pretty definitive liability," Comer said.Meanwhile, Democrats on Capitol Hill are calling for more transparency from Republicans and the Trump administration on the Epstein files.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer speaks with reporters just outside the chamber, at the Capitol in Washington, Sept. 10, 2025.J. Scott Applewhite/APSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made a move on Wednesday to force a Senate vote on an amendment that would compel the Department of Justice to release the Epstein files ahead of a vote on the massive must pass defense spending bill."The bottom line is the American people need to see this. Donald trump has lied about this. There was no picture, there was no drawing, there has been so many lies, so much prevarication, so much cover up. The American people, Democrats, independents Republicans are demanding it be made public and it should be. We hope Republicans will vote for it, they should," Schumer said.Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, posted on X on Wednesday: "The note is real. It’s not a hoax.
