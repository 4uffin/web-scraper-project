Kennedy Jr. is now demanding a different approach from the CDC -- one by which the agency reduces its role in Americans’ lives."Mission creep has distracted us from our core mission over the years," O’Neill wrote. "Not every health decision is the government’s business, and CDC need not duplicate the work of other divisions."MORE: Susan Monarez, former CDC director, tells Senate committee 'true reason' she was firedO’Neill, the HHS deputy secretary whom Kennedy appointed to be CDC’s acting director after Susan Monarez’s dismissal last month, said the agency had "lost the American public trust and faith" during the pandemic but that HHS’ new leadership is "working hard to refocus and earn that trust back.""Rigorous science, transparency about data and reasoning, and treating our fellow citizens as adults who can make their own informed decisions will be well received whenever we can offer them," he added.Technically, the CDC only offers guidance and does not have the ability to mandate people’s behavior; things such as school vaccine mandates, for instance, are decided upon and implemented at the state level.Fiona Havers, a former CDC official who worked on vaccine policy, told ABC News, “CDC has always treated Americans like adults by providing them with the science-based evidence and guidance they need to make their own decisions."MORE: Sen.
