Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James. "Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff, and Leticia???" Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday evening, directly addressing Attorney General Pam Bondi. "We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!"Lindsey Halligan, special assistant to the president, speaks with a reporter outside of the White House, Aug. 20, 2025.Jacquelyn Martin/AP, FILETrump says he is appointing Lindsey Halligan, one of his former attorneys, to lead key prosecutor's officeAccording to sources, Halligan’s deputy -- a prosecutor who was briefly assigned to lead the office just a day before Trump appointed Halligan to the high-profile position -- has also expressed reservations about bringing the politically charged case. Halligan has been spotted at DOJ headquarters in Washington, D.C., at least twice this week for meetings which, in part, centered around the Comey matter, sources said. The United States Attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia -- which prosecutes the bulk of the country’s national security cases -- has been thrown into tumult amid Trump’s campaign to push for prosecutions of his political adversaries. Trump officials pressuring federal prosecutors to bring criminal charges against NY AG Letitia James: SourcesErik Siebert, Trump’s previous nominee to the position, resigned from the office after sources said he refused to bring charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James over unfounded allegations of mortgage fraud.Popular ReadsTrump demands investigation into alleged 'sabotage' of UN escalator, teleprompterSep 24, 6:33 PMWhat we know about Dallas ICE sniper suspect Joshua JahnSep 25, 3:26 PMDOJ official ordered to rescind inquiry to FBI agent who sued Alex Jones: SourcesSep 24, 3:11 PMTrump later claimed he "fired" Siebert and quickly installed Halligan into the position, as he continued to make unprecedented calls for the speedy prosecution of his political foes.  "I just want people to act, they have to act, and we want to act fast," Trump said on Saturday. "They were ruthless and vicious. I was impeached twice. I was indicted five times. It turned out to be a fake deal. And we have to act fast, one way or the other, one way or the other: they're guilty, they're not guilty. We have to act fast. If they're not guilty, that's fine. If they are guilty, or if they should be charged, they should be judged. And we have to do it now."The government could shut down in less than a week. Here's what you need to knowTrump has long criticized Comey, who briefly served as the director of the FBI during Trump’s first term but was fired over his handling of an investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The Department of Justice launched an investigation into Comey earlier this year after FBI Director Kash Patel claimed to discover "burn bags" containing sensitive documents at the FBI headquarters related to the Russia probe.In July, CIA Director John Ratcliffe released a review that concluded the 2016 intelligence assessment over alleged collusion was “conducted through an atypical & corrupt process under the politically charged environments” of Comey and former CIA Director John Brennan. When asked about the probe in July, Trump told reporters he believes Brennan and Comey are "truly bad people and dishonest people." "I will tell you, I think they're very dishonest people. I think they're crooked as hell. And, maybe they have to pay a price for that," Trump said.Comey and Brennan have both stood by the integrity of the 2016 intelligence assessment, arguing its findings on Russia's interference in the election were bolstered by bipartisan congressional investigations as well as former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation on ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. Related TopicsJames ComeySponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTrump demands investigation into alleged 'sabotage' of UN escalator, teleprompterSep 24, 6:33 PMDOJ official ordered to rescind inquiry to FBI agent who sued Alex Jones: SourcesSep 24, 3:11 PMRFK Jr. launches FDA review of abortion pillSep 24, 9:00 PMWhat we know about Dallas ICE sniper suspect Joshua JahnSep 25, 3:26 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
