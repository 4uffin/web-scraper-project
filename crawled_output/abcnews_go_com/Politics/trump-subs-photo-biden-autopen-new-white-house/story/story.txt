The White HousePresident Donald Trump is once again making decorative changes to the White House -- disparaging former President Joe Biden in the process. The White House has installed a new presidential portrait gallery along the West Wing Colonnade, unveiling the wall of photos on Wednesday. While the new "Presidential Walk of Fame" features portraits of all the presidents in gilded frames, Biden's portrait is replaced with a picture of an autopen. A new “Presidential Walk of Fame” has been built along the West Wing Colonnade featuring portraits of all the Presidents in gilded frames, however, rather than putting up former President Joe Biden’s portrait, a picture of an autopen making Biden’s signature is there instead.The White HouseA new “Presidential Walk of Fame” has been built along the West Wing Colonnade featuring portraits of all the Presidents in gilded frames, however, rather than putting up former President Joe Biden’s portrait, a picture of an autopen making Biden’s signature is there instead.The White HouseThe White House called attention to the change on its social media.Trump has long criticized Biden's use of the autopen, a routine method of executing official documents when signatories are unable to sign them. The use of autopen is commonplace on Capitol Hill and in the White House and has been used by former presidents on both sides of the aisle.Trump has pushed unfounded claims that Biden didn’t understand what was going on during his presidency because of his use of an autopen to sign legislation and pardons. Trump has suggested that the pardons Biden signed using the technology should be considered null and void.Trump doubles down on claims, without evidence, that Biden aides illegally used autopenBiden has pushed back on Trump's claims."Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false," Biden said in his statement.A new “Presidential Walk of Fame” has been built along the West Wing Colonnade featuring portraits of all the Presidents in gilded frames, however, rather than putting up former President Joe Biden’s portrait, a picture of an autopen making Biden’s signature is there instead.The White HouseTrump has teased in recent weeks that he would make good on this extraordinary move as he continues to disparage Biden’s legacy. Popular ReadsTrump admin live updates: In major shift, Trump says Ukraine can win back seized landSep 24, 11:03 AM'Your countries are going to hell': Trump bashes UN, world leaders in speechSep 23, 12:55 PMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PM"It’s a decision I have to make.

Clinton's portrait was replaced it with a red, white and blue painting of Trump. Then in August, Trump moved portraits of former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush from the entryway of the White House to have a less-prominent position. Related TopicsPresident TrumpPresident BidenSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTrump admin live updates: In major shift, Trump says Ukraine can win back seized landSep 24, 11:03 AMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PM'Your countries are going to hell': Trump bashes UN, world leaders in speechSep 23, 12:55 PMJimmy Kimmel to return to air on TuesdaySep 22, 4:01 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
