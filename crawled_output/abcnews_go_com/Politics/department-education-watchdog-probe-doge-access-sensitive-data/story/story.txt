Elizabeth Warren and a group of her Democratic colleagues sent a letter requesting a probe of the Department of Government Efficiency's alleged "infiltration" of the Education Department's Federal Student Aid office, which handles the nation's $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio.This week, the Education Department's acting Office of Inspector General confirmed it would work to review that data.

She argued the American people should know who is "digging" into their personal data."The American people deserve to know if Elon Musk's DOGE guys had access to private Social Security numbers and income information," Warren told ABC News. "It's about time these amateurs in the Education Department were investigated."Sensitive data that Warren warned could be vulnerable includes anything from borrowers' social security numbers to personal information that is used within the National Student Loan Data Systems.The acting inspector general said it "plans to look into the Department's processes for managing access to several sensitive Department data systems." This will be a coordinated effort with the Government Accountability Office, which is also looking into issues involving access and handling of sensitive data at the department, according to the letter from the acting inspector general.Popular ReadsMudslides trap drivers, bury roads and damage homes in southern CaliforniaSep 19, 8:18 AMWoman reveals new details about relationship with dentist who killed wifeSep 19, 6:10 AMChina cancels schools and flights as it braces for typhoonSep 22, 11:01 PMThe OIG claimed its probe will begin "shortly," but a timeline for when -- or if -- a final report would be issued was not immediately available.In June, the Democratic group of senators accused the Department of Education of refusing to comply with Warren's monthslong congressional investigation into what, if any, records have been accessed by DOGE employees that could be sensitive."The Department of Education has a responsibility to protect student loan borrowers' sensitive data and ensure it doesn't get into the wrong hands," Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján said in a statement to ABC News. "I'm thankful that the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General heeded our call and will now launch an investigation into DOGE's reckless takeover.
