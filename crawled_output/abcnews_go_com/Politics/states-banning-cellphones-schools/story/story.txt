Education experts told ABC News that electronic devices stifle engagement, disrupt learning by causing distractions, and create adverse mental-health issues in adolescents.Thomas Toch, the director of FutureEd -- an education policy center at Georgetown University, said he believes using cellphones in schools is generally problematic with the harm outweighing the good."It's a problem," Toch argued.

"What we have found is that most school districts in Kansas are implementing a bell-to-bell ban."Emergency situationsOne of the top concerns for parents and families is their ability to contact their children in case of an emergency.School safety is the No. 1 priority for educators, according to interviews with city leaders and education officials, especially with the influence of recent school shootings.Stock photo of a student using a cellphone in school.Yacobchuk/STOCK PHOTO/Getty ImagesFor communication purposes, phones can be valuable tools for students during the school day, according to Toch."There could be instances where kids don't ... have a way to communicate with family members -- or don't have an ability to communicate a problem that they see and that they might want to use their phone to alert others to," Toch told ABC News.Celebrating Washington, D.C.'s bell-to-bell policy, D.C. Schools Chancellor Lewis Ferebee argued that if there's an emergency "the last thing we want students to do is to be on their cellphone.""We want them to be focused on the guidance and direction that they will be receiving from adults in the situation," he said.Kansas Commissioner Watson said any school incident is tragic, but he claimed there was "no evidence" to suggest having cellphones helps in the case of an emergency, according to his conversations with law enforcement.In his state, Watson said districts are making their own choices and it's paying off for the students."Kids are more engaged," Watson explained."Kids are happier. There's less bullying that takes place. There's less distractions academically. That daily behavior goes on and on."Related TopicsEducationParentingSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsEmmy Awards 2025 recap: The memorable moments and biggest winnersSep 14, 11:50 PMEmmy Awards 2025: Complete winners listSep 14, 11:20 PMSugar Coke?
