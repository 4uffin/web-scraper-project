You responded under oath, 'Never.' He then asked you, 'Have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton administration?' You responded again under oath, 'No.' Now, as you know, Mr. McCabe, who works for you, has publicly and repeatedly stated that he leaked information to the Wall Street Journal and that you were directly aware of it and that you directly authorized it. Now, what Mr. McCabe is saying and what you testified to this committee cannot both be true. One or the other is false. Who's telling the truth?" Sen.

I stand by the testimony you summarized that I gave in May of 2017," Comey responded.Newly appointed US attorney will attempt to charge James Comey despite prosecutors finding no probable cause: Sources "So your testimony is you've never authorized anyone to leak?
