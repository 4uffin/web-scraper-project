"And importantly, we have to talk about this incredibly destructive movement of left-wing extremism that has grown up over the last few years and, I believe, is part of the reason why Charlie was killed by an assassin's bullet."Since Kirk was fatally shot at a college campus event in Utah on Sept. 10, President Donald Trump and top officials have sought to predominately blame the "radical left" for political violence in the country despite attacks against both Democrats and Republicans in recent years.FBI co-Deputy Director Dan Bongino said Monday on Fox News' "America's Newsroom"
that the suspect arrested in Kirk's fatal shooting -- 22-year-old Tyler Robinson -- had an "obsession" with the conservative influencer, based on the alleged shooter's digital footprint. Robinson was tracking Kirk's events and public appearances through open-sourced information on the internet, according to law enforcement officials familiar with the investigation.Bongino said Robinson "had become more political" before the shooting, though the motivation for the shooting is still not clear. Federal and state law enforcement officials are going through Robinson's electronic devices and are continuing to interview family, friends and associates as they seek more evidence to bolster their case and also establish a motive.Trump struck a similar tone later Monday when asked in the Oval Office about several instances of violence against Democrats.“I never said it's on one side," Trump said. "I say the radical left causes tremendous violence, and they seem to do it in a bigger way. But the radical left really is -- causes a lot of problems for this country. I really think they hate our country."Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday that the suspect was not cooperating with authorities. Asked if investigators have uncovered evidence about Robinson's political ideology, Cox replied, "Well, so far that -- that has come from his acquaintance and his family members. That's where that initial information has come from. Certainly, there will be much more information that is released in the charging documents as they're bringing all of that together."MORE: Republicans blame 'radical left' for Kirk shooting, Democrats reject that claimOnline voter registration records show that Robinson is registered to vote, but is not affiliated with any party. He is listed as being an "inactive" voter, meaning he has not voted in two regular general elections and did not respond to a notice sent by the county clerk.Vance and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, on Monday's show, described how the administration intends to take action against groups they say are responsible for inspiring political violence."We're going to go after the [non-governmental organization] network that foments, facilitates and engages in violence," Vance said. "That's not OK. Violence is not OK in our system, and we want to make it less likely that that happens."Vice President JD Vance hosts an episode of 'The Charlie Kirk Show' at the White House, following the assassination of the show's namesake, in Washington, Sept, 15, 2025.The Charlie Kirk ShowMiller, who on Fox News last month called the Democratic Party a "domestic-extremist organization," said the administration is going to "channel all of the anger that we have over the organized campaign that led to this assassination to uproot and dismantle these terrorist networks.""It is a vast domestic terror movement, and with God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people. It will happen, and we will do it in Charlie's name," Miller said.Miller didn't point to any specific groups.On Fox News' "Hannity" last Friday, Miller suggested the government could pursue charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) or conspiracy charges against certain groups.Vance later claimed, "This is not a both sides problem. If both sides have a problem, then one side has a much bigger and malignant problem and that is the truth."Popular ReadsAlleged shooter in Charlie Kirk killing had 'obsession' with influencer: FBISep 15, 10:38 PMAttorney General Pam Bondi claims 'left-wing radicals' killed Charlie KirkSep 15, 6:58 PM3 killed in US strike on 2nd alleged Venezuelan drug boat, Trump saysSep 15, 6:19 PMDemocrats have criticized the rhetoric from Trump and his top officials. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the chamber's top Democrat, said last week that "finger pointing" would not help cool tensions in the country and highlighted acts of violence against both Democratic and Republican figures."We are not getting the leadership that we need to bring this country together from the White House," Democrat Pete Buttigieg, who served as transportation secretary in the Biden administration, said on NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday. Buttigieg also warned that the "response to this cannot be for the government to crack down on individuals or groups not because of violence, but because they challenge the government politically.""We need to have free and open political debate and a healthy political process in this country," Buttigieg said.A video feed is displayed in the White House Briefing Room as Vice President JD Vance hosts a podcast episode of 'The Charlie Kirk Show' following the assassination of the show's namesake, at the White House, September 15, 2025 in Washington.Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesMORE: Trump doubles down on blaming 'radical left' after vow to go after political violenceTrump on Sunday suggested his government was already working to follow through on his vow to target those he claims contribute to political violence."They're already under major investigation. A lot of the people that you would traditionally say are on the left, already under investigation," Trump said on Sunday.The president, however, provided no additional details and it's unclear what steps, if any, have been taken by his administration. The Justice Department has yet to announce any probes into the matter.A tent bearing the slogan 'The American Comeback Tour' is cordoned off after U.S. right-wing activist, commentator, Charlie Kirk was fatally shot during an event at Utah Valley University, in Orem, Utah, September 10, 2025.Jim Urquhart/ReutersMeanwhile, several prominent conservative figures have called for punishment for people they say have mocked Kirk or celebrated his death online. Some instances have been recorded of institutions or companies firing workers who allegedly posted such sentiments on social media.Vance, on Kirk's show on Monday, encouraged listeners to respond to such social media posts."When you see someone celebrating Charlie's murder, call them out. And hell, call their employer," Vance said.In his closing remarks, Vance said the best way to honor Kirk was to "shine the light of truth like a torch.""I can't promise you this is gonna be easy. Can't promise you that all of us will avoid Charlie's fate. Can't promise you that I will avoid Charlie's fate, but the way to honor him is to shine the light of truth like a torch in the very darkest places," Vance said.Related TopicsCharlie Kirk shootingJD Vance Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsAlleged shooter in Charlie Kirk killing had 'obsession' with influencer: FBISep 15, 10:38 PMAttorney General Pam Bondi claims 'left-wing radicals' killed Charlie KirkSep 15, 6:58 PMKash Patel says others under investigation in Charlie Kirk shooting probeSep 16, 2:52 PM3 killed in US strike on 2nd alleged Venezuelan drug boat, Trump saysSep 15, 6:19 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
