Russian Foreign Ministry via ReutersSecretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met on Wednesday, one day after President Donald Trump called Moscow a "paper tiger" and said Ukraine could win back its seized land.Rubio and Lavrov sat with their delegations on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz was also present.The meeting lasted roughly 50 minutes. Lavrov didn't respond to questions as he left, including whether he was concerned about the shift in tone from Trump or whether the U.S. president had turned his back on Russia.A spokesperson for Rubio released a short statement after the meeting, only saying that Rubio "reiterated President Trump's call for the killing to stop and the need for Moscow to take meaningful steps toward a durable resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war."Members of the delegations, led by Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, attend a meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York CitySeptember 24, 2025.Russian Foreign Ministry via ReutersFor months, Trump had said Kyiv would likely need to cede territory to Russia to end the war. But Trump abruptly reversed after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday."After getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation and, after seeing the Economic trouble it is causing Russia, I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," Trump wrote. "With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option. Why not?"Russia, he suggested, was a "paper tiger" as he criticized its military.It wasn't clear what made Trump change his tune. Zelenskyy said he believed Trump was aware of "more details" and that U.S. intelligence is now more aligned with that of Ukraine's view. It also remains to be seen whether Trump's shift in rhetoric will come with any change in policy.Zelenskyy praises 'well-informed' Trump after president's Russia war pivotRussia pushed back quickly that it was a "bear" not a "paper tiger," and that Trump was mistaken.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Trump "heard Zelenskyy's version of events. Apparently, this version was the reason for the assessment we heard. We cannot agree with everything here.""We will have the opportunity to convey our assessment of recent events to the American side. In particular, [Russian Foreign Minister Sergei] Lavrov will have a meeting," Peskov added.Popular ReadsTrump admin live updates: In major shift, Trump says Ukraine can win back seized landSep 24, 11:03 AM'Your countries are going to hell': Trump bashes UN, world leaders in speechSep 23, 12:55 PMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PMRubio, at a U.N.

"And even that doesn't work without weapons. It's terrible but without it, things will be even worse. There are no security guarantees except friends and weapons.""If it takes pressure on Russia, it must be done and it must be done now otherwise Putin will keep driving the war forward, wider and deeper," Zelenskyy added. "We told you before, Ukraine is only the first and now Russian drones are already flying across Europe, and Russian operations are already spreading across countries ... No one can feel safe right now."Trump on Tuesday said NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft if they enter their airspace.Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday insisted that Trump's statement is "not a shift in position," saying that he is being "responsive to the reality on the ground.""And one of the things I'll say about the president is that he is responsive to the reality on the ground, and the reality on the ground is that number one, we have engaged in incredibly good faith negotiations with both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and I believe the president is growing incredibly impatient with the Russians right now because he doesn't feel like they're putting enough on the table to end the war. That's number one," Vance said.Vance echoed Trump's message that the economic and battlefield reality for Russia is grim amid the years-long conflict.William Taylor, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under Presidents George Bush and Barack Obama, said on ABC News Live that he's cautious to call Trump's statement a complete change of heart, but rather "an acceleration of a trend" toward more support for Ukraine and frustration with Vladimir Putin."Diplomacy likes consistency, of course. Everybody does. But rather than U-turns or flip-flops, I would say this is an acceleration of a trend. There is a trend over the past, say, two months, three months of Trump being irritated with, frustrated with, even pissed off with, Putin," he said. "And by the same token, that three-month period has been up and down a bit, but more cordial, more supportive, more interested in, more admiring of the Europeans, of the Ukrainians, including Zelenskyy. So, I think this is a trend, it's not a smooth trend, but it's in the direction of more support for Ukraine and frustration and anger with Putin," Taylor said.ABC News' Michelle Stoddart and Olivia Osteen contributed to this report.Related TopicsRussiaTrump AdministrationUkraineSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTrump admin live updates: In major shift, Trump says Ukraine can win back seized landSep 24, 11:03 AMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PM'Your countries are going to hell': Trump bashes UN, world leaders in speechSep 23, 12:55 PMJimmy Kimmel to return to air on TuesdaySep 22, 4:01 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us Â© 2025 ABC News
