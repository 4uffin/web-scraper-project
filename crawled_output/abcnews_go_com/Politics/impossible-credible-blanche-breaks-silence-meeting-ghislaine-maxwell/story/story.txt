"She answered them. I didn't -- the point of the interview was not for me to pressure test every single answer she gave, of course not.

My questions were there and whether -- whether her answers were credible or truthful, there's a lot of information out there about — about Mr. Epstein, about her and whether what she said is completely wrong or completely right or a little of both, is for that's the reason why -- why we released the transcript."Blanche then added, "It's really up to the American people to determine what they believe that her answers were credible or whether they found her not credible."Related TopicsJeffrey Epstein caseSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsFormer CDC director tells Senate committee 'true reason' she believes she was firedSep 17, 4:19 PMGov.
