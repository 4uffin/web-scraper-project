To determine whether a witness is credible takes weeks and weeks and weeks," Blanche said on CNN Tuesday night.Todd Blanche, US deputy attorney general, speaks during a press conference in the James S.

"She answered them. I didn't -- the point of the interview was not for me to pressure test every single answer she gave, of course not. The point of the interview was to allow her to speak, which nobody had done before."The government had previously argued Maxwell should be afforded no credibility during her criminal case, citing her "willingness to lie brazenly under oath about her conduct," according to court records.

My questions were there and whether -- whether her answers were credible or truthful, there's a lot of information out there about — about Mr. Epstein, about her and whether what she said is completely wrong or completely right or a little of both, is for that's the reason why -- why we released the transcript."Blanche then added, "It's really up to the American people to determine what they believe that her answers were credible or whether they found her not credible."Related TopicsJeffrey Epstein caseSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsDOJ ended probe of Tom Homan for allegedly accepting $50K in FBI sting: SourcesSep 21, 1:49 PMFormer CDC director tells Senate committee 'true reason' she believes she was firedSep 17, 4:19 PMTrump says he is appointing former defense attorney to lead key prosecutor's officeSep 20, 11:05 PMIsrael-Gaza live updates: France, UK, Canada recognize Palestinian statehoodSep 21, 12:39 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
