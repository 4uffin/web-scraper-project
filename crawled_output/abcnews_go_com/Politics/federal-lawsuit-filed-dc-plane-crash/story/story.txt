Operators of a commercial aircraft cannot run through yellow lights, and they ran blatantly for years, many red lights here by allowing these planes to operate in the navigable space at DCA, knowing that there was massive congestion, that there was a massive intersection between military traffic regarding runways that were unique and required special training that they failed to provide to their pilots, the complaint against American is set out in a way that emphasizes their responsibility," Clifford said.Popular ReadsTrump admin live updates: In major shift, Trump says Ukraine can win back seized landSep 24, 11:03 AM'Your countries are going to hell': Trump bashes UN, world leaders in speechSep 23, 12:55 PMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PMRachel Crafton, whose husband Casey was killed in the collision, said in a statement: "Because of systematic failures and reckless disregard for safety, his life, along with 66 others, was taken. Casey was betrayed by this system he trusted -- we all were. As his wife, I cannot stand by and allow his life to be lost in vain."Crafton's lawsuit is requesting a trial by jury and monetary damages from the airline and the U.S. government, with the compensation will be determined by a judge. The average time of a lawsuit of this nature is between two and three years, according to the lawyers.MORE: NTSB questions flight training procedures during hearings over January plane crashBrian Alexander, a partner with the law firm of Kreindler and Kreindler which is also representing the families, said the lawsuit is also against the air traffic controllers who failed to issue a safety alert to the passenger jet, advising it to change course and avoid the collision."The primary duty of an air traffic controller is to separate traffic and to avoid midair collisions. In this particular case, they completely failed to meet that responsibility," Alexander said.In response to the lawsuit, American told ABC that the airline "has a strong track record of putting the safety of our customers and team members above everything else. We continue to support the ongoing NTSB investigation and will defend American and PSA Airlines against any legal action claiming the airline caused or contributed to this accident."The FAA said in a statement "Our hearts go out to the families who lost loved ones on that tragic January evening. Since the accident, [Transportation] Secretary [Sean] Duffy and the FAA have acted decisively to make the skies over our nation's capital safer. We will continue to work closely with the NTSB to ensure no family has to suffer this pain again."Army spokesman Maj. Montrell Russell said in a statement, "Out of respect for the deceased, their families, and the ongoing investigation, it is inappropriate for the Army to comment on litigation. Our primary focus remains on supporting the families and ensuring the safety of our Soldiers and the public. Please direct all inquiries on this matter to the Department of Justice."Brett Shumate, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Civil Division told ABC News in a statement, "While the Department of Justice does not typically comment on ongoing litigation, this lawsuit arises out of a local and national tragedy in which 67 people lost their lives right here in the Nation's capital. Our hearts continue to be with the families. The Department will pursue a just resolution of this matter that follows the facts, the law, and provides fair compensation to the victims of this tragedy."Related TopicsDC plane crash Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTrump admin live updates: In major shift, Trump says Ukraine can win back seized landSep 24, 11:03 AMVideo shows Charlie Kirk shooting suspect jump down from roof, make getawaySep 11, 10:33 PM'Your countries are going to hell': Trump bashes UN, world leaders in speechSep 23, 12:55 PMJimmy Kimmel to return to air on TuesdaySep 22, 4:01 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us Â© 2025 ABC News
