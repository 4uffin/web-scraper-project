Security Council meeting on Ukraine, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said of Trump’s options for penalizing Russia, there would “come a moment in which we will have to conclude that perhaps there is no interest in a peaceful resolution.” “And then the president has before him real options, which he intends to pursue, as he has made clear today in some of the messages he has put out,” Rubio said. The secretary also argued that Trump has shown “extraordinary patience” by not yet levying sanctions against Moscow “in the hopes of having a breakthrough.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio listens as President Donald Trump meets with Argentine President Javier Milei during the United Nations General Assembly, Sept. 23, 2025, in New York.Evan Vucci/AP“He's very committed to peace, but his patience is not infinite, and as he has said repeatedly, he has before him the opportunity and the options of imposing additional economic costs on the Russian Federation, if necessary, in order to bring this to an end,” Rubio said. “He also has before him the option, as he has already chosen to do in some circumstances, to sell defensive weaponry and potentially offensive weaponry so that Ukraine can defend itself from this assault by purchasing that weaponry.” He concluded: “This war needs to end, but if it does not, if there is no path to peace in the short-term, then the United States and President Donald J. Trump will take the steps necessary to impose costs for continued aggression.”
Earlier in his remarks, Rubio also assessed that the war had entered “a period of what appears to be potential even escalation,” citing a historically high number of strikes in recent days as well as incursions by Russian drones and planes into neighboring airspace. -ABC News’ Shannon KingstonSep 23, 2025, 4:01 PM EDTTrump says Ukraine can win back its land from Russia -- a shift from president's previous commentsTrump said in a long social media post Tuesday, after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that he believes that Ukraine is in a position to win back its territory lost to Russia, marking a major shift from the president's previous comments."After getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation and, after seeing the Economic trouble it is causing Russia, I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," Trump wrote.President Donald Trump meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during the 80th United Nations General Assembly, in New York City, New York City, September 23, 2025.Alexander Drago/ReutersTrump has previously called on Ukraine to relinquish some of the territory that has been occupied by Russia over the more than three-year war.Last month, Trump gathered with Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House and said they needed to "discuss the possible exchanges of territory taking into consideration the current line of contact."Trump has talked about land "swapping" but it's unclear what Russia would offer Ukraine in return to keeping some of the Ukrainian territory it has gained since its invasion.In his social media post, Trump said that the war is making Russia look weak, writing that Russia is looking like a "paper tiger.""Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act," the president wrote.-ABC News' Hannah Demissie, Michelle Stoddart and Karen TraversRelated TopicsTrump AdministrationSponsored Content by TaboolaTop StoriesSupreme Court allows Trump firing of FTC commissionerSep 22, 4:02 PM'Your countries are going to hell': Trump bashes UN, world leaders in speechSep 23, 12:55 PMJimmy Kimmel to return to air on TuesdaySep 22, 4:01 PMTrump admin links Tylenol use in pregnancy to increased risk of autismSep 22, 8:22 PMRyan Routh, would-be Trump assassin, tries to stab himself after being found guiltySep 23, 6:04 PMABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
