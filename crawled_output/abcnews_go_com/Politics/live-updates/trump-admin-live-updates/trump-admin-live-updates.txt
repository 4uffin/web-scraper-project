Marco Rubio appears on "Good Morning America," Sept. 23, 2025.ABC News"That's ridiculous. They died because England didn't give enough money, or Canada didn't give more or China didn't. Let's blame the other countries that don't do any foreign aid. How about China? It's the second largest economy in the world and they don't give money?" Rubio said."I think anybody who tells you that somehow the United States, if we cut a dollar somehow we are responsible for some horrific thing going on in the world, is just not true," he said. "No one has died because the United States has cut aid, no," Rubio declared. "We are going to continue to do it, but we will do it the right way and in a responsible way. We aren't going to continue to pour billions of dollars out the door of American taxpayer funds for programs that don't work. And in some cases, flat-out corrupt."-ABC News' Mariam KhanSep 22, 2025, 11:49 PM GMTTrump designates antifa a ‘domestic terrorist organization’Trump signed an executive order designating Antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization.”The order directs federal agencies to "utilize all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations — especially those involving terrorist actions — conducted by Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa."The order also directs any necessary investigations and prosecutions of "those who fund such operations."President Donald Trump walks towards Marine One as he departs for New York from the White House, Sept. 22, 2025.Kevin Lamarque/ReutersThe order that Trump signed describes the organization as one that "recruits, trains, and radicalizes young Americans to engage in this violence and suppression of political activity, then employs elaborate means and mechanisms to shield the identities of its operatives, conceal its funding sources and operations in an effort to frustrate law enforcement, and recruit additional members." The order also claims that antifa members coordinate with other organizations "for the purpose of spreading, fomenting, and advancing political violence and suppressing lawful political speech.""This organized effort designed to achieve policy objectives by coercion and intimidation is domestic terrorism," the order said. It is not immediately clear how the domestic terrorist organization designation would be made for antifa, which is an umbrella description for far-left-leaning militant groups opposing fascists and neo-Nazis. Antifa does not have a publicly known centralized structure or leadership.-ABC News’ Michelle StoddartSep 22, 2025, 10:56 PM GMTLindsey Halligan sworn in as interim US attorneyLindsey Halligan was officially sworn in as the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced on social media Monday.Halligan, who most recently worked in the White House staff secretary's office, represented President Trump for a time during the classified documents investigation.Trump said Saturday that he would appoint his former attorney to lead the key federal prosecutor's office after the previous head, Erik Siebert, resigned his position amid pressure from Trump administration officials to bring a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James.Related TopicsTrump AdministrationSponsored Content by TaboolaTop StoriesJimmy Kimmel to return to air on TuesdaySep 22, 8:01 PMSupreme Court allows Trump firing of FTC commissionerSep 22, 8:02 PMTom Holland suffers concussion while filming 'Spider-Man: Brand New Day'Sep 22, 4:33 PMMan accused of trying to kill Trump rests his defense following chaotic testimonySep 22, 8:15 PMKey takeaways from Charlie Kirk's memorial serviceSep 22, 12:50 AMABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
