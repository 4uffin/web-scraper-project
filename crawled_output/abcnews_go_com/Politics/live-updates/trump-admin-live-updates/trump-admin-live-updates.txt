It is a political philosophy or movement and the term comes from the longer “anti-fascist.” It’s used as a catchall for groups that oppose the concept of authoritarianism, neo-Nazism and white supremacy."We're looking at the funders of a lot of these groups," Trump said. "When you see the signs and they're all beautiful signs made professionally, these are the protesters that make the sign in their basement late in the evening because they really believe that these are anarchists and agitators, professional anarchists and agitators, and they get hired by wealthy people," the president added without evidence.5:21 PM EDTTrump signs memo directing Bondi, Pirro to seek death penalty in DCWeeks after calling for the death penalty to be pursued for any murder that takes place in the nation's capital, President Trump on Thursday signed a presidential memorandum directing Attorney General Pam Bondi and U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro to implement the death penalty in Washington "where the evidence and facts of the case indicate that the death penalty should be used."Though it is unclear what authority Trump and the Justice Department have to seek the death penalty for murders in Washington that are not on federal land or otherwise considered federal crimes, as the city abolished the death penalty in 1981.President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office of the White House, September 25, 2025 in Washington.Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images5:30 PM EDTTrump blames 'radical left rhetoric' for Dallas shootingTrump blamed "radical left rhetoric" for the attack on an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas, Wednesday and also warned that "bad things happen when they play these games."Investigators are still probing the shooting that left one ICE detainee dead but they said that the suspect was targeting ICE agents.
