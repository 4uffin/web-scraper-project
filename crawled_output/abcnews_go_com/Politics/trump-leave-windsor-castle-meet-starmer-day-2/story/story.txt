The British leader called for greater international pressure on Putin, saying Putin's only shown an inclination to move toward peace when Trump has used his influence.Trump said he thought the war would be one of the easiest global conflicts to solve "because of my relationship with President Putin.""But he's let me down," Trump said. "He's really let me down."Trump didn't say what steps he would take to pressure Putin, instead calling on European countries to pull back on buying Russian oil -- something Starmer said would be a "challenge" but agreed some nations are too reliant upon Russia."Very simply, if the price of oil comes down, Putin's gonna drop out. He's gonna have no choice. He's gonna drop out of that war," Trump said.Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Donald Trump attend a joint press conference following their meeting at Chequers, in Aylesbury, central England, on September 18, 2025.Andrew Caballero-reynolds/AFP via Getty ImagesOn the Israel-Gaza conflict, Trump said he had some "disagreement" with Starmer, particularly on the United Kingdom moving to recognize a Palestinian state.Popular ReadsTrump poised to fire US attorney for resisting effort to charge NY AG: SourcesSep 19, 5:44 PM'Your countries are going to hell': Trump bashes UN, world leaders in speechSep 23, 12:55 PMKremlin says Russia is not a 'paper tiger' after Trump criticismSep 24, 4:19 AM"One of our few disagreements, actually," Trump said.Starmer said he and Trump agreed on the need for a roadmap to peace as he called the situation in Gaza "intolerable."Trump focused his remarks on the hostages held by Hamas, saying he wants them released "right now.""We have to have the hostages back immediately," Trump said. "That's what the people of Israel want. They want them back. And we want the fighting to stop. And it's going to stop, but a lot of bad things -- you know, Hamas, said that they're going to put the hostages up as bait. They're going to put the hostages in front of any attack. And that's pretty brutal. We haven't heard that one in a long time.
