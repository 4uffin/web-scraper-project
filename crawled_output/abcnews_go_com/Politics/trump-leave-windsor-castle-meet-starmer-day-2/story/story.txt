The British leader called for greater international pressure on Putin, saying Putin's only shown an inclination to move toward peace when Trump has used his influence.Trump said he thought the war would be one of the easiest global conflicts to solve "because of my relationship with President Putin.""But he's let me down," Trump said. "He's really let me down."Trump didn't say what steps he would take to pressure Putin, instead calling on European countries to pull back on buying Russian oil -- something Starmer said would be a "challenge" but agreed some nations are too reliant upon Russia."Very simply, if the price of oil comes down, Putin's gonna drop out. He's gonna have no choice. He's gonna drop out of that war," Trump said.Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Donald Trump attend a joint press conference following their meeting at Chequers, in Aylesbury, central England, on September 18, 2025.Andrew Caballero-reynolds/AFP via Getty ImagesOn the Israel-Gaza conflict, Trump said he had some "disagreement" with Starmer, particularly on the United Kingdom moving to recognize a Palestinian state.Popular ReadsTrump asks SCOTUS to let him remove Lisa Cook from Fed ReserveSep 18, 1:27 PMErika Kirk elected as new CEO for Turning Point USA after husband's deathSep 18, 1:58 PMTrump admin live updates: Trump says he wants Bagram base in Afghanistan 'back'3 hours ago"One of our few disagreements, actually," Trump said.Starmer said he and Trump agreed on the need for a roadmap to peace as he called the situation in Gaza "intolerable."Trump focused his remarks on the hostages held by Hamas, saying he wants them released "right now.""We have to have the hostages back immediately," Trump said. "That's what the people of Israel want. They want them back. And we want the fighting to stop.
