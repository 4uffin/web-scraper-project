Miller asked in response."We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech -- and that's across the aisle," Bondi responded.Attorney General Pam Bondi claims 'left-wing radicals' killed Charlie KirkBondi's comments quickly gained traction across social media, with some users replying with a 2024 post from Charlie Kirk, in which he wrote: "Hate speech does not exist legally in America. There's ugly speech. There's gross speech. There's evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment. Keep America free.""Someone needs to explain to Ms. Bondi that so-called 'hate speech,' repulsive though it may be, is protected by the First Amendment. She should know this," conservative commentator Brit Hume wrote on X.Attorney General Pam Bond listens as President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office of the White House, Sept. 15, 2025, in Washington.Alex Brandon/APBondi issued a defiant statement from her X account on Tuesday morning in response to mounting backlash."Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. It's a crime," Bondi wrote. "For far too long, we've watched the radical left normalize threats, call for assassinations, and cheer on political violence. That era is over."Popular ReadsTrump admin updates: Trump at Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 4:09 PM13 injured in 2 shootings at homeless encampments in MinneapolisSep 16, 11:42 AMIsrael-Gaza live updates: France, UK, Canada recognize Palestinian statehoodSep 21, 12:39 PMBondi listed out several criminal statutes the Justice Department has historically deployed to prosecute threats of violence."You cannot call for someone's murder. You cannot swat a Member of Congress. You cannot dox a conservative family and think it will be brushed off as 'free speech.' These acts are punishable crimes, and every single threat will be met with the full force of the law," Bondi wrote."Free speech protects ideas, debate, even dissent but it does NOT and will NEVER protect violence. It is clear this violent rhetoric is designed to silence others from voicing conservative ideals," she posted.In a separate interview on Fox News' "Hannity" on Monday evening, Bondi also suggested she has directed the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division to "prosecute" businesses that refuse to print Kirk's pictures for vigils. It is not clear what criminal statute would be relevant in that instance.Bondi's comments come as President Donald Trump and other senior White House officials have repeatedly said they would use the Justice Department in the wake of Kirk's assassination to explicitly target left wing groups.During Trump's first administration, Justice Department officials repeatedly resisted attempts by Trump and the White House to designate Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization -- a move they described as "highly problematic" and which would likely run afoul of the First Amendment.The First Amendment protects the rights of Americans who like spewing "hateful speech" and "assembling with others who share the same hateful views," so "unless an organization engages solely in unprotected activity, such as committing crimes of violence, any designation of a (U.S.-based) organization as a terrorist organization … would likely run afoul of the First Amendment," Mary McCord, the former head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, told a House panel in January of 2020.Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTrump admin updates: Trump at Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 4:09 PM13 injured in 2 shootings at homeless encampments in MinneapolisSep 16, 11:42 AMIsrael-Gaza live updates: France, UK, Canada recognize Palestinian statehoodSep 21, 12:39 PMIndianapolis mass shooting leaves 7 shot, 2 fatally: PoliceSep 21, 4:18 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
