Richard Drew/APPresident Donald Trump delivered a combative speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday morning, lambasting the international body while touting the work of his administration.Trump spared no criticism, beginning with his predecessor former President Joe Biden before taking aim at world leaders on everything from migration to the Russia-Ukraine war."One year ago, our country was in deep trouble. But today, just eight months into my administration, we're the hottest country anywhere in the world, and there is no other country even close," he said at the top of his remarks.The president then turned his attention the United Nations, accusing the organization of ignoring conflicts around the world that he helped solved and not living up to its promise."What is the purpose of the United Nations?" Trump asked. "It has such tremendous, tremendous potential. But it's not even coming close to living up to that potential. For the most part, at least for now, all they seem to do is write a really strongly-worded letter and then never follow that letter up. It's empty words and empty words don't solve war."President Donald Trump addresses the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, in New York City, Sept. 23, 2025.Richard Drew/APTrump threatens Russia sanctions, but says Europe must do moreTrump said the United States is prepared to enforce a "very strong round of powerful tariffs" on Russia should Moscow not be ready to make a peace deal.But he said other countries need to pull back on buying Russian oil "otherwise we're all wasting a lot of time."Popular ReadsUkraine drones attack Moscow as NATO condemns 'irresponsible' Russian incursionsSep 23, 5:49 AMFormer 'The Bear' writer handcuffed on train after alleged complaint from white womanSep 22, 7:39 PM3 key moments that defined Kamala Harris' '107 Days'Sep 23, 12:02 AM"Europe has to step it up.
