Richard Drew/APPresident Donald Trump delivered a combative speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday morning, lambasting the international body while touting the work of his administration.Trump spared no criticism in the hourlong address, beginning with his predecessor former President Joe Biden before taking aim at world leaders on everything from migration to the Russia-Ukraine war."One year ago, our country was in deep trouble. But today, just eight months into my administration, we're the hottest country anywhere in the world, and there is no other country even close," he said at the top of his remarks.MORE: 'Sick to my stomach': Trump distorts facts on autism, Tylenol and vaccines, scientists sayTrump touted the U.S. as having the "strongest" borders, military and relationships around the world.The president then turned his attention the United Nations, accusing it of not living up to its promise and even accused it of bringing on more problems."What is the purpose of the United Nations?" Trump asked. "It has such tremendous, tremendous potential. But it's not even coming close to living up to that potential. For the most part, at least for now, all they seem to do is write a really strongly-worded letter and then never follow that letter up. It's empty words and empty words don't solve war. The only thing that solves war and wars is action."Trump accused the organization of ignoring conflicts around the world that he claims he solved, casting himself as a peacemaker."Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize for each one of these achievements," Trump said. "But for me, the real prize will be the sons and daughters who lived to grow up with their mothers and fathers because millions of people are no longer being killed in endless and inglorious wars."President Donald Trump addresses the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, in New York City, Sept. 23, 2025.Richard Drew/APTrump threatens Russia sanctions, but says Europe must do moreTrump said the United States is prepared to enforce a "very strong round of powerful tariffs" on Russia should Moscow not be ready to make a peace deal.But he said other countries need to pull back on buying Russian oil and energy products "otherwise we're all wasting a lot of time."MORE: Trump admin live updates: Rubio defends US cuts to foreign aid"Europe has to step it up.

He didn't say on Tuesday what it would take for him to determine Russia doesn't want peace, though he said the war is "not making Russia look good, it's making them look bad."President Donald Trump addresses the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, in New York City, Sept. 23, 2025.Jeenah Moon/ReutersTrump bashes world leaders on migration, green energyTrump said other countries should be modeling the U.S. on the issue of immigration.Popular ReadsSniper opens fire on Dallas ICE facility, killing 1 detainee, wounding 2: DHSSep 24, 6:39 PMRyan Routh, would-be Trump assassin, tries to stab himself after being found guiltySep 23, 6:04 PMTrump admin live updates: Trump announces new tariffs on cabinets, trucks, drugsSep 25, 4:37 PM"Not only is the U.N. not solving the problems it should, too often it's actually creating new problems for us to solve," Trump said.
