Service officials contacted by ABC News said Hegseth hadn't issued any new directive or policy and that they were mostly looking at whether posts reported to commanders had violated existing social media protocols.One Army official said "numerous people" have been suspended pending investigation and that "dozens" of social media posts are under review.
