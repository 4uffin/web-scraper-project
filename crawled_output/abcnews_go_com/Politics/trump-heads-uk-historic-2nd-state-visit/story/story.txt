At the same time, the visit will recognize and celebrate the upcoming 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States," a White House official told reporters during a background call previewing the trip.President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump host a dinner at Winfield House for Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, during their state visit, June 4, 2019, in London.Chris Jackson/WPA Pool/Getty ImagesMORE: Trump arrives in Scotland for 'working visit' focused on golf properties, trade talks Pomp and circumstance at Windsor Castle The visit will have much of the same pomp and circumstance as Trump's first state visit to the U.K., but there will be some notable differences. For one thing, the events will take place at Windsor Castle, while Trump's previous visit was held at Buckingham Palace.President Donald Trump and Britain's Queen Elizabeth II inspect a Guard of Honor, formed of the Coldstream Guards at Windsor Castle, July 13, 2018, in Windsor, England.Richard Pohle/WPA Pool/Getty ImagesAnother notable difference: the royals themselves. Trump's previous visit was headed by then-monarch, Queen Elizabeth II. This time King Charles III will host the president, supported by the Prince and Princess of Wales -- William and Catherine -- who will play a major role as the red carpet is rolled out for Trump for the second time.Back in February, in the Oval Office, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hand-delivered an invitation from the king to Trump.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hands President Donald Trump a letter from King Charles III during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House, Feb. 27, 2025.Jim Watson/AFP via Getty ImagesThere will be gun salutes from Windsor and London, and for the first time a U.S. president will take a carriage ride through the grounds of Windsor Castle, and enjoy a joint flyover performed by the Red Arrows and U.S. F-35 military jets.President Donald Trump holds a letter from Britain's King Charles III during a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in the Oval Office, Feb. 27, 2025.Jim Watson/AFP via Getty ImagesMORE: Trump says Prince William told him King Charles is 'fighting very hard' after cancer diagnosisOne notable royal will not be present at all during the visit. Prince Andrew will not participate. Andrew's ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were major U.K. news.The disgraced Duke of York's lack of attendance comes as the Epstein files and his own relationship with the late financier have been a political headache for Trump.

The leaders will hold a bilateral meeting at Chequers, the Prime Minister's country estate outside of London.Popular ReadsTyler Robinson said he killed Charlie Kirk because he 'spreads too much hate'Sep 16, 5:18 PMRobert Redford, film icon, Oscar-winning director and activist, dead at 89Sep 16, 8:29 AMLuigi Mangione earns legal victory as judge tosses 2 murder chargesSep 16, 10:07 AMPressing global issues, including Russia and Ukraine, Russia's threat to NATO's Eastern flank and the war in Gaza will surely be a main topic for the leaders. Their visit comes after Starmer and other European leaders traveled to the White House to meet with Trump and Zelenskyy just after Trump's summit in Alaska with Russian President Putin. But since that meeting, during which allies expressed optimism of a path forward on security guarantees, no progress has materialized.The meeting also comes as Russia has shown staggering provocation by violating Polish airspace with drones. Poland then invoked NATO's Article 4 and European nations are rattled by the overt action. But Trump has seemed to suggest that the drone incident may have been a mistake. Starmer will surely want to discuss the issue with Trump, a leader who has not always been keen on the U.S. upholding Article 5 of NATO's treaty -- calling for mutual defense when one member is attacked.The leaders will also surely discuss their relationship, namely announcing deals to strengthen tech partnerships between the nations and a deal to vastly increase the U.K.'s investment in nuclear power with the US.Mounted military personnel take part in rehearsals ahead of a state visit by the US President and his wife, at Windsor Castle in Windsor, west of London, September 15, 2025.Toby Shepheard/AFP via Getty ImagesStarmer will also likely make the case more favorable trade terms with the U.S. While the U.K. has solidified a tariff deal with the U.S., negotiations remain for some things, including steel and pharmaceuticals.The White House adds that Trump will meet with U.S. and U.K. business leaders, but White House officials declined to confirm ones.Asked for a dollar amount for how much these investments could be, a White House official on the call could not give an exact figure but said that the White House was "looking at more than 10 million, perhaps tens of billions."The visit will also highlight mutual cooperation in civil nuclear power, research, investment and development. The U.S. and the U.K. are expected to sign new deals that will enhance the build-out of new nuclear power stations in both countries and clear the way for a significant expansion of new nuclear projects in the U.K.​​The agreement will enable companies to build new nuclear power stations more quickly in both countries by reducing bureaucratic hurdles and delays, officials said.Kelly also said there will be advances in defense technology cooperation and an examination of how both the U.S. and U.K.'s leading financial hubs can be sustained into the future.Other top officials will be traveling alongside Trump in the U.S. delegation include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, Ambassador Warren Stevens and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.Related TopicsPresident TrumpUnited KingdomRoyal FamilySponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTyler Robinson said he killed Charlie Kirk because he 'spreads too much hate'Sep 16, 5:18 PMTrump greeted by king, thousands of protesters in UK visitSep 17, 4:56 PMRobert Redford, film icon, Oscar-winning director and activist, dead at 89Sep 16, 8:29 AMLuigi Mangione earns legal victory as judge tosses 2 murder chargesSep 16, 10:07 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
