Cory Mills.ByTierra CunninghamSeptember 17, 2025, 7:04 PM2:39Rep. Nancy Mace participates in a House Oversight Committee's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets hearing at the Capitol, Sept. 9, 2025.Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesFour House Republicans joined Democrats to tank GOP Rep. Nancy Mace’s effort to censure and remove Rep. Ilhan Omar from committee assignments over comments she made following the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.The final tally was 214-213 with two Republicans and three Democrats not voting. The GOP defections were Reps. Mike Flood of Nebraska, Jeff Hurd of Colorado, Tom McClintock of California and Cory Mills of Florida.With the defeat of the Omar censure resolution, Democrats will now drop their effort to censure Mills over several accusations that he has denied.Mace claimed in a statement that "Ilhan Omar has shown us exactly who she is: someone who defends political violence and refuses to condemn the loss of innocent lives when it doesn't suit her agenda, even the cold-blooded assassination of Charlie Kirk."During an interview on a Zeteo town hall with Mehdi Hasan the day after the assassination of the prominent conservative activist, Omar commented that Kirk's killing was "really mortifying," adding, "You know, all I could think about was his wife, his children, that image is going to live forever."Omar, however, mentioned Kirk’s previous takes that she disagreed with, stating, “Yeah, there is nothing more effed up, you know, like then, then to completely pretend that you know, his words and actions have not been recorded and in existence for for the last decade or so.”MORE: While Johnson calls to lower temperature, House Republicans finger-point in Charlie Kirk killingOmar hit back at Mace on X, posting that the South Carolina representative is trying to censure her over comments she never said to benefit her own political ambitions.Rep.

This is all an attempt to push a false story so she can fundraise and boost her run for Governor," Omar concluded.Censuring Omar would have stripped her of all committee assignments, removing her from the Committee on Education and Workforce, and the Committee on the Budget.The Minnesota representative was previously removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee in February 2023 after she was accused of making antisemitic comments that she later apologized for.MORE: Vance says 'left-wing extremism' helped lead to Charlie Kirk's killingAfter Mace announced her resolution, Texas Progressive Rep. Greg Casar gave notice of intent to offer a separate privileged resolution to censure Florida GOP Rep.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said before the vote on Wednesday that Mace's rhetoric has made Omar a target."Nancy Mace is a complete and total disgrace. Her racist, unhinged and xenophobic comments about Congresswoman Ilhan Omar are beneath the dignity of the Congress. Is this what civility looks like in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives?" Jeffries said in a statement. "We live in an era of intense political violence as we have seen with the recent assassinations of [Minnesota] Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Nancy Mace’s crazed rhetoric has put a target on the back of Rep. Omar. Mace must cease and desist her inciteful behavior immediately."Rep.
