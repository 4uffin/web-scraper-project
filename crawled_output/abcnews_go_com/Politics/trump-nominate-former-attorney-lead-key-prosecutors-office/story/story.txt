I will be nominating Lindsey Halligan to be the United States Attorney in this very important part of our Great Country. She will be Fair, Smart, and will provide, desperately needed, JUSTICE FOR ALL!"The announcement came a day after the previous head of that office, Erik Siebert, resigned his position amid pressure from Trump administration officials to bring a criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James.Halligan, who does not have any prosecutorial experience, is licensed to practice law in Florida and handled insurance claims when she joined Trump's legal team amid the probe by the Justice Department into Trump's handling of classified material after leaving office following his first term.More recently, from her post in the White House, Halligan was tasked by Trump with an effort to root out what the administration calls radical ideology at the Smithsonian Institution museums."Lindsey is a tough, smart, and loyal attorney, who has worked with me for a long time, including in the winning fight against the Weaponization of our Justice System by Crooked Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats, which she witnessed firsthand when she stood up for my rights during the Unconstitutional and UnAmerican raid on my home, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida," Trump said in another social media post about her appointment. Trump's announcement that he was appointing Halligan to the position came shortly after a previous post in which he appeared to criticize U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi over the pace of investigations into his political opponents, including the investigation of James over an allegation of mortgage fraud.Erik Siebert, interim U.S. Attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, speaks during a news conference about an MS-13 gang leader who was arrested in an operation by the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force, at the Manassas FBI Field Office, March 27, 2025, in Manassas, Va.Rod Lamkey/APTrump poised to fire US attorney for resisting effort to charge NY AG Letitia James: SourcesIn the follow-up post on Saturday, Trump wrote: "Pam Bondi is doing a GREAT job as Attorney General of the United States."Earlier this week, ABC News reported that Trump was expected to fire Siebert after investigators were unable to find incriminating evidence of mortgage fraud against James, according to sources. Trump officials had pushed Siebert to bring charges against James, despite investigators failing to find clear evidence that she committed a crime, sources said. Popular ReadsTrump admin live updates: Trump meets with Turkey's ErdoganSep 25, 4:37 PMSpecial election winner in Arizona could be key vote to release Epstein filesSep 23, 11:53 PMCharlie Kirk memorial updates: 'I forgive him,' Erika Kirk says of alleged shooterSep 21, 7:22 PM"It looks to me like she is very guilty of something, but I really don't know," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday. When asked about Siebert, Trump said he wanted him "out" of the position because Virginia's two Democratic senators supported his nomination. Trump nominated Siebert for the position in May, and he has served as the interim U.S. attorney since Trump's inauguration. "When I saw that he got approved by those two men, I said, pull it, because he can't be any good," Trump said. "When I learned that they voted for him, I said, I don't really want him." Staff at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Virginia received an email Saturday afternoon from Maggie Cleary, an official who recently joined the Justice Department's Criminal Division, who said she was named the acting head of the office.Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsTrump admin live updates: Trump meets with Turkey's ErdoganSep 25, 4:37 PMCharlie Kirk memorial updates: 'I forgive him,' Erika Kirk says of alleged shooterSep 21, 7:22 PMSpecial election winner in Arizona could be key vote to release Epstein filesSep 23, 11:53 PMWoman reveals new details about relationship with dentist who killed wifeSep 19, 6:10 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
