Two of them told ABC News they don't know what prompted this gathering of potentially hundreds of the U.S. military's most senior leaders.It is very rare to hold such a large meeting of general officers who are based stateside and overseas in one location and for it to include the defense secretary.Secretary of War Pete Hegseth attends an Oval Office meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the White House, September 25, 2025 in Washington.Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesThe unusual meeting will also take place months after Hegseth ordered a 20% reduction in the number of officers of the four-star rank, in addition to the 15 senior military officers he has removed from their posts, including Gen. Charles "CQ" Brown, Jr. the then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the Navy's top admiral."The Secretary of War will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week," chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement.Parnell used Hegseth's informal title, which came from President Donald Trump's executive order renaming the Department of Defense the Department of War earlier this month. The formal renaming of the department would require Congress to act.Hegseth unveils new restrictions on Pentagon press accessThe invitation went out to commanders at the one-star level and higher, as well as their command sergeant majors, sources told ABC News. This means several hundred of these high-ranking officials are expected to converge upon the Marine base at once.Overall, there are 838 total general officers and admirals on active duty -- 446 of them are from the higher two-star, three-star and four-star ranks -- according to the Pentagon's latest statistics from June, though it is difficult to ascertain a breakdown of how many officers are in command positions versus staff positions.The Pentagon declined to say how many people will attend the meeting and what its purpose is, leaving many officials scratching their heads about the last-minute order.Popular ReadsTrump announces deal to put TikTok under control of US investorsSep 25, 4:58 PMUS economy grew 3.8% in 2nd quarter, far exceeding previous estimateSep 25, 10:03 AMMystery drones over Denmark are 'hybrid attack,' defense minister saysSep 25, 5:00 PMThe Washington Post was first to report the news of next week's gathering.It is not unusual for a defense secretary to meet with senior military officers at the Pentagon or those on domestic and overseas travel. Twice a year, the senior officers in charge of the U.S. combatant commands gather at the Pentagon to meet with the secretary.However, the size and scope of the meeting that makes next week's gathering rare and likely a security concern for planners. The meeting has also led to speculation among officials as to whether it has anything to do with Hegseth's moves to reduce the number of officers serving as generals or admirals.In May, Hegseth signed a memo directing a "minimum" 20% reduction in the number of four-star generals and admirals across the active-duty force.He also called for at least a 20% reduction of general officers in the National Guard, as well as at least a 10% reduction in general and flag officers affiliated with combatant commands.In a video accompanying the memo, Hegseth described it as a "Less Generals More GIs Policy." In the memo, Hegseth said the order was needed to "drive innovation and operational excellence, unencumbered by unnecessary bureaucratic layers that hinder their growth and effectiveness.""A critical step in this process is removing redundant force structure to optimize and streamline leadership by reducing excess general and flag officer positions," he also wrote.Related TopicsUS MilitaryTrump AdministrationSponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsNetanyahu's jet largely avoids European airspace in unusual route to New YorkSep 25, 2:47 PMTrump announces deal to put TikTok under control of US investorsSep 25, 4:58 PMMystery drones over Denmark are 'hybrid attack,' defense minister saysSep 25, 5:00 PMUS economy grew 3.8% in 2nd quarter, far exceeding previous estimateSep 25, 10:03 AMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
