Win McNamee/Getty ImagesFBI Director Kash Patel faced questions about his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files when he appeared before the House Judiciary Committee for a roughly five-hour hearing Wednesday -- sparring with lawmakers calling for answers about unreleased documents in the investigation.Ranking Member Jamie Raskin and Patel argued over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. The Trump administration has been dealing with blowback it received from the president's supporters for its decision to not release more materials related to the investigation into Epstein, the wealthy financier and convicted sex offender who died by suicide in jail in 2019.MORE: Epstein survivors ask GOP Women's Caucus to support release of remaining Epstein filesRaskin asked why Patel hadn't "released the names of Epstein's co-conspirators in the rape and sex trafficking of young women and girls." The FBI and prosecutors investigated Epstein’s alleged co-conspirators -- even after his death. That investigation resulted in the 2020 indictment and subsequent conviction of Epstein’s associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Prosecutors otherwise have not made public statements about any particular individual they suspect of conspiring with Epstein.Patel fired back at Raskin that "we have released more material than anyone else before," adding that the FBI has released "everything the court has allowed us."FBI Director Kash Patel testifies before a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, September 17, 2025.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesEarlier this month the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released tens of thousands of records related to Epstein, provided by the Department of Justice. A review of the documents released by the committee indicates they consist of public court filings and transcripts from Maxwell’s trial, previously released flight logs from Epstein's plane, already public Bureau of Prisons communications the night of Epstein’s death and various other public court papers from Epstein’s criminal case in Florida.On Tuesday, the committee's Chairman James Comer said it received additional documents from the Epstein estate, which he said it plans to release to the public at some point.Raskin responded to Patel, saying that the FBI's release of documents has "nothing to do with what those courts have," accusing Patel of going against comments he made before becoming FBI director where he suggested that the federal government was shielding information regarding the Epstein case and that the FBI director has direct control of the Epstein files."Do you know how the law works?" Patel asked, later adding "I'm not going to break the law to satisfy your curiosity."Raskin said Patel's answers were "all misdirection."A birthday letter that President Donald Trump allegedly wrote to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein is displayed while Rep.

Thomas Massie, who filed a discharge petition for the release of the Epstein files, challenged Patel on the FBI director's claim -- which he made before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday -- that there is no credible information that Epstein trafficked women to anyone other than himself. In doing so, Massie noted that alleged victims of Epstein have provided interviews to the FBI which detail allegations, according to Massie, against at least 20 men.Patel claimed in response to Massie -- who asked if he had decided that these allegations that were not credible -- that it wasn't his assertion, but it was the assessment of three separate U.S. Attorneys from separate administrations.In another testy exchange, Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell said he "called b-------" on Patel's claims about courts preventing the release of documents. Swalwell also repeatedly tried to get Patel to answer "yes or no" to a question about whether he told Attorney General Pam Bondi that the president's name appeared in the Epstein files. Patel never answered directly and the whole exchange ended up in a shouting match between the two."I'm going to borrow your terminology and call b------- on your entire career in Congress, which is a disgrace to the American public," Patel said to Swalwell.MORE: Trump's alleged letter among 'Friends' section in Epstein's birthday book When Democratic Rep. Daniel Goldman went after Patel for not releasing the "full Epstein files," Patel said the FBI is "releasing as much as legally allowed.""You are hiding the Epstein files! You are part of the cover up," Goldman claimed.Trump's name appears in the Epstein files; a name appearing in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. Earlier this month, the House Oversight Committee said it obtained Epstein's "birthday book," which is said to contain the letter that Trump allegedly signed for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. Trump has denied writing the letter -- calling it "fake."MORE: Kash Patel says others under investigation in Charlie Kirk shooting probePatel's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday was also marked by explosive interactions with Democrats.
