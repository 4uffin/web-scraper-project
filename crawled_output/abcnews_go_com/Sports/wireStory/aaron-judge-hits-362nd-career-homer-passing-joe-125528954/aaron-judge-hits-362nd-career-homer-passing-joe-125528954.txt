The Yankees entered the night with a one-half game edge over the Red Sox in the AL East, behind division leader Toronto, with both in position for a wild-card berth.It was the longest home run at Fenway Park this season, according to Sportradar, and the longest since Judge hit a 470-footer last July. Judge reached 362 homers in his 1,130th game. DiMaggio played 1,736 games and hit his last homer on Sept. 28, 1951, at the end of a 13-year career that was interrupted for three seasons because he served in World War II.Popular ReadsChase Stokes celebrates Kelsea Ballerini's 32nd birthday with sweet Instagram tributeSep 13, 1:20 PMRelatives of Dutch POWs visit former Nagasaki prison site to honor their memorySep 13, 5:50 AMNepal's new prime minister urges calm after deadly protestsSep 14, 3:46 AMJudge’s 47th homer of the season raised his major league-best batting average to .324.Judge broke a tie with Hall of Fame catcher Yogi Berra for fifth on New York’s career list Tuesday night.
