The Yankees entered the night with a one-half game edge over the Red Sox in the AL East, behind division leader Toronto, with both in position for a wild-card berth.It was the longest home run at Fenway Park this season, according to Sportradar, and the longest since Judge hit a 470-footer last July.

DiMaggio played 1,736 games and hit his last homer on Sept. 28, 1951, at the end of a 13-year career that was interrupted for three seasons because he served in World War II.Popular ReadsRelatives of Dutch POWs visit former Nagasaki prison site to honor their memorySep 13, 5:50 AMA high school student's new children's book aims to tell US immigration storySep 20, 12:04 PMTrump admin live updates: Trump at Charlie Kirk memorial serviceSep 21, 4:09 PMJudge’s 47th homer of the season raised his major league-best batting average to .324.Judge broke a tie with Hall of Fame catcher Yogi Berra for fifth on New York’s career list Tuesday night.
