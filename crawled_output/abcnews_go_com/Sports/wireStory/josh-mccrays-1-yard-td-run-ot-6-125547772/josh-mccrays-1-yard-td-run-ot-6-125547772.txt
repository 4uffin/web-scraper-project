(AP Photo/George Walker IV)The Associated PressKNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- When No. 6 Georgia clawed its way back from three deficits against No. 15 Tennessee on Saturday, coach Kirby Smart got the answer he was looking for.“We feel our team has a certain identity,” Smart said after the Bulldogs' 44-41 overtime victory. “We're not going to go down without a fight.” Josh McCray scored on a 1-yard run in to cap the win. Georgia (3-0, 1-0 SEC) beat Tennessee (2-1, 1-0) for the ninth straight time with Nate Frazier setting up the winning score with a 21-yard run on Georgia’s first snap in overtime.“I feel almost like we have to apologize,” said Smart. “I don't think that we should have won that game. I thought (Tennessee) outplayed us in a lot of ways.”Max Gilbert kicked a 42-yard field goal to give Tennessee a 41-38 edge in overtime. Tennessee had a chance to win in regulation, but Gilbert pushed a 43-yard field-goal attempt wide right just before the final whistle.“It's a series of one play that makes a specialist,” Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said. “Sometimes your life gets showcased in a way where you get limited opportunities. That's the life of being a kicker.”Joey Aguilar threw for 371 yards and four touchdowns and ran for a TD to lead Tennessee. The Volunteers came from behind twice in the second half after jumping out to a 14-point lead in the first quarter.“I started off in a groove, but those come and go,” Aguilar said. “In the middle (of the game), I was pressing a little bit.”Chris Brazzell III caught scoring passes of 72, 14 and 66 yards. Braylon Staley's 32-yard TD reception early in the fourth quarter put Tennessee on top 35-30 with 11:01 left.“It was a good performance,” Brazzell said. “If we'd have won it would have been better.”Georgia quarterback Gunner Stockton threw for 304 yards and two touchdowns and also ran for a TD. Trailing 38-30 with 2:32 left in the game, Stockton hit London Humphreys on fourth down with a 28-yard fade in the end zone. The two-point conversion tied it for the third time.“We needed to convert and we ended up scoring,” said Stockton. “London ran a great route and made the catch.”Popular ReadsBrewers become first MLB team to clinch playoff spot this seasonSep 13, 7:31 PMMudslides trap drivers, bury roads and damage homes in southern CaliforniaSep 19, 8:18 AMTrump admin live updates: Trump appears to criticize Bondi over investigations1 hour agoSmart was pleased with Stockton's effort.“(Stockton) grew up tonight,” he said.
