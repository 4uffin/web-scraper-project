(CU Athletics via AP)The Associated PressThe latest recruit on Deion Sanders' roster weighs in at 700 pounds and runs the 40-yard dash as fast as she wants.Colorado’s new live buffalo mascot will make her debut at Folsom Field on Saturday night against Wyoming. She's officially named Ralphie VII, although a unique nickname is soon to come after her first run.Ralphie VII is the latest in a string of field-storming live mascot buffaloes, a storied tradition and one of college football's most iconic. The running of the buffalo has been a must-glimpse event at the school for the past 58 years.The 1-year-old bison steps in for Ralphie VI, who went into retirement before the start of season after showing little enthusiasm toward making the gallop around the field.“We’re excited to be adding a new Ralphie to the lineage of incredible buffalo that have represented the University of Colorado and have elevated the fans’ passion for our student-athletes," said Taylor Stratton, the director of the Ralphie Live Mascot Program.A version of Ralphie has been missing from action the past two home games. Ralphie VI — nicknamed Ember — showed a reluctance to make the trip around Folsom Field to the roar of the fans. The plan for Ember will be to join Ralphie V — known as Blackout — on the ranch and do one of her favorite things — take it easy.The newest member of Sanders' squad is “definitely not indifferent to running,” the release from the school said.Popular ReadsToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on beauty, tech, home and moreSep 25, 1:39 PMWoman reveals new details about relationship with dentist who killed wifeSep 19, 6:10 AMSan Francisco’s City Hall becomes backdrop for striking quinceañera photoshootsSep 19, 3:46 PMRalphie VII was a gift from the Beauprez Family, supporters of the university and owners of Eagle’s Wing Ranch located near Steamboat Springs, Colorado.“Ralphie’s run is iconic and our fans, students, faculty, staff, and alumni take an incredible amount of pride in this tradition which transcends sports,” Stratton said.___AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-footballRelated TopicsFootballNCAASponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsToday's deals starting at 40% off: Save on beauty, tech, home and moreSep 25, 1:39 PMSan Francisco’s City Hall becomes backdrop for striking quinceañera photoshootsSep 19, 3:46 PMWoman reveals new details about relationship with dentist who killed wifeSep 19, 6:10 AMChina cancels schools and flights as it braces for typhoonSep 22, 11:01 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact Us © 2025 ABC News
