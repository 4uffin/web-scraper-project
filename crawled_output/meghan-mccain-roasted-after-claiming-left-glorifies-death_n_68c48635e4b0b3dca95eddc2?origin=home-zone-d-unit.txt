And it’s not something I think I really have fully faced until Charlie’s assassination. And it’s petrifying.I think the fundamental difference between the right and the left in this country is that the left glorifies death - particularly of adversaries and the right does not. And it’s not something I think I really have fully faced until Charlie’s assassination. And it’s petrifying.— Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) September 12, 2025McCain’s theory might sound legit in the confines of a conservative news bubble, but many people on social media felt obliged to point out some things she may have forgotten.For instance, progressive activist and Parkland school shooting survivor David Hogg reminded McCain that, among other things, Utah Senator Mike Lee made now-deleted jokes on social media after Minnesota Democratic state Rep.

Trump has repeatedly shared photos of flags of Joe Biden being tied up. https://t.co/HdZrsXOssK— David Hogg 🟧 (@davidhogg111) September 12, 2025Activist Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter died in the 2018 Parkland shooting, reminded the daughter of former Sen. John McCain of the patriots who tried to publicly hang Mike Pence on Jan. 6.What the fuck are you talking about @MeghanMcCain? As a national gun safety activist, I have been subjected to threats to my life and safety, by the right. Over the past 2 days, the right has been calling for war and violence against the left.

Others joined in, noting how President Donald Trump mocked the 2022 attack on Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul, and also the way Trump treated her dad before he died in 2018.What did you make of conservatives’ response to the attack on Paul Pelosi?— Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) September 12, 2025It's interesting you've come to this conclusion after the violence incited against your father by Donald Trump.— Lauren Windsor (@lawindsor) September 12, 2025Advertisement
