Secret Service Raids Malicious SIM Server Setup
(apnews.com)

on Tuesday September 23, 2025 @10:34AM
Gilmoure writes: The US Secret Service is in the process of taking down a massive network of SIM Server systems, designed to
function "like banks of mock cellphones, able to generate mass calls and texts, overwhelm local networks and mask encrypted communications criminals. When agents entered the sites, they found rows of servers and shelves stacked with SIM cards. More than 100,000 were already active, investigators said, but there were also large numbers waiting to be deployed, evidence that operators were preparing to double or even triple the network’s capacity, McCool said. He described it as a well-funded, highly organized enterprise, one that cost millions of dollars in hardware and SIM cards alone."

Anonymous Coward
on Tuesday September 23, 2025 @12:32AM
An anonymous reader writes: MediaTek is launching a mobile processor more capable of handling agentic AI tasks on devices, positioning to better compete with Qualcomm. The new Dimensity 9500 will provide users with better summaries of calls and meetings, improved output from AI models and superior 4K photos, the Taiwanese company said in a statement. The chip is made using an advanced 3-nanometer process by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., according to MediaTek, and handsets carrying the new chip will become available in the fourth quarter.
Xiaomi is set to launch its latest handset range powered by Qualcomm’s newest Snapdragon processor later this week, and the Chinese smartphone maker is aiming to benchmark its upcoming devices against Apple Inc.’s iPhone 17. MediaTek’s processor, meanwhile, is expected to give Xiaomi’s rivals including Vivo a boost in the premium segment. [...] Separately, the Taiwanese company is preparing to place chip orders for automotive and more sensitive applications with TSMC’s Arizona plant as some US customers have security concerns, according to the executives.

FIFNIC: An Open Source Bane

BrendaEM writes: Firstly, Thank you to all the heroic open-source coders, as well as the many people who support open-source projects by helping the masses of computer users on forums.
For the lack of a better term, the problem is: Fixed in Forum, Not In Code, a condition that exists when there is insufficient feedback to the actual coders of software--yet the problem and even the workaround may be known elsewhere on the forums. So, old bugs persist.
With an inclusive library-based tree-like structure of a large open-source project--rising to the level of a Linux distribution. It can be hard to tell at which level the problem lies. Some well-documented bugs and fixes on the forums never reach the people who write the code, so the issue does not get fixed at the source. So, then the huddled masses continue to pour into the forums and mailing lists for answers and workarounds--to issues that might have been fixed at the source. This is why a quick NOTABUG and a quickly closed thread can cause issues downstream, and why more distro-to-programer communication might help.

China Launched Stealth Jet from Electromagnetic Catapult Aircraft Carrier

hackingbear
on Monday September 22, 2025 @03:49PM
hackingbear writes: The Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has demonstrated its ability to launch and recover aircraft from its first electromagnetic catapult-equipped aircraft carrier, the CNS Fujian. Official imagery released by the PLAN today confirms that the new J-35 naval stealth fighters, KJ-600 airborne early warning and control aircraft, and J-15T fighter jet are carrying out carrier trials. Ben Lewis, a co-founder of PLATracker, told USNI News that the test was a “significant milestone” for the Chinese military’s carrier program. “Once operational, the PLAN will have the capacity to field fifth-generation stealth carrier aircraft, supported by fixed-wing carrier-based airborne early warning and command aircraft, across the first island chain and Western Pacific Ocean,” Lewis said. Electromagnetic catapults offer several advantages, not least the fact that they can be more finely tuned to very different aircraft types, including ones that are larger and slower (like the KJ-600), or which are smaller and lighter, such as smaller drones.
In contrast to the U.S. Navy, which gathered decades of experience with steam-powered catapults, China opted for electromagnetic ones for its first catapult-equipped carrier. It’s worth noting that the U.S. Navy’s USS Gerald R. Ford was the first carrier ever to get an aircraft into the air using what is also referred to as an electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS). However, it has not launched an F-35C so far, making the J-35 the first stealth jet to achieve this feat. Based on earlier predictions, the F-35C may not do the same for some years.

LastPass uncovers fake GitHub repos spreading Atomic Stealer malware to Mac user

BrianFagioli writes: Mac users have a new reason to be cautious when downloading software. LastPass has revealed that cybercriminals are running a large-scale campaign using fraudulent GitHub repositories to trick people into installing the Atomic Stealer (AMOS) malware.The LastPass Threat Intelligence, Mitigation, and Escalation (TIME) team discovered the effort, which uses aggressive Search Engine Optimization (SEO) tactics to push malicious links to the top of Google and Bing results. The attackers create GitHub pages impersonating companies such as LastPass, 1Password, Citibank, Fidelity, Docker, Dropbox, Shopify, and dozens more. Once clicked, the repositories redirect victims to malicious websites that instruct them to run terminal commands on their Macs. Those commands eventually pull down the Atomic Stealer payload.LastPass says it immediately reported and helped take down multiple GitHub pages targeting its own customers. One example involved a repository that pretended to offer âoeInstall LastPass on MacBook,â which funneled users through a series of redirects until they unknowingly executed a CURL command that decoded into a malicious download from bonoud[.]com. That file planted the infostealer under the guise of an âoeUpdateâ process.Atomic Stealer is not new. It has been circulating since at least April 2023 and is associated with financially motivated groups that focus on harvesting passwords, crypto wallet keys, and other sensitive information. This latest campaign simply repackages an old threat in a new delivery method, using GitHubâ(TM)s trusted reputation and search visibility to ensnare victims.The list of impersonated brands is long. Beyond password managers and financial firms, the attackers set up GitHub repos imitating software projects like Audacity, Thunderbird, Docker, Notion, Obsidian, and even Adobeâ(TM)s After Effects. This shows a broad shotgun-style approach rather than a narrow focus.LastPass has shared a full set of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to help defenders identify infections and related infrastructure. Security teams can use these to block known domains and hashes linked to the campaign. The company is continuing to monitor the operation and warns that the same actors may quickly create new repositories after takedowns.For everyday users, the advice is simple but critical: do not install software from random GitHub pages or unfamiliar websites, even if they appear high in search results. Download only from official company sites or trusted app stores.LastPass stresses that protecting users is its top priority and says it will keep collaborating with industry partners to disrupt the attackers. But at the end of the day, personal vigilance remains the best defense.

NASA: More than 6,000 exoplanets confirmed, over 8,000 candidates
(heise.de)
Submitted

alternative_right
on Sunday September 21, 2025 @11:25PM
alternative_right writes: The existence of planets around other stars was only experimentally confirmed three decades ago; now there are more and more instruments designed specifically for the search. More than two-thirds of the confirmed exoplanets were found using the so-called transit method, which involves observing them as they pass in front of their star. More than 1.100 additional exoplanets were found using the radial velocity method, in which stars reveal their small companions through their own movements. NASA lists nine other methods, but together they have contributed only a few hundred exoplanets to the database.According to the database, researchers also know the mass of one-third of the confirmed exoplanets, 102 of which are roughly comparable to Earth. In addition, over 500 exoplanets are about the size of Earth, and the radius is known for almost 4.500 celestial bodies. This and much more data can be found in NASA's "Exoplanet Archive," which is maintained by the Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology. According to NASA, the rate at which the number of confirmed exoplanets is growing has recently accelerated, with the 5.000 mark only being exceeded at the beginning of 2022. Future instruments are likely to cause the number to rise even faster.

LibreOffice Needs a Bullt-in Non-AI Adulterated Grammar Checker

Its files are lossless compressed to save on disk space--allowing you to save more often, but as download and installed, there seems to be no functioning grammar checker. I will not write for all writers, but I have no trust for anything touched by unchecked AI. I just want things like double space checking, punctuation, and that kind of thing, grammar checking before large companies lined up to steal your content. While grammar checking extensions are available, most are touched by AI, or require additional Java. So, why is no included grammar checking in LibreOffice?

Feeling Cranky About AI and CS Education
Submitted

theodp
on Sunday September 21, 2025 @02:07PM
theodp writes: Over at the Communications of the ACM, Bard College CS Prof Valerie Barr explains why she's Feeling Cranky About AI and CS Education. Having seen CS education go through a number of we-have-to-teach-this moments over the decades — introductory programming languages, the Web, Data Science, etc. — Barr turns her attention to the next hand-wringing "what will we do" CS education moment with AI. "We're jumping through hoops without stopping first to question the run-away train," Barr writes. "In much discussion about CS education:a.) There’s little interest in interrogating the downsides of generative AI, such as the environmental impact, the data theft impact, the treatment and exploitation of data workers.b.) There’s little interest in considering the extent to which, by incorporating generative AI into our teaching, we end up supporting a handful of companies that are burning billions in a vain attempt to each achieve performance that is a scintilla better than everyone else’s.c.) There’s little interest in thinking about what’s going to happen when the LLM companies decide that they have plateaued, that there’s no more money to burn/spend, and a bunch of them fold—but we’ve perturbed education to such an extent that our students can no longer function without their AI helpers." Barr calls for stepping back from "the industry assertion that the ship has sailed, every student needs to use AI early and often, and there is no future application that isn’t going to use AI in some way" and instead thoughtfully "articulate what sort of future problem solvers and software developers we want to graduate from our programs, and determine ways in which the incorporation of AI can help us get there."

More durable UV coating for solar panels made from red onion skins
(zmescience.com)
Submitted

fahrbot-bot

fahrbot-bot writes: In a lab in Turku, Finland, scientists have found a surprising ally in the fight for sustainable solar energy: the papery red skin of an onion.
Researchers from the University of Turku, in collaboration with Aalto University and Wageningen University, have developed a bio-based UV protection film for solar cells that not only blocks nearly all harmful ultraviolet light but also outperforms commercial plastic films. The key ingredient is a water extract made from red onion skins.
Sunlight can degrade the delicate components in solar panels—particularly the electrolyte inside dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), a type known for their flexibility and low-light performance. To mitigate this, manufacturers typically wrap cells in UV-protective films made from petroleum-based plastics like polyethylene terephthalate (PET). But these plastics degrade over time and are difficult to recycle.
Seeking a greener alternative, the team turned to nanocellulose, a renewable material derived from wood pulp. Nanocellulose can be processed into thin, transparent films that serve as the perfect substrate for UV-blocking compounds.
Their breakthrough came when they dyed these films using an extract from red onion skins, a common kitchen waste. The result was a filter that blocked 99.9% of UV radiation up to 400 nanometers, a feat that outstripped even the PET-based commercial filters chosen for comparison.
In solar cells, preserving visible and near-infrared light is crucial. That’s the part of the spectrum that powers electricity generation. And here, too, the onion-treated filter excelled: it let through over 80% of light in the 650–1,100 nm range—an ideal sweet spot for energy absorption.
Testing under 1,000 hours of artificial sunlight, the CNF-ROE film—short for cellulose nanofiber with red onion extract—held up remarkably well. It exhibited only minor discoloration and preserved the yellow hue of the electrolyte far better than any other filter. Even predictive modeling based on early degradation trends suggested the CNF-ROE filter could extend a solar cell’s lifetime to roughly 8,500 hours. The PET-based filter? Just 1,500 hours.

"A new report highlights how youth-focused coding platforms like Code.org are driving growth, opportunity, and access to essential skills for the next generation." Sounds great, but the article linked to by Code.org — who Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently told the White House Task Force on AI Education is being given $3M by Google to transform its K-12 CS curriculum to make schoolchildren AI-savvy — is apparently AI-generated. The Future of Learning: Unlocking Long-Term Growth in Youth-Focused Coding Platforms is credited by AInvest.com to "Henry Rivers", who is described as "an AI-powered strategist designed for professionals and economically curious readers seeking investigative financial insight" who is "backed by a 32-billion-parameter hybrid model." It's been long said that "Self-praise is no recommendation." How about AI praise?
