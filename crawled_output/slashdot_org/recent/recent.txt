Did US Successfully Take Over TokTok, Or Not?
(apnews.com)
Submitted

hackingbear
on Thursday September 25, 2025 @08:59PM
hackingbear writes: President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday that he says will allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns. Trump’s order will enable an American-led of group of investors to "buy the app" [up to 80% ownership] from China’s ByteDance, though the deal is not yet finalized and also requires China’s approval. However, much about the deal is still unknown. So did the US successfully snatch TikTok from ByteDance? It is probably up to individual's interpretation. As with any deals between U.S. and China, the devil is in the details. According Shen Yi, an internet influencer and a professor at Shanghai's Fudan university, what the US investor will eventually take control of is an entity known as TikTok US Data Security Company (“USDS”) which is a subsidiary of the TikTok US and is exclusively responsible to handle data security in the US. ByteDance will continue, through its U.S. subsidiary “ByteDance TikTok US Company,” to operate business and other related activities (such as e-commerce, advertising for brands, and cross-border commercial activities). It is important to stress that “Byte TikTok US Company” remains 100% owned by ByteDance through its global TikTok subsidiary—this arrangement has not changed. The TikTok algorithm remains the property of ByteDance, only licensed to USDS for use. This point was in fact explicitly clarified by a relevant official of China’s Cyberspace Administration at the press conference following the Madrid talks. After reaching the TikTok deal, Beijing and Washington are now selling it to their respective domestic audience, each highlighting the part of the deal that it can characterize as a win. Shen’s details are not in conflict with the widely-reported account given by Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary, who emphasized “a new board with six American directors out of seven. Observers can also find the TikTok arrangement being very similar to that of Apple's iCloud operation in China being run by GCBD (AIPO Cloud (Guizhou) Technology Co. Ltd.) while Apple retain controls of the brand and business.

The Silent Erosion: Global Generational Cognitive Decline in the Age of AI ...

rezoG writes: Research at the R. C. Patel Institute of Technology, Administration, Shirpur, India, indicates that broad adoption and incorporation of A.I. into the social sphere is not without some costs.
The researchers explored the extent of cognitive decline related to A.I.-reliance across multiple nations. It is concluded (tentatively) that widespread A.I. entwinement within socio-technical spheres does result in cognitive atrophy, degeneration. The effects were found to be more pronounced in nations with higher A.I. adoption, lesser in nations with a more responsible approach to pedagogy, inclusion of A.I. in the lifestyles.This study formalizes the concept of national cognitive resilience as the capacity of a country
to preserve and regenerate metacognitive friction, epistemic novelty density, and human
interpretive effort despite increasing AI integration. In the AI era, the boundaries between
thinking and automation, learning and consumption, and originality and replication are quietly
dissolving. The silent consequence is GCA, the recursive weakening of human epistemic
agency through sustained reliance on AI-mediated knowledge production. This erosion is not
accidental; it arises from design logics that privilege frictionless efficiency and predictive
optimization over ambiguity, novelty, and reflection.
The results show clearly that AI readiness does not equate to cognitive resilience. Nations with
advanced AI infrastructure, such as China and the United States, may record low CDI scores
when novelty is eroded and automation reliance is high. Conversely, countries like Singapore,
and Finland outside this dataset, sustain high CDI scores by embedding cognitive scaffolding
into their educational and governance systems, even with similar AI maturity levels. Historical
precedents such as the Gutenberg press, industrial schooling, and the screen revolution
demonstrate that cognitive systems can recover from compression and conformity, but only
through deliberate pedagogical reform and institutional innovation.
The broader implication is that cognition must be treated as a civilizational asset, equal in
strategic importance to ecological sustainability or democratic stability. Just as environmental
degradation prompted coordinated global climate action, cognitive degradation demands
epistemic governance that is transdisciplinary, generational, and anticipatory. Embedding
GCAL–CDI metrics into AI policy, designing reflective human–AI interfaces, and prioritizing
epistemic plurality over algorithmic conformity are essential to achieving this.
Artificial intelligence need not be inherently corrosive.

Shoplifters Could Soon Be Chased Down By Drones
(technologyreview.com)
Submitted

Anonymous Coward
on Thursday September 25, 2025 @06:30PM
An anonymous reader writes: Flock Safety, whose drones were once reserved for police departments, is now offering them for private-sector security, the company announced today, with potential customers including including businesses intent on curbing shoplifting.Companies in the US can now place Flock’s drone docking stations on their premises. If the company has a waiver from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly beyond visual line of sight (these are becomingeasier to get), its security team can fly the drones within a certain radius, often a few miles.
“Instead of a 911 call [that triggers the drone], it’s an alarm call,” says Keith Kauffman, a former police chief who now directs Flock’s drone program. “It’s still the same type of response.” Kauffman walked through how the drone program might work in the case of retail theft: If the security team at a store like Home Depot, for example, saw shoplifters leave the store, then the drone, equipped with cameras, could be activated from its docking station on the roof. “The drone follows the people. The people get in a car. You click a button,” he says, “and you track the vehicle with the drone, and the drone just follows the car.”
The video feed of that drone might go to the company’s security team, but it could also be automatically transmitted directly to police departments.
The defense tech startup Epirus has developed a cutting-edge, cost-efficient drone zapper that’s sparking the interest of the US military. Now the company has to deliver. The company says it’s in talks with large retailers but doesn’t yet have any signed contracts. The only private-sector company Kauffman named as a customer is Morning Star, a California tomato processor that uses drones to secure its distribution facilities. Flock will also pitch the drones to hospital campuses, warehouse sites, and oil and gas facilities. It’s worth noting that the FAA is currently draftingnew rulesfor how it grants approval to pilots flying drones out of sight, and it’s not clear if Flock’s use case would be allowed under the currently proposed guidance.

Neon Goes Dark After Exposing Users' Phone Numbers, Call Recordings, Transcripts

An anonymous reader writes: A viral app called Neon, which offers to record your phone calls and pay you for the audio so it can sell that data to AI companies, has rapidly risen to the ranks of the top-five free iPhone apps since its launch last week. The app already has thousands of users and was downloaded 75,000 times yesterday alone, according to app intelligence provider Appfigures. Neon pitches itself as a way for users to make by providing call recordings that help train, improve, and test AI models. But now Neon has gone offline, at least for now, after a security flaw allowed anyone to access the phone numbers, call recordings, and transcripts of any other user, TechCrunch can now report.
TechCrunch discovered the security flaw during a short test of the app on Thursday. We alerted the app’s founder, Alex Kiam (who previously did not respond to a request for comment about the app), to the flaw soon after our discovery. Kiam told TechCrunch later Thursday that he took down the app’s servers and began notifying users about pausing the app, but fell short of informing his users about the security lapse. The Neon app stopped functioning soon after we contacted Kiam.

Experts Urge Caution About Using ChatGPT To Pick Stocks
(arstechnica.com)
Submitted
by
Anonymous Coward
on Thursday September 25, 2025 @03:48PM
An anonymous reader writes: With AI chatbots growing in popular usage, it was only a matter of time before large numbers of people began applying them to the stock market. In fact, at least 1 in 10 retail investors now consult ChatGPT or other AI chatbots for stock-picking advice, according to a Reuters report published Thursday. Data from a survey by trading platform eToro of 11,000 retail investors worldwide suggests that 13 percent of individual investors already use AI tools like ChatGPT or Google's Gemini for stock selection, while about half say they would consider using these tools for portfolio decisions.
Unlike algorithmic trading, where computers automatically execute thousands of trades per second, investors are using ChatGPT as an advisory tool in place of human experts. They type questions, read the AI model's analysis, and then manually decide whether to place trades through their brokers. Reuters spoke with Jeremy Leung, who analyzed companies for investment bank UBS for almost two decades. Leung now relies on ChatGPT for his multi-asset portfolio. "I no longer have the luxury of a Bloomberg terminal, or those kinds of market-data services which are very, very expensive," Leung told Reuters. "Even the simple ChatGPT tool can do a lot and replicate a lot of the workflows that I used to do."
Reuters reports that financial products comparison website Finder asked ChatGPT in March 2023 to select stocks from high-quality businesses based on criteria like debt levels and sustained growth. Since then, the resulting 38-stock portfolio has reportedly grown in value nearly 55 percent. That performance beat the average of the UK's 10 most popular funds by almost 19 percentage points. But there's a huge caveat to that kind of AI success story: US stocks sit near record highs, Reuters notes, with the S&P 500 index up 13 percent this year after surging 23 percent last year. Those are conditions that can make almost any stock-picking strategy look smart.
Reuters frames the AI trading advice trend as a case of new technology tools "democratizing," or opening up, investment analysis once reserved for institutional investors with expensive data terminals. But experts warn that AI models can confabulate financial data and lack access to real-time market information, making them risky substitutes for professional advice. "AI models can be brilliant," Dan Moczulski, UK managing director at eToro, told Reuters. "The risk comes when people treat generic models like ChatGPT or Gemini as crystal balls." He noted that general AI models "can misquote figures and dates, lean too hard on a pre-established narrative, and overly rely on past price action to attempt to predict the future."

Cloudflare shocks the Internet with launch of NET Dollar stablecoin

BrianFagioli writes: Cloudflare has revealed something I did not see coming. The company, best known for protecting and accelerating websites, is now introducing a stablecoin called NET Dollar. A U.S. dollar-backed cryptocurrency from Cloudflare feels unusual to me, and Iâ(TM)m still surprised by it. The decision shows just how much the Internet is shifting in response to artificial intelligence.NET Dollar is meant to support instant, secure payments for what Cloudflare calls the âoeagentic web.â In this future, AI agents handle tasks such as booking flights, buying groceries, and managing calendars. For that kind of automation, the money itself needs to move instantly, work globally, and be trustworthy. Cloudflare believes NET Dollar will fill that role.CEO Matthew Prince said, âoeFor decades, the business model of the Internet ran on ad platforms and bank transfers. The Internetâ(TM)s next business model will be powered by pay-per-use, fractional payments, and microtransactionsâ"tools that shift incentives toward original, creative content that actually adds value.â He added that by using its global network, Cloudflare aims to âoehelp modernize the financial rails needed to move money at the speed of the Internet.âCloudflare says NET Dollar will make payments possible anywhere in the world, across currencies and borders. It will allow personal AI agents to act instantly, such as paying for a plane ticket the moment a price drops, while business AI agents could be programmed to release payment as soon as a delivery is confirmed. The company also expects creators, developers, and content providers to benefit from easier monetization.Alongside NET Dollar, Cloudflare is contributing to open standards like the Agent Payments Protocol and x402. These are intended to simplify how payments move across the Internet.I remain shocked that Cloudflare is taking this step. It feels odd to see a company rooted in security and performance suddenly create a digital currency. Still, AI is reshaping the Internet faster than many expected, and Cloudflare clearly wants to position itself at the center of how payments will work in that world. Whether NET Dollar becomes widely adopted or fades as an experiment, the launch is a reminder that the financial side of the Internet may look very different in the years ahead.

Remote controlled car rental service

At the end of the rental, a remote driver takes over again to take the car away.
The trained remote drivers sit in a driving station, with a steering wheel, foot pedals, screens, headphones, and even tactile feedback for things like bumps on the road.Vay says the rental rate cost would be "about half of what a current car-sharing service costs".
If he is talking about car-rental services that deliver cars to customers by on-site drivers, like
this defunct San Francisco car rental company, then the claim about half the cost seems right.Vay's founder used Las Vegas as a testing ground for the service, and expects to launch in Germany soon.
Las Vegas had the necessary legal framework already in place.

BYD U9 Set Fastest Production Car World Record

hackingbear writes: China is known for boasting the world's cheapest EVs, and is now also home to the fastest. Chinese automaker BYD's YangWang U9 Xtreme just blew the whole competition out of the water. The U9 Xtreme just hit a top speed of 308.4 mph (496.32 km/h) on the ATP Papenburg oval track in Germany, making it the fastest car in production, after demolishing the top-speed record for production EVs a few weeks ago. It was once again driven by German racer Marc Basseng, who piloted the hypercar beyond the previous record-holding Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+, which managed 304.8 back in 2019. The U9 Xtreme sports an insane quad-motor powertrain on a 1200-volt system, combining for a total output of over 2959 horsepower. One small caveat that doesn't lessen the impressiveness of the feat is that while the U9 Xtreme does classify as a production model, it barely does. That's because BYD is planning to limit production of the top-speed version of the U9 to no more than 30 units. The Xtreme is a high-performance version of Yangwang U9, BYD's pothole-jumping hypercar, which costs around $233,000 in China.

Facebook Data Reveal the Devastating Real-World Harms Caused By Misinformation
(theconversation.com)

An anonymous reader writes: Twenty-one years after Facebook’s launch, Australia’s top 25 news outlets now have a combined 27.6 million followers on the platform. They rely on Facebook’s reach more than ever, posting far more stories there than in the past. With access to Meta’s Content Library (Meta is the owner of Facebook), our big data study analysed more than three million posts from 25 Australian news publishers. We wanted to understand how content is distributed, how audiences engage with news topics, and the nature of misinformation spread. The study enabled us to track de-identified Facebook comments and take a closer look at examples of how misinformation spreads. These included cases about election integrity, the environment (floods) and health misinformation such as hydroxychloroquine promotion during the COVID pandemic. The data reveal misinformation’s real-world impact: it isn’t just a digital issue, it’s linked to poor health outcomes, falling public trust, and significant societal harm. [...]
Our study has lessons for public figures and institutions. They, especially politicians, must lead in curbing misinformation, as their misleading statements are quickly amplified by the public. Social media and mainstream media also play an important role in limiting the circulation of misinformation. As Australians increasingly rely on social media for news, mainstream media can provide credible information and counter misinformation through their online story posts. Digital platforms can also curb algorithmic spread and remove dangerous content that leads to real-world harms. The study offers evidence of a change over time in audiences’ news consumption patterns. Whether this is due to news avoidance or changes in algorithmic promotion is unclear. But it is clear that from 2016 to 2024, online audiences increasingly engaged with arts, lifestyle and celebrity news over politics, leading media outlets to prioritize posting stories that entertain rather than inform. This shift may pose a challenge to mitigating misinformation with hard news facts. Finally, the study shows that fact-checking, while valuable, is not a silver bullet. Combating misinformation requires a multi-pronged approach, including counter-messaging by trusted civic leaders, media and digital literacy campaigns, and public restraint in sharing unverified content.

World's Oceans Fail Key Health Check As Acidity Crosses Critical Threshold
(theguardian.com)
Submitted
by
Anonymous Coward
on Wednesday September 24, 2025 @05:55PM
An anonymous reader writes: The world’s oceans have failed a key planetary health check for the first time, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels, a report has shown. In its latest annual assessment, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said ocean acidity had crossed a critical threshold for marine life. This makes it the seventh of nine planetary boundaries to be transgressed, prompting scientists to call for a renewed global effort to curb fossil fuels, deforestation and other human-driven pressures that are tilting the Earth out of a habitable equilibrium. The report, which follows earlier warnings about ocean acidity, comes at a time of recordbreaking ocean heat and mass coral bleaching.
Oceans cover 71% of the Earth’s surface and play an essential role as a climate stabilizer. The new report calls them an “unsung guardian of planetary health”, but says their vital functions are threatened. The 2025 Planetary Health Check noted that since the start of the industrial era, oceans’ surface pH has fallen by about 0.1 units, a 30-40% increase in acidity, pushing marine ecosystems beyond safe limits. Cold-water corals, tropical coral reefs and Arctic marine life are especially at risk. This is primarily due to the human-caused climate crisis. When carbon dioxide from oil, coal and gas burning enters the sea, it forms carbonic acid. This reduces the availability of calcium carbonate, which many marine organisms depend upon to grow coral, shells or skeletons.
Near the bottom of the food chain, this directly affects species like oysters, molluscs and clams. Indirectly, it harms salmon, whales and other sea life that eat smaller organisms. Ultimately, this is a risk for human food security and coastal economies. Scientists are concerned that it could also weaken the ocean’s role as the planet’s most important heat absorber and its capacity to draw down 25-30% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Marine life plays an important role in this process, acting as a “biotic bump” to sequester carbon in the depths. In the report, all of the other six breached boundaries – climate change, biosphere integrity, land system change, freshwater use, biogeochemical flows, and novel entities – showed a worsening trend. But the authors said the addition of the only solely ocean-centred category was a alarming development because of its scale and importance.

An anonymous reader writes: OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank on Tuesday announced plans for five new artificial intelligence data centers in the United States to build out their ambitious Stargate project. [...] ChatGPT-maker OpenAI said on Tuesday it will open three new sites with Oracle in Shackelford County, Texas, Dona Ana County, New Mexico and an undisclosed site in the Midwest. Two more data center sites will be built in Lordstown, Ohio and Milam County, Texas by OpenAI, Japan's SoftBank and a SoftBank affiliate.
The new sites, the Oracle-OpenAI site expansion in Abilene, Texas, and the ongoing projects with CoreWeave will bring Stargate's total data center capacity to nearly 7 gigawatts and more than $400 billion in investment over the next three years, OpenAI said. The $500 billion project was intended to generate 10 gigawatts in total data center capacity. "AI can only fulfill its promise if we build the compute to power it," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. The Tuesday's announcement, expected to create 25,000 onsite jobs, follows Nvidia saying on Monday that it will invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and supply data center chips. OpenAI and partners plan to use debt financing to lease chips for the Stargate project, people familiar with the matter said.

Why AI Chatbots Can't Process Persian Social Etiquette

Anonymous Coward
on Tuesday September 23, 2025 @08:09PM
An anonymous reader writes: If an Iranian taxi driver waves away your payment, saying, "Be my guest this time," accepting their offer would be a cultural disaster. They expect you to insist on paying—probably three times—before they'll take your money. This dance of refusal and counter-refusal, called taarof, governs countless daily interactions in Persian culture. And AI models are terrible at it.
New research released earlier this month titled "We Politely Insist: Your LLM Must Learn the Persian Art of Taarof" shows that mainstream AI language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta fail to absorb these Persian social rituals, correctly navigating taarof situations only 34 to 42 percent of the time. Native Persian speakers, by contrast, get it right 82 percent of the time. This performance gap persists across large language models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Llama 3, DeepSeek V3, and Dorna, a Persian-tuned variant of Llama 3.
A study led by Nikta Gohari Sadr of Brock University, along with researchers from Emory University and other institutions, introduces "TAAROFBENCH," the first benchmark for measuring how well AI systems reproduce this intricate cultural practice. The researchers' findings show how recent AI models default to Western-style directness, completely missing the cultural cues that govern everyday interactions for millions of Persian speakers worldwide.

An anonymous reader writes: On Monday morning, I spoke to a Volvo EX90 owner who reported a litany of issues with her 2025 EX90: malfunctioning phone-as-a-key functionality, a useless keyfob, a keycard that rarely worked quickly, constant phone connection issues, infotainment glitches and error messages. I was surprised not because I hadn't heard of these kinds of problems, but because I experienced them myself over a year ago at the EX90 first drive again. At the time, Volvo said software fixes were imminent. Today, we know the issues go deeper. To solve them, Volvo announced on Tuesday that it will replace the central computer of every 2025 EX90 with the new one from the 2026 EX90. It's a tacit admission that the company can't solve the EX90's issues while simultaneously launching its next-generation software-defined vehicles, and that it's easier to replace the original computer than to build bug-free software for it. But for some, the damage to the Volvo brand has already been done.

Dedicated Mobile Apps For Vibe Coding Have So Far Failed To Gain Traction

An anonymous reader writes: While many vibe-coding startups have become unicorns, with valuations in the billions, one area where AI-assisted coding has not yet taken off is on mobile devices. Despite the numerous apps now available that offer vibe-coding tools on mobile platforms, none are gaining noticeable downloads, and few are generating any revenue at all. According to an analysis of global app store trends by the app intelligence provider Appfigures, only a small handful of mobile apps offering vibe-coding tools have seen any downloads, let alone generated revenue.
The largest of these is Instance: AI App Builder, which has seen only 16,000 downloads and $1,000 in consumer spending. The next largest app, Vibe Studio, has pulled in just 4,000 downloads but has made no money. This situation could still change, of course. The market is young, and vibe-coding apps continue to improve and work out the bugs. New apps in this space are arriving all the time, too. This year, a startup called Vibecode launched with $9.4 million in seed funding from Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six. The company’s service allows users to create mobile apps using AI within its own iOS app. Vibecode is so new, Appfigures doesn’t yet have data on it. For now, most people who want to toy around with vibe-coding technology are doing so on the desktop.
