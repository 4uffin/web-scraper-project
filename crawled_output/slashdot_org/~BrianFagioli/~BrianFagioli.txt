Tails 7.0 Linux distribution debuts with Debian 13 and GNOME 48

BrianFagioli writes: Tails 7.0 has officially arrived, marking the first release of the privacy-focused, Linux-based operating system based on Debian 13 âoeTrixieâ and GNOME 48 âoeBengaluru.â This update delivers faster startup times, refreshed applications, and stronger hardware support.One of the most noticeable improvements is boot speed. Thanks to a switch from xz to zstd compression, Tails now starts 10 to 15 seconds quicker on most machines. The tradeoff is a slightly larger image size, but for users with reliable USB sticks the difference in speed is worth it. The developers caution that low-quality USB drives could still cause slower boots.Software updates are a major part of this release. GNOME Terminal has been replaced by GNOME Console, and GNOME Image Viewer has been swapped for GNOME Loupe. Key applications have been updated as well, including Tor Browser 14.5.7, Tor client 0.4.8.17, Thunderbird 128.14.0esr, Electrum 4.5.8, KeePassXC 2.7.10, GIMP 3.0.4, Inkscape 1.4, and Audacity 3.7.3. The Text Editor and Document Scanner also get substantial upgrades.GNOME itself sees a wave of improvements. The Settings app now has redesigned sections for sound, accessibility, and input. New accessibility features include Overamplification and always-visible scrollbars. Other changes include a workspace indicator replacing the Activities button, better screen reader navigation, and an option to extend battery life in laptops. While GNOME 48 is a polished release, itâ(TM)s worth noting that GNOME 49 was released just yesterday, which makes Tails 7.0 feel slightly behind the curve from day one.Some older tools have been removed, such as unar, aircrack-ng, and the Power Statistics utility, but alternatives remain. File Roller still handles most RAR archives, and aircrack-ng can be reinstalled if needed using Additional Software.Under the hood, the Linux kernel has been updated to 6.12.43, boosting compatibility with newer graphics cards and Wi-Fi hardware. Memory requirements have also increased from 2GB to 3GB, though the developers expect this will affect very few users.Tails 7.0 is a huge step for anyone who values privacy and security. With faster performance, updated apps, and better hardware support, it continues to be one of the most important Linux-based tools for staying anonymous online.

BrianFagioli writes: The Fedora Project has announced Fedora Linux 43 Beta, giving users and developers the opportunity to test the distribution ahead of its final release. This beta introduces improvements across installation, system tools, and programming languages while continuing Fedoraâ(TM)s pattern of cleaning out older components.The beta can be downloaded in Workstation, KDE Plasma, Server, IoT, and Cloud editions. Spins and Labs are also available, though Mate and i3 are not provided in some builds. Existing systems can be upgraded with DNF system-upgrade. Fedora CoreOS will follow one week later through its âoenextâ stream.Installer changes are a major focus in Fedora 43. The Anaconda WebUI is now the default across Spins, creating a consistent and modern setup experience. The installer has also moved to DNF5, replacing DNF4. Support for modular packages has been removed, simplifying the installation process further. Fedora Kinoite now enables automatic updates by default, applying fixes in the background and finalizing them after reboot.Fedora 43 updates its core development tools. The GNU toolchain has been refreshed with gcc 15.2, glibc 2.42, binutils 2.45, and gdb 17.1. LLVM has been updated to version 21. Perl moves to 5.42, and OpenJDK 25 is now the preferred Java version. RPM itself jumps to 6.0, bringing structural changes for packagers. Package maintainers also benefit from new RPM macros for build flags, easing per-package compiler adjustments.On the language front, Python has been updated to version 3.14. Go 1.25 is included, with Golang packages now vendored by default to improve reproducibility. Idris 2 makes its debut, offering advanced type system features. Haskell GHC is updated to 9.8 with Stackage 23. The release also introduces support for the Hare programming language, which is still under development but available for experimentation.Other notable updates include PostgreSQL 18, Ruby on Rails 8.0, MySQL 8.4 as the default version, Dovecot 2.4, and Tomcat 10.1. Fedora CoreOS is now built with Containerfile, allowing Podman users to build locally. Greenboot has been rewritten in Rust, and SELinux handling sees adjustments with reduced âoedontauditâ rules.Fedora 43 also makes graphical and user-facing changes. Noto Color Emoji now uses the newer COLRv1 format, improving scalability. GNOME is now Wayland-only, retiring the old X11 session. The default monospace fallback font has been set to avoid inconsistent text rendering.Deprecated or removed components include the gold linker, python-nose, YASM, legacy GTK Rust bindings, and outdated Python RPM macros tied to setup.py. Packages depending on async-std and python-async-timeout are also being phased out.

Canonical brings NVIDIA CUDA directly to Ubuntu Linux for easier AI development

BrianFagioli writes: Canonical is making life a whole lot easier for developers who rely on NVIDIA GPUs. The publisher of Ubuntu has announced that the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit will now be distributed straight through Ubuntuâ(TM)s repositories. No more chasing downloads from NVIDIAâ(TM)s website or dealing with a long list of installation steps. Soon, a single command inside Ubuntu will get CUDA up and running.CUDA is the platform that lets developers push NVIDIA graphics cards beyond gaming and into serious number crunching. It gives direct access to GPU threads, memory handling, and kernels, which makes it essential for machine learning and large-scale computing tasks. While Ubuntu users have always had access to CUDA, setting it up hasnâ(TM)t exactly been seamless. Canonicalâ(TM)s change aims to fix that.This isnâ(TM)t some new partnership either. Canonical and NVIDIA have worked closely for years, with Ubuntu already being the go-to Linux distribution for data centers running GPU workloads. By distributing CUDA inside Ubuntu, Canonical is basically removing one of the last headaches for developers who want to get straight to building and testing their apps.For anyone managing systems at scale, this could be a big time-saver. Developers will be able to list CUDA as a dependency, and Ubuntu will handle the installation and compatibility behind the scenes. Thatâ(TM)s a huge shift from the current multi-step process, and it means fewer things breaking in production.It also ties neatly into Ubuntuâ(TM)s overall approach. Canonical has long promoted its secure supply chain, LTS releases, and the extended coverage available through Ubuntu Pro. Now CUDA falls under the same umbrella, which gives enterprises more confidence that their AI workloads will stay reliable over the long haul.If youâ(TM)re a developer, the takeaway is simple: youâ(TM)ll spend less time wrestling with installs and more time writing code. Canonical putting CUDA inside Ubuntuâ(TM)s repositories just makes sense, and itâ(TM)s a move that should benefit everyone from solo developers to massive data centers.

I used ChatGPT 5 to help me buy a car and hereâ(TM)s what happened

BrianFagioli writes: Buying a car is one of the biggest financial moves most people make, and it rarely feels simple. Prices are high nowadays, financing is confusing, and every website claims to have the right answer. When it came time to replace my 2020 Nissan Rogue Sport with 45,000 miles, I wanted a smarter way to cut through the noise. So I leaned on ChatGPT 5, the newest generation of AI, to see if it could help me make a clearer decision.This was not an experiment for fun. It was a real purchase that mattered to my family. With a toddler and more road trips ahead of us, the Rogue Sport just was not cutting it anymore. It was starting to feel cramped, and I knew it would not hold up trouble free forever (its CVT is notoriously problematic). Trading it in before it hit 50,000 miles made sense, but deciding what to buy next was the real challenge.At the end of it all, I drove home a used Honda Pilot EX-L. It may not be the flashiest option, but it was the most balanced. Big enough for road trips, dependable enough for long term peace of mind, and comfortable for family life. Trading in the cramped Rogue Sport for the roomy Pilot felt like the right move, a big step up that matched our needs without creating new headaches. Most importantly, I love it.The truth is, I probably would have gotten to the Pilot eventually. But ChatGPT 5 helped me cut the noise, confirm the facts, and feel confident that I was not missing something better. That confidence changed the whole experience.

The AI job apocalypse is a myth: layoffs are the real problem

BrianFagioli writes: Artificial intelligence is often blamed when companies announce layoffs, but new data shows the picture is far less dramatic. While some tasks are being reshaped by AI, most jobs are not disappearing. The bigger problem comes from business leaders choosing cuts instead of retraining.TechWolf, a workforce intelligence company, has released its Workforce Intelligence Index. It draws on more than two billion job postings collected worldwide between 2015 and 2025. The numbers tell a different story from the headlines. Only 18 percent of tasks can be fully automated. About 62 percent of work remains entirely human. Another 38 percent falls into the category of disruption, meaning tasks that can be either automated or augmented by AI.That means most workers are not being replaced. They are facing change, and change can be managed through reskilling. According to the data, 75 percent of employees at large technology firms have the potential to retrain into AI-augmented roles. Yet too often, companies fall back on layoffs, a move that may cut costs in the short term but weakens innovation and morale for years.Engineering jobs are a prime example. These roles are often painted as endangered, especially with the rise of AI-assisted coding tools. The Index shows the opposite. Engineers are shifting into roles where AI speeds up development, improves code quality, and frees up time for more complex architecture and design work.Some of the biggest names in tech highlight this potential. Microsoft shows 86 percent of its workforce could benefit from retraining. IBM sits at 85 percent, Dell at 79 percent, Apple at 75 percent, Cisco at 70 percent, and Qualcomm at 71 percent. In all of these cases, layoffs risk throwing away talent that could instead be retrained to master AI-driven tools.The same trend shows up outside of tech. Healthcare workers can be trained to work alongside AI in diagnostics and administration. Retail employees can move from repetitive logistics tasks to data-driven customer engagement. Even within industries, the picture varies. For example, one pharmaceutical companyâ(TM)s supply chain may be ripe for AI adoption, while another companyâ(TM)s sales team shows little disruption.The big takeaway is simple. AI is not triggering mass unemployment. It is reshaping tasks. The real damage comes when executives rush to layoffs instead of investing in their people. Companies that choose reskilling are better positioned to keep expertise, maintain culture, and capture the productivity gains that AI can actually deliver.

Microsoft forces workers back to the office and it stinks

BrianFagioli writes: Microsoft has decided it is time to rein in remote work. The company will soon require employees to spend at least three days per week in the office, starting with those in the Puget Sound region by February 2026. From there, the policy will spread across the United States and eventually overseas.The announcement came in a memo from Amy Coleman, Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer. She reminded staff how work has evolved over the decades, from the old days of desktop machines in the office to the pandemic era when working from home became normal. Coleman claimed that Microsoftâ(TM)s own data shows people thrive when they are together in person, saying teams are more energized, deliver stronger results, and drive the kind of collaboration needed to build its next wave of AI tools.That may be the official line, but I think forcing employees back into the office nowadays is rotten. It feels like a step backwards at a time when workers have already proven they can get the job done from home. While the company insists this is not about cutting staff, the underlying message is clear: Microsoft wants people at desks again, whether itâ(TM)s truly necessary or not.Exceptions can be requested, but managers are expected to enforce the rule and guide their teams through the change. The company also said it is beefing up safety and security measures at its offices to help ease the transition.For employees outside of Puget Sound, nothing changes immediately, but new timelines for other U.S. regions are on the way. International offices will follow in 2026.The bottom line? Remote work at Microsoft is being chipped away, and many workers who built their lives around flexibility will be left scrambling to adjust. To me, itâ(TM)s a disappointing move that ignores the lessons of the past few years.

BrianFagioli writes: Plex has alerted its customers about a security incident that may have affected user accounts. In an email sent to subscribers, the popular media server company confirmed that an unauthorized third party gained access to one of its databases. The breach exposed emails, usernames, and hashed passwords.Plex emphasized that passwords were encrypted following best practices, so attackers cannot simply read them. The company also reassured users that no credit card data was compromised, since Plex does not store that information on its servers. Still, out of caution, it is requiring all account holders to reset their credentials.Users are being directed to reset their passwords at plex.tv/reset. During the process, Plex recommends enabling the option to sign out all connected devices. This measure logs out every device associated with the account, including Plex Media Servers, forcing a fresh login with the updated password.The company says it has already fixed the method used by the intruder to gain entry and is conducting additional security reviews. Plex is also urging subscribers to enable two-factor authentication if they have not already done so.In its message, Plex stressed that no employee will ever ask for a customerâ(TM)s password or payment details via email. The company closed by apologizing to users and promising to strengthen its defenses to avoid similar incidents in the future.

BrianFagioli writes: Roku is celebrating a milestone that says a lot about where entertainment is heading. For the third month in a row, people in the United States spent more time streaming on Roku-powered devices than they did watching traditional broadcast television.Nielsenâ(TM)s latest data shows Roku-powered devices accounted for 21.4 percent of all TV viewing in July. Broadcast came in at 18.4 percent. That gap may not seem huge, but it marks a steady trend from May and June where streaming also came out ahead. Roku says its share of TV viewing is up 14 percent year-over-year, which suggests people are not just trying streaming, theyâ(TM)re sticking with it.The Roku Channel, the companyâ(TM)s free and ad-supported streaming service, represents 2.8 percent of all TV viewing on its own. But Roku is quick to point out that its platform goes beyond one service, covering thousands of apps and live TV providers. Itâ(TM)s not just about giving people access to content, but also about becoming the front door to modern television.âoeWhen we first said that all TV would be streamed, it was a bold prediction,â said Anthony Wood, Rokuâ(TM)s founder and CEO. âoeThat day is closer than ever.â Wood said the company now wants to make streaming easier and more personal while also giving creators and partners more impact.Charlie Collier, President of Roku Media, made a point about how much has changed since the days of the old TV guide. âoeIn broadcastâ(TM)s heyday, TV guides directed us to âmust-seeâ(TM) television and the pop cultural moments we shared. Today, the streaming platform is the guide, and the moments shaping culture are happening on Roku.âRoku powers streaming on smart TVs and devices in over half of internet-enabled U.S. households. By its own numbers, it sells more TV units than the next two operating systems combined. Itâ(TM)s a reminder that Roku has positioned itself as more than just a box or an app. It clearly wants to be the place where television happens.So, is traditional TV dead? Not yet, folks. Broadcast still plays a role, especially for live sports and local news. But with Roku steadily outpacing it, the balance of power is shifting. For many households, streaming is no longer the future of TVâ¦ itâ(TM)s already the present.

BrianFagioli writes: The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) has signed a new agreement with Microsoft that could change how federal agencies buy and use technology. The deal, part of GSAâ(TM)s OneGov strategy, is expected to save $3.1 billion in the first year alone.One of the biggest perks is free access to Microsoft 365 Copilot for millions of government employees on G5 plans. Agencies will be able to use the AI tool at no cost for up to 12 months.âoeThis agreement helps us advance AI adoption across the federal government, a key priority of the Trump Administration,â said GSA Deputy Administrator Stephen Ehikian. He called on agencies to take advantage of the new offers to cut costs and modernize operations.Josh Gruenbaum, Commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service, called OneGov âoea paradigm shift in federal procurementâ and said the savings are possible because the government is now buying as one large customer.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company has worked with the U.S. government for more than four decades. âoeWith this new agreement, including a no-cost Microsoft 365 Copilot offer, we will help agencies improve citizen services, strengthen security, and save taxpayers more than $3 billion in the first year alone,â Nadella said.Chris Barry, Microsoftâ(TM)s U.S. Public Sector lead, added that the company is âoecommitted to leading as the governmentâ(TM)s essential partnerâ as agencies move deeper into the AI era.The deal also includes steep discounts on Azure, Sentinel, Dynamics 365, and Entra ID Governance. Agencies wonâ(TM)t pay per-agent fees for new AI agent features, which can power citizen inquiries and case management systems. Microsoft also waived data egress fees, making it easier for agencies to share information securely across departments.Security is a major selling point. Microsoft 365, Azure, and other services are already authorized at FedRAMP High, meeting more than 400 NIST security controls. Copilot has provisional approval from the Department of Defense and is expected to earn full FedRAMP High clearance soon.Microsoft is also investing $20 million in support services and workshops to help agencies get the most from the deal. Those workshops will focus on cutting software duplication, boosting automation, and improving interoperability.Agencies can opt in until September 2026, with discounted pricing available for up to three years. If the projections hold, the partnership could deliver more than $6 billion in total value over three years.

Gen Z and millennials struggle to pay rent, could it slow iPhone and laptop sale

BrianFagioli writes: A new Redfin report paints a troubling picture of housing affordability in America, particularly for Gen Z and millennial renters and homeowners. Seven in 10 renters in those generations say they struggle to make their regular housing payments. Even homeowners in the same age group are feeling the pressure, with 41 percent saying the same.The study, based on a May 2025 survey of more than 4,000 U.S. adults, shows just how widespread the crunch has become. Younger generations were hit hardest, though baby boomers and Gen Xers are also affected. Over half of baby boomer renters and more than two-thirds of Gen X renters said they have a hard time making monthly payments.To make ends meet, young renters are cutting back on eating out, with 40 percent saying they dine at restaurants less often. Nearly one-third are skipping vacations, 27 percent borrow money from family or friends, and 25 percent pick up extra shifts. Some of the most drastic measures include selling belongings, delaying medical treatments, and in more than one in five cases, skipping meals.Millennials and Gen Zers who own their homes report similar adjustments. They are more likely than renters to cut luxuries like eating out and traveling, but fewer said they are skipping meals or putting off doctor visits to make mortgage payments. Older Americans also trim back on non-essentials. Roughly 45 percent of baby boomer and Gen X homeowners said they cut back on restaurants, and two in five reported taking no or fewer vacations.The backdrop is a basic affordability problem. Home prices are up more than 40 percent since before the pandemic, mortgage rates have doubled, and rents have climbed more than 20 percent. Wages, on the other hand, have grown about 28 percent in the same period. Younger workers typically earn less because they are earlier in their careers. Many are also burdened with student loans and do not have equity from a previous home sale to help.“Many Gen Zers and millennials are making real sacrifices, picking up side gigs, selling their possessions, even delaying doctor’s appointments just to pay for the basic need of housing,” said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin’s chief economist. She added that “a lot of the young people who can easily afford housing can do so because they have major financial support from their parents, with roughly one-quarter of the young Americans who recently bought a home using family money for their down payments.”Fairweather warned that with home costs rising much faster than wages, “people without access to family money are much more likely to struggle to pay for housing, which could widen the gap between the haves and the have-nots in the future.”There are a few encouraging signs, however. Mortgage rates recently dropped to a 10-month low. Buyers now have more purchasing power and sellers are more willing to negotiate. Affordability has even improved in 11 major metro areas, including parts of California and Florida.Jim Fletcher, a Redfin Premier agent in Tampa, Florida, explained that “the local market is slow, with builders offering incentives to entice people to buy and individual sellers willing to negotiate because there’s so much supply on the market.” He suggested that for people early in their careers, “it’s a good time to start building equity. They can get homes for less than they could have a few years ago, especially if they’re open to condos or townhouses.”But the report also raises a larger question. If so many young people are skipping meals and delaying medical care just to afford rent, how are they still buying the latest smartphones, tablets, and laptops?Look, folks, flagship devices now range from $800 to more than $2,000 nowadays. Even so-called budget laptops and tablets remain a serious expense. If housing continues to strain budgets, younger buyers may finally cut back on yearly gadget upgrades. That could ripple into the consumer tech industry, which depends heavily on these same demographics for steady sales.

Perplexity Comet security flaw shows AI browsers are easily hijacked

BrianFagioli writes: Brave researchers have revealed a troubling vulnerability in Perplexityâ(TM)s Comet that shows just how risky AI-powered browsers can be. The flaw, known as an indirect prompt injection, allowed attackers to trick the browser into carrying out hidden commands.The research was led by Brave engineer Artem Chaikin and detailed with VP of Privacy and Security Shivan Kaul Sahib. They found that Comet could not tell the difference between a userâ(TM)s instructions and malicious text hidden inside a webpage. That oversight opened the door to serious account takeovers and data theft.In their demonstration, a Reddit comment with invisible text instructed Comet to visit Perplexityâ(TM)s account page, grab the userâ(TM)s email, intercept a one-time password from Gmail, and then send the stolen data back to the attacker. Once the victim clicked âoesummarize page,â the AI did the rest automatically. No additional input was required from the user.This kind of attack bypasses traditional web safeguards such as same-origin policy and CORS. Those protections normally prevent websites from stealing data across different domains, but when an AI assistant has full control of the browser, the rules break down. Because the AI operates with the full privileges of a logged-in user, it can move freely between services and access sensitive accounts without the user realizing what is happening.

Google TV and Android TV apps must support 64-bit starting August 2026

BrianFagioli writes: Google is preparing to bring its television platforms in line with the rest of Android. Starting August 1, 2026, both Google TV and Android TV will require app updates that include native code to provide 64-bit support. The move follows similar requirements for phones and tablets, and it paves the way for upcoming 64-bit TV devices.For developers, the change means any new app or update with native code must include an arm64 version alongside the existing 32-bit variant. Apps that fail to do so will not be accepted on Google Play for TV devices. Google says the shift will bring better performance, shorter start times, and enable new experiences on future hardware.If an app targets Android 15 or higher, it must also be compatible with 16 KB memory page sizes, another requirement meant to ensure smoother performance across modern systems. While 32-bit support will continue, apps can no longer be 32-bit only. Developers will need to ship both versions using App Bundle ABI splits.Google stresses that this requirement only impacts apps containing native code, such as those with .so libraries. Tools like the APK Analyzer can help identify whether an app includes these files. To test the changes, developers can use the Google TV emulator for Apple Silicon Macs or physical hardware like the Nvidia Shield, which supports both 32-bit and 64-bit userspaces. Pixel phones running Android 7 or newer can also be configured to mimic TV resolution and DPI for sideload testing.The company recommends developers begin checking their apps now and updating code where needed. By August 2026, all TV apps with native code must be ready for 64-bit and 16 KB page size compliance in order to remain on Google Play.

If you are still running Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1, this is the end of the road. LibreOffice will not run on those systems anymore, and there are no workarounds. The suite has slammed the door shut.For years, LibreOffice kept older Windows users afloat while Microsoft and other developers moved on. That lifeline is gone. Anyone stubbornly clinging to Windows 7 or 8 now has two choices: upgrade or stay stuck on outdated software. LibreOffice has made it clear that it will not carry dead platforms any further.And the cuts do not stop there. 32-bit Windows builds are on their way out, with deprecation already in place. On the Mac side, 25.8 is the last release that runs on macOS 10.15. Starting with LibreOffice 26.2, only macOS 11 and newer will be supported. In other words, if your computer is too old to run modern systems, LibreOffice is walking away.
