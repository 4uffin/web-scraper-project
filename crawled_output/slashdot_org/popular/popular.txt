whoever57 writes: Birmingham city council, the largest such entity in Europe has been declared effectively bankrupt. There are a couple of reasons for this, but one of them is a disastrous project to replace the city's income management system, using Oracle. The cost of this has
risen to $230M, while the initial estimate was $24M. There was a failed rollout of the new system
earlier this year.

The Silent Erosion: Global Generational Cognitive Decline in the Age of AI ...

rezoG writes: Research at the R. C. Patel Institute of Technology, Administration, Shirpur, India, indicates that broad adoption and incorporation of A.I. into the social sphere is not without some costs.
The researchers explored the extent of cognitive decline related to A.I.-reliance across multiple nations. It is concluded (tentatively) that widespread A.I. entwinement within socio-technical spheres does result in cognitive atrophy, degeneration. The effects were found to be more pronounced in nations with higher A.I. adoption, lesser in nations with a more responsible approach to pedagogy, inclusion of A.I. in the lifestyles.This study formalizes the concept of national cognitive resilience as the capacity of a country
to preserve and regenerate metacognitive friction, epistemic novelty density, and human
interpretive effort despite increasing AI integration. In the AI era, the boundaries between
thinking and automation, learning and consumption, and originality and replication are quietly
dissolving. The silent consequence is GCA, the recursive weakening of human epistemic
agency through sustained reliance on AI-mediated knowledge production. This erosion is not
accidental; it arises from design logics that privilege frictionless efficiency and predictive
optimization over ambiguity, novelty, and reflection.
The results show clearly that AI readiness does not equate to cognitive resilience. Nations with
advanced AI infrastructure, such as China and the United States, may record low CDI scores
when novelty is eroded and automation reliance is high. Conversely, countries like Singapore,
and Finland outside this dataset, sustain high CDI scores by embedding cognitive scaffolding
into their educational and governance systems, even with similar AI maturity levels. Historical
precedents such as the Gutenberg press, industrial schooling, and the screen revolution
demonstrate that cognitive systems can recover from compression and conformity, but only
through deliberate pedagogical reform and institutional innovation.
The broader implication is that cognition must be treated as a civilizational asset, equal in
strategic importance to ecological sustainability or democratic stability. Just as environmental
degradation prompted coordinated global climate action, cognitive degradation demands
epistemic governance that is transdisciplinary, generational, and anticipatory. Embedding
GCAL–CDI metrics into AI policy, designing reflective human–AI interfaces, and prioritizing
epistemic plurality over algorithmic conformity are essential to achieving this.
Artificial intelligence need not be inherently corrosive.

Cloudflare shocks the Internet with launch of NET Dollar stablecoin
(nerds.xyz)

BrianFagioli
on Thursday September 25, 2025 @02:29PM
BrianFagioli writes: Cloudflare has revealed something I did not see coming. The company, best known for protecting and accelerating websites, is now introducing a stablecoin called NET Dollar. A U.S. dollar-backed cryptocurrency from Cloudflare feels unusual to me, and Iâ(TM)m still surprised by it. The decision shows just how much the Internet is shifting in response to artificial intelligence.NET Dollar is meant to support instant, secure payments for what Cloudflare calls the âoeagentic web.â In this future, AI agents handle tasks such as booking flights, buying groceries, and managing calendars. For that kind of automation, the money itself needs to move instantly, work globally, and be trustworthy. Cloudflare believes NET Dollar will fill that role.CEO Matthew Prince said, âoeFor decades, the business model of the Internet ran on ad platforms and bank transfers. The Internetâ(TM)s next business model will be powered by pay-per-use, fractional payments, and microtransactionsâ"tools that shift incentives toward original, creative content that actually adds value.â He added that by using its global network, Cloudflare aims to âoehelp modernize the financial rails needed to move money at the speed of the Internet.âCloudflare says NET Dollar will make payments possible anywhere in the world, across currencies and borders. It will allow personal AI agents to act instantly, such as paying for a plane ticket the moment a price drops, while business AI agents could be programmed to release payment as soon as a delivery is confirmed. The company also expects creators, developers, and content providers to benefit from easier monetization.Alongside NET Dollar, Cloudflare is contributing to open standards like the Agent Payments Protocol and x402. These are intended to simplify how payments move across the Internet.I remain shocked that Cloudflare is taking this step. It feels odd to see a company rooted in security and performance suddenly create a digital currency. Still, AI is reshaping the Internet faster than many expected, and Cloudflare clearly wants to position itself at the center of how payments will work in that world. Whether NET Dollar becomes widely adopted or fades as an experiment, the launch is a reminder that the financial side of the Internet may look very different in the years ahead.

Cloudflare Introduces NET Dollar

head_dunce writes: In a bold move, Cloudflare announced NET Dollar, a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin designed to enable instant, secure transactions across the web — at “the speed of the Internet.”Their pitch: as autonomous agents and AI tools increasingly mediate digital interactions (booking flights, procuring items, negotiating services), the financial rails must evolve accordingly. NET Dollar is meant to support microtransactions, pay-per-use models, and fractional payments in that ecosystem.Cloudflare says this could shift the Internet’s monetization model away from ads and bulk payments toward rewarding originality, enabling new monetization paths for content creators, API providers, and AI systems.The company is also contributing to open standards (like the Agent Payments Protocol) and positioning NET Dollar as a bridge between traditional financial systems and an “agentic web.”

Remote controlled car rental service

votsalo
on Thursday September 25, 2025 @01:39AM
votsalo writes: A German company, Vay, offers a rental car service where the cars are driven by a remote driver to the customer, who then takes over driving the car.
At the end of the rental, a remote driver takes over again to take the car away.
The trained remote drivers sit in a driving station, with a steering wheel, foot pedals, screens, headphones, and even tactile feedback for things like bumps on the road.Vay says the rental rate cost would be "about half of what a current car-sharing service costs".
If he is talking about car-rental services that deliver cars to customers by on-site drivers, like
this defunct San Francisco car rental company, then the claim about half the cost seems right.Vay's founder used Las Vegas as a testing ground for the service, and expects to launch in Germany soon.
Las Vegas had the necessary legal framework already in place.

BYD U9 Set Fastest Production Car World Record

hackingbear writes: China is known for boasting the world's cheapest EVs, and is now also home to the fastest. Chinese automaker BYD's YangWang U9 Xtreme just blew the whole competition out of the water. The U9 Xtreme just hit a top speed of 308.4 mph (496.32 km/h) on the ATP Papenburg oval track in Germany, making it the fastest car in production, after demolishing the top-speed record for production EVs a few weeks ago. It was once again driven by German racer Marc Basseng, who piloted the hypercar beyond the previous record-holding Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+, which managed 304.8 back in 2019. The U9 Xtreme sports an insane quad-motor powertrain on a 1200-volt system, combining for a total output of over 2959 horsepower. One small caveat that doesn't lessen the impressiveness of the feat is that while the U9 Xtreme does classify as a production model, it barely does. That's because BYD is planning to limit production of the top-speed version of the U9 to no more than 30 units. The Xtreme is a high-performance version of Yangwang U9, BYD's pothole-jumping hypercar, which costs around $233,000 in China.

Why Volvo Is Replacing Every EX90's Central Computer
(insideevs.com)
Submitted
by
Anonymous Coward
on Tuesday September 23, 2025 @05:36PM
An anonymous reader writes: On Monday morning, I spoke to a Volvo EX90 owner who reported a litany of issues with her 2025 EX90: malfunctioning phone-as-a-key functionality, a useless keyfob, a keycard that rarely worked quickly, constant phone connection issues, infotainment glitches and error messages. I was surprised not because I hadn't heard of these kinds of problems, but because I experienced them myself over a year ago at the EX90 first drive again. At the time, Volvo said software fixes were imminent. Today, we know the issues go deeper. To solve them, Volvo announced on Tuesday that it will replace the central computer of every 2025 EX90 with the new one from the 2026 EX90. It's a tacit admission that the company can't solve the EX90's issues while simultaneously launching its next-generation software-defined vehicles, and that it's easier to replace the original computer than to build bug-free software for it. But for some, the damage to the Volvo brand has already been done.

The cool nights are great for throwing the windows open and listening to the lullaby of breaking waves.But now some people here are seeing red. Literally. Right from the same Madaket Beach where they watch those spectacular sunsets over Nantucket Sound.Vineyard Wind has 62 wind turbines planned for 15 miles southwest of the island. Seventeen are already operating, the company said.Each one is 812 feet tall, nearly 22 times the size of the Green Monster at Fenway Park. Each blade is the size of a football field.On clear nights, the blinking red lights make it look like Logan Airport.“I don’t like all this mess out on the horizon, all the flashing red lights each night,” says one fisherman, who asked that he not be named.“When you come out here you expect peace and serenity and it’s flashing lights out there, it just messes with your psyche.”

schwit1 writes: As of September 1, 2025, banks across Vietnam are closing accounts deemed inactive or non-compliant with new biometric rules. Authorities estimate that more than 86 million accounts out of roughly 200 million are at risk if users fail to update their identity verification.
The State Bank of Vietnam has also introduced stricter thresholds for transactions:
Facial authentication is mandatory for online transfers above 10 million VND (about $379).Cumulative daily transfers over 20 million VND ($758) also require biometric approval.The policy is part of the central bank’s broader “cashless” strategy, aimed at combating fraud, identity theft, and deepfake-enabled scams.
As one person commented
If users don't comply by the 30th they'll lose their money. This is why we bitcoin.

EU policymakers finally plan to fix the cookie banner nightmare they created

jjslash writes: The European Commission is drafting amendments to the ePrivacy Directive to reduce the constant flood of cookie consent banners. Currently, websites must get explicit permission and clearly explain their data practices, leading to widespread banner fatigue. Critics argue that this overuse has backfired, with most users clicking “accept” without reading, undermining privacy protections and awareness.More than a decade ago, Europe rewrote internet rules which effectively forced the entire internet to adopt stricter rules on cookie consent by amending the ePrivacy Directive. Since 2009, from big tech giants, to small personal blogs, and virtually any internet-based organization had to display a "cookie banner" to first-time visitors. Collectively, European users spend an estimated 575 hours every year clicking through those pesky prompts.

Criminals use portable SMS blasters to flood phones with phishing texts
(techspot.com)
Submitted

jjslash
on Tuesday September 23, 2025 @11:00AM
jjslash writes: Cybercriminals are increasingly using portable devices known as SMS blasters to flood phones with fraudulent text messages, marking a shift in how large-scale phishing scams are carried out. Instead of relying on lists of numbers and automated delivery systems routed through mobile networks, criminals have begun installing fake cell towers in cars or backpacks to beam scam texts directly to nearby phones. These devices, often disguised inside vehicles, impersonate cellular base stations and force surrounding phones into insecure connections.
The trend is a turning point, according to Cathal Mc Daid, VP of technology at telecommunications and cybersecurity firm Enea. "This is essentially the first time that we have seen large-scale use of mobile radio-transmitting devices by criminal groups," Mc Daid told Wired.

FIFNIC: An Open Source Bane

BrendaEM writes: Firstly, Thank you to all the heroic open-source coders, as well as the many people who support open-source projects by helping the masses of computer users on forums.
For the lack of a better term, the problem is: Fixed in Forum, Not In Code, a condition that exists when there is insufficient feedback to the actual coders of software--yet the problem and even the workaround may be known elsewhere on the forums. So, old bugs persist.
With an inclusive library-based tree-like structure of a large open-source project--rising to the level of a Linux distribution. It can be hard to tell at which level the problem lies. Some well-documented bugs and fixes on the forums never reach the people who write the code, so the issue does not get fixed at the source. So, then the huddled masses continue to pour into the forums and mailing lists for answers and workarounds--to issues that might have been fixed at the source. This is why a quick NOTABUG and a quickly closed thread can cause issues downstream, and why more distro-to-programer communication might help.
