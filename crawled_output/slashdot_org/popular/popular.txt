BYD U9 Set Fastest Production Car World Record

hackingbear writes: China is known for boasting the world's cheapest EVs, and is now also home to the fastest. Chinese automaker BYD's YangWang U9 Xtreme just blew the whole competition out of the water. The U9 Xtreme just hit a top speed of 308.4 mph (496.32 km/h) on the ATP Papenburg oval track in Germany, making it the fastest car in production, after demolishing the top-speed record for production EVs a few weeks ago. It was once again driven by German racer Marc Basseng, who piloted the hypercar beyond the previous record-holding Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+, which managed 304.8 back in 2019. The U9 Xtreme sports an insane quad-motor powertrain on a 1200-volt system, combining for a total output of over 2959 horsepower. One small caveat that doesn't lessen the impressiveness of the feat is that while the U9 Xtreme does classify as a production model, it barely does. That's because BYD is planning to limit production of the top-speed version of the U9 to no more than 30 units. The Xtreme is a high-performance version of Yangwang U9, BYD's pothole-jumping hypercar, which costs around $233,000 in China.

Why Volvo Is Replacing Every EX90's Central Computer
(insideevs.com)
Submitted
by
Anonymous Coward
on Tuesday September 23, 2025 @05:36PM
An anonymous reader writes: On Monday morning, I spoke to a Volvo EX90 owner who reported a litany of issues with her 2025 EX90: malfunctioning phone-as-a-key functionality, a useless keyfob, a keycard that rarely worked quickly, constant phone connection issues, infotainment glitches and error messages. I was surprised not because I hadn't heard of these kinds of problems, but because I experienced them myself over a year ago at the EX90 first drive again. At the time, Volvo said software fixes were imminent. Today, we know the issues go deeper. To solve them, Volvo announced on Tuesday that it will replace the central computer of every 2025 EX90 with the new one from the 2026 EX90. It's a tacit admission that the company can't solve the EX90's issues while simultaneously launching its next-generation software-defined vehicles, and that it's easier to replace the original computer than to build bug-free software for it. But for some, the damage to the Volvo brand has already been done.

It seems like car manufacturers cannot resist selling telematics (driving data) from connected cars to all kinds of third parties.

An anonymous reader writes: NANTUCKET — Ahhh, September on Nantucket, the best month of the year.The traffic backups are gone, the locals are chill, the fish are still biting.The stunning nature is soothing. The cool nights are great for throwing the windows open and listening to the lullaby of breaking waves.But now some people here are seeing red. Literally. Right from the same Madaket Beach where they watch those spectacular sunsets over Nantucket Sound.Vineyard Wind has 62 wind turbines planned for 15 miles southwest of the island. Seventeen are already operating, the company said.Each one is 812 feet tall, nearly 22 times the size of the Green Monster at Fenway Park. Each blade is the size of a football field.On clear nights, the blinking red lights make it look like Logan Airport.“I don’t like all this mess out on the horizon, all the flashing red lights each night,” says one fisherman, who asked that he not be named.“When you come out here you expect peace and serenity and it’s flashing lights out there, it just messes with your psyche.”

Vietnam Shuts Down Millions of Bank Accounts Over Biometric Rules

schwit1 writes: As of September 1, 2025, banks across Vietnam are closing accounts deemed inactive or non-compliant with new biometric rules. Authorities estimate that more than 86 million accounts out of roughly 200 million are at risk if users fail to update their identity verification.
The State Bank of Vietnam has also introduced stricter thresholds for transactions:
Facial authentication is mandatory for online transfers above 10 million VND (about $379).Cumulative daily transfers over 20 million VND ($758) also require biometric approval.The policy is part of the central bank’s broader “cashless” strategy, aimed at combating fraud, identity theft, and deepfake-enabled scams.
As one person commented
If users don't comply by the 30th they'll lose their money. This is why we bitcoin.

Google launches "Learn Your Way"

schwit1 writes: This is going to revolutionize education Google just launched "Learn Your Way" that basically takes whatever boring chapter you're supposed to read and rebuilds it around stuff you actually give a damn about.Like if you're into basketball and have to learn Newton's laws, suddenly all the examples are about dribbling and shooting. Art kid studying economics? Now it's all gallery auctions and art markets.Here's what got me though. They didn't just find-and-replace examples like most "personalized" learning crap does. The AI actually generates different ways to consume the same information:- Mind maps if you think visually- Audio lessons with these weird simulated teacher conversations- Timelines you can click around- Quizzes that change based on what you're screwing upThey tested this on 60 high schoolers. Random assignment, proper study design. Kids using their system absolutely destroyed the regular textbook group on both immediate testing and when they came back three days later.Every single one said it made them more confident.The part that surprised me? They actually solved the accuracy problem. Most ed-tech either dumbs everything down to nothing or gets basic facts wrong.

EU policymakers finally plan to fix the cookie banner nightmare they created

jjslash writes: The European Commission is drafting amendments to the ePrivacy Directive to reduce the constant flood of cookie consent banners. Currently, websites must get explicit permission and clearly explain their data practices, leading to widespread banner fatigue. Critics argue that this overuse has backfired, with most users clicking “accept” without reading, undermining privacy protections and awareness.More than a decade ago, Europe rewrote internet rules which effectively forced the entire internet to adopt stricter rules on cookie consent by amending the ePrivacy Directive. Since 2009, from big tech giants, to small personal blogs, and virtually any internet-based organization had to display a "cookie banner" to first-time visitors. Collectively, European users spend an estimated 575 hours every year clicking through those pesky prompts.

Criminals use portable SMS blasters to flood phones with phishing texts
(techspot.com)
Submitted

jjslash
on Tuesday September 23, 2025 @11:00AM
jjslash writes: Cybercriminals are increasingly using portable devices known as SMS blasters to flood phones with fraudulent text messages, marking a shift in how large-scale phishing scams are carried out. Instead of relying on lists of numbers and automated delivery systems routed through mobile networks, criminals have begun installing fake cell towers in cars or backpacks to beam scam texts directly to nearby phones. These devices, often disguised inside vehicles, impersonate cellular base stations and force surrounding phones into insecure connections.
The trend is a turning point, according to Cathal Mc Daid, VP of technology at telecommunications and cybersecurity firm Enea. "This is essentially the first time that we have seen large-scale use of mobile radio-transmitting devices by criminal groups," Mc Daid told Wired.

FIFNIC: An Open Source Bane

BrendaEM writes: Firstly, Thank you to all the heroic open-source coders, as well as the many people who support open-source projects by helping the masses of computer users on forums.
For the lack of a better term, the problem is: Fixed in Forum, Not In Code, a condition that exists when there is insufficient feedback to the actual coders of software--yet the problem and even the workaround may be known elsewhere on the forums. So, old bugs persist.
With an inclusive library-based tree-like structure of a large open-source project--rising to the level of a Linux distribution. It can be hard to tell at which level the problem lies. Some well-documented bugs and fixes on the forums never reach the people who write the code, so the issue does not get fixed at the source. So, then the huddled masses continue to pour into the forums and mailing lists for answers and workarounds--to issues that might have been fixed at the source. This is why a quick NOTABUG and a quickly closed thread can cause issues downstream, and why more distro-to-programer communication might help.

LastPass uncovers fake GitHub repos spreading Atomic Stealer malware to Mac user

BrianFagioli writes: Mac users have a new reason to be cautious when downloading software. LastPass has revealed that cybercriminals are running a large-scale campaign using fraudulent GitHub repositories to trick people into installing the Atomic Stealer (AMOS) malware.The LastPass Threat Intelligence, Mitigation, and Escalation (TIME) team discovered the effort, which uses aggressive Search Engine Optimization (SEO) tactics to push malicious links to the top of Google and Bing results. The attackers create GitHub pages impersonating companies such as LastPass, 1Password, Citibank, Fidelity, Docker, Dropbox, Shopify, and dozens more. Once clicked, the repositories redirect victims to malicious websites that instruct them to run terminal commands on their Macs. Those commands eventually pull down the Atomic Stealer payload.LastPass says it immediately reported and helped take down multiple GitHub pages targeting its own customers. One example involved a repository that pretended to offer âoeInstall LastPass on MacBook,â which funneled users through a series of redirects until they unknowingly executed a CURL command that decoded into a malicious download from bonoud[.]com. That file planted the infostealer under the guise of an âoeUpdateâ process.Atomic Stealer is not new. It has been circulating since at least April 2023 and is associated with financially motivated groups that focus on harvesting passwords, crypto wallet keys, and other sensitive information. This latest campaign simply repackages an old threat in a new delivery method, using GitHubâ(TM)s trusted reputation and search visibility to ensnare victims.The list of impersonated brands is long. Beyond password managers and financial firms, the attackers set up GitHub repos imitating software projects like Audacity, Thunderbird, Docker, Notion, Obsidian, and even Adobeâ(TM)s After Effects. This shows a broad shotgun-style approach rather than a narrow focus.LastPass has shared a full set of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to help defenders identify infections and related infrastructure. Security teams can use these to block known domains and hashes linked to the campaign. The company is continuing to monitor the operation and warns that the same actors may quickly create new repositories after takedowns.For everyday users, the advice is simple but critical: do not install software from random GitHub pages or unfamiliar websites, even if they appear high in search results. Download only from official company sites or trusted app stores.LastPass stresses that protecting users is its top priority and says it will keep collaborating with industry partners to disrupt the attackers. But at the end of the day, personal vigilance remains the best defense.

NASA: More than 6,000 exoplanets confirmed, over 8,000 candidates
(heise.de)

alternative_right
on Sunday September 21, 2025 @11:25PM
alternative_right writes: The existence of planets around other stars was only experimentally confirmed three decades ago; now there are more and more instruments designed specifically for the search. More than two-thirds of the confirmed exoplanets were found using the so-called transit method, which involves observing them as they pass in front of their star. More than 1.100 additional exoplanets were found using the radial velocity method, in which stars reveal their small companions through their own movements. NASA lists nine other methods, but together they have contributed only a few hundred exoplanets to the database.According to the database, researchers also know the mass of one-third of the confirmed exoplanets, 102 of which are roughly comparable to Earth. In addition, over 500 exoplanets are about the size of Earth, and the radius is known for almost 4.500 celestial bodies. This and much more data can be found in NASA's "Exoplanet Archive," which is maintained by the Exoplanet Science Institute at the California Institute of Technology. According to NASA, the rate at which the number of confirmed exoplanets is growing has recently accelerated, with the 5.000 mark only being exceeded at the beginning of 2022. Future instruments are likely to cause the number to rise even faster.

LibreOffice Needs a Bullt-in Non-AI Adulterated Grammar Checker

BrendaEM writes: LibreOffice writer is a great word processor. Its menus are coherent. It suffer from suffers from less inline style-corruption than Word. Its files are lossless compressed to save on disk space--allowing you to save more often, but as download and installed, there seems to be no functioning grammar checker. I will not write for all writers, but I have no trust for anything touched by unchecked AI. I just want things like double space checking, punctuation, and that kind of thing, grammar checking before large companies lined up to steal your content. While grammar checking extensions are available, most are touched by AI, or require additional Java. So, why is no included grammar checking in LibreOffice?
