What is this?
This is Slashdot, a website based on and running the
Slashdot-Like Automated Story-Telling Homepage
software. You're reading
the FAQ.
Slashdot is the oldest tech news and discussion site on the web. Slashdot is also one of the largest business software comparison and review websites in the world, with over 100,000 business software products. Millions of people visit Slashdot every month to find and compare the best business software.
Who does this?
Slashdot was created in 1997 by Rob "CmdrTaco" Malda. Today it's owned by Slashdot Media. Slashdot is run primarily by a handful of editors and coders, with the help of many others. The editors are Beau ("BeauHD") Hamilton, Manish ("manishs") Singh, David ("EditorDavid"), and Logan ("whipslash") Abbott.
What does the name "Slashdot" mean?
"Slashdot" is an intentionally obnoxious URL.
When Rob registered the domain
http://slashdot.org,
he wanted a URL that was confusing when read aloud.
