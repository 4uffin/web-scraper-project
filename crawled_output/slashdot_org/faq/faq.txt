About Slashdot
What is this?
This is Slashdot, a website based on and running the
Slashdot-Like Automated Story-Telling Homepage
software. You're reading
the FAQ.
Slashdot is the oldest tech news and discussion site on the web. Slashdot is also one of the largest business software comparison and review websites in the world, with over 100,000 business software products. Millions of people visit Slashdot every month to find and compare the best business software.
Who does this?
Slashdot was created in 1997 by Rob "CmdrTaco" Malda. Today it's owned by Slashdot Media. Slashdot is run primarily by a handful of editors and coders, with the help of many others. The editors are Beau ("BeauHD") Hamilton, Manish ("manishs") Singh, David ("EditorDavid"), and Logan ("whipslash") Abbott.
What does the name "Slashdot" mean?
"Slashdot" is an intentionally obnoxious URL.
When Rob registered the domain
http://slashdot.org,
he wanted a URL that was confusing when read aloud.
(Try it!)
Top
Editorial—Story Submissions, etc.
How do I submit a story? What about corrections or updates?
To submit stories, corrections, or updates, please use
the
submissions form.
Submit corrections or updates just as if you were
submitting any other news item, by using the
web submission form.
Please include a link to the story you're updating or
correcting, and explain what the trouble is.
How do I Ask Slashdot?
Use the same
submissions form;
just make clear that you're asking a question.
(A good way is to title your submission starting with
"Ask Slashdot.")
Why did you change my submission?
We often edit submissions for reasons of spelling,
grammar, or clarity, or to format them for visual
consistency. We're happy when a story submission comes
in with no changes needed, but most stories get at
least a tweak or two. Sometimes we'll shorten a
submission to emphasize its key points or points,
remove links not relevant or central to the story
posted, swap anchor text to make links easier to read,
or substitute a better link for one that may be broken,
expired or paywalled (or not the best link for some
other reason). When two submissions offer different
sources, we may combine them into a single story.
Sometimes, too, we may fold links to relevant previous
Slashdot stories into the text, or add these links
separately. Though we do so in good faith, we apologize
in advance and strive to correct any errors that this
tweaking introduces.
Could you explain why my submission was declined?
This is harder than it sounds. We try to select the
most interesting, timely, and relevant submissions, but
can only run a fraction of those submitted; there are
probably as many reasons for stories to get declined as
there are stories. Think positive: read our
submissions guidelines
for some hints about increasing the chances that we'll
run yours.
Can I submit a story anonymously?
Yes. If you log in, though, the editors can follow up
with questions if for some reason we'd otherwise like
to run your story but some crucial word or link is
missing.
Where do I submit press releases?
We'd rather you didn't submit press releases—at
least not ones that sound like press releases! But if
you're going to submit one,
please use the submission form.
Can I email a story submission?
In short, No. If you email one of the editors directly,
the others won't see your submission. (And your mail
might hit someone who's on vacation, sleeping, or has a
downed network connection.) Assume that any emailed
story submission is likely to go unread; please
use the submission form
instead.
I submitted a similar submission before the one you actually ran!
Sometimes we post a later submission rather than an
earlier one. There are a variety of factors: the
personality of the post, the quality of the submission,
or even the quantity of stories already posted when
your submission entered the queue—and sometimes,
we just mess up.
I want to write a book review. What should I do?
Be sure to read our
book review guidelines
so you know what we're looking for. When you're ready
to submit it, you can do so on our submissions page.
Top
Slashdot Interviews
How many questions can I ask?
Ask as many questions as you'd like! Just don't ask
unrelated questions in the same comment; instead, ask
separately, so they can be moderated separately. (More
chances to win!)
I asked nearly the same question as one you selected to pass on; why?
Often several readers ask similar questions. If yours
is the one Slashdot editors believe represents that
"group" of questions best, it's the one that gets
picked. We tend to pick questions that have meaningful
subject lines, and we prefer questions that are short
and pithy to long, wandering ones.
Hey, that eleventh question wasn't even highly moderated!
It's a human factor. Moderation helps us decide which
questions to send along, but often there are
interesting ones which haven't been modded up as much.
Top
Tags
What are tags?
Tags are text labels you can add to a story that help
categorize stories by content or category.
Clicking
the tag icon will open a text field
for tagging. Type
in a tag, then press the space bar. Repeat for all tags
you'd like to add to the story.
Note: Adding the same tag more than once does
not increase its weight; once is enough.
You might,
though, tag a story about Western Digital hard drives
"wd," "westerndigital," and "storage," or a story about
an MIT programming contest "programming,"
"competition," and "mit." Tags help sort stories, and
help you search for related ones. More tags help!
Everyone can see them! Tags are public and flexible
(rather than private and permanent). So one day, we
might consolidate and change all "canine" tags to
"dog," say, or define new system tags and usurp more
namespace. (Don't say we didn't warn you!) Because tags
on Slashdot are public, and are used to inform the
moderation system, tag abuse can hurt your karma.
Please tag in good faith.
What syntax do tags require?
Tags should be all-lowercase; leave out
punctuation and spaces—a space is used to
enter multiple tags. So use "bigbrother," not
"big brother."
Numbers can appear but can't be first. Smoosh
them together: "usb3," not "usb 3."
For the opposite of a tag, prefix it with "!,"
e.g. "!funny" means "not funny."
Keep your tags brief (64 characters max).
What tags are defined?
Certain tags trigger alerts to the editors, which means
there are a few cases where we poach the namespace a
bit. Just a few, for now:
Dupe
Use "dupe" when a Slashdot story is an actual
duplicate of a previous story, offering no new
information. This alerts the editors, but is
generally only useful when the story is in The
Mysterious Future.
Typo
Use "typo" when a story writeup has spelling or
grammatical errors, or bad HTML (like a
malformed link).
How can I see what others are tagging?
You can see some of the most popular tags at
slashdot.org/tags.
(You can see your own tags by visiting
slashdot.org/my/tags.)
How can I see stories that have been tagged with "gadget"? Or "stevejobs"?
For any tag, you can see the stories it's been applied
to by going to
slashdot.org/tag/$tag
(replace "$tag" with the term you're curious about).
It's fun just to poke around!
Top
Accounts
Why should I log in?
Logging in lets you save preferences, and gives you access
to features that anonymous readers don't have, including a
journal, the Friends & Foes system, and comment moderation.
Can I change my nickname?
Sorry, but No. It's just too prone to abuse.
How do I change my password or email address?
Log in,
then use the form on your
User Info
page.
How can I delete my account?
You can delete your account using this form.
I forgot / can't get my password!
Hit
"Log In"
anyhow, then click
"Forgot your password?"
Still have trouble? Email
feedback@slashdot.org
for help.
I'm having trouble logging in.
Make sure you have cookies turned on, and that your computer's date
and time are correct. If you've turned cookies on, and still have trouble,
email feedback@slashdot.org for help.
What are login sessions?
A login session is a glorified cookie; to provide some
added security, you can determine the duration and
location for your session. The duration options should
be self-explanatory: "Lasts Forever," or "Closes With
Browser." The former is good if you're the only person
using your computer. If you're slightly paranoid, or
often log in from remote terminals, choose "Closes With
Browser" instead.
The second decision is your location. The first choice
is "Never Moves," appropriate it you have a static IP
and you never log out of Slashdot or share your
computer. "Moves within Subnet" is useful if you have a
desktop and never log out, but your ISP sometimes
changes your IP. "Follows me Everywhere" is the right
choice for machines that move from network to network.
This option is the least secure, but oh-so-convenient,
and it's also the default.
What are slashboxes?
Slashboxes are configurable mini-feeds that appear on
the right-hand side of the page. If you're logged in,
they're configurable: you can select which Slashboxes
(from dozens of choices) show up on your
page—everything from single-source news feeds to
webcomics to recent tags, etc.
Top
Moderation and Metamoderation
I just got moderator access. What do I do?
Moderate! Read comments (preferably at a low threshold)
and when you see comments that are very insightful, or
perhaps just plain off topic, select the appropriate
option from the drop down list. When you're done, hit
the 'Moderate' button. That's it! Moderation is like
jury duty: You never know when you'll be selected, and
when you get it, you only do it for a little bit.
How should I spend my moderation points?
Concentrate more on promoting than on demoting. Try to
be impartial about this; simply disagreeing with a
comment is not a valid reason to mark it down. The goal
here is to share ideas, to sift through the haystack
and find needles, and to keep spammers and griefers in
check.
I found a comment that was unfairly moderated!
For every moderator out there pushing an agenda, there
are usually several good ones making sure that everyone
is getting a fair say. To counter unfair moderation,
though, we've come up with a system of
meta-moderation (moderating the moderation).
What do the choices in the moderation drop-down boxes mean?
Normal
The default setting attached to every comment
when you have moderation privileges.
Offtopic
A comment which has nothing to do with the
story it's linked to (song lyrics, obscene
ascii art, etc).
Flamebait
Comments whose sole purpose is to insult and
enrage.
Troll
A Troll is similar to Flamebait, but slightly
more refined. This is a prank comment intended
to provoke indignant (or just confused)
responses.
Redundant
Redundant posts add no new information; they
take up space with information either in the
original post, the attached links, or lots of
previous comments.
Insightful
An Insightful comment makes you think, or puts
a new spin on a given story. Examples: an
analogy you hadn't thought of, or a telling
counterexample.
Interesting
If you believe a comment to be Interesting (and
on-topic), it is.
Informative
Informative comments add new information to
explain the circumstances hinted at by a
particular story, fill in "The Other Side" of
an argument, etc.
Funny
Choose "Funny" if you think the comment is
actually funny, not just because it seems
intended to be.
Overrated
Sometimes comments are disproportionately
up-moderated—this probably means several
moderators saw it at nearly the same time, and
their cumulative scores exaggerated its merit.
(Example: A knock-knock joke at +5, Funny.)
Such a comment is Overrated.
Underrated
Likewise, some comments get smashed lower than
they might deserve. Choosing "Underrated" means
you think it should be read by more people.
What is metamoderation?
Metamoderation is a second layer of moderation. It
seeks to increase fairness by letting logged-in users
"rate the rating" of randomly selected comment posts.
What do "M1" and "M2" mean?
M1 and M2 are Slashdot shorthand for "moderation" and
"metamoderation," respectively. We also use these with
suffixes For example, if you see the term "M2ed," it
means "metamoderated." Likewise, the term "M1er" means
"Moderator."
Who can metamoderate?
In order to metamoderate, your account must be among
the oldest 92.5% accounts on the system.
Why am I asked to metamoderate the same comment more than once?
Remember, M2 rates the moderations, not the comments.
If the same comment was moderated more than once, it
may appear several times to a meta-moderator, too.
How should I M2 if the moderator called it "Insightful" and I think it should be "Informative"?
Don't sweat the small stuff—both have a +1 effect on
the comment. Rate the moderation "Fair" and move on.
Top
Karma, Thresholds, Abuse, etc.
What are thresholds?
Your "threshold" is the minimum score of the comments
displayed to you. Comments are scored from -1 to 5, and
you can set your threshold to any score within that range.
If you set your threshold to 2, only comments rated 2 or
above would be displayed. Setting your threshold at -1 will
display all comments. 0 is almost all comments. Higher
threshold settings reduce the number of comments you see,
but (in theory, anyway) increase the quality of the posts
you see.
How do I change thresholds?
A widget attached to each story's comments contains two
sliders; these allow you to control the score threshold
at which comments are displayed. You can drag and drop
them and adjust your preferences to find the balance of
score and comment text you want.
Someone is posting under a false or misleading identity!
We've tried to make this difficult (for example, the
system won't let you create an account named 'CmdrTaco'
because one already exists) but that doesn't prevent
ninnies from doing what ninnies do. Read cautiously.
Why did that comment disappear?
The Slashdot editors are also readers; we have
unlimited mod points, and have no problem using them to
highlight good comments, or to moderate down abusive
comments of which we become aware. (Hey, get your own
sandbox! And get off my lawn!) Abusive comments make it
less pleasant for people to read the site. Not to
mention, we'd like people to be able to read Slashdot
behind ham-handed filtering systems that would block
the entire site. If you're posting in good faith, this
will probably never affect you. (And if you want to
read all the comments, set your threshold to -1.)
How do I report abuse?
Below and to the right of each comment is a small
"Anti" symbol; click on this, and (optionally) explain
why you consider the comment abusive. (Slashdot
discussions are and should be robust; only cry "Abuse!"
for comments that are utterly without redeeming value
-- spam, racist ranting, etc. For everything else, use
the other moderation options.) Reported comments will
be reviewed and moderated by the editors, if
appropriate.
"You can't post to this page"—Why not?
This probably means you're reading from behind a web
proxy that allows connections from any host. This
functionality has been abused. Comments can't be posted
from this address until the proxy is better secured.
Please notify your Proxy Admin.
Do you ban people from Slashdot?
Occasionally we ban IPs from which we see abuse, or
disallow accounts from specific actions (such as
posting or submitting stories) in response to spam,
persistent flamebait, etc. If this happens unfairly to
you, please read
How do I get an IP Unbanned.
These bans are relatively rare, but necessary when
specific users or IPs disrupt service for others.
Why is my IP banned?
If your IP is banned, it's probably because one of
these is true:
Your IP has been used to perform a denial of
service attack (or the accidental equivalent)
against Slashdot.
Your IP was used to post comments that break
Slashdot's rendering.
You're using a proxy server used by someone who
did one of those things.
How do I get an IP unbanned?
Email
banned@slashdot.org.
Be sure to specify the IP itself, your user ID, and any
other pertinent information. (If you're connecting
through a proxy server, you might need to have the
admin contact us instead.)
What is karma?
Your karma is a reference that primarily represents how
your comments have been moderated. Karma is used to
determine who moderates and who doesn't. You can
improve your karma by posting intelligent, funny,
informative or comments generally impressive to your
fellow readers.
Karma is structured on the following scale "Terrible,
Bad, Neutral, Positive, Good, and Excellent." If a
comment you post is moderated up, your karma will rise.
Conversely,
bad karma usually indicates a user account
used to spam or otherwise hurt the discussion.
Factors besides moderation also affect karma. Having a
story submission accepted raises your karma. Also,
metamoderation can cause your karma to change. This
encourages good moderators, and ideally removes
moderator access from bad ones. Don't worry too much
about it; it's just an integer in a database.
Are there anti-troll filters?
A handful of filters have been put into place to try to
make sure that people don't abuse the system. For
instance, the same person can't post more than once
every 120 seconds. Also, if a single user is moderated
down several times in a short span, a temporary ban
will be imposed on that user ... a cooling off period,
if you will.
If you believe you've been unfairly banned, let us
know, so we can fix it.
A comment I posted shows a different score on my user page than in the comments page. Why?
Your user page displays the comment's "Natural" score.
That reflects things like moderations up or down, default
posting bonus, and so forth. When you see the same comment
in a discussion, though, its score reflects bonuses or
penalties associated with your own user preferences. (You
can choose to tailor the comments you read, for instance,
by bumping up comments that others have rated "Insightfulâ)
Top
The Firehose
What is the Firehose?
The Firehose is powerful viewing tool for Slashdot
content, from comments and journal entries to RSS feeds
and story submissions. You can filter and interact with
the Firehose in a number of ways. The plus/minus box on
the left side of each Firehose entry lets you vote on
that item. A context menu will appear when you click on
the plus or minus, giving you the option of adding
certain tags. You can also expand the submission if
you'd like to add other tags, such as "northdakota" or
"spaceflight." Voting and tagging are helpful; they
inform other Firehose users, and help the editors
decide which ones make it to the front page.
How can I filter the Firehose?
You can enter filter terms in the text field at the top
of the firehose page. Sort for any particular type of
entry by entering its type into the field and hitting
enter. For example, entering "journal" there would sort
for journal entries. You can also sort for story,
comment, feed, bookmark, and submission. Putting a "-"
in front of a type will exclude that type. For example:
"-feed" would exclude all RSS feeds. You can also sort
for things like "linux," "openbsd," or "riaa" to see
stories with those tags or comments and submissions
that mention them.
What do the colors mean?
The colors serve as a rough quality rating for entries
in the firehose. You can sort for colors by using the
color-picker next to the filter field. Red is the most
popular, black is the least popular, and story
submissions enter the firehose at blue. Your nods and
nixes affect this, so the more often you vote, the more
useful color sorting becomes. The lower your color
threshold, the more content you'll see.
Top
The Friends and Foes System
How do I add users to my friends / foes list (or remove them)?
Search for the user. Click. Add the user as your friend
or foe.
You'll find those symbols on users' comments as well,
and elsewhere on the site. Basically, anywhere you see
the following symbol
you can decide to add a user as
friend or foe.
To remove a friend or foe, click on their friend/foe
symbol and change them back to Neutral.
Where can I see my friends / foes?
http://slashdot.org/my/friends
and
http://slashdot.org/my/foes,
respectively.
Can I see other people's friends and foes?
Sure. It's similar to checking your own friends or foes
list
(http://slashdot.org/my/friends);
simply replace
/my/friends
with
/~username/friends.
Follow the same pattern for checking other users' foes
list.
What are fans / freaks?
When you select someone as a friend, it makes you that
user's fan. To see people who have chosen you as a
friend (your fans):
http://slashdot.org/my/fans.
To see other users' fans, replace
/my/fans
with
/~username/fans.
"Freaks" are people who name you as a foe:
http://slashdot.org/my/freaks.
What are comment modifiers, and how do they work?
Comment modifiers (see
http://slashdot.org/my/comments)
let you filter comments in a story. There are many
comment modifier options. For instance, you can attach
a comment modifier to a friend, foe, fan, freak, friend
of friend, or foe of friend.
The reason this is cool: let's say you want to be able
to read all your friends comments, but many of their
comments lie at the threshold of 1, and you read at a
threshold of 2. If you go to your comment preferences,
you can make all of your friends' comments appear at a
score of 5.
Top
Journals
Where is my journal?
Your journal can be found at
http://slashdot.org/my/journal.
What can I use my journal for? Can Slashdot censor my journal?
Use it for whatever you'd like! we don't care (much).
We reserve the right to moderate down abusive journal
entries (including spam), just as with comments.
Who can read my journal? Can I read anyone else's journal?
Anyone can read your journal. (And you can read anyone
else's journal, too.)
Can I ban people from reading my journal?
Nope—Sorry.
Top
Tech
What kind of logging does Slashdot do?
We log the usual stuff (IP, page, time, user, page
views, moderation, and comment posting, mainly), and a
few other bits, too. The data is used mostly to make
moderation possible.
Why do I see 'loading from a.fsdn.com' when I'm reading Slashdot?
That's our image server; if you block it, you'll miss
all the graphic violence.
I use NoScript; what should I know?
Whitelisting
slashdot.org
is necessary for the fancier parts of the site to
function. You'll need to whitelist
a.fsdn.com
too; that's our CDN, and if you block it, many things
may break.
Top
Mobile Site
How do I access the mobile site?
The mobile site can be accessed at
http://m.slashdot.org/
from your mobile device (smartphone or tablet). Note
that if you attempt to access this from your desktop,
you will not be able to click on items. For proper
Android support, all actions must be registered as
touch events, which aren't in desktop browsers.
What devices are supported?
The Slashdot mobile website uses the latest
technologies to deliver a clean mobile experience. Due
to the wide variety of mobile devices, we cannot
support every combination. Therefore, below is a list
of recommended configurations.
We recommend:
An iOS device running iOS 5 or newer.
An Android device running Android 4.0 or newer.
Note:
We strongly recommend the latest Chrome
browser, not the browser that came packaged
with your phone.
JavaScript must be enabled.
We support:
All iOS devices running iOS 5 or newer.
All Android devices running Android 2.3 or newer.
I'm having a problem with your mobile site; what should I do?
If you're having trouble viewing our mobile site,
please view the
Supported
area above and ensure that your device meets these
requirements. Also, ensure that JavaScript is enabled.
If you are still having trouble with our mobile site,
please email
feedback@slashdot.org
with:
The device you are using
The OS version
The browser name and version
The problem you are experiencing
What powers the mobile site?
We're using a delightful potpourri of
Backbone,
Zepto,
Underscore,
Hamstache,
Jasmine,
and
Sass.
Apache
&
mod_perl
serve up the framework.

Feeds
Where can I get Slashdot's main feed?
The syndication feed for the Slashdot front page is
available in RSS 0.9, RSS 1.0, and Atom 1.0 formats.
Please don't request feeds more than once every 30
minutes.
What other feeds are available?
On most pages, if there is feed content available, it
will be noted in the <HEAD> of the
page.
Wherever you see rss below, you can also substitute
with atom to get an Atom 1.0 feed, such as
content_type=atom and
journal/atom, or append atom
to the end of the rss.slashdot.org URLs,
like slashdotGamesatom
(although some feeds, like Zoo and some search results,
need some more work for Atom).
Where you see $username below, substitute
the URI-encoded username of the user in question (such
as Clifton+Wood).
Where you see $logtoken, you must include
a token so the server knows you're you, in lieu of a
cookie, as most newsreaders can't handle cookies well
(you can find it in the <HEAD> of
the page, if you're a logged in, and a subscriber).
NOTE: your logtoken is subject to change when you log
out or change your login preferences. See the
Accounts FAQ
for more information.
Append the section name to the index
link for individual section feeds. For
example:
http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdotGames
http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdotAskSlashdot
http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdotYourRightsOnline

How do I set up a custom feed?
Use the filter field to sort for whatever type of
content you like. On the section menu, you'll see an
"untitled" section, which you can use to save those
settings. Once that's done, hitting the edit button
again will bring up an RSS icon, which you can use to
subscribe to the custom feed.
My RSS headline reader says I was banned!
Our policy is to allow one request every 30 minutes.
We'll allow a few more before you'll get banned, and we
are more flexible still with proxy servers. You should
still be able to access the rest of the site, just not
the .rss, .rdf, and .xml pages.
If you're still banned after 72 hours, please email
banned@slashdot.org
for help. Include the approximate time of the ban, the
srcid hex string from the ban message, and what you
think your IP number is. If you're connecting through a
proxy server (or think you might be), please mention
that, too; you might need the proxy server's admin to
contact us.

Miscellaneous
What are the posts on Slashdot that say "Paid Post"?
These are advertisements; that's what the label means. Just as with the advertisements on the page, the content of these advertisements is not created by the Slashdot editorial team. You're free to ignore their content, of course, but advertising is what allows Slashdot to exist. If you spot any advertisements that are not clearly labeled, that's a bug: please email us to let us know.
What is that funny right-facing angle bracket next to the comment I'm reading?
This marks the current comment for the purpose of
key-stroke discussion navigation. You can navigate the
discussion with your WASD keys—no mouse required!
An ad is screwing up my browser!
We have rules meant to keep our advertisements sanely
polite, but occasionally one slips by that breaks them.
If you see a 500k banner, or one that is launching
Java, say, please complain to
feedback@slashdot.org.
What are Slashdot achievements?
The achievements system began as an April Fool's Day
joke in 2009, but the system itself is real. You can
view your own accomplishments (or others') by visiting
slashdot.org/~${your_username}/achievements.
Can I direct readers of my own site to suggest it to Slashdot?
You can add a badge or link to your page (or for a
blog, to your page template, to get one on every page)
to easily allow your readers to submit it to Slashdot
for consideration; and once submitted, take them to the
discussion.
A Slashdot badge is an easy, powerful tool to do this.
Add a badge to your page by including this snippet of
HTML:
<script src="https://slashdot.org/slashdot-it.js" type="text/javascript">
</script>
I have found a bug on Slashdot; whom do I contact?
Please email
feedback@slashdot.org
with as much relevant detail as you can. (When? What
browser, and what version, under what OS? Did you get
an error message, and if so what was it? Screenshots
are great, too. We appreciate it!)
This document doesn't answer my question!
Like most FAQs, this one usually needs pruning and
watering. If you have a burning question, please send
it to
feedback@slashdot.org
with "FAQ suggestion" in the subject line so we can
consider including it.
