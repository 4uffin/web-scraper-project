Some Private Equity Firms Doomed To Fail as High-Flying Industry Loses Its Way

from the meteor-hits-earth dept.
Private equity firms are facing systemic challenges after a half-century of meteoric growth as attractive takeover targets become scarce and financing costs remain elevated while exits prove increasingly difficult. US buyout funds currently hold more than 12,000 companies that would take approximately nine years to fully distribute at current rates, according to PitchBook data.
The industry holds $1.2 trillion in dry powder and nearly a quarter of that capital was pledged at least four years ago. More than 18,000 private capital funds seek $3.3 trillion from increasingly reluctant investors, Bain estimates. Quarterly returns for US private equity funds fell from 13.5% in Q2 2021 to 0.8% in Q4 2024. Apollo President Jim Zelter described the situation as a "natural washout" at an investor conference this month. Charles Wilson of Selby Jennings added that "many PE firms are dead already, they just don't know it" and noted survival depends on how forgiving limited partners -- the entities, including pension funds and endowments, that have invested in private equity firms -- prove when firms return for new fundraising.

What's left are the dregs that turn into scams.
This is incidentally why they opened up private equity to regular investors. Your 401k is about to have hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars poured into it from dodgy private equity stocks.
They're aren't enough public pensions for them to dump bad investments on anymore because again they've killed them all already.
So now they're coming for your 401k. Better start picking out your favorite flavor of cat food. And make sure you have a dry option for backup. But hey you sure showed those bureaucrats what's what right?

Cold hard cash is still used for a majority of money laundering. BTC has a transparent ledger that makes it easy to trace anything. You need better arguments against bitcoin as the ones you use have been debunked for a decade. Bitcoin was designed to prevent economic collapse after the events of 2008, and it is proving resilient to the economic fuckery of the Trump administration. If you don't hold bitcoin today, you are doomed to poverty and hyperinflation through the 2030's.

Private equity firms are a scourge on society (like Zillow outbidding home buyers just so they can rent it back to them at twice what their mortgage would've been).

Zillow is actually worse. What they were doing was buying up properties to artificially inflate the value of the properties surrounding it that they owned.
It's the kind of market manipulation that used to be illegal and probably still is if we enforce the laws.
But Americans can't walk and chew gum at the same time. So while we are busy freaking out over whatever moral panic they put in front of us this week, currently trans kids in sports, we can't also demand law enforcement do anything about this cr

Private Equity ruined all chain restaurants. Cuts in pay and everything else, company strapped with debt, menu prices skyrocket, quality declines. I heard on the radio recently that Olive Garden is going to offer smaller portions at reduced prices, because 43% of adults order off the kids menu. Guess who owns Olive Garden and its typical take-over story?Every single Darden brand has the same run-down, over-priced, and indebted, story. Only the PE dicks make money, everyone else suffers.
