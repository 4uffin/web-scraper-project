Supreme Court Allows Trump to Fire Remaining Democrat On FTC

from the you're-fired dept.
The Supreme Court has temporarily allowed President Trump to fire Rebecca Slaughter, the last Democrat on the FTC. "The court's action is technically temporary, since the justices said they will hear arguments in the case in December, but every indication is that the conservative court majority will use the case to reverse a major Supreme Court precedent that dates back almost a century," reports NPR. From the report:
Congress created the FTC and lots of other agencies to be multi-member, bipartisan regulatory agencies. And the Supreme Court in 1935 upheld those statutes ruling ruled against then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt's claim that he could fire FTC commissioners at will. In a unanimous opinion at the time, the court said Congress acted within its powers in declaring that a commissioner could only be fired for misconduct -- not for a policy disagreement. But now, prodded by President Trump, the court's six-member conservative majority seems poised to remake the way independent agencies operate. And if the handwriting on the wall is as clear as it seems to be, the independent agencies won't be independent. Their membership will be subject to the will of the president.
The court's action Monday was hardly subtle. While the lower courts had ruled that the president could not fire Slaughter, under the court's 1935 precedent, the conservative Supreme Court majority allowed the president to fire her. Indeed, her name isn't even on the FTC website anymore. And the court so far has allowed Trump to fire other agency board members. In short, the justices are not playing hide-the-ball. And it's a good bet that the court will reverse the 1935 precedent, which until now had been reaffirmed multiple times. The result will be that whereas in the past, these agencies had to be bipartisan, with a minority of opposition party members, now there will be no such requirement. In short, Trump can name all the agency members. And if his successor is a Democrat, he or she can fire all the Republicans.

There are
at least three different reasons this is bad.
First, this is one more sign (of about 15 court cases at this point) that this court is willing to give Trump massive powers simply because he is pushing for them and they agree with him politically. And there's no reason to remotely think he's going to stop.
Second, it means that the Presidency (already an already too powerful office in the modern form for any one person) is going to be even more powerful under for the first time under a far more authoritarian person without any safeguards in place.
Third, is more subtle: even if we get through this with Trump with only some damage, the long-term damage and threat to stability is massive. In general, parliamentary systems or presidential systems with somewhat weak presidencies are more stable than those with powerful presidencies. One sees this in for example the high instability in many presidential republics in Central America and South America. The standard explanation for this is that when there's functionally a winner-take-all system, the stakes becoming higher and the degree to which any side has an incentive to moderate becomes small. One question then is why this hasn't happened in the US? One explanation is that the US had the illusion of a not deeply strong President, in part because everyone (including the Presidents) agreed tacitly not to push the limits of their authority that much. The precedent breaking nature here undermines that illusion, and makes it more likely that we'll have years (possibly decades) where the Democrats and Republicans will even more than usual treat everything as a zero sum game with no respects for democratic norms.
The bottom line is that everything about this is bad.

It is not lost on me that during the Biden and Obama administrations the supreme court tended towards limiting Executive power, then during the trump administrations have leant towards a massive expansion of them.When sane government eventually returns i think it would be prudent for congress to actually set out some clear boundaries as to executive power, and work towards a separation of public service from executive power. Because this is all bullshit. In MOST countries while there will be ministers in charge of things, government departments will tend to hire independently of politics so as to remain strictly neutral. The government wins by a strengthening of democratic norms, and the people win by having a government that isnt tied up with shit politics.And the supreme court needs to fuck off with this partisan judge bullshit. Again, this "democrat" or "republican" judge thing is another american special and boy is it an error. Judges should be impartial interpreters of the laws and constitutions, not the corrupt activists dominating the supreme court right now.

Either our Constitution was designed to have an elected King, and we only discovered that fact 230 years later, or our Supreme Court is supremely corrupt. I tend to believe the latter, as it seems there are only two rules at the Supreme Court: (1) There are no rules, and (2) Trump always wins.

After WW1, the kings and queens in Europe saw their political power greatly reduced, and by the end of WW2 the few monarchies that survived had their monarchs limited to ceremonial duties, with real political authority being wielded by the countryâ(TM)s equivalent of a prime minister. The exceptions are microstates - Liechtenstein, Monaco, Vatican - the last one the only absolute monarchy left in Europe.

The problem is that our government has evolved well beyond what was spelled out in the constitution and said evolution was largely based on gentlemen's agreements and precedent to maintain the spirit of separation of powers. While this is sloppy as fuck what's happening now should not be celebrated. The old agreements and the appreciation of precedent have all gone out the window.The practical effect of what this ruling does here is it fully politicizes the bureaucracy. Now instead of career bureaucrats that are experts at their job we'll get incompetent political cronies appointed for the duration of a presidency only to be turned over by the other political party when they come to power. It's a recipe for government incompetence.It is also worrying in the context of the completely unprecedented (at least during peacetime) powers Trump is building up under himself. This along with Congress essential ceding their job to Trump creates very few limits on the presidency when one of the points of our constitution was to prevent such a singular powerful individual in our country.

The thing is, most of the other western powers arent having these problems. Hell, Australias constitution just has a bit of stuff about separation of powers between the states and the feds, some immensely dull nonsense about the political organization of taxes and yeah its all dull procedures. No bill of rights or whatever. THAT part the judges kinda had to fudge by declaring that since it says we are a democracy theres some implied rights to free speech and yeah. But the thing is, it all runs just fine because those boring details in the constitution actually put a bunch of checks and balances in to limit the prime-minister to someone whos answerable to the parliment , the judiciary as being fully impartial, and so on. Even the relationship to the british crown has a check and balance (The prime minister can fire the govenor general, and the govenor general can fire the prime minister [and, as the joke goes, the CIA can fire them both]).Basically, the US was one of the first modern democracies, so its got a pretty good excuse that theres a lot of flaws in the system. But maybe its time to look around at how other countries do things and plan up a version 2.0 update to the operating system. Because version 1.0 is starting to crash.

Aside from the constitution being flawed and totally not a religious document as some idiots believe, the Congress is the most powerful branch of government. This co-equal BS is like saying apples and oranges are equal.The congress writes the laws; which is the greatest power and that is why so many people share that power. The "CEO" only can execute those laws; not rewrite them or interpret them. It's supposed to be a much weaker position and still a design flaw that other governments improved with ministers. The courts settle misinterpretations (2nd most powerful, split over multiple people;) especially, intentionally stupid interpretations - they can't invent new laws.
If they do, congress can clarify with new law and if they get ridiculously corrupt, they get fired by congress. If the "CEO" gets out of line, they can fire the president too; being like the board of directors.The "CEO" doesn't have invented powers beyond the rules or even the policies and it doesn't matter what a corrupt court says because the "board" can fire them all at will with only the "shareholders" to keep them in check at elections... when the system works and the voters are not too gullible. Which they are.Trump may as well start firing congressional staffers too; since he ignores all the laws anyway. I bet the GOP won't even push back if he fires all their staff...

I am not a Constitutional scholar... so this is just an amateur reading. The Constitution doesn't say a lot of what a president does, especially with respect to laws passed by Congress.The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of AmericaAnd the President swearsto the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United StatesThe Constitution says that Congress makes laws (and the procedure for passing them or vetoing them, etc.). While this isn't explicit, "protecting and defending the Constitution" would seem to me to include faithfully following the laws duly passed under that Constitution - otherwise what in the world does a law mean and why even bother putting it in the Constitution?Nothing that I see in the Constitution says the President is able to ignore the law whenever he wants. If a law says you cannot fire for some reason, the President cannot do that. The Supreme Court actually hinted that they believed this to be the case when they made their comments that the Fed might be protected.The Supreme Court is being sneaky with this one. They aren't saying that the President has the right to do so - just that they won't stop him at the moment. This puts Rebecca Slaughter in an untenable position unless she happens to be wealthy enough to go for years without a salary and simultaneously pay huge legal bills until the court case can be decided. Without someone backing her, she will be forced to find another job and drop the case - rendering it moot. Even if she does prevail in court, the damage is done. Someone else will do her job until all the appeals are exhausted, which may be years from now. Possibly just in time for the next President (especially if a Democrat) to be prohibited from doing so.As a side note, "the best of my Ability" might be a get-out clause ;)

@stevew:If you read the Constitution, you will come to the realization that these agencies and commissions are ENTIRELY constitutional. The Necessary and Proper Clause, Article I, Section 8, Clause 18, gives Congress the power to enact all laws necessary to accomplish the tasks assigned to Congress by the Constitution. The commission in question, the FTC, regulates commerce, which is explicitly a power given to Congress in Article I, Section 8, Clause 3. Congress enacted the law that created the FTC and governs how it will be run, the FTC Act in 1914. The Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 created a standalone Federal Trade Commission composed of five commissioners appointed by the President with Senate approval. No more than three commissioners may belong to the same political party, and each serves a seven-year term, with staggered initial terms of three to seven years to ensure continuity. The President designates one commissioner as Chair, and any member may be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.So, if in its final decision, the Supreme Court says the President has the power to remove commissioners at will and populate the commission with all Republicans, then they will plainly be telling the President he can violate the law and do as he pleases. You know, like the immunity they gave him months ago. Which of course is completely frakked. My theory is that this is payback for FDR's actions. MAGA is in the process of tearing down the institutions and frameworks that were created and instituted, and the stability and rule of law that helped create the US as the world power it is. We are heading the way of a banana republic, all for short-term gain and the ability to rule over the convulsing corpse that we will become.

One question then is why this hasn't happened in the US? One explanation is that the US had the illusion of a not deeply strong President, in part because everyone (including the Presidents) agreed tacitly not to push the limits of their authority that much. The precedent breaking nature here undermines that illusion, and makes it more likely that we'll have years (possibly decades) where the Democrats and Republicans will even more than usual treat everything as a zero sum game with no respects for democratic norms.Lots of great points.
The first thing a D president will do is fire all the R appointees, not just the traditional political appointees who leave when the President does.
Then the next R does the same, resulting in a very unstable governance environment that will negatively impact the economy as companies can't plan long term in such a regulatory environment. Then there's the whole "lets get revenge on the other side by prosecuting/investigating them" payback game.

So, the supposedly "great" founding fathers chose to establish a Supreme Court where its members are political appointees by the president (and for life!).
Did they think a president would appoint members based on their competency? When has this ever happened? Naturally, the Supreme Court will follow the political ideology of its members. The US will never be democratic while their Supreme body is not. It is a fundamentally broken system, unfixable under the present constitution.
complaining about single rulings is pointless: it is a system designed to drift towards authoritarianism.
In an ideal world, politicians appointing judges, and the judges themselves, would think of the common good. When has this ever happened? They must have been high while writing the constitution.
But go on believing you live in a democracy. The rest of the world is enjoying the shitshow of the final crumbling of the US. Every empire eventually falls. This is the time of the US.
China will take much longer, I expect, but they will of course also crumble eventually.
Next time someone sets up a new country, they might consider learning from history, since the same has happened countless times. Now let's enjoy the deniers denying. History doesn't care. You can't stop a running river with propaganda.
