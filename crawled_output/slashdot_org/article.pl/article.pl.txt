Microsoft is Bringing Video Wallpapers To Windows 11

from the who-asked-for-this dept.
Microsoft is working on bringing support for setting a video as your desktop wallpaper on Windows 11. From a report: Hidden in the latest Windows 11 preview builds, the feature lets you set an MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV, M4V, or MKV file as your wallpaper, which will play the video whenever you view the desktop.
For many years, users have wanted the ability to set a video as a desktop background. It's a feature that many Linux distributions support, and macOS also supports the ability to set a moving background as your lock screen. Windows Vista did support setting videos as your wallpaper, but only as part of the Ultimate SKU via a feature called DreamScene.

We generally kept the widget, and status content type stuff, from weather and headlines to e-mail.The problem with the desktop is a organizational space you visit briefly to switch or start tasks, and maybe move some files around.
If it is actually displayed other than around the periphery for any amount of time it means the user isn't really 'using'

Decoding the video takes processing time, probably on the GPU these days. Otherwise you have to keep the whole uncompressed video in memory. For a short loop that might be viable, except that resolutions have been trending upwards over time, so the memory needed for that has been as well. Most non-gamers still have 16GB RAM or less so this is still an issue. It's smarter to do live backgrounds as animations using pixel shaders, then the power consumption

I've never in my life wanted this. It sounds like a massive distraction and a waste of local resources. Just wait, once you can get video for your background, the very next fucking day you'll have ads on your background.I guess home Windows users deserve this for using Windows, since no way this will fly in the corporate setting.
