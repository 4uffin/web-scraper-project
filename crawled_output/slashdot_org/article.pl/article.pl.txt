CFO of $320 Billion Software Firm: AI Will Help Us 'Afford To Have Less People'

from the shape-of-things-to-come dept.
The pressure is mounting on business leaders to harness AI to make work faster, cheaper, and more efficient. That may thrill investors, but for employees, it could mean fewer jobs around the world. From a report: At the $320 billion software giant SAP, there will likely be a need for fewer engineers to deliver the same -- or even greater -- output, according to the company's CFO Dominik Asam.
"There's more automation, simply," Asam told Business Insider. "There are certain tasks which are automated and for the same volume of output we can afford to have less people." As a C-suite exec at Europe's most valuable software company, Asam cautioned that this reality will only come true if the corporate world implements the technology properly. After all, a recent MIT study found that 95% of generative AI pilots have not met the mark. "I will be brutal. And I also say this internally. For SAP and any other software company, AI is a great catalyst. It can be either great or catastrophe," Asam warned.
"It will be great if you do it well, if you are able to implement it and do it faster than others. If you are left behind, you will have a problem for sure. We work day and night to not fall behind."

AI is designed to allow wealth to access skill without skill accessing wealth.I don't know that's necessarily true.
I've come to realize that what the rich need from "us" isn't for us to produce anything.
It never was.
They need us to consume.
AI and robotics can theoretically produce everything except raw materials.
But they don't consume anything that causes wealth.
Robots cannot (meaningfully) buy tens of thousands of iPhones.
AI cannot (meaningfully) subscribe to a half-dozen streaming services.
It's the human masses that cause demand.
Supply without demand does not cause wealth.

LLM-based AI can do some pretty impressive things. It *seems* to answer questions with remarkable accuracy, and it instantly produces code in response to often ridiculously vague input queries:"Write me an app to track ant farms in Vietnam"And what do you know? You get something that seems surprisingly useful!Except that it's all an illusion.I'm an experienced software developer (25 years now) and I focus on information lifecycle apps targeting workgroups and enterprise - organizations of 50+ people. As I write this, about 20,000 people are concurrently using an app I created.Over the past year or so, I've been trying to deeply integrate AI into my workflow. It's there when I write code in VSCode, it's there when I write sysadmin/shell code, and it's there when I'm refactoring.The more I use it, and the "better" it gets, the more frustrating I find it. It's only somewhat useful in the area that most coding projects fail: debugging.No matter what it seems, LLM-based AI doesn't *understand* anything. It's just an ever-more-clever trickery based on word prediction. As such, it serves only as another abstraction that still must be understood and reviewed by a real person with actual understanding, or the result is untrustable, unstable, and insecure "vibe code" that is largely worthless outside of securing VC funding, which is the thing that AI perhaps does best: help unprepared people get VC funding.You still need real people to get code you can live with, depend on, and grow with.
