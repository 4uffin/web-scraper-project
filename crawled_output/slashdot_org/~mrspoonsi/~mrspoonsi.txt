mrspoonsi writes: The US Secret Service says it has dismantled a network of more than 300 SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards in the New York area that were capable of crippling telecom systems.The devices were "concentrated within 35 miles of the global meeting of the UN General Assembly now under way in New York City" and an investigation has been launched, it adds in a press statement.The Secret Service says the dangers posed included "disabling cell phone towers, enabling denial of services attacks, and facilitating anonymous, encrypted communication between potential threat actors and criminal enterprises".

...is very different, frequently running out of stock, fuel hose stuck on the vehicle and 1 hour to fill a single car at some places. So much so Toyota is facing class action lawsuits on the cars they practically gave away.
"The Iwatani hydrogen station is fragile, has only one working pump, and dispenses fuel every 20 minutes. It also has a limit of about one-third of the full tank per fill, so a Mirai driver has to spend one hour at the pump to fill up to 100% if the driver comes to the station with less than 30% in the tank," Benko said. "[Last month] my Mirai completely lost power when I was waiting in line because I had my heater on. I called Mirai’s emergency roadside assistance. The assistance came in an hour and recharged my battery; however, the line moved up only 1 car in that time, so I was still an hour away from getting to the pump."
He added, "The whole process of refueling a hydrogen car is plain horrible."

"At 1658 UTC we noticed that Facebook had stopped announcing the routes to their DNS prefixes. That meant that, at least, Facebook’s DNS servers were unavailable. Because of this Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver could no longer respond to queries asking for the IP address of facebook.com or instagram.com."
"Meanwhile, other Facebook IP addresses remained routed but weren’t particularly useful since without DNS Facebook and related services were effectively unavailable"
If they had an external DNS away from facebook.com, the lookups would have still worked, and parts of facebook would still be operating, even though BGP to their internal DNS had been killed. Godaddy had a similar issue years ago and wiped a huge part of the internet for a number of days. I guess memories do not go back that far.

So Facebook have 4 dns servers a to d.ns.Facebook.com, and they are dns hosted by themselves, so fb need to update the domain to external dns servers to bring it all back online, that is likely 24 hours from now, assuming they can get in the building to get the passwords. Amateur hour in facebook, they never guessed that a miss configuration could take facebook.com off the internet. I bet you in future one of their dns servers will be external to fb.com

2) If Trump had of not put the stock market before lives in his country and did a lock down when the evidence said to do so instead of downplaying it.
The more he blames others, the more the spot light is on his own incompetence.

Facebook usage has collapsed since scandals, data shows
Submitted

mrspoonsi writes: Facebook usage has plummeted over the last year, according to data seen by the Guardian, though the company says usage by other measures continues to grow.Since April 2018, the first full month after news of the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke in the Observer, actions on Facebook such as likes, shares and posts have dropped by almost 20%, according to the business analytics firm Mixpanel. The decline coincided with a series of data, privacy and hate speech scandals. In September the company discovered a breach affecting 50m accounts, in November it admitted that an executive hired a PR firm to attack the philanthropist George Soros, and it has been repeatedly criticised for allowing its platform to be used to fuel ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. “On top of that, Facebook has continued to lose younger users, who are spreading their time and attention across other social platforms and digital activities,” eMarketer said.
