Things seem simpler to me, MAGAs think that solar and wind is bad, oil is good.
Don't forget about coal -- sorry, "beautiful, clean coal" -- no matter how unnecessarily expensive to consumers...
Independent Report Finds that the Trump Administration’s Orders to Keep Coal-fired Power Plants Running Could Cost Consumers between $3-6 Billion a Year If the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) mandates that the large fossil fuel power plants scheduled to retire between now and the end of 2028 continue to operate, the cost to ratepayers could exceed $3.1 billion per year. If DOE issues similar orders for additional older fossil plants, the cost could reach nearly $6 billion per year, according to an independent analysis prepared by Grid Strategies for Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, NRDC, and Sierra Club.
And other sources, Google trump coal power cost

essential security updates will be extended for one year at no additional cost, provided they log in with a Microsoft account
So, the overly simplified choices seem to be:
(a) Definitely give MS even more access to, and possible control over, your data, for undetermined concrete benefit.
(b) Risk a possible security incident, that may happen anyway or never.
Depending on how one feels about having a Microsoft Account, could be a tough choice, especially w/o knowing what security updates will mitigate what issues, that you may not even encounter.
Microsoft isn't doing this for free out the goodness in its heart (if it has one), or even potential good press/karma, so they're getting (or think they're getting) something they perceive as "value" out of this, other than money.
My understanding is that if you have Office and a logged-in MS account, Office is going to try to use One Drive unless you disable things, and keep re-disabling them after updates -- and they'll nag you about that.
Who knows what else they'll nag you about.
Windows 10 still nags me to "upgrade" to Windows 11 even though (a) I've disable it in the registry and (b) the Windows PC health Check utility says my system can't be upgraded because the CPU is too old and there's no TPM.
So annoying.
Last option:
(c) Switch to Linux. [X]

Copilot controls tabs, navigates websites and completes tasks while users watch. ...
Copilot opening tabs, reading multiple pages simultaneously and performing research transparently in real-time.
So now we just browse our browsers?
Hope there's at least some human interaction before agreeing to or paying for things.
Also, anyone "reading" and "performing research" and relying on just the bits the AI extract for them, w/o reviewing the rest of the context is "researching wrong."
Doing your own research doesn't mean watching AI do it for you - and (especially) accepting whatever it comes up with...
If you'll indulge a little tangent for a bit...
Ignoring any specific agenda / axe-to-grind by the parties involved, makes me wonder about the dubious "research" and claims of a "link" between acetaminophen and autism and misunderstanding correlation vs causation.
For example, they could have noted the facts that ice cream consumption and shark attacks go up in the summer, but (pretty sure) they'd be wrong that sharks bite people (just) because they're eating ice cream.
As far as the claimed acetaminophen and autism BS... a Swedish study (below) of this with 2,480,797 children over 25 years that found:"Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was not associated with children’s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability in sibling control analyses."
Acetaminophen Use During Pregnancy and Children’s Risk of Autism, ADHD, and Intellectual Disability
And even the actual letter the FDA is sending to physicians nationwide, referenced in the FDA article below, says:"To be clear, while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in
many studies, a causal relationship has not been established ..."

I would love to have one of you fuckers explain to me why you like right wing propaganda so much though.
I would guess it's because so much of it simply blames problems on others and/or make others the "bad guys" and that's *way* more palatable.
The right is more like "you're the problem for us", where the left is more like "we're all part of the problem" (and "the solution").
The former is easier and latter harder.
In the case of MAGA specifically, it really seems to be a party of exclusion - with the test being if you're currently "MAGA enough" and an ever-narrowing definition of what that is.
Just $0.02 from my Left pocket.

We go through this in cycles where every 8 years we get obsessed with some stupid moral panic and we elect Republicans and then they destroy everything because that's pretty much all they can do.
Then the Democrats come in and fix as much as they can and it's never enough because the Republicans are actively sabotaging them but they at least gets enough fixed that we can go about our lives just in a slightly lower quality.
You forgot the part where the fixing is often more painful than the breaking - like tax hikes vs cuts - which makes people unhappy, especially in the moment, because many have the memory and attention span of a goldfish and have forgotten how we all got there and they're disinterested in the future.
To illustrate your comment about Republicans / "Conservatives", think about how they lost their collective minds about trans athletes, then consider there are only 10 (ten) trans U.S. college athletes, out of 500,000.
From Trans Women in Sports: Facts Over Fear:Trans people are estimated to make up 1-2% of the population of the United States; however, trans people make up less than less than 0.002% (10/500,000) of US college athletes, and even fewer of recent Olympians (0.001%) identify as trans.
Got to hand it to them; it got people riled up though and some of those voted on that issue.
Unfortunately, that says more about the voters than the politicians, and it's not necessarily good.
