essential security updates will be extended for one year at no additional cost, provided they log in with a Microsoft account
So, the overly simplified choices seem to be:
(a) Definitely give MS even more access to, and possible control over, your data, for undetermined concrete benefit.
(b) Risk a possible security incident, that may happen anyway or never.
Depending on how one feels about having a Microsoft Account, could be a tough choice, especially w/o knowing what security updates will mitigate what issues, that you may not even encounter.
Microsoft isn't doing this for free out the goodness in its heart (if it has one), or even potential good press/karma, so they're getting (or think they're getting) something they perceive as "value" out of this, other than money.
My understanding is that if you have Office and a logged-in MS account, Office is going to try to use One Drive unless you disable things, and keep re-disabling them after updates -- and they'll nag you about that.
Who knows what else they'll nag you about.
Windows 10 still nags me to "upgrade" to Windows 11 even though (a) I've disable it in the registry and (b) the Windows PC health Check utility says my system can't be upgraded because the CPU is too old and there's no TPM.
So annoying.
Last option:
(c) Switch to Linux. [X]

Nice try, but a /. AI agent would just ignore TFA/S and pull something out of its electronic ass. :-)

Copilot controls tabs, navigates websites and completes tasks while users watch. ...
Copilot opening tabs, reading multiple pages simultaneously and performing research transparently in real-time.
So now we just browse our browsers?
Hope there's at least some human interaction before agreeing to or paying for things.
Also, anyone "reading" and "performing research" and relying on just the bits the AI extract for them, w/o reviewing the rest of the context is "researching wrong."
Doing your own research doesn't mean watching AI do it for you - and (especially) accepting whatever it comes up with...
If you'll indulge a little tangent for a bit...
Ignoring any specific agenda / axe-to-grind by the parties involved, makes me wonder about the dubious "research" and claims of a "link" between acetaminophen and autism and misunderstanding correlation vs causation.
For example, they could have noted the facts that ice cream consumption and shark attacks go up in the summer, but (pretty sure) they'd be wrong that sharks bite people (just) because they're eating ice cream.
As far as the claimed acetaminophen and autism BS... a Swedish study (below) of this with 2,480,797 children over 25 years that found:"Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was not associated with children’s risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability in sibling control analyses."
Acetaminophen Use During Pregnancy and Children’s Risk of Autism, ADHD, and Intellectual Disability
And even the actual letter the FDA is sending to physicians nationwide, referenced in the FDA article below, says:"To be clear, while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in
many studies, a causal relationship has not been established ..."

I would love to have one of you fuckers explain to me why you like right wing propaganda so much though.
I would guess it's because so much of it simply blames problems on others and/or make others the "bad guys" and that's *way* more palatable.
The right is more like "you're the problem for us", where the left is more like "we're all part of the problem" (and "the solution").
The former is easier and latter harder.
In the case of MAGA specifically, it really seems to be a party of exclusion - with the test being if you're currently "MAGA enough" and an ever-narrowing definition of what that is.
Just $0.02 from my Left pocket.

We go through this in cycles where every 8 years we get obsessed with some stupid moral panic and we elect Republicans and then they destroy everything because that's pretty much all they can do.
Then the Democrats come in and fix as much as they can and it's never enough because the Republicans are actively sabotaging them but they at least gets enough fixed that we can go about our lives just in a slightly lower quality.
You forgot the part where the fixing is often more painful than the breaking - like tax hikes vs cuts - which makes people unhappy, especially in the moment, because many have the memory and attention span of a goldfish and have forgotten how we all got there and they're disinterested in the future.
To illustrate your comment about Republicans / "Conservatives", think about how they lost their collective minds about trans athletes, then consider there are only 10 (ten) trans U.S. college athletes, out of 500,000.
From Trans Women in Sports: Facts Over Fear:Trans people are estimated to make up 1-2% of the population of the United States; however, trans people make up less than less than 0.002% (10/500,000) of US college athletes, and even fewer of recent Olympians (0.001%) identify as trans.
Got to hand it to them; it got people riled up though and some of those voted on that issue.
Unfortunately, that says more about the voters than the politicians, and it's not necessarily good.

... have no interest in paying their dues, often expecting a salary that is more appropriate for someone with 10 years of experience.
This was a few years ago, so not exactly Gen-Z, but a similar situation.
I was helping a very recent hire, just out of university, with a project and he asked when he would get promoted from a Junior to Senior Software Engineer.
I told him, among other things, when he didn't need a senior engineer to help him with his work.
It took him two weeks to complete his task, even with my on-request guidance.
When he was done, he thanked me for all the help and remarked that I had always been ready with an answer and to talk through things and he asked how I had done that.
I told him that prior to being given the work his manager asked me if I thought this would an appropriate task to give him.
I said I'd check it out by doing it myself first, and I had run into many of the same issue he did.
The junior guy asked me how long it took me; I said two hours (which was true).
Granted, I had many years of experience on him and a lot of accumulated (Perl) code from which I could pull that helped reduce my effort.

Just a guess here, and I could easily be wrong. But maybe that's 8500 hours of direct and strong sunlight?
The Applied Optical Materials.journal article referenced in TFA/S describes the stability testing setup: 2.6. Stability Testing and Color Alteration Characterization
DSSCs along with UV filter films were subjected to an intensive light soaking protocol using an Atlas XLS+ solar simulation system. The xenon lamp of the system (model NXE 1700), which simulates the AM1.5G solar spectrum, (34) facilitated a 1000-h exposure to artificial sunlight. The spectral irradiance within the UV 300–400 nm range was quantified at approximately 240 MJ/m2. The simulator maintained internal conditions of approximately 35 C, a black standard temperature (BST) of 60 C, and a relative humidity level of 20%. Thermal imaging, conducted with a Fluke TiS75 camera, indicated the average temperature of the filters and DSSC to be 45 C. This 1000-h duration was chosen since it aligns with standard light soaking protocols in photovoltaic research, corresponding to roughly one year of outdoor exposure in a central European climate under the AM 1.5G solar spectrum.

It's the red coloring in the onion skins, which is extracted and bound with cellulose from wood pulp.
