So when can we expect this violent eruption/explosion? 10 years? 10,000 years?I'm a busy man. I don't have millennia to waste on this.
Excellent thought; could happen anytime, even tomorrow.
Something people often, annoyingly, forget, like in this bit from The Fifth Element: Billy [Luke Perry]: When is this "snake" act supposed to occur?
Professor Pacoli: Well, if this is the five and this is the one... [counting under his breath] Every 5,000 years.
Billy: So I've got some time then.

The $100k visa fee is *annual* -- up from $215/year.

It still seems unbelievable to me that among 300+ millions, ...
Not to worry, all those people apparently died of drug overdoses last year: Trump Claims 300 Million People Died of Drug Overdoses Last Year. -- out of a U.S. population of 340 million, btw.
For the record, "there were only 62.4 million deaths globally in 2024" from *all* causes.

The way I see it, Republicans try to minimize the average unhappiness, while Democrats try to minimize the maximum unhappiness. So Republicans focus on majorities and Democrats focus on minorities as a result. To those who only care about themselves, the Democrat approach looks insane. To those who care about the collective good, the Republican approach looks cruel and insensitive.
Noting that individuals eventually die off while the collective lives on.
I know Marie Antoinette didn't actually say this, but "Let them eat cake" didn't turn out so well for the actual few with cake when the hungry masses showed up.

4. The Democrats actively alienate people.
Not arguing your points, but want to add that MAGA does this too as loyal followers are deemed "not MAGA enough".
It's a group of exclusion where the criteria for inclusion is constantly arbitrarily re-decided.

1) the maggots in America and abroad are being paid to propagate the conservative hate speech in their own countries.
Which, to be clear, is protected here in the U.S. under the First Amendment -- contrary to what A.G. Pam Bondi
said (then walked back, but probably still wants to be true even though she seriously should know this), and many on the Right complaining about anyone saying anything against Charlie Kirk (as just recent examples).

... saying it will require them to pledge they won't gather any information - even unclassified - that hasn't been expressly authorized for release, ...
Seems to be ignoring that said information is often obtained from someone who shouldn't be releasing it.
Journalists aren't stealing this information, it's being given to them.
[*cough* Signal *cough*]
If that information is new-worthy, especially if it's about the military/administration doing something wrong, illegal or suspect, it's their job to report it.
The public casts the votes and pays the bills...
This Administration should (try to) remember who serves who.

What this will do, is that newly graduated STEM masters and PhD will go back to their home country and we lose out on top talents.
If by "will go back" you mean "will be deported".
If they're even allowed to stay long enough to graduate...

What's the long-term game-plan for "smart" / connected appliances?
My Whirlpool refrigerator was left by the previous owner when I bought my house in 1993, so it's at least 32 years old, and we got our Kenmore washer and dryer in 1993.
All three still run great.
On a related note, my 2001 Civic and 2002 CR-V are still running well.
Thankfully, none of my appliances/cars have this crap.
Are companies planning on supporting these "smart" / connected features and touch screens for 30+ years?
History so far says nope.

Yes, they could try to locate everyone that manages to use banned technology like this, but as commodity-level technology designed to be used by even unskilled individuals, they're not going to be able to stop people from using technology.
All they'll be able to do is to punish them after finding them.
Yup, 'cause the Taliban is known for giving up easily and being lenient to people breaking morality decrees. /s

Scientists find that ice generates electricity when bent

fahrbot-bot writes: Phys.org is reporting on a study published in Nature Physics involving ICN2, at the UAB campus, Xi'an Jiaotong University (Xi'an) and Stony Brook University (New York), showing for the first time that ordinary ice is a flexoelectric material — meaning it can generate electricity when subjected to mechanical deformation.
"We discovered that ice generates electric charge in response to mechanical stress at all temperatures. In addition, we identified a thin 'ferroelectric' layer at the surface at temperatures below -113C (160K)," explains Dr. Xin Wen, a member of the ICN2 Oxide Nanophysics Group and one of the study's lead researchers.
"This means that the ice surface can develop a natural electric polarization, which can be reversed when an external electric field is applied—similar to how the poles of a magnet can be flipped. The surface ferroelectricity is a cool discovery in its own right, as it means that ice may have not just one way to generate electricity, but two: ferroelectricity at very low temperatures, and flexoelectricity at higher temperatures all the way to 0 C."
This property places ice on a par with electroceramic materials such as titanium dioxide, which are currently used in advanced technologies like sensors and capacitors.

I wouldn't be surprised if it's revealed that it's ticketmaster or the developers of their platform that's behind the bots just to line their pockets.
