Just a guess here, and I could easily be wrong. But maybe that's 8500 hours of direct and strong sunlight?
The Applied Optical Materials.journal article referenced in TFA/S describes the stability testing setup: 2.6. Stability Testing and Color Alteration Characterization
DSSCs along with UV filter films were subjected to an intensive light soaking protocol using an Atlas XLS+ solar simulation system. The xenon lamp of the system (model NXE 1700), which simulates the AM1.5G solar spectrum, (34) facilitated a 1000-h exposure to artificial sunlight. The spectral irradiance within the UV 300–400 nm range was quantified at approximately 240 MJ/m2. The simulator maintained internal conditions of approximately 35 C, a black standard temperature (BST) of 60 C, and a relative humidity level of 20%. Thermal imaging, conducted with a Fluke TiS75 camera, indicated the average temperature of the filters and DSSC to be 45 C. This 1000-h duration was chosen since it aligns with standard light soaking protocols in photovoltaic research, corresponding to roughly one year of outdoor exposure in a central European climate under the AM 1.5G solar spectrum.

It's the red coloring in the onion skins, which is extracted and bound with cellulose from wood pulp.

For those keeping score at home, 8500 hours is just over 354 days.
(a) The Sun doesn't shine 24 hours/day. (On on spot on the Earth /pedantic :-) )
(b) It's still projected to last 5.6x longer than the current petroleum-based coating. ... the CNF-ROE filter could extend a solar cell's lifetime to roughly 8,500 hours. The PET-based filter? Just 1,500 hours.

More durable UV coating for solar panels made from red onion skins

fahrbot-bot writes: In a lab in Turku, Finland, scientists have found a surprising ally in the fight for sustainable solar energy: the papery red skin of an onion.
Researchers from the University of Turku, in collaboration with Aalto University and Wageningen University, have developed a bio-based UV protection film for solar cells that not only blocks nearly all harmful ultraviolet light but also outperforms commercial plastic films. The key ingredient is a water extract made from red onion skins.
Sunlight can degrade the delicate components in solar panels—particularly the electrolyte inside dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), a type known for their flexibility and low-light performance. To mitigate this, manufacturers typically wrap cells in UV-protective films made from petroleum-based plastics like polyethylene terephthalate (PET). But these plastics degrade over time and are difficult to recycle.
Seeking a greener alternative, the team turned to nanocellulose, a renewable material derived from wood pulp. Nanocellulose can be processed into thin, transparent films that serve as the perfect substrate for UV-blocking compounds.
Their breakthrough came when they dyed these films using an extract from red onion skins, a common kitchen waste. The result was a filter that blocked 99.9% of UV radiation up to 400 nanometers, a feat that outstripped even the PET-based commercial filters chosen for comparison.
In solar cells, preserving visible and near-infrared light is crucial. That’s the part of the spectrum that powers electricity generation. And here, too, the onion-treated filter excelled: it let through over 80% of light in the 650–1,100 nm range—an ideal sweet spot for energy absorption.
Testing under 1,000 hours of artificial sunlight, the CNF-ROE film—short for cellulose nanofiber with red onion extract—held up remarkably well. It exhibited only minor discoloration and preserved the yellow hue of the electrolyte far better than any other filter. Even predictive modeling based on early degradation trends suggested the CNF-ROE filter could extend a solar cell’s lifetime to roughly 8,500 hours. The PET-based filter? Just 1,500 hours.

So when can we expect this violent eruption/explosion? 10 years? 10,000 years?I'm a busy man. I don't have millennia to waste on this.
Excellent thought; could happen anytime, even tomorrow.
Something people often, annoyingly, forget, like in this bit from The Fifth Element: Billy [Luke Perry]: When is this "snake" act supposed to occur?
Professor Pacoli: Well, if this is the five and this is the one... [counting under his breath] Every 5,000 years.
Billy: So I've got some time then.

Not to worry, all those people apparently died of drug overdoses last year: Trump Claims 300 Million People Died of Drug Overdoses Last Year. -- out of a U.S. population of 340 million, btw.

The way I see it, Republicans try to minimize the average unhappiness, while Democrats try to minimize the maximum unhappiness. So Republicans focus on majorities and Democrats focus on minorities as a result. To those who only care about themselves, the Democrat approach looks insane. To those who care about the collective good, the Republican approach looks cruel and insensitive.
Noting that individuals eventually die off while the collective lives on.
I know Marie Antoinette didn't actually say this, but "Let them eat cake" didn't turn out so well for the actual few with cake when the hungry masses showed up.

4. The Democrats actively alienate people.
Not arguing your points, but want to add that MAGA does this too as loyal followers are deemed "not MAGA enough".
It's a group of exclusion where the criteria for inclusion is constantly arbitrarily re-decided.

1) the maggots in America and abroad are being paid to propagate the conservative hate speech in their own countries.
Which, to be clear, is protected here in the U.S. under the First Amendment -- contrary to what A.G. Pam Bondi
said (then walked back, but probably still wants to be true even though she seriously should know this), and many on the Right complaining about anyone saying anything against Charlie Kirk (as just recent examples).

... saying it will require them to pledge they won't gather any information - even unclassified - that hasn't been expressly authorized for release, ...
Seems to be ignoring that said information is often obtained from someone who shouldn't be releasing it.
Journalists aren't stealing this information, it's being given to them.
[*cough* Signal *cough*]
If that information is new-worthy, especially if it's about the military/administration doing something wrong, illegal or suspect, it's their job to report it.
The public casts the votes and pays the bills...
This Administration should (try to) remember who serves who.

What this will do, is that newly graduated STEM masters and PhD will go back to their home country and we lose out on top talents.
If by "will go back" you mean "will be deported".
If they're even allowed to stay long enough to graduate...
