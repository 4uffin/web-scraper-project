Linux 4.19, the Last Supported Kernel of the Linux 4.x Series, Reaches EOL

on Saturday December 07, 2024 @08:58AM
prisoninmate writes: From a report: "Linux kernel 4.19, the last of the Linux 4.x kernel series, has now reached the end of its supported life as announced earlier on the Linux kernel mailing list by kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman. The Linux 4.19 kernel branch was released more than six years ago, on October 22nd, 2018, and it received no less than 325 maintenance updates, the last one being Linux 4.19.325. The biggest highlights of Linux kernel 4.19 were initial Wi-Fi 6 support, the EROFS file system, and a union mount filesystem implementation.Greg Kroah-Hartman also said that the Linux 4.19 kernel is plagued with hundreds of “unfixed” CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), urging companies that still use it in their products to upgrade immediately to a newer LTS (Long-Term Support) kernel series, such as Linux kernel 6.12, which has been officially confirmed as LTS. He added that even if most of these CVEs have been patched by now in recent kernels, no one will backport them to the Linux 4.19 branch."
