schwit1 writes: As of September 1, 2025, banks across Vietnam are closing accounts deemed inactive or non-compliant with new biometric rules. Authorities estimate that more than 86 million accounts out of roughly 200 million are at risk if users fail to update their identity verification.
The State Bank of Vietnam has also introduced stricter thresholds for transactions:
Facial authentication is mandatory for online transfers above 10 million VND (about $379).Cumulative daily transfers over 20 million VND ($758) also require biometric approval.The policy is part of the central bank’s broader “cashless” strategy, aimed at combating fraud, identity theft, and deepfake-enabled scams.
As one person commented
If users don't comply by the 30th they'll lose their money. This is why we bitcoin.
