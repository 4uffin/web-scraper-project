Art kid studying economics? Now it's all gallery auctions and art markets.Here's what got me though. They didn't just find-and-replace examples like most "personalized" learning crap does. The AI actually generates different ways to consume the same information:- Mind maps if you think visually- Audio lessons with these weird simulated teacher conversations- Timelines you can click around- Quizzes that change based on what you're screwing upThey tested this on 60 high schoolers. Random assignment, proper study design. Kids using their system absolutely destroyed the regular textbook group on both immediate testing and when they came back three days later.Every single one said it made them more confident.The part that surprised me? They actually solved the accuracy problem. Most ed-tech either dumbs everything down to nothing or gets basic facts wrong.
