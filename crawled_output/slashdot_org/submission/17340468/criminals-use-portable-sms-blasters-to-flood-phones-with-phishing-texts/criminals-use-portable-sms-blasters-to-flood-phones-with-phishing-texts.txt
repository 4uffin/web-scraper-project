jjslash writes: Cybercriminals are increasingly using portable devices known as SMS blasters to flood phones with fraudulent text messages, marking a shift in how large-scale phishing scams are carried out. Instead of relying on lists of numbers and automated delivery systems routed through mobile networks, criminals have begun installing fake cell towers in cars or backpacks to beam scam texts directly to nearby phones. These devices, often disguised inside vehicles, impersonate cellular base stations and force surrounding phones into insecure connections.
The trend is a turning point, according to Cathal Mc Daid, VP of technology at telecommunications and cybersecurity firm Enea. "This is essentially the first time that we have seen large-scale use of mobile radio-transmitting devices by criminal groups," Mc Daid told Wired.
