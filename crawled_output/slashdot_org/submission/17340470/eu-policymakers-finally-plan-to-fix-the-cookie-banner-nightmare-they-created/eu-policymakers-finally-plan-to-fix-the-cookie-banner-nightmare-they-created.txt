jjslash writes: The European Commission is drafting amendments to the ePrivacy Directive to reduce the constant flood of cookie consent banners. Currently, websites must get explicit permission and clearly explain their data practices, leading to widespread banner fatigue. Critics argue that this overuse has backfired, with most users clicking “accept” without reading, undermining privacy protections and awareness.More than a decade ago, Europe rewrote internet rules which effectively forced the entire internet to adopt stricter rules on cookie consent by amending the ePrivacy Directive. Since 2009, from big tech giants, to small personal blogs, and virtually any internet-based organization had to display a "cookie banner" to first-time visitors. Collectively, European users spend an estimated 575 hours every year clicking through those pesky prompts.

Well, I read just enough to make sure "reject" really means reject the cookies not reject the opportunity to reject the cookies.
