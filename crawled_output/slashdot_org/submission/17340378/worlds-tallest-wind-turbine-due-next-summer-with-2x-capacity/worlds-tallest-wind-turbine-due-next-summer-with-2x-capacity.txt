Qbertino writes: German public news outlet Tagesschau has a video report on the progress of the world's tallest Wind Turbine that is due next summer. The Turbine will have roughly 2x the capacity of regular wind turbines and is planned as a proof of concept for accessing an additional layer of wind for energy and 3x-ing the output of existing wind farm zones by upgrading them with additional extra tall turbines.
