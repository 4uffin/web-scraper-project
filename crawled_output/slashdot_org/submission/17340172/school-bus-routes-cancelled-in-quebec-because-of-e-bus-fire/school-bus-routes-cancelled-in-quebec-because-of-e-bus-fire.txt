The 1200 Lion buses operating in Quebec were pulled from service Thursday night as a precautionary measure after a bus caught fire in Montreal earlier in the week. Several children and a driver were inside the bus when it went up in flames, but no one was injured. It was the third fire involving a Lion school bus in the last year.
