Samsung Brings Ads To US Fridges

from the you-can't-escape dept.
An anonymous reader shares a report: A software update rolling out to Samsung's Family Hub refrigerators in the US is putting ads on the fridges for the first time. The "promotions and curated advertisements" are coming despite Samsung insisting to The Verge in April that it had "no plans" to do so. Samsung is calling it a pilot program for now, which -- I kid you not -- is meant to "strengthen the value" of owning a Samsung smart fridge.

They didn't say whose value it strengthened. And I'm sure this strengthens the (monetary) value for them of you owning their shitty refrigerator.But I supposed one could, if one was stuck with one of these shitty devices, spray paint over the screen, and cut the wires to the speaker. Or dump the whole piece of crap into a river somewhere and buy a real refrigerator.

Ah, but they will install detectors in the fridge ; vibration sensors to tell when you're actually in the kitchen, and light sensors behind the screen.
If there's no light detected when you're in the kitchen, it will be flagged as illegal mod to Company equipment and the fridge will warm up slightly so your food spoils a little bit quicker.
You only get a proper cold fridge if you can see the ads.

You're missing the point: selling advertising to fund public toilets as opposed to pay toilets is a good idea. But no, I wouldn't want a toilet in my kitchen. Samsung thinks they can make continuous revenue off their hardware by selling advertising. What they are really doing is creating a market to rid their hardware of advertising. Seems easy to do, when all that advertising has to flow through your home network over the router you own.

Consumers need to reject it. Return the fridge if an update brings ads.In countries with stronger consumer rights there is little question that this kind of enshittification would be a refund issue. It fundamentally changes the product, intrudes into your private space with unwanted and obnoxious ads, and it cannot be repaired.

How about we put this much hyped AI to good use by employing it to automatically shut the door in such cases?
While we're at it, I could use an AI robot dishwasher that can actually clean pans, determining whether to use scouring powder and then use it or not, and position dishes itself, no more need for the user to carefully position everything, just dump the dirty dishes in the machine.
Too bad all the hoopla around AI was hype, and AI still can't do such simple things.

Crossed them off the list.Wow.
Their refrigerators reportedly have among the worst reliability stats [usatoday.com] out of all the major brands, but ads are the reason you're rejecting them?
I'm kind of assuming the ads are to recover the unexpectedly high cost of warranty repairs and food loss claims. :-)Having used a lot of their Blu-Ray players and TVs over the years, Samsung reached peak ensh*ttification a long time ago, IMO.
What remains is the long-tail death spiral.

I'd accept a Fridge that had ads if it were free.
Otherwise I can't see it.
A fridge can last a decade easily and you can get them for less than 2 grand.
2 grand a decade = 200 a year, and that works out to less than a dollar a day.
My time is worth more than that.So unless the ads paid for the entire fridge I can't see paying cash for it.

"Smart" devices were ALWAYS a vector for advertising. First it was a vector for data collection to better target ads, now it's just blatant advertising all the time. I've shied away from smart devices whenever possible, and if I'm forced to buy a smart device to replace a defective device I don't enable the network. "But you're missing out on features, man!" Yeah, I'm missing out on yet another advertising and propaganda channel. Boo hoo.Smart devices were *NEVER* about adding features for the end user. It was always, and always will be, about advertising. Don't fall for it. Don't support it.

If you bought one of these things, you deserve it. :)This reminds me of a story too. I was working at a place just rolling out Microsoft Office 365 and the whole 2 factor authentication thing. We started looking at the devices people had registered for MFA. Obviously, you mostly had various smartphones and a few people even used iPads or other tablets. But this one guy had a Samsung smart fridge as his device. He explained that, "I work from home and have a desk in the kitchen. So it's easy to confirm the authentication from the refrigerator screen. And this way, I know I won't just lose it someplace like I might lose my phone!"But seriously, I really dislike this trend of making basic home appliances Internet connected and/or computerizing them needlessly. My old Black & Decker 4 slice toaster finally gave out on us last week. I was shocked by how much a new toaster costs now!
I was expecting to run out and grab something for maybe $20 or so? Nope! Many of the highly rated models are well over $200! The cheapest I could find was about $45, for one at Costco that has 2 digital strips down the front. One side lights up with icons of toast, in various levels of darkness, and the other depicts all the different foods you mgiht toast; bagels, waffles, pastries, toast...We got it home and tried it out, and guess what? When you select toast with a darkness of "3 out of 6", shown as a medium brown? It absolutely burns it! The lightest setting just ejects warm, untoasted bread. I couldn't find any point to a setting on the thing other than the second-lightest one! Highly inaccurate. All of this seems really unnecessary, when the light/dark knob on my old toaster worked just as it was supposed to.

This is the very same reason I replaced my previous toaster oven as well, so this time I got one with a digital timer.
I'm expecting it to be more reliable, but only time will tell (no pun intended).
No internet of course, will be a cold day in hell I put my appliances on the internet.

Costco is primarily where people go to buy a truckload of toilet paper and 50 lbs of frozen chicken breasts, not appliances, so their selection tends to be quite limited.
They do have a pretty decent return policy and it looks like Walmart still sells your original toaster.

What's the long-term game-plan for "smart" / connected appliances?
My Whirlpool refrigerator was left by the previous owner when I bought my house in 1993, so it's at least 32 years old, and we got our Kenmore washer and dryer in 1993.
All three still run great.
On a related note, my 2001 Civic and 2002 CR-V are still running well.
Thankfully, none of my appliances/cars have this crap.
Are companies planning on supporting these "smart" / connected features and touch screens for 30+ years?
History so far says nope.

One of the things that makes TV so crazy cheap is that the TV manufacturers have deals when they let guys like Roku put ads on the TV.
For me it's a okay because my TV is really just a monitor for the living room PC and handful of consoles hooked up to it. So I don't really care that if I used it for Netflix I get a bunch of ads. The TV itself never gets connected to the internet.
Where it becomes a problem with some of the appliances is that they sometimes don't have proper controls so you have to co

The only justification for a smart fridge that I can think of is to have it reduce the temperature of the freezer section when electricity is cheap, it can then work less hard when electricity is expensive. In order to do this properly, it needs some kind of interface so another machine can tell it that there is spare solar power at the moment etc. Obviously such a machine should have a method for setting times of day when power is cheaper, for those who have cheap rate power at night.The amount of "smart" required is trivial and can be achieved without a screen at all. A 2x32 character display and a few buttons would suffice.This is the sort of "smart" I want in my household appliances - features that improve performance or reduce running cost. If I want my fridge to display stuff I can simply attach my choice of display device to it... currently the display device on my fridge consists of a couple of sheets of A4 with my daughter's school timetable printed out, attached with magnets. Insanely reliable, low initial cost, no running cost, very hard to hack, doesn't "phone home" and never displays adverts.

And also their new fridges don't last very long and constantly break down and need parts. Current older gen basic fridge I have without a screen currently needs modifications to fix known problems where the ice maker ices up internally and won't make ice. It's a total piece of shit.
