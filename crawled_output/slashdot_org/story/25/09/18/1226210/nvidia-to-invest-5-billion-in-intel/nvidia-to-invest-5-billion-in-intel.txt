Nvidia To Invest $5 Billion in Intel

from the how-about-that dept.
Nvidia has agreed to invest $5 billion in its struggling rival Intel [non-paywalled source] as part of a deal to develop new chips for PCs and data centres, the latest reordering of the tech industry spurred by AI. From a report: The deal comes a month after the US government agreed to take a 10 per cent stake in Intel, as Donald Trump's administration looks to secure the future of American chip manufacturing.
However, the pair's announcement makes no reference to Nvidia using Intel's foundry to produce its chips. Intel, which has struggled to gain a foothold in the booming AI server market, lost its crown as the world's most valuable chipmaker to Nvidia in 2020. On Thursday Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, hailed a "historic collaboration" and "a fusion of two world-class platforms," combining its graphics processing units, which dominate the market for AI infrastructure, with Intel's general-purpose chips.

More like a frenemy - Nvidia does not have any sort of market in the datacenter where Intel competes, at all, and would much rather see Intel Xeon chips and motherboards running their AI compute stack than AMD Epycs - because AMD is the *real* rival to where Nvidia makes the bulk of their money (hint: its not to gamers)... Intel compute cards cannot compete on the enterprise level at all with Nvidia and in fact there's a synergy there since they both want the same thing - AMD to lose.

You obviously don't work in a datacenter or with enterprise hardware - it doesn't matter what benchmarks you're looking at, large companies are still buying tons of Intel chips because they already have a ton of Intel chips. And you're right, CUDA has more market penetration than ROCm but that doesn't change what I said - AMD is the only *real* rival to the products Nvidia makes.
The more DC start to get AMD, the better their automation teams will get at patching the firmware and performance tuning for Epyc, which again is an entirely different skillset than just "rack and run". Should companies start to *actually buy* MI35x en masse, then Nvidia will feel their biggest profit/margin maker threatened.
This investment is ensuring people don't run *any* AMD anything in the DC.

I wasn't trying to be insulting though I can see I hit a sore spot with you. AMD is not outselling Intel in the DC - they had a good year but I don't know of any DC that is buying more AMD than Intel chips, unless its an AMD only company, and there are a few...Giving you the benefit of the doubt (which google searches easily show is wrong),
this STILL means the vast majority of hardware, today, in a DC, is STILL Intel. Enterprises aren't just throwing away their servers. Hell my last gig ~25% of our servers were 10 years old (and buying 5k new every quarter)
Nvidia absolutely wants to ensure that Intel remains on top because its in their best interest. On Top doesn't mean who has sold more chips to gamers last year - if you walk into any DC you'll find 75-90% of their silicon is Intel, and if its an AI DC a higher percentage will be Nvidia compute.
For the record, I own lots of AMD and think they have much better products than Intel, but that doesn't change the enterprise reality of momentum, though its changing rapidly and Nvidia sees this...

AMD has been outselling Intel in the DC for what, a year now or more?No, AMD still trails Intel in the data center, both in terms of revenue and unit sales [hothardware.com]. AMD's server share was stagnating at 20% for many years despite an uptick in reputation and positive press. It's only been recently this year that AMD hit around 40% in server market share, and that's based on revenue. In terms of units, AMD's market share is lower at around 32%.Of course, upward momentum is still with AMD, so it wouldn't be surprising to see AMD claim a majority of server market share in the near future.

Intel was only ahead of AMD in mobile because they had superior process tech. That is now over and there are no signs it's coming back (Intel having failed at getting acceptable yields with two process shrinks in a row now) so AMD has the clear edge for the time being.

Compare the market caps though, Nvidia and Intel are not on the same order of magnitude.I don't think there is much a of frenemy relationship really to speak of.My guess is this about two things:1) Nvidia ensuring they have or could get some access to an x86 license if AMD is somehow able to both make some kind of great leap in MIMD compute space and at the same time is able to deliver some kind of integration advantage with integration in traditional compute in memory architecture with EPYC parts.2) Being sure they have access to some kind of FAB capacity in the event the excrement hits the fan around TSMC, and with a "partner" to whom they could dictate terms.
