Intel Says Blockbuster Nvidia Deal Doesn't Change Its Own Roadmap

from the aftermath dept.
If you're wondering what effect Intel's blockbuster deal with Nvidia will have on its existing product roadmaps, Intel has one message for you: it won't. PCWorld: "We're not discussing specific roadmaps at this time, but the collaboration is complementary to Intel's roadmap and Intel will continue to have GPU product offerings," an Intel spokesman told my colleague, Brad Chacos, earlier today. I heard similar messaging from other Intel representatives.
Nvidia's $5 billion investment in Intel, as well as Nvidia's plans to supply RTX graphics chiplets to Intel for use in Intel's CPUs, have two major potential effects: first, it could rewrite Intel's mobile roadmap for laptop chips, because of the additional capabilities provided by those RTX chiplets. Second, the move threatens Intel's ongoing development of its Arc graphics cores, including standalone discrete GPUs as well as integrated chips. We're still not convinced that Arc's future will be left unscathed, in part because Intel's claim that it will "continue" to have GPU product offerings sounds a bit wishy-washy. But Intel sounds much more definitive on the former point, in that the mobile roadmap that you're familiar with will remain in place.

Is just now starting to dip its toes into serious competition in the GPU market you would think maybe a $5 billion dollar investment from a competitor would get a little more scrutiny from regulators...
I am not saying that the investment would get blocked but it's not unusual for these kind of large investments in markets with very little competition to come with some caveats. Antitrust law is fairly broad for a good reason.

Yes, because he's just saddled taxpayers with 10% ownership of Intel. And by offering suggestions to Nvidia to "invest" in Intel he's trying to show the world he's a good businessman that doesn't make poor investment choices, like casinos, airlines, hotels, and other things he's lost money on.

This deal does make sense in a way.
From Nvidia's side, they're mostly left out of the low end GPU market.
Low end means integrated, and they don't sell CPUs for consumer PCs.
Any PC inexpensive enough not to have a discrete GPU is inaccessible to them.
This gets them entry into that market.From Intel's side, it gets them some cash they badly need, as well as new options for integrated GPUs.
Options that are likely to be better than what they currently have.
That will help them compete with AMD.Regula

It's possible this is a hedge against AMD putting out genuinely useful integrated graphics. The 780 is okay for fortnite on the lowest settings but not much else. And the 8060s requires a very expensive purchase because it's not really for gaming or even video encoding it's for AI use as a workstation for programmers playing with their models.
AMD is clearly avoiding putting decent graphics in their integrated gpus so that they don't cannibalize their GPU market which is I suppose understandable. Once yo

What's the market for a good integrated GPU ?AMD is clearly capable of making a fairly high end integrated GPU. The PS5 is roughly a GTX 2070 level GPU integrated with a Ryzen CPU.But to make that perform well, you need a custom memory architecture with faster memory bus for the GPU. And you need an enormous cooler. The PS5 is basically a tiny motherboard with a massive heatsink attached to it. Xbox Series X isn't much different - they went heavier on fans and airflow, less on the heatsink.If you go a littl

Let me change the question slightly: what's the market for an integrated GPU?It's huge.
Most laptops use integrated GPUs.Do laptop buyers care about GPU performance?
Of course.
Lots of people play games on their laptops.
They would value better performance.You can buy a laptop with a discrete GPU, but then you sacrifice other things: size, weight, battery life, heat, fan noise.
If you can improve the GPU performance without sacrificing those things, lots of people would see it as a selling point.

The way integrated GPUs typically work is they're a chiplet: a separate die in a package with some other dies, like the CPU. If you shove a Blackwell or whatever die into a package with a CPU it's going to have the same power and heat dissipation requirements as if it were by itself, but complicated because it's physically co-located with the other hottest part of the computer.You save a bit on cost and maybe a bit on space with integrated graphics, but not really that much. the actual GPU chip isn't very b

The chiplet they use isn't going to be the same as a RTX 5060.
It's going to be something smaller and less powerful, appropriate for use as an integrated GPU.Nvidia already makes integrated GPUs, for example the one in the Switch 2.
This deal will allow them to get into PCs.

OP was talking about a "powerful" GPU. There ain't no free lunch. You don't get magical heat and power benefits from putting a chiplet in a package with a CPU versus it's own little plastic house. Quite the opposite, at least where heat is concerned.

This sounds a lot like the Microsoft "investment" in Apple back in the late 90's. That was surely done to stave off some of the monopoly heat they were getting back then. nVidia better be careful, that Apple investment came back to bite Microsoft in the end. History has a way of repeating itself.
Kinda wondering if Intel is near failure.

NVIDIA can run a second set of eyeballs over Intels products, and undeclared problems, and either kill them or pay TSMC to shrink and refine designs built for low ball fabs. This is exactly what Apple did.
No doubt NVIDIA will weld in some NVIDIA silicon to speed up the pair. I remember Pentium II's made possible, because at that time Intel made memory others could not.
