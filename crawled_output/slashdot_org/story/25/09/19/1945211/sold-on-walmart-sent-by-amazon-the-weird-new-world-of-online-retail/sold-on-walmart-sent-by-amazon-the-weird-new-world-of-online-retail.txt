Sold on Walmart, Sent by Amazon: The Weird New World of Online Retail

from the long-live-logistics dept.
Amazon's logistics network will now fulfill orders placed on Walmart.com, the company announced at its Accelerate seller conference, creating a surreal arrangement where the e-commerce giant directly supports its biggest retail rival's online operations. Third-party sellers can now use Amazon's Multichannel Fulfillment service to automatically process Walmart orders through direct integration. The packages arrive in unbranded boxes since Walmart prohibits Amazon-branded deliveries to its customers.
Amazon VP Dharmesh Mehta told GeekWire the system automatically routes any Walmart order through Amazon's fulfillment network. The service expansion includes upcoming Shein integration and existing support for eBay, Etsy, and Temu. Amazon's third-party seller services generated $156 billion in 2024 revenue. The company now competes directly against ShipBob, FedEx, UPS, and ironically Walmart's own fulfillment services while positioning itself as an end-to-end logistics provider regardless of where the sale originates.

Here's the first sign that Walmart is on the way down the drain, when they're contracting out part one of their core competencies for the sake of better short-term returns.
That seems to be the beginning of the end for pretty much any large American company, on their way to being managed to death.

I live in Texas too. For about $100/year Walmart will deliver groceries or anything else they sell at the local store to my house with no additional service charge. Some poor schmuck drives up in their personal car, hauls bags with my order to my front door. I can order in the morning and it will arrive in time to cook the food for dinner.

Maybe you could try their service before deciding what they do? It's basically the same as a local version of Amazon. You order what you want on their website.

I do hand them a few bucks though, it doesn't look like a fun gig.

I'm not sure online sales were ever part of Walmart's core competencies; I suspect they contracted all that stuff out to third parties.The reason I suspect that is that one of my relatives bought a product from Walmart.com and needed to return it, so she called the number listed on the front page of the Walmart.com web site (and dialled it correctly; I later double-checked the call record on her phone against the walmart.com web page), and the representative who answered put her on hold, then forwarded her to a scammer who tried to trick her into allowing him to TeamViewer in to her computer remotely.
When she refused, he got increasingly abusive and eventually hung up on her.So whomever Walmart was contracting for online support, they were at least bribable, and arguably criminal.

Your anecdote does point to some *neighborhoods* that are in decline, but I'm not sure it can be extrapolated to all of society. In the Houston area, where I live, there are Walmarts in both wealthy suburbs, and in the inner city. They do indeed have different selections of products in locked cases. This does not indicate to me that Houston is in decline--it is, in fact, the second-fastest growing large city in the US, second only to New York City. That doesn't sound like "decline" to me.

They don't overlap entirely; Amazon sells a lot more variety under its own return policies etc, while Walmart is better for things like motor oil that they have locally (if you wanted to go into a Superstore).
But there's enough overlap that it's worth cross-shopping, for now.
