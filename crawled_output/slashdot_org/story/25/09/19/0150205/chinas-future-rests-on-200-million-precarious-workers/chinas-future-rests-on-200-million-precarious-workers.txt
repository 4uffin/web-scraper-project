China's Future Rests on 200 Million Precarious Workers

from the flexible-until-it-breaks dept.
China's economy increasingly relies on 200 million "flexible workers" who lack formal employment contracts, pensions and urban residency permits despite comprising 25% of the national workforce and 40% of urban workers. The demographic includes 40 million day-wage factory workers and 84 million platform economy workers performing deliveries and ride-share driving. Factory gig workers average 26 years old, are 80% male, and 75-80% single and childless. These workers face systemic exclusions from urban benefits including healthcare, schooling and property ownership due to lacking urban hukou residency permits.
China's Supreme Court ruled in August that workers can claim compensation from employers denying benefits, though enforcement mechanisms remain unclear. Economic data shows retail sales growth at yearly lows, continuing property price declines, and rising urban unemployment. Analysts project GDP growth potentially falling to 3% in the third quarter. Manufacturing hubs report increasing numbers of young workers sleeping in parks and under overpasses between temporary jobs.

(1) Innovate with technology to rely on less labor. This is called a productivity gain. And (2) start paying people a decent/humane wage, and this will attract more workers to this line of work.Both of these ideas are problematic.First, technological innovations have already come to some crops like most of the grains grown in the Midwest. The reason most fruit and vegetable harvesting is not automated is that the technology doesn't yet exist. Maybe in a few years or decades, we'll have machines or robots that can pick fruits and vegetables, but likely not anytime soon.Second, it's not just a matter of money. The work is hard, literally back breaking, and often unpleasant. A wage that is just a living wage may not be sufficient to attract enough workers. Remember that many young people don't want the factory jobs that Trump is trying to bring back to the US, and farm work is even harder than factory work.Furthermore, the price inflation from paying much higher wages would make that produce pretty much impossible to sell.In our world, there are currently only two practical solutions. Either use undocumented workers or import produce. Trump is attacking both solutions at the same time.

Commercial properties are often less, around 20 years, but may be extended in some cases.
To be fair urban hukou residency permits are a big issue and just one of several ways the Chinese government exert control over their population.

Which is a power I voted to give it, and in some municipalities- have even been stripped from it- and after the transaction is complete- I get the difference.
Are you truly too stupid to see how that's different?

Do Americans own their land?Yes.Property tax is basically rent.No, it's not. It's property tax. I can vote every penny of my property tax away.
Try as I might, I'm unlikely to sway my landlord's rent by voting it away.
The interesting thing here, is you seem to think that municipal, local, and State government in the US is like China- where the Government is a distinct entity from the people. It's not.
I voted for my property taxes.

This is just as pedantic.No, it's accurate. Don't be stupid. Try voting away your property tax.Property taxes in my tax jurisdiction go up and down all the time as they're voted for and voted against. It's not going to happen any more than voting your landlord's rent away.Incorrect.You have a better chance negotiating with your landlord rent than voting away property tax.LOL- not unless you live in a place with very, very strong renter rights that more or less prevents them from evicting you. Otherwise, there's a literal line of people waiting to take your unit.
I own my property. It's pretty clear you don't.

Interesting. My first reaction to that was wow, that's wrong, I like my freehold. I've never looked into what freehold really means, for example if I find an oil field in the garden I have a feeling the crown might own the mineral rights.I am British, our home is our castle, I believe in that for the individual. I would like to see every British citizen owning the land they live on, in my mind that makes them more invested in the country more willing to defend it.However we have suffered from a plague of la

A lot of people in China do rent, I did, from people who have 'brought' a property and can then rent it.
I looked seriously at 'buying' an apartment in China, but as you say it does feel a lot like renting and therefore felt like a bad investment.
My sense from living in China is not that people trust their government or they have been indoctrinated.
They simple live in a situation where many things are out of their control and make the most of what they can control.
Basically they know they are being

In the US, you almost certainly do not own the mineral rights. Worse, if they are discovered on "your" property, the owner of the mineral rights can come in and start mining while you live there. It is usually in the fine print of your title. I think the "Bush" family owns mine and I live in a very urban area. Those rights go back generations.

These folks work for private companies that treat them this way.
In the Soviet Union, you would have literally worked for the Government, and a local Government council would have made the employment decisions.
China is an essentially capitalist market economy operating under a Communist dictatorship for the people.
It's honestly quite close to fascism, not that I expect you to understand the nuance.

China is a "market socialist" system -- which is a contradiction in terms.
If China is socialist, then for practical purposes Norway and Sweden have to be even *more* socialist because they have a comprehensive public welfare system which China lacks.
And those Nordic countries are rated quite high on global measures of political and personal freedom, and very low on corruption. In general they outperform the US on most of those measures, although the US is better on measures of business deregu
