from the you-can't-escape dept.
An anonymous reader shares a report: Microsoft is adding a whole load of AI agents to Teams today, promising Copilot assistants for every channel, meeting, and community. The new agents will also work across SharePoint and Viva Engage, and are rolling out for Microsoft 365 Copilot users.
Facilitator agents will now sit in on Teams meetings, creating agendas, taking notes, and answering questions. Agents can also suggest time allotments for different meeting topics -- letting participants know if they're running over -- and create documents and tasks. A mobile version is designed to be activated "with a single tap" so you can make sure the agent doesn't miss out on "a quick hallway chat or a spontaneous in-person sync." Channel agents are designed to answer questions based on a channel's previous conversations and meetings and can also generate status reports for a project the same way.

Why would they need to do that from Teams? If you're already using Teams its because your organization is neck deep in Windows/Office365. Your Crown Jewels are most likely already in the hands of trust of MS. And I think you underestimate *just how much* interoffice drama and "lunch time restaurant votes" and emojis and memes you'd have to crawl through to get that one piece of insider info that actually had value.... And getting an 'agent' to scour that from Teams? I mean.....the data is *already in* Teams, seems super inefficient to have an AI Copilot Agent do the heavy lifting here.
