Microsoft Is Reportedly Building An AI Marketplace To Pay Publishers For Content

from the pay-per-crawl dept.
Microsoft is preparing a Publisher Content Marketplace to pay publishers when their work is used in AI products like Copilot. Neowin reports:
Microsoft is reportedly discussing with select US publishers a pilot program for its so-called Publisher Content Marketplace, a system that pays publishers for their content when it gets used by AI products, starting with its own Copilot assistant. The PCM will launch with a limited number of partners before Microsoft hopes to expand the program over time. The company pitched the idea to publishing executives at an invite-only Partner Summit in Monaco last week. Microsoft was allegedly courting them with the message: "You deserve to be paid on the quality of your IP." No concrete launch date for the pilot was shared.
As Axios notes, Microsoft is the first major company to try to build a proper AI marketplace for publishers. Other AI labs like OpenAI have mostly focused on securing one-off licensing deals instead of building a platform for ongoing transactions. Companies like Cloudflare are also working on a more technical, network-level solution to this problem.

We need a clearinghouse for photography and video as well.
I'm guessing this is just for Microsoft AI.
There needs to be one for all models wanting to use copyrighted content.
It would suck to have to upload your stuff to 10 different clearinghouses.something like this would help stop the bandwidth leeching going on right now on every site on the internet, in addition to the IP theft.

People still won't be happy. There are image models trained on public domain images only and some of the typical anti AI people say the dead would not have wanted there images to be trained on (completely missing the point of public domain being free of the limitations the original authors imposed).
Going full Ouroboros.

How long until a publisher starts allowing AI submissions and then this marketplace gets flooded? :)
