Quarter of Workers Under 35 Expect AI To Take Their Jobs Within Two Years, Deutsche Bank Survey Finds

from the kids-aren't-alright dept.
Nearly a quarter of workers aged 18-34 fear they'll lose their jobs to AI within two years, according to a Deutsche Bank survey of 10,000 people across the US and major European economies. The survey, conducted from June through August, found 24% of younger respondents scored their concern at 8 or above on a 10-point scale, compared to just 10% among workers 55 and older. Workers anticipate growing AI risk over time. 22% expressed high concern over a five-year horizon versus 18% for the two-year timeframe, the bank wrote in a report, reviewed by Slashdot.
Americans show greater concern than Europeans across all time periods, scoring roughly five percentage points higher. The survey also revealed major differences in AI adoption patterns. The US leads workplace adoption at 56%, while Spain shows the highest home adoption at 68% over three months. Germany and the UK demonstrate contrasting behaviors -- both countries report similar home usage above 50%, but workplace adoption differs significantly at 41% for Germany versus 5% for the UK. Training gaps persist across regions. Only one in four European respondents has received AI training at work compared to nearly one in three Americans, though 52% of Europeans and 54% of Americans want employer-led AI training.

I mean once the take the jobs, they better become good little consumers and have wants and needs to buy things to keep our economy going since humans won't have any ability to purchase anything anymore.
I hear electricity is a premium these days. Maybe the AI should start by paying for that since they consume so much of it.

Why older workers aren't worried

My guess is that older workers aren't too worried because we have enough experience to recognize the hype when we see it, and the experience to see how badly it does overall (it helps in some small instances, but overall not that much). I don't see 2 years as bringing enough difference to matter unless the AI bros come up with a new way. The last reason is because we recognize we're about to age out and so it won't have an affect on us in the long term.I just need to hang on for 5-8 years and then I'm out of the software work force ... unless I want to volunteer for my favorite OSS project.

Some of that is survivorship bias though. Current workers are the people who didn't lose a job to previous hype waves or actual changing market conditions. The ones that didn't make it could be addicted to OxyContin for all we know. Some of them certainly turned out that way.
I think a lot of the concern is misplaced. I don't see my job being replaced in two years and even ten seems unlikely. The flip side is that if it can be replaced by AI, there're a lot of other jobs that got replaced before or alongs

Should stop drinking the AI coolaid. AI is not a complete solution for job replacement. Yes there will be a lot of jobs replaced. If you are working at a call center or paper pushing, maybe even some aspects of accounting and coding can be replaced. But AI is not going to bake your cake and eat it too. It's going to get most of the ingredients together for you and then you get to mix it.Right now we are in a period where the realities of AI have not set in, once those set in and the AI bubble pops, it will be more apparent how many jobs are going to be replaced. AI is also going to create a lot of jobs.

Cell phones seemed obvious at that point, but basically ALL phones everywhere AND payphones all just being poofed by 20-30 years later?
Seemed impossible, but even my rice farmer FIL who really only has a single rice tractor has a cell phone and no house phone.
Even had me run an electric outlet 200m so he could have electricity in the barn for a phone charger.
