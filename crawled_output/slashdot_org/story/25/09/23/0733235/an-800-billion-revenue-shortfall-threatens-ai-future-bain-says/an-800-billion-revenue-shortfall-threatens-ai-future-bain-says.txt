An $800 Billion Revenue Shortfall Threatens AI Future, Bain Says

from the reality-check dept.
AI companies like OpenAI have been quick to unveil plans for spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers, but they have been slower to show how they will pull in revenue to cover all those expenses. Now, the consulting firm Bain & Co. is estimating the shortfall could be far larger than previously understood. Bloomberg: By 2030, AI companies will need $2 trillion in combined annual revenue to fund the computing power needed to meet projected demand, Bain said in its annual Global Technology Report released Tuesday. Yet their revenue is likely to fall $800 billion short of that mark as efforts to monetize services like ChatGPT trail the spending requirements for data centers and related infrastructure, Bain predicted.
The report is set to raise further questions about the AI industry's valuations and business model. The increasing popularity of services such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, as well as AI efforts by companies across the planet, means demand for computing capacity and energy is rising at a rapid clip. But the savings provided by AI and companies' ability to generate additional revenue from AI is lagging behind that pace.

They have the potential to replace a large percentage of white collar workers. Even if it's not everyone just replacing some of them would cause wages to plummet.
The combination of replacing workers with plummeting wages because of those workers competing for jobs is worth trillions.
One of the major problems people have is they think like an employee and not like an employer.
Your boss is thinking about the entire labor market and how it affects how much he spends on labor.
It's like how when you go buy eggs in the back of your mind you're thinking about the supply of eggs and how that will affect the price.
In this analogy you are the egg and you are going to be cracked to do an omelet and eating.

The Generative AI companies did their thing. It was overall very impressive, even if they massively overstated its usefulness. ChatGPT is a great early demo of this infantile, currently-almost-useless-but-very-promising tech! Now someone simply (heh) needs to get the compute requirements down two to four orders of magnitude.If companies like OpenAI can (and want to) work on that, great! Or others can build on the work that's been done up to now. I don't think anyone will miss the current companies, though they might currently be employing people who likely have a leg up (thanks to their familiarity with the subject) on addressing the compute resources problem.But whenever (if ever) it gets done, people are going to run it on their own machines, not your servers and jail. Lock-in has always been, and will always be, an adversarial force to be eliminated by progress. If that means OpenAI's long-term plans won't work out, well, too bad.
