from the closer-look dept.
40% of U.S. employees have received "workslop" -- AI-generated content that appears polished but lacks substance -- in the past month, according to research from BetterUp Labs and Stanford Social Media Lab. The survey of 1,150 full-time workers found recipients spend an average of one hour and 56 minutes addressing each incident of workslop, costing organizations an estimated $186 per employee monthly. For a 10,000-person company, lost productivity totals over $9 million annually.
Professional services and technology sectors are disproportionately affected. Workers report that 15.4% of received content qualifies as workslop. The phenomenon occurs primarily between peers at 40%, though 18% flows from direct reports to managers and 16% moves down the hierarchy. Beyond financial costs, workslop damages workplace relationships -- half of recipients view senders as less creative, capable, and reliable, while 42% see them as less trustworthy.

That is the thing with AI. You use an AI to summarize the long text from management to something brief and to the point. The manager, on the other hand, threw a few bullet points into an LLM and asked it to write the text.
The manager could have just emailed the bulletpoints. But no, now we need two nuclear power plants. One to generate the text from the summary and another to summarize the text. AI slop...
Just... talk... to... eachother.

So you're saying AI consumes too much energy. GPT-4 training consumed as much energy as 300 cars in their lifetime, which comes about 50 GWh. Not really that much, could be just families on a short street burning that kind of energy. As for inference, GPT-4 usage for an hour consumes less than watching Netflix for an hour. If you compare datacenter energy usage to the rest, it amounts to 5%. Making great economies on LLMs won't save the planet.

My place of work sends human slop.
They are constantly giving us impediments to doing our job while complaining that we should be more productive.
Emails every 5 minutes.
Teams going off constantly from various different channels we are 'required' too be in.
Then you miss something because it was buried in all the crap, people look down on you.
So you need to wade through all the crap.
Oh yes and now people are just seeing up websites for their team and expecting you to go out of your way to check out and stay informed.
They act all indignant like you are a bad employee if you aren't up to date on every one.

Depending on your manager, it's intentional. For managers, personal power is a result of having more people below you on the organization tree. The most logical way to respond to this incentive is to hire more people below you. And if people are working slowly, then it's a justification to hire more people.
Not all managers do this, but the incentive exists, and managers who do it tend to gain power faster than those who don't.
So, because incentives are misaligned, evolutionary pressure exists in corporations to make you, as an individual contributor, inefficient.

Your the second person to write this and it's all true, although when someone asks you "Is the website down?" and you sigh because FFS we have eleventeen different fucking websites and anyway I'm a dev" there's at least a reality behind it. When your manager's manager tells you they're merging two teams in order to facilitate the cross pollination of synergies to promote teamwork, they are actually telling you your team is being merged.But... what we don't need is all the human slop augmented by a giant mountain of AI generated shit. Because if you think the human slop is being replaced by AI shit, you have another thing coming. And the AI shit, unlike the human slop, isn't long winded (or the opposite in the "Is the website down?" example) statements of things that you need to be aware of, it's most of the time useless crap from start to finish.

To write documentation that I know nobody is ever going to read or use. I have to admit if I had had AI back then I absolutely would have used it to write that nonsense.
Also and this is somewhat terrifying but I have encountered people incapable of reading at the director level. I don't mean that as an insult I mean literally they are functionally illiterate. I figured it out when I had one of them and I kept emailing a basic explanation of something to them and they didn't understand but the moments I told them on a phone call they got it.
If you are trying to hide functional illiteracy I could see AI being extremely useful for that.
Now a proper civilization would not have let somebody get out of school functionally illiterate, and I don't mean we failed them so you right wingers can take your dicks out of your hands. We know how to take someone who is functionally illiterate and make them literate it's just a hell of a lot of work and it costs a bit of money. It's well worth doing but there's a bunch of people who get off on the idea that there are people out there who can't read.
It's always about the totem pole. The hierarchy. There has to be somebody beneath me no matter what. So keeping a handful of people unable to read when you yourself can read becomes highly desirable to a certain type of jerkwad.
