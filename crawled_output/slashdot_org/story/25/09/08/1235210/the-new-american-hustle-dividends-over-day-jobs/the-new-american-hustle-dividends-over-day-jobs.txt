from the how-about-that dept.
Young Americans are abandoning traditional retirement planning for dividend-focused ETFs that promise immediate income and freedom from traditional employment. Income-generating ETFs captured one in six dollars flowing into equity ETFs in 2025, pushing the sector to $750 billion -- with the most aggressive funds offering yields above 8% quadrupling to $160 billion over three years.
The r/dividends subreddit has grown tenfold to 780,000 members over five years, while YouTube channels and Discord servers dedicated to dividend investing proliferate. YieldMax's MSTY fund, offering a 90% distribution rate through complex derivatives, has underperformed MicroStrategy stock by 120 percentage points since February 2024 when dividends are reinvested -- nearly 200 points when payouts are withdrawn. Speaking to Bloomberg, finance professor Samuel Hartzmark identified this as the "free dividends fallacy," where investors fail to recognize that dividends reduce share prices rather than creating additional wealth.

This has strong "1999 daytrader" vibes.
Or "2007 house-flipping."
As a newly retired person who really does need to live off my savings, hearing about everybody and their brother piling into the market hoping to avoid having to earn money in the first place by investing makes me think today's market probably is a bubble, and is headed for a fall.
But that doesn't mean I have anywhere better or safer to keep the money other than invested. Inflation is certainly a huge risk to cash savings or long-term bonds right now.
And please don't tell me Bitcoin.

Gold is essential for electronics manufacturing. Trouble is while physical Gold is finite:
paper gold is not finite, and there are actors within the financial system who can double the paper gold as easily as exploiters cloned diablo gold or warcraft gold.
Various traders can essentially create trades on paper gold that represent a debt to be delivered in gold, and later fail to deliver or default on that debt.
An example form is naked short selling,
since the financial system allows for certain players essentially creating fictitious units of stocks and selling them at the market in order to repurchase to later cover the debt at a lower price.
And in this case they are not actually properly "borrowing" units that exist in the world,
but fabricating a promise to sell what they don't have --
causing units to appear available for sale which don't physically exist.
It's like the fractional reserve system, but for different exchange funds representing units of gold trading on the market.The various derivatives and debt paper are viewed by the system as gold and impact the price of gold at the exchange.
So it's very possible they can prevent increase in the spot value of gold to reflect inflation -- they may even be able to bring the exchange price of gold down to 0;
even though none of the sellers of physical gold would sell for that price..

The famous Trinity study gives a very good answer.
It is based on a very thorough analysis of stock and bond investing over the history of the market, with the intent of finding the surest path.And it works like this:
You invest a lot of money in successful stocks (like those in the SnP 500, so an SnP 500 index fund would be a sound choice).
You are "ready to retire" when 4% of your investment's value is a bit more than you need in yearly income.
That's when you retire.
You sell off enough to claim your 4%.
Then you live off of that for a year and let the market work for you.
In theory, the investment will grow by more than 4%, to compensate.
Next year, you sell off that same amount, adjusted up for inflation.Over almost every period in the history of the market, you can do this for 30 years, and at the end of 30 years you will still have most of your original investment.
Over some periods, you would have even more.
There was one period of sustained very high inflation where you would wind up running out of money.From related analysis I saw, if you mix in bonds, you wind up worse off.
Bonds pay a fixed payout without losing principal, but they don't go up with inflation, so they wind up performing worse than the stock market over the 30 year period even if inflation is relatively normal.
Some people still recommend having 25% in bonds to help smooth over the periods where the market is down, so you don't have to sell as much and don't get hit as hard.
Do with that what you will.Of course, you also have the option of investing even more, so you don't need to take the 4% but can instead take 2% or whatever, to further ensure that you remain "gainfully retired" and can weather the storms.But when figuring out how much you need, consider that your medical expenses are likely to go up over time, because you will have to carry your own insurance but also you will have medical issues in your old age, and these will cost you more out-of-pocket money, even with insurance, than you have had to pay throughout your life.

You are "ready to retire" when 4% of your investment's value is a bit more than you need in yearly incomeHealth insurance for a family of 4, right now, runs about $20,000 per year. So 4%, you'd need $500,000 in investments just to cover that annually. Add in housing, which is at least another $1,500 per month, and now you need a portfolio of $950,000. Food is easily another $10,000 per year, plus transportation, probably another $10,000, and add in any entertainment, gifts, and pretty quickly you get to $75,000 - $80,000, which amounts to a portfolio of $2 million.
If you deposited $1,000 per month (after fees, taxes, etc.), and earned 5% on that, it would take you 45 years to save up a $2 million portfolio. It's not bad advice, and starting early is key, but if you start at 25, 45 years gets you to 70, and most people would want to retire long before that.

This is why I'm putting $4,000 per month into retirement savings, most of it into broad stock market index funds.
The expected return on those is more in the 7% to 10% range, depending on how conservatively you're estimating.401k and Roth IRA plans help on the tax side.

In case the summary misleads anyone:
Dividend investing is an absolutely legitimate strategy, indeed it's arguably the original stock investment strategy.
The reason people bought shares in companies when the whole concept was invented was primarily to get paid a share of the companies' profits, i.e. dividends.
Indeed, the way stocks have long been valued is assuming their price should be equal to the net present value of their future dividend stream (discounted for uncertainty).
A few decades ago it became fashionable for companies not to pay dividends and instead re-invest profits in expansion or in stock buybacks, to increase the share price. That's fine, too, the point is that dividend investing isn't a new fad, it's really what stocks were always fundamentally about.
Also, dividend investing has long been a staple of retirement planning... but it's generally a strategy for retirees not people saving for retirement.
The benefit of buying good dividend stocks is that you can collect and live on the dividends without selling the stocks, meaning you live on the revenues without reducing your assets, so you don't run out of money before you die.
For that matter, I suppose if young people have enough wealth that they can afford to buy enough dividend-paying shares (or shares in ETFs that invest in dividend-paying companies), then it's a fine strategy for retiring now.
It just requires that you already have a few million.
If you don't, well, you should invest in whatever will grow your money fastest, and that's "growth" stocks, not "income" stocks.
As an aside, I'll mention that there's also a common One Weird Trick scam [*] related to dividend investing:
Dividend capture.
The idea is that you buy a stock just before it issues its dividend to capture the dividend, then sell it.
Rinse, repeat.
Of course, anyone who actually tries this quickly learns that dividends are priced into stocks (net present value of future dividend stream, right?) which means that the share price drops by roughly the amount of the dividend when the dividend is issued, so selling right after the dividend generally means giving up the gain.
At the end of the day, and after trading commissions, you're likely to be better off doing the boring thing of buying and holding shares of profitable, well-managed companies.

If you haven't held the stock for long enough (about two months, though the rules are complicated) before the dividend is issued, the dividends are taxed as income (up to 37%, plus state income taxes).
If you have held the stock long enough, they're taxed as capital gains (15%, plus whatever the state takes).

If the dividend is considered a Qualified Dividend, which it often is (in my whole portfolio, I have no Unqualified dividend stocks), it is taxed at a 15% rate as long as your income is between $48k-533k and 0% if below $48k and 20% if above $533k (for unmarried single filers...feel free to pull up the numbers yourself for married filing jointly etc).Which is to say that they're nearly identical to long term capital gains for many/most filers.(Ok, here you go...I'll just put this here for folks: https://www.nerdwallet.com/art...

> Speaking to Bloomberg, finance professor Samuel Hartzmark identified this as the "free dividends fallacy," where investors fail to recognize that dividends reduce share prices rather than creating additional wealth.Leaving aside whether the quote is irrelevant - the implication of TFA is that people are using this as side income because wages are low (though I think, also, the article is bollocks too, people who need the income don't have loose change to spend on shares), this is the "free dividends fallacy fallacy", which relies upon the ludicrous assertion that stocks are valued logically according to some objective criteria.In a perfect world, yes, a company giving 1% of its income to investors rather than investing it back into itself should reduce its worth... kinda. But the share price of a company is based upon the desirability of the stock. Will the business still exist in ten years? Will it be bigger? Does it have a racist asswipe who spends all day posting memes to a nazi social network as its head? (You'd think that'd kill the company's value, especially if said company only exists due to government subsidies and said company has a recent history of technological failures, but, I'M PROVING MY POINT HERE. You think Tesla would lose any of its share value if it paid a dividend next year? Fuck that, it'd probably go up in value as there'd be a reason to buy it.)Dividends are also a means for stable businesses that have no obvious direction to grow, but no obvious threats that require a reorganization, to reward investors. That keeps the share price high.So not only is Hartzmark's comments irrelevant, they're also predicated on the most common fallacy in stock trading - the idea that stocks have an objective value. People who assume that are usually the people who end up holding the bag when an investment goes south.

As a very rough rule of thumb, you can get $1,000 in dividends a month from evern $100,000 invested.

And if they do they'd be dumb to put the whole nut in a dividend play and not diversify.
The solution for these brokeass dividend wannabees then is to chase even bigger yields which over time will erode their principal.The only tried and true solution is time in the market long term.
