Top Economists Agree That Gen Z's Hiring Nightmare Is Real

from the not-looking-good dept.
An anonymous reader quotes a report from Fortune: The dramatic rise in unemployment among Americans under 25 -- especially recent graduates -- has become one of the most troubling economic headlines of 2025. Recent insights from economists, central bankers, and labor market analysts signal that this appears to be a uniquely American challenge, underpinned by a "no hire, no fire" economy rather than solely by the rapid ascent of artificial intelligence.
For many Gen Z workers, the struggle to land a job can feel isolating and fuel self-doubt. But that frustration recently got some high-level validation: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell echoed economists' concerns about the cooling labor market, telling reporters at his regular press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee that it's an "interesting labor market" right now, adding that "kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities, are having a hard time finding jobs." Noting a low job finding rate, along with a low redundancy rate, he said, "you've got a low firing, low hiring environment." and noting that it's harder than ever for young jobseekers to break in.
While recent months have been dubbed by Deutsche Bank "the summer AI turned ugly," and some major studies find AI adoption disrupting some entry-level roles, Powell was less sure. AI "may be part of the story," but he insisted the main drivers are a broadly slowed economy and hiring restraint. Top economists at Goldman Sachs and UBS tackled the subject soon after and found Powell to be mostly on the money. This isn't an AI story, at least not yet. "The U.S. labor market experience is peculiar," said Paul Donovan, UBS Chief Economist. "Young Euro area workers have a record low unemployment rate. In the UK, the young persons' unemployment rate has fallen steadily. Employment participation by young Japanese workers is near all-time highs. It seems highly implausible that AI uniquely hurts the employment prospects of younger US workers."
"It might be tempting to blame technology... Machines, robots, or computers replacing humans is an ever-popular dystopian scenario." Donovan concludes that the U.S. pattern "more convincingly fits a broader hiring freeze narrative, affecting new entrants to the workforce."
Goldman Sachs economist Pierfrancesco Mei said last Thursday that "finding a job takes longer in a low-turnover labor market." He argued that "job reallocation," or the pace at which new jobs are created and existing ones destroyed, has been on the decline since the late 1990s... "almost all the variation in turnover since the Great Recession mostly falls on younger workers" and is taking place as "churn." Goldman found that in 2019, it took a young unemployed worker about 10 weeks to find a new job in a low-churn state; now that's 12 weeks on average.

Personally, I'd blame a complete lack of work ethic.When your employer tells you something needs to be done, and you respond you need to go camping (even though you've just taken two weeks off), and maybe you'll get to it next week or thereabouts, I can assure you, you won't be losing your job because of AI.

They tend to be scared to try new things, un-interested in being at work on time or even during standard hours, entitled, and have no interest in paying their dues, often expecting a salary that is more appropriate for someone with 10 years of experience.
"I don't want to build stuff" I was told by a recent mechanical engineering grad.
"I want to design stuff".
Hey kid, you will be a far better engineer in the long run if you learn how to build stuff for a few years, especially if the parts are poorly designed.
You will quickly learns what works and what doesn't.

For a minute there I thought you were talking about Millennials, since all of these very things were said about them when they were just entering the work force.As I recall, the very same things were said about Gen-X too.I don't know if it goes much further back than this, though there is an interesting quote from a famous old guy named "Socrates" that goes like: "The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers."Kids these days....

This was a few years ago, so not exactly Gen-Z, but a similar situation.
I was helping a very recent hire, just out of university, with a project and he asked when he would get promoted from a Junior to Senior Software Engineer.
I told him, among other things, when he didn't need a senior engineer to help him with his work.
It took him two weeks to complete his task, even with my on-request guidance.

Production equals consumption in an ideal economy. Both are bound by finite time. If production increases, consumption must increase, too. Ergo, time spent on production must fall, which is what happened during the last two depressionary eras. 1873-1897 and 1930-1940https://www.scry.llc/2024/12/2... [scry.llc]This phenomenon can be modeled with two linear equations.ConditionsAssume we want Production = Consumption. (P = C)Linear EquationsP Hours + C Hours = Konstant (16 hours if we measure by day).(P Hours) X (Rate of P) = (C Hours) X (Rate of C)Example by week: (40 hours) x (Rp) = (72 hours) x (Rc)As Rp increases, P Hours must decline to maintain equilibrium.https://www.scry.llc/2025/01/2...

We hadn't fully recovered from the damage his mishandling of covid did (as a reminder Obama had two pandemics under his administration neither of which made it to our shores).
We go through this in cycles where every 8 years we get obsessed with some stupid moral panic and we elect Republicans and then they destroy everything because that's pretty much all they can do.
Then the Democrats come in and fix as much as they can and it's never enough because the Republicans are actively sabotaging them but they at least gets enough fixed that we can go about our lives just in a slightly lower quality. Hooray for the Contract with America, Google it if you don't know.
The problem is Biden had just barely gotten us a soft landing despite Jerome Powell gunning for three and a half million layoffs that he never got.
We needed at least another four years to begin to get back on track and we didn't get it. On top of that you've got AI Plus the other 50 years of factory automation and miscellaneous process improvement we all just pretend didn't happen.
This is not sustainable. The Republican party knows that and it's why they are moving to end elections. If America keeps having elections it's only a matter of time before we elect another FDR and have a new new deal.
And the billionaires aren't going to let that happen this time. They are anxious to become trillionaires.

You forgot the part where the fixing is often more painful than the breaking - like tax hikes vs cuts - which makes people unhappy, especially in the moment, because many have the memory and attention span of a goldfish and have forgotten how we all got there and they're disinterested in the future.

I would guess it's because so much of it simply blames problems on others and/or make others the "bad guys" and that's *way* more palatable.
The right is more like "you're the problem for us", where the left is more like "we're all part of the problem" (and "the solution").
The former is easier and latter harder.
In the case of MAGA specifically, it really seems to be a party of exclusion - with the test being if you're currently "MAGA enough" and an ever-narrowing definition of what that is.

The company I work for is heavily international - we crossed the 50% mark a few years back, and now a majority of our revenue comes from non-US countries.
Our parent company is almost entirely US-only.
We're hiring a lot world-wide, and a tiny amount domestically. Our parent is laying people off left and right.
We're also postponing domestic projects. International ones are full-steam ahead.
And the single-biggest reason is no exec can make any significant plans without serious risk of the President of the US doing something bone-headed that blows it up. The risk that some admin hanger-on will come up with a regulatory extortion scheme targeting big announcements is too great. Even if you're not directly targeted, they just flip various regulatory switches randomly, just as they've been doing for the past 8 months. Coked up fascists doing policy is just not good for business, yo.
If you think I'm exaggerating, you try finishing a project budget this month. (Hint [slashdot.org].) To be clear this is not complaining about the fee - the constant changes that render yesterday's work irrelevant is the problem.
