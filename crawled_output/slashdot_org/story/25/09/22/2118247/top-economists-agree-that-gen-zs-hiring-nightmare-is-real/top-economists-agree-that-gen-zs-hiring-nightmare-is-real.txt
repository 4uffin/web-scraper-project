from the not-looking-good dept.
An anonymous reader quotes a report from Fortune: The dramatic rise in unemployment among Americans under 25 -- especially recent graduates -- has become one of the most troubling economic headlines of 2025. Recent insights from economists, central bankers, and labor market analysts signal that this appears to be a uniquely American challenge, underpinned by a "no hire, no fire" economy rather than solely by the rapid ascent of artificial intelligence.
For many Gen Z workers, the struggle to land a job can feel isolating and fuel self-doubt. But that frustration recently got some high-level validation: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell echoed economists' concerns about the cooling labor market, telling reporters at his regular press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee that it's an "interesting labor market" right now, adding that "kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities, are having a hard time finding jobs." Noting a low job finding rate, along with a low redundancy rate, he said, "you've got a low firing, low hiring environment." and noting that it's harder than ever for young jobseekers to break in.
While recent months have been dubbed by Deutsche Bank "the summer AI turned ugly," and some major studies find AI adoption disrupting some entry-level roles, Powell was less sure. AI "may be part of the story," but he insisted the main drivers are a broadly slowed economy and hiring restraint. Top economists at Goldman Sachs and UBS tackled the subject soon after and found Powell to be mostly on the money. This isn't an AI story, at least not yet. "The U.S. labor market experience is peculiar," said Paul Donovan, UBS Chief Economist. "Young Euro area workers have a record low unemployment rate. In the UK, the young persons' unemployment rate has fallen steadily. Employment participation by young Japanese workers is near all-time highs. It seems highly implausible that AI uniquely hurts the employment prospects of younger US workers."
"It might be tempting to blame technology... Machines, robots, or computers replacing humans is an ever-popular dystopian scenario." Donovan concludes that the U.S. pattern "more convincingly fits a broader hiring freeze narrative, affecting new entrants to the workforce."
Goldman Sachs economist Pierfrancesco Mei said last Thursday that "finding a job takes longer in a low-turnover labor market." He argued that "job reallocation," or the pace at which new jobs are created and existing ones destroyed, has been on the decline since the late 1990s... "almost all the variation in turnover since the Great Recession mostly falls on younger workers" and is taking place as "churn." Goldman found that in 2019, it took a young unemployed worker about 10 weeks to find a new job in a low-churn state; now that's 12 weeks on average.

Yeah, there was never an irresponsible young person before this generation.Way to completely miss the point...It's not that this never happened, or even that it was some extremely exceptional case in the millennial/GenX/boomer eras...but it was extremely different.For starters, I think that there are two sides that have both valid points and problematic extremes. In the days of yore, companies generally saw employees as an investment. It wasn't uncommon for people to work at the same company for 25 years or more. Certainly not every company, but the majority of them accepted the tradeoff that new employees would require a good amount of training before the company broke even on their paycheck, and in return, the employee who stayed would earn the company a tidy profit over time, receiving enough money to support a family in return. Today, it seems that everyone wants to 'skip to the end' - companies want to hire savants with 20 years experience in Debian Trixie, make them always-on-call, and in return want to pay them less than half of a living wage, and keep a fear of layoffs at the front of everyone's mind.The counterbalance is that Gen-Z knows this is the case, and treats employers with the same sense of expendability. If a company sees an employee as someone not worth investing in, with little ability to get promoted, and both promotions and layoffs being abstracted from job performance or dedication, it's not unreasonable to adopt the mindset of "if they're doing what's best for them, then I'll do what's best for me"...and it's only a few more steps from there to "I'll work when I feel like it", which is demonstrated in the willingness to no-call/no-show, doomscrolling at work, or having to be 'helicopter managed'.This leads us to the downward spiral - with both sides leaving themselves vulnerable to exploitation if loyalty and dedication are expressed, it is only natural to reduce that vulnerability moving forward. The result, however, is both sides getting worse...it's a Prisoner's Dilemma, and neither side has incentive to break the cycle.

Are you referring to the camper? They didn't hand in shit. They had just returned from two weeks vacation (which was scheduled, for the record), and upon learning what needed to be done now that they returned, informed everyone they couldn't, as they were now taking a "long weekend" to go camping (that had a completely undetermined return date as a kicker).

Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers."Kids these days....

These people get stuck in a self-fulfilling bubble though. They don't realise that anyone who is a decent grad and comes across well in an interview isn't going to be apply for their minimum wage grad job at their no-name engineering firm. I find, especially with engineering in the UK, many companies haven't figured out that the top engineering grads just go into finance, management consulting or FAANG where they get paid decent starting wages. These candidates are filtering out grad jobs advertised at year 2000 salary levels.The applicants engineering companies then get are increasingly the bottom of the barrel. They then complain that the quality is so low, so ironically, try to reduce salaries even further.I know plenty of very good engineers who would return to the traditional industries if the pay was anywhere close to what you can get elsewhere. Meanwhile the lament about lack of talent continues...

This was a few years ago, so not exactly Gen-Z, but a similar situation.
I was helping a very recent hire, just out of university, with a project and he asked when he would get promoted from a Junior to Senior Software Engineer.
I told him, among other things, when he didn't need a senior engineer to help him with his work.
It took him two weeks to complete his task, even with my on-request guidance.
When he was done, he thanked me for all the help and remarked that I had always been ready with an answer and to talk through things and he asked how I had done that.
I told him that prior to being given the work his manager asked me if I thought this would an appropriate task to give him.
I said I'd check it out by doing it myself first, and I had run into many of the same issue he did.
The junior guy asked me how long it took me; I said two hours (which was true).
Granted, I had many years of experience on him and a lot of accumulated (Perl) code from which I could pull that helped reduce my effort.

Production equals consumption in an ideal economy. Both are bound by finite time. If production increases, consumption must increase, too. Ergo, time spent on production must fall, which is what happened during the last two depressionary eras. 1873-1897 and 1930-1940https://www.scry.llc/2024/12/2... [scry.llc]This phenomenon can be modeled with two linear equations.ConditionsAssume we want Production = Consumption. (P = C)Linear EquationsP Hours + C Hours = Konstant (16 hours if we measure by day).(P Hours) X (Rate of P) = (C Hours) X (Rate of C)Example by week: (40 hours) x (Rp) = (72 hours) x (Rc)As Rp increases, P Hours must decline to maintain equilibrium.https://www.scry.llc/2025/01/2...

From Trans Women in Sports: Facts Over Fear [sf.gov]:Trans people are estimated to make up 1-2% of the population of the United States; however, trans people make up less than less than 0.002% (10/500,000) of US college athletes, and even fewer of recent Olympians (0.001%) identify as trans.
Got to hand it to them; it got people riled up though and some of those voted on that issue.
Unfortunately, that says more about the voters than the politicians, and it's not necessarily good.

Careful - you're getting stuck in bipartisanship as well. Look, I totally think Obama was a far better president than Trump (and a decent human being to boot), but as someone outside of America, what really annoys me about Obama is that he just papered over the cracks from the global financial crisis and refused to burn political capital to actually take on the banks and wealthy elites.The same thing happened in most other countries, but there was a time when a leader would sacrifice their popularity in order to push through unpopular but necessary change.In some respects, Trump became possible because at least he is going around smashing things up. Not in a good or coherent way but, like Brexit in the UK, when people keep voting for leaders who make big promises then continue the status quo, they eventually just start voting for anyone who will do anything different.

I am genuinely appalled and impressed at the same time by the outpouring of old men yelling at clouds energy here.
It's like none of you have children or if you do you didn't bother raising them.
Here in the real world people under 30 are working their asses off much harder than our generation did. They are expected to come out of school fully trained for specific jobs but they are also expected to take the kind of low pay that someone without that training would accept. And that's before we talk about adjusting for inflation
My kid regularly puts in 50 hours a week and up. In college they not only had the same workload that I did but they also had a ton of additional courses on top of a ton of on-the-job training classes that had to be paid for. They came out of college ready to work with basically a full Year's worth of direct working experience and they still got paid like shit.
It's been about 5 years and they are only just now at the point where they can reliably support themselves at their income level. With a roommate of course.
This is where the college degree in an in-demand field. I can't imagine what it's like hitting the job market right now. And adjusted for inflation they're making about 75% of what their grandparents made in the exact same career but with less education.
I know facts aren't going to change anyone's mind. You're just going to get your dose of right-wing propaganda.
I would love to have one of you fuckers explain to me why you like right wing propaganda so much though. It's weird but I know it entertains you I just don't understand why. I mean I guess it's similar to how I like anime and people who don't like anime can't understand why I like anime but still. I can at least put into words the reasons I like anime like that I enjoy animation, that I like things that are whimsical and fun, that my color blindness makes anime look especially attractive because I can see the bright primary colors used and that I'm more than a little childish when it comes to my entertainment. Although I do draw the line at lolis and Isekai Mary Sue slop. Which is a pity because if I liked isekai there's a virtually unlimited amount of it but Jesus I don't understand how anyone watches that stuff.
But I have never once seen a right winger put into words why they are so entertained by right wing content. Honestly though I'm not even sure they understand that they are. I only became aware of it when a guy who was in the process of being pipelined into the right wing mentioned that he was entertained by Fox News and I thought it was the weirdest fucking thing I ever heard in my life.
Anyway at this point I'm just ranting because God knows I'm not going to get through to any of you. What's the phrase you love so much? Set in your ways. That's going to end real well for you when your 401k goes bankrupt in a few years because it gets loaded with bad Tesla stock and Trump coin.

I would guess it's because so much of it simply blames problems on others and/or make others the "bad guys" and that's *way* more palatable.
The right is more like "you're the problem for us", where the left is more like "we're all part of the problem" (and "the solution").
The former is easier and latter harder.
In the case of MAGA specifically, it really seems to be a party of exclusion - with the test being if you're currently "MAGA enough" and an ever-narrowing definition of what that is.

The company I work for is heavily international - we crossed the 50% mark a few years back, and now a majority of our revenue comes from non-US countries.
Our parent company is almost entirely US-only.
We're hiring a lot world-wide, and a tiny amount domestically. Our parent is laying people off left and right.
We're also postponing domestic projects. International ones are full-steam ahead.
And the single-biggest reason is no exec can make any significant plans without serious risk of the President of the US doing something bone-headed that blows it up. The risk that some admin hanger-on will come up with a regulatory extortion scheme targeting big announcements is too great. Even if you're not directly targeted, they just flip various regulatory switches randomly, just as they've been doing for the past 8 months. Coked up fascists doing policy is just not good for business, yo.

He just wants to keep his admirers enthralled so it is some new bad and disruptive idea every week, sometimes every day. Hence economic planning becomes completely impossible. There is no more reliable way to long-term kill a modern, optimized western economy than sabotaging all planning.Enjoy the probably deepest recession ever that this will cause.

Makes it easy to bury the really nasty stuff that's permanent.On the political side? For sure. Trump still needs to escape the Epstein files and of all the gross mistakes he makes, some are becoming hard to ignore. Hence he is "flooding the zone with crap" (as I believe the full expression is).But unless he totally wants to tank the economy, he would have to exclude all economic decisions and measures from that "flooding" and allow enterprises to still plan strategically. My guess is he is too uneducated and too dumb to understand that though, and as he has surrounded with excessively dumb but loyal people, nobody is going to explain that to him.

As Carville said, "It's the economy, stupid!" It's as true as ever now. Yes, other factors are at play, including AI, but it's mainly the economy.The big question in our faces is why the US economy is uniquely suffering. We need to turn our eyes toward Washington to answer that question. The tax increases via tariffs combined with the negative stimulus via direct government job cuts and government funding cuts. Plus negativity towards tourism in the US and buying American products.It's one thing for Washington to deny science and medicine, but our leaders are going for the trifecta in denying economics. None of this is a surprise, and none of it goes away by cancelling critics and pounding the propaganda pulpit.

This misses the main point.
Nobody wants to invest money in the US right now for new capital projects because the tariff situation has everyone on hold.
Look at the auto manufacturers... they're not investing in building out new lines or launching new models.
They're refurbishing existing lines and maintaining their existing tooling instead.
The meta is "keep doing what you're doing until this blows over."
That's what's driving the "no hire, no fire" logic.
Now with USMCA under renegotiation, this will just take longer and longer to resolve.
