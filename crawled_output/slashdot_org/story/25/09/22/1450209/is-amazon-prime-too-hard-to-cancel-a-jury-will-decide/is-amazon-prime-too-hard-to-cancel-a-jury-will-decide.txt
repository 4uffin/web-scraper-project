Is Amazon Prime Too Hard To Cancel? A Jury Will Decide.

Subscribing to an online service is often as easy as a click of a button. Is it illegal if it takes a maze of clicks to cancel? That issue is at the heart of a civil trial beginning this week that will scrutinize the tactics Amazon uses to entice consumers to sign up for its signature Prime service -- and to steer them away from leaving. WSJ: The Federal Trade Commission alleges the online giant has duped nearly 40 million customers, in violation of consumer-protection laws. It is seeking civil penalties, refunds to consumers and a court order prohibiting Amazon from using subscription practices that could confuse or deceive customers. The case, which will unfold in a Seattle courtroom, is a top test of the agency's enforcement campaign against allegedly deceptive digital subscription practices.
Amazon's Prime membership, the largest paid subscription program in the world with at least 200 million users, has helped the company become an integral part of consumers' shopping habits. The FTC, which sued Amazon in 2023, alleges the company tricked people into signing up for the service without their knowledge or consent, including by obscuring details about billing and the terms of free trials. It says Amazon created a labyrinth to make it hard to cancel, which the company dubbed "Iliad," a reference to Homer's epic about the long, arduous Trojan War. The FTC says Amazon required customers to navigate four webpages and chose from 15 options to cancel a Prime membership. The company streamlined the process in April 2023, ahead of the filing of the criminal complaint.
The FTC won an initial pretrial victory last week when a federal judge ruled that Amazon did violate consumer-protection laws by taking Prime members' billing information before disclosing the terms of the membership. But he said jurors still would have to consider whether the customers gave their consent to enroll and whether Amazon provided a simple cancellation mechanism.

For funzies I just looked too. Settings->prime->dropdown to manage membership->tap manage and there it is. Sure its not one-click but I dont particularly want a big "CANCEL MEMBERSHIP" button front and center every time I open an app. Theres a lot in there and the management area seems placed in a perfectly reasonable location.

But did you actually go through and cancel? How do you know there are not 100 popups with "are you really sure you want to cancel?" after the part where you stopped? You located the button to /start/ the process, but you don't know how complicated the process is once you start.

My uncle tried it before his death and could never get it to actually take, he never could cancel the subscription.
After he died, Amazon sent voodoo oungans around to raise him from the dead so he could continue paying his Prime subscription.
It wouldn't be so bad only bits keep dropping off of him and then the dog drags them around the house.

Fuck TiVO with a rusty jagged pipe. They double charged me the cancellation fee, since my contract wasn't up yet, and then did not refund me the full extra amount they charged. They absolutely refused to refund me whatever amount of the fee was for taxes, despite the fact that they fucked up by double charging me in the first place. They acted like because the remaining portion was the tax amount, there was absolutely nothing they could do.

Are you sure that you actually cancelled your Prime account?

Not only cancelling Prime is easy, but they will also refund you if you get charged after your free trial ends and cancel before using your paid subscription.

I recommend it! Life after canceling Prime is still great! I haven't missed it and won't go back.Most orders even arrive in the same amount of time, for free (as long as they're over $35). I can live with that restriction.So if there's anybody out there who's a little timid, I'd say, jump on out, the water's fine!
