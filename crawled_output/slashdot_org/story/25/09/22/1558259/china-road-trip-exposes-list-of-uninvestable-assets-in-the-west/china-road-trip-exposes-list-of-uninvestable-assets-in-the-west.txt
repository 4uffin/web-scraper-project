from the closer-look dept.
An anonymous reader shares a report: Venture capitalists in clean tech are starting to say out loud what they've suspected for a while: China's dominance has left key sectors in the West uninvestable. A group of eight VCs from Western firms agreed to share with Bloomberg the details of a July road trip across China during which they visited factories, spoke with startup investors, and interviewed founders of companies.
They knew China had raced ahead in sectors like batteries and "everything around energy," but seeing how big the gap was firsthand left them wondering how European and North American competitors can even survive, says Talia Rafaeli, a former investment banker at both Goldman Sachs and Barclays who's now a partner at Kompas VC. "Everyone needs to take this kind of trip," she said.

The more they modernize in China, the more expensive their labor will get (without some heavy handed pressure from the Chinese government). Will it be fast enough or significant enough to make domestic production viable without tariffs? Who knows...?

I honestly don't care much about the assessments of some VCs rolling around China and explaining their opinions. Their goal is never efficient production of quality products.

Structural economic problems are a large part of why there has been such inaction on climate change though.
The fundamental economic problem of climate change is we have nothing to address the economic issue of negative externalities.Pollution of all kinds fits under that, a cost is borne yet the person producing it does not in most cases have to pay that cost.

5) This situation can continue as long as China (or some other large country) is willing to impoverish it's own citizens in pursuit of dominance in a few select industries, or until other countries throw up trade barriers in responseChina lifted 1B people out of poverty during ~1980-2015. They are the last country on Earth whom you can accuse of impoverishing their people. Their salaries are also 5x SEA average, life is cheap there, and they can actually even afford to buy real estate.If you want an example of a country that is impoverishing it's people, it's the US. 2/3 of the country is one hospital visit away from being homeless, nobody can afford to buy a home anymore, and people work multiple shifts to get by. But yeah, let's point fingers at others...What is going on in China is that their government can set goals, and achieve them. Unheard of, yes. Currently they are among others building up the renewables and car industries. The situation will continue until the industries have matured enough to make it on their own. This is standard industrial policy stuff. Keep your children safe, and teach them, and allow them to take age-appropriate risks and gain experience, unitl they are ready to go out on their own.Overcapacity only looks like a problem if you look at it from a beancounter angle that has never seen a government that knew what it was doing. But if you view the whole lot as an education, research, and development system for bootstrapping a new industry fast, then this is exactly what you want. First, China has ultracompetitive markets in all sectors, so overcapacity is kinda their thing. Second, those who survive will be stronger on the world stage later. And third, the CCP has plenty of experience now scaling things up to get them going, and down as they mature. They will not break a sweat on this one, either.

This is western Capitalists trying to blame the Chinese for the fact they sold us out.The sad reality is that the west has stopped investing in new tech and innovation.It started with outsourcing the manufacturing of non essential parts... that could be made at lower cost in Asia (aka more profit for the Capitalists).As the Chinese learned how to do this with coaching and investment by those same western capitalists they figured out how they could do more complex things.At this point the greedy western Capitalists outsourced the manufacture of critical and essential parts to China.After this they found out they could no longer find the talent they needed to design hard to manufacture or material / technology specific harder to make components in North America (as those skills are built during the intereaction of designers with manufacturing).Again the Chinese had progressed and invested in training engineers etc... at this point the logical _profitable_ last step was to move some of the design and sub-assemblies to China.Frankly the capitalists sold our asses and hand our tech to the Chinese.
They were just hungry and willing to work harder and as such easier to exploit for profit.The Capitalists now realize they no longer control the process and the Chinese have them by the balls.
At this point they are worried what the rest of us will do to them when we finally figure out how badly they screwed us, so they are trying to blame the Chinese a possibly start a war to bomb the Chinese back into the stone age.Capitalists will sell you the rope you hang them with.Make no mistake about this.
This is all about "MBA" strategic choices and quarterly thinking that lead us to this dependence and lack of investment in research, innovation and education.
Reality is even in the past many of the best and brightest have come from outside of North America.
At the time we still recognized that and took care to integrate those people and make them part of our society.
Now with restrictive immigration those people will go else where as well.You don't need to look far to figure out who has sold you out.
Just look who the billionaires are that aren't paying their fair share of taxes either.

The MIC has already figured out how badly they screwed up, since China is embargoing strategic minerals, mostly rare earths, bound for western weapons factories.
As someone in another forum said, "They have no intentions of supplying the materials to build the missiles the Pentagon wants to launch at them."
They're getting so desperate that they're shutting down production lines and delaying fulfillment of contracts by years.
Boeing for example can't get materials to resupply Israel's "Iron Dome" interceptors after their last spat with Iran, interceptor rationing is part of the reason why Ansarallah (Houthi) missiles have been having more success recently.

One child policy did work out, without it, they would have about 2.4B people now. In a country that is not exactly blessed with available farmland. The policy is not without it's problems, but problems smaller that what no policy would have had.Great leap forward didn't work out. Lessons learned, painful ones. They are in fact studying all of the lessons extensively, lessons both of their own, and of others. In particular they are studying the lessons of the both the Soviet Union and the United States, and what went right and wrong with both of those.If you want to draw any conclusions from this, look into the ratio of goals set and goals achieved. I'm sure you would not expect a perfect score. But you'll find the track record is by now stellar compared to pretty much any government on earth. As to your waffle house analogy, I guess you think that is a smart and absurd diss, but not really. There was a girl I knew who really liked to bake, and wanted to make a business out of it. Guess what her house was filled with? Cakes, pastires, cookies and pies. And for good reason. If you want to become really good at something, you need to do it a lot. A LOT. So yeah, you are indeed right, it is a really good thing to stuff your house with waffles.The US did state capitalism in the post-war period, and it worked out great. In fact it built the America we all knew and loved, until it went into disassemble mode and slow decline in the neoliberal age.

That means fundamental R&D expenditures get cut, and mass layoffs happen every year. The best and brightest leave for greener pastures, and the technology stagnates.Along come the venture capitalists who look at the industry and say: well, there's no way I could possibly make 200% profit here, so I'm gonna call it *uninvestable*How can you understand this and yet not understand what it causes to happen?

Your views are compatible, and my view is that you're both correct. Venture capitalists, in common with many other capitalists, optimize for short-term profits, which can stifle long-term planning and innovation. State intervention is capable of making industries uncompetitive. I think that both have contributed to, for example, solar panels no longer being made either in Germany or the United States.

In no way does China have technical superiority.China has technical superiority in a number of areas. Not across the board, but in enough things that we should care. Battery technology is the primary example. Solar panel technology, they may not lead the world, but they certainly lead the US. Manufacturing of small items, they are years out ahead of us, we gave that up, we can only cost effectively build large items now.the only reason they are the place to make these is because of slim margins and dumping practicesThat's how they became the #1 place to make those things, which in turn is how they became #1 in technology to make those things. They copied their way to understanding the tech. That saved them a lot of time and money. Now they lead in several areas. Pretending otherwise is foolish. A lot of goods sold around the world are now not only manufactured in China, they are designed there as well. Corporations in other countries are buying complete goods, not just parts, and having their logos put on them.

The Chinese government deliberately built up their industrial capacity because production becomes power over time.
They used every trick in the book to become attractive to manufacturing.
For a while, cheap labor was one of the tools they had, but Chinese labor hasn't been cheap for a long time now.
Sometimes now it is even more expensive than American labor, but we still can't compete because we've lost those skills, that knowledge, those networks.WW2 was over before it started because America had the industrial capacity to outbuild the rest of the world combined, in every category.
WW3 will go exactly the same way for exactly the same reasons, but it this time it won't be America.

Regarding your other topic
- WW3 is likely to play out quite differently than WW2. Things have changed a lot since 1940s. As just one example, the Ukraine conflict has shown that raw manufacturing power doesn't necessarily determine the outcome of a war.
Plus, there's the whole nuclear aspect. There's a pretty good chance WW3 will last roughly 90 minutes, followed by several centuries of recovery time.

The word "distortion" is doing a lot of work in the US political-economical discourse.The questions one should ask is: can a government set goals for itself, and can it achieve them? Should it do so? The US answer is no and no, and most importantly - even to think of that is pure evil. But what is the point of the government then, if it doesn't bother to solve any problems the country has? And what is the point of the beautiful undistorted system, if all it produces is social problems and a falling standard of living...

The math is really simple. The one with the biggest factory wins. The more you manufacture, the more money you make, the more you learn, and the more you can do all that you want to do. All of this adds up to very real hard and soft power. It is now at a level where China has multiple shipyards building for the navy, where every one is building more ships at once than the whole US navy has in total, and the cost of that is basically a rounding error for them. Think for a second what that means for the balance of power in the world, once those ships hit the water.China has the world's biggest manufacturing base, and 8 out of 10 top universities in the world. They are not only the biggest producer of industrial goods in the world, but also of science. And in both manufacturing and science they lead both in quantity all around and quality on the top end. They have also pretty much overtaken the neutral arbitrator role in international relations, while US has openly made itself the bully that goes around taking everyone's lunch money.China has already gained tech lead in all but three key industries: chips, aerospace and biotech. And as we have been hearing, they are making progress in those fast. All the West had to do was not fuck up these three tech leads we had left. Instead we went and proved to China that we are not a reliable partner in these, so they went ahead and are speedrunning their own.Now while Chinese salaries have raised to about 5x the average SEA salaries, they are still cheap compared to the West. And they are also going big into automation, diluting the labor cost of industry. And if that's not enough, their government is willing and able to manage the economy and money to solve any problems it has. The result is at any quality level their stuff is cheaper than what is available in the West. And their trade deals aren't half as predatory as what you can negotiate for in the West. The result is that for anything that you can get from China, there's not much reason to even think about the West.This will soon enough add up to that the West will have no one to sell to. This is what the Orange Guy tarriffs game is about. Managing the decline. Carve the West into a separate from China trading block, so that there would be someone to sell to. As long as the US can keep Europe off of cheap energy from Russia, everyone will have no choice but to buy everything they need from the US. Never mind that this means cannibalizing the supposed "allies". A great power does not have friends, it only has interests. Those who have made themselves believe otherwise will be having the chickens come home to roost.

To be clear the 2 primary companies that design and built nuclear power in China are CGN and CNNC are both State-Owned-Enterprises. Same as in France with EDF and India with NPCIL.
Those 3 nations have the bulk of current and future nuclear plants.The US used to have far more Federal involvement with the Atomic Energy Commission and when that was disbanded we have seen a dropoff in plant construction.Nuclear power and private investment don't really mix as history and results show.
The risk factors and ROI are just not aligned.If America wants to get serious about nuclear power again it's going to take Federal dollars and directives.
