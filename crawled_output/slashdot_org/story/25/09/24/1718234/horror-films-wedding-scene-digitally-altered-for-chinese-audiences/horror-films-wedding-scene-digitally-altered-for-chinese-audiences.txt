Horror Film's Wedding Scene Digitally Altered for Chinese Audiences

from the real-horror dept.
Australian horror film Together, starring Dave Franco and Alison Brie, underwent digital alterations for its mainland China release on September 12. Chinese cinemagoers discovered that a wedding scene between two men had been modified using face-swapping technology to transform one male character into a female appearance. The change only became apparent after side-by-side screenshots from the original and altered versions circulated on social media platforms.
Chinese viewers are expressing outrage over the AI-powered modification, The Guardian reports, citing concerns about creative integrity and the difficulty of detecting such alterations compared to traditional scene cuts. The film's distributor halted the scheduled September 19 general release following the backlash. China's censorship authorities require all imported films to undergo approval before release.

So the summary is dumb and weirdly evasive, so I skimmed the article.
There's a shot of two dudes getting married to each other and whoever the censors are used AI to make one of the dudes a woman.
Chinese viewers are, according to the article, actually increasingly tolerant of same-sex relationships, and so they are insulted by the switcheroo.When I read "horror movie edited for Chinese audiences", I thought maybe they had put some skin back on a skeleton, because (and this may be outdated by now) skeletons are tantamount to blasphemy in mainstream Chinese culture.

Americans force way more censorship upon Hollywood than China.For example, look at all the PG-13 adaptations of original works that should be rated R. Americans forced Hollywood to censor movies "for the children".

Kinda - the there's no real evidence they actually care about skeletons exactly, but they have historically regularly reject foreign media with 'occult' visuals or that 'promoted superstition', and rather than figure out the actual boundaries, importers would self-censor skeletons and ghosts rather than risk needing to go through revisions or being outright banned.

...or that 'promoted superstition'I find that hilarious, since China is rife with superstition: pointing furniture in certain directions, mirror phobias, fortune tellers consulted before deciding on business transactions, etc. Not that the rest of the world is any better. Our world has a long way to go to eliminate ridiculous superstition.

Was it the Chinese censors - panty-twisting apparatchiks who declare yes or no, often for specious or capricious reasons?
Or was it the studio, who have the masters and a host of VFX people at their disposal, hoping to score some Chinese box office returns?
And who should we be more mad at?

My understanding is that this generally accounts for the diversity/representation gap between movies and TV shows. In movies, representation is either absent or very contained (like a throw away sentence that can be easily cut out in international release). Movies have to cater to many countries, including China. TV shows have nothing but representation because they are mostly targeting USA or maybe Europe and don't have to de

It was the studio. It's also something that has been going on for years. Cuts and edits are often made to suit local laws, e.g. the UK release of Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones was censored in the UK to remove a head butt, which would have bumped its classification up from PG and limited its audience.Japan is another market where it happens frequently. As well as laws around censorship of genitals, there are some about showing drug use. Sometimes movies just don't get released or are heavily dela

Well there's the problem: they turned it from a gay wedding into a trans wedding and I'm guessing Chinese audiences are just not ready for that yet.

Being there is a shortage of women in China due to cultural habits, the Chinese gov't should embrace homosexuality to reduce the chance of riots.

Seems some "Archie Bunker" in the brass got triggered by overly fem boy bands.
