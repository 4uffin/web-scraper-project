AI's Ability To Displace Jobs is Advancing Quickly, Anthropic CEO Says

from the ring-the-alarm-bells dept.
The ability of AI displace humans at various tasks is accelerating quickly, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said at an Axios event on Wednesday. From the report: Amodei and others have previously warned of the possibility that up to half of white-collar jobs could be wiped out by AI over the next five years. The speed of that displacement could require government intervention to help support the workforce, executives said.
"As with most things, when an exponential is moving very quickly, you can't be sure," Amodei said. "I think it is likely enough to happen that we felt there was a need to warn the world about it and to speak honestly." Amodei said the government may need to step in and support people as AI quickly displaces human work.

Slavery would likely have ended by now even without the Civil War because of the cotton picker.
The same thing is happening to the remaining agricultural jobs now, thanks to AI.Strawberry picking robots are already good enough to do the job, just with a ridiculously high up-front cost (like $300k each, which is probably well over a hundred years worth of labor costs, and possibly several hundred).

AI is increasing jobs. Nobody is getting not hired or fired due to AI. The thing we're losing jobs to is inflation due to tariff bullshit. Inflation is reducing the number of people going to restaurants and things like that. If AI was taking jobs and doing things more efficient we'd see the price of goods collapsing.

Jobs are not decreasing, they're just not increasing as quickly as he'd like.2)
Changes in immigration policy are offsetting, albeit not 100%, the slowdown in jobs creation.
So the balance of open jobs hasn't increased that much, but the bar is lower.Point being, he did not call out tariffs as the cause of job losses.
He did leave open the possibility that tariffs or something un-named are slowing job creation.

Unfortunately, at least SOME of the changes are (currently) on an exponential growth curve, and people have very poor ability to project those.
(And also at some point "limiting factors" will manifest, which aren't significant during the early part of the rise.)There are quite plausible scenarios where we are still in the early part of the exponential growth curve.
Nobody can prove whether this speculation is true or false, but we should be prepared in case it is true.
