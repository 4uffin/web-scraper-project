Gemini AI Solves Coding Problem That Stumped 139 Human Teams At ICPC World Finals

from the artificial-brain-power dept.
An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Like the rest of its Big Tech cadre, Google has spent lavishly on developing generative AI models. Google's AI can clean up your text messages and summarize the web, but the company is constantly looking to prove that its generative AI has true intelligence. The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) helps make the point. Google says Gemini 2.5 participated in the 2025 ICPC World Finals, turning in a gold medal performance. According to Google this marks "a significant step on our path toward artificial general intelligence."
Every year, thousands of college-level coders participate in the ICPC event, facing a dozen deviously complex coding and algorithmic puzzles over five grueling hours. This is the largest and longest-running competition of its type. To compete in the ICPC, Google connected Gemini 2.5 Deep Think to a remote online environment approved by the ICPC. The human competitors were given a head start of 10 minutes before Gemini began "thinking."
According to Google, it did not create a freshly trained model for the ICPC like it did for the similar International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) earlier this year. The Gemini 2.5 AI that participated in the ICPC is the same general model that we see in other Gemini applications. However, it was "enhanced" to churn through thinking tokens for the five-hour duration of the competition in search of solutions. At the end of the time limit, Gemini managed to get correct answers for 10 of the 12 problems, which earned it a gold medal. Only four of 139 human teams managed the same feat. "The ICPC has always been about setting the highest standards in problem-solving," said ICPC director Bill Poucher. "Gemini successfully joining this arena, and achieving gold-level results, marks a key moment in defining the AI tools and academic standards needed for the next generation." Gemini's solutions are available on GitHub.

The correct answer shouldn't ever be "8"... if you assume that the numbers are expressed as binary, you would express the answer as binary. My joke was based on the fact that the base wasn't specified (I know it was implied to be binary and hence my smiley). Leading 0s don't tell me what base it is in. Hexadecimal is often used with sets of 2/4/8 digitals with leading 0s. If hex (or any base >2), the correct answer would be 0120. If base 2, of course it is 1000.

The article doesn't say what hardware Gemini was running on, but apparently the dollar cost of this30 min run was high enough that they'd rather not say. Impressive perhaps, but I'm not sure that the correct takeaway is what a great programmer Gemini is (if so, when did it take 30 min ?!), but rather that with brute force search lots of time consuming things can be achieved.

If Andy Weir re-wrote "The Martian" with an LLM-powered drone as the main character, how would the calculation of potatoes-versus-poop-versus-water change?To me, the obvious plot hole in "The Matrix" series was the absurdity of the notion that bio-batteries - human brains and bodies - could magically violate physics and provide more energy/processing power output to The Matrix than the inputs that would be required to keep the nutrient/stasis apparatus running. Billions of people kept alive in a coma, apparently without significant muscular atrophy or any damage to brain development, because when people take the red pill and escape The Matrix they are walking and talking a short while later. The infrastructure required to feed, chemically stimulate, neurologically stimulate, and maintain homeostasis for billions of meatsacks would be prohibitively more expensive than just burning those energy inputs to directly power the Matrix.Yes, if we put a billion monkeys on a billion typewriters (the training set and subsequent LLM token-producing functions) for a billion years (processor cycles in an AI farm), then they can produce Ye Compleat Works Of Shakespeare. Or, well... just give one monkey some porridge and water for a few decades and he will also produce Ye Compleat Works Of Shakespeare because he's, like, you know... Shakespeare.
