Chimps Drinking a Lager a Day in Ripe Fruit, Study Finds

from the having-a-good-time dept.
Wild chimpanzees have been found to consume the equivalent of a bottle of lager's alcohol a day from eating ripened fruit, scientists say. BBC: They say this is evidence humans may have got our taste for alcohol from common primate ancestors who relied on fermented fruit -- a source of sugar and alcohol -- for food. "Human attraction to alcohol probably arose from this dietary heritage of our common ancestor with chimpanzees," said study researcher Aleksey Maro of the University of California, Berkeley.
Chimps, like many other animals, have been spotted feeding on ripe fruit lying on the forest floor, but this is the first study to make clear how much alcohol they might be consuming.
The research team measured the amount of ethanol, or pure alcohol, in fruits such as figs and plums eaten in large quantities by wild chimps in Cote d'Ivoire and Uganda. Based on the amount of fruit they normally eat, the chimps were ingesting around 14 grams of ethanol -- equivalent to nearly two UK units, or roughly one 330ml bottle of lager. The fruits most commonly eaten were those highest in alcohol content.

We should all be on the Lion Diet of all raw beef, butter and eggs, just like a lion eats. Joe Rogan told me so.I don't know how seriously I should take this but I'll comment regardless.As far as I know most any adult mammal loses their taste for any kind of milk or dairy upon becoming an adult.
It's an anomaly among European humans to tolerate lactose into adulthood, an artifact of living in a cold European climate where long winters left adults without a source of vital vitamin D but the milk extracted from cattle.
Those that had the gene for lactose tolerance as an adult tended to survive the winter to produce children with that same gene.
As I recall this doesn't hold for regions where fishing was the norm as fish are high in vitamin D so this isn't universal among those with European ancestry, but rather common enough that if's considered odd for someone with light skin to not like eating cheese.Eating eggs is also an artifact of domesticating animals for food.
Do lions eat eggs?
I know raccoons do, but they are vile creatures that did a lot of damage to my home.
I cry when I see raccoon roadkill as I didn't have the chance to run them over.
Eating eggs was also apparently vital for humans to survive the cold and cloudy north climates as eggs had vitamin D that would have come from being out in the sun for their distant cousins closer to the equator.Light skin helped in getting more vitamin D but also meant a higher risk for sunburn.
This is might be why much of the world as a brown skin, their ancestors got there by leaving sunny Africa, surviving traversing the cold and dimly lit Europe, then settling in places that might have eggs, butter, or fish, or maybe not.
The skin color kind of averaged out.I'm a fan of a relatively starch free diet.
That means eating vegetables with some color to them than wheat, corn, potatoes, and rice that are basically white starch and little else.
Because I crave calories by being a 6'5" dude I will often order a second side of fries with my Whopper meal if there's no side salad on the menu.I remember hearing something about how many potatoes the typical Irish farmer ate in a day before the potato famine put an end to that.
It was something like 40 potatoes.
When working hard to harvest potatoes to keep a balance on calories in to out then maybe that's enough trace minerals and vitamins in a potato to keep going?
I'm sure some milk and eggs helped balance out the diet.
They didn't get much meat.A healthy diet for most humans will have plenty of red meat and colorful vegetables, with some eggs, fish, or starchy vegetables to fill a hole in calories and vitamins.Tolerance for alcohol helped in human development because fermented wine and beer meant the alcohol killed off bacteria while providing needed hydration and calories to a human population that largely consisted of subsistence farmers.
Once humans discovered tea and coffee they started to boil water to kill off bacteria, with the needed calories made up with a habit of adding honey or sugar than alcohol.
Didn't Joe Rogan cover this theory at some point?

We see lactose tolerance in cats and dogs because as domesticated animals they'd be eating our table scraps, and that means they'd get milk that's a couple days past the sell by date, bits of cheese here and there, buttered this and that, and so on.
The lactose tolerant animals could get more calories from our table scraps and so would be more likely to hang around to produce more dogs and cats that were lactose tolerant.

Myth: All Cats Love Milk
While some cats might enjoy the taste of milk, itâ(TM)s not a universal preference. Many cats are simply not interested in it, and even those who enjoy it might experience digestive upset as a result. The article I linked to above says 30% of cats will tolerate lactose as adults.
The article also points out that cats will drink milk in spite of their intolerance because it is a learned behavior, they enjoy the taste and texture, and they are perhaps a bit too trusting of the humans that put food before them.
The cats might not be able to correlate drinking milk to feeling sick from lactose intolerance later, their brains might not understand that

I grew up on a dairy farm and we would feed the cats milk regularly. They seemed to enjoy it. Had I known then what I know now I'd likely point out that milk might not be good for the adult cats.My grandparents had a mixed farm including a milking herd. The cats also liked milk. Ditto, I wouldn't feed my cat cows milk with lactose in it. But then the previous cat got so obsessive about it, it would wake me at 4am for it. So milk feeding stopped soon after that. Hence, new cat is not getting milk as I don't want to go down that road again.

It is ridiculous to link our drug-use to a recent ancestor (via a genetic cousin).
Getting drunk is not a apes-only activity.

The diet of orangutans is 65% fruit ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org] ), so if eating fruit easily gave diabetes, diabetes in orangoutans (and other primates) would be commonplace and it does not seem to be. A survey of captive orangutans finds that 25% are obese and 2% have diabetes. https://nagonline.net/wp-conte... [nagonline.net] , while an estimate 14% in adult humans currently live with diabetes (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diabetes )As high-fiber diets are important for diabetes management ( https://journals.plos.org/plos... [plos.org] ), here is some advice for orangutans:dietary fiber levels for captive orangutans may need to be increased. This can be accomplished in several ways:1) offer all fruits raw and unpeeled; fiber is often localized in the peels;2) replace soft fruits (bananas, grapes, citrus fruits), which contain low fiber levels, with hard fruits and vegetables, such as apples, pears, yams, potatoes, squash, or cucumbers, which contain relatively more fiber (carrots are not as fibrous);3) increase green produce in the diet, and/or add browse daily; and 4) use high-fiber, commercial-primate biscuits.In humans as well, literature says consumption of whole fruit (and not sugary syrups) protects from type 2 diabetes. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.co...
