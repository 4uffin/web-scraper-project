LimeWire Acquires Fyre Festival Brand

from the what-could-possibly-go-wrong dept.
LimeWire, once notorious for fueling online piracy, has acquired the rights to the infamously disastrous Fyre Festival brand. "LimeWire Acquires Fyre Festival Brand -- What Could Possibly Go Wrong?" the company titled its news release.
LimeWire said it would "unveil a reimagined vision for Fyre -- one that expands beyond the digital realm and taps into real-world experiences, community, and surprise." No additional details were announced about the relaunch.
"Fyre became a symbol of hype gone wrong, but it also made history," LimeWire CEO Julian Zehetmayr said. "We're not bringing the festival back -- we're bringing the brand and the meme back to life. This time with real experiences, and without the cheese sandwiches."

Somebody brought back the Acclaim brand

If you don't know Acclaim was a video game publisher from the late 80s famous for making some of the worst garbage on the Nintendo entertainment system and 16-bit consoles. Lots of licensed garbage. If you know them it's probably because they also licensed Mortal Kombat and NBA jam, and rather famously stole the NBA jam name from the original company that made it, Midway games, and proceeded to run it into the ground immediately.
Once a brand exists and people know it it just seems like it always ends up

... about the Fyre Festival fraud and failure, (at least) one of them on Netflix. Check it out, absolutely hilarious. LimeWire buying the Fyre brand sounds 110% like something the LimeWire crew came up with while laying stoned in a Whirlpool. I love this. LOL!

I wonder what they paid for it? I'd like to think maybe it was $100 or something, but Fyre presumably still owes people money, so maybe it had to be a bit more?Either way, Limewire was a pretty toxic brand until those blokes bought it. Now it's pretty much unheard of. Fyre is about as toxic as it comes, so one wonders what they're going to do with it.

Maybe get aquired by EA so EA can start up a "shit brand licensing scheme" for people who really want to associate their product with absolute nonsense.

I watched a video on it a while back and it's freaking hilarious. Absolute complete total disaster. It was marketed towards Rich yuppie types and when all is said and done they took tons of money from downrich people and dump them into a muddy field in middle of nowhere and gave them bologna sandwiches with moldy bread.
Didn't know LimeWire was still around...

They aren't really. The name was re-used by a NFT company starting in 2022. That's who we are talking about in this article. The original has been dead since 2010 or 2011 after a number of lawsuits from the RIAA (including one seeking $72 Trillion (yes, with a T).

As per the wiki, the name was reused by unrelated companies long after the original LimeWire imploded.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

I cannot imagine any other reason to WANT that brand.It is synonymous with fraud, deception, and incompetence.Either someone wants to change that more than they want to make money, or someone made a deal with the devil and the devil said "OK, you can own a big corporate brand, but is has to be an EVIL one.

Exactly. I don't see why anyone would want this "brand" it's not like they had a successful run of many festivals and only fucked up once. They literally fucked up the one and only festival they attempted. It's been so long I bet if you ask random people on the street they would have no idea what the Fyre brand means to them they would have no clue what Fyre is, then there will probably be a small percent that remember the news or got personally burned by the event. As soon as they announce any event under

Quoth wikipedia:In mid-April 2025, Fyre Festival II was postponed indefinitely, and a week later McFarland said the Fyre brand was for sale, being "bigger than what I'm able to lead on my own".[49] In July, McFarland auctioned the Fyre brand on eBay, and expressed disappointment at its "low" sale price of $245,300.[50]

The cheese sandwich was the best part of Frye. I've literally had that same sandwich many times, and while it looks sad and basic, if you are in a position where someone is giving that to you where you didn't specifically order it, let me tell you its special and it hits like nothing else on this earth.
