from the how-about-that dept.
An anonymous reader shares a report: Apollo is exploring a sale of early internet darling AOL after receiving inbound interest in the business, according to people familiar with the matter. Any deal could value AOL at around $1.5 billion, the people said. It is also possible the talks won't result in any deal, they cautioned.
Apollo bought AOL in 2021 as part of a $5 billion deal to acquire that business and Yahoo from Verizon. AOL generates around $400 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the people familiar with the matter said. Its main business lines include software for internet privacy and protection, and the AOL.com website and email domain.

Let's face it - if you're spending $1.5B for AOL, you're paying $1.5B for a list of email addresses owned by people too thick to figure out how to create a different email account somewhere else.That's a captive audience that you can spam the shit out of forever... or at least until they keel over from old age; better consult with the actuarials on what single-digit number of years the mean is for that customer base because you know they're all old AF.

I'm having a difficult time believing that, but then again I don't know what products or services are offered under the AOL brand either.Last time I paid attention to AOL, it was being annoyed when they switched from 3.5" floppies to CDs for distributing software for their service, because the new medium was no longer reformattable for reuse for whatever I needed it for.

Putting a CD in the microwave for a few seconds is amusing the first time, possibly even the second or third, but the novelty wears off very quickly.

I honestly did not know that AOL still existed.
I'm astonished that it's market value is so high.I listened to a security guy's podcast yesterday, and he went over why security programs like Norton and Mcafee were useful at one time but are just junk bloatware these days.
It was his opinion that Windows Defender is good enough for most things.
The same with PC vpn software -- most of them don't do what you think they do.
Apparently the security and privacy industries are big scam opportunities.To be honest, I've been out of that industry long enough that I don't have a feel for the current status.
So I note without commenting.

I remember attempts to moderate on Usenet, and it really didn't work. It was too decentralized, there was insufficient central authority to enforce or to delegate to moderators, and then the volume of garbage got so bad that it simply wasn't worth it anymore.Moderation on USENET works fine. Moderated newsgroups require post approval. The only problem there is post volume, but every newsgroup doesn't have to be for everyone.However, a better plan would have been to give users the tools to filter out the trolls with a web of trust moderation system based on PGP signatures, which could have been added to any newsreader.

AOL was not an internet pioneer. They were an evolution of Quantum Link, an old fashioned on-line service for Commodore computers, that competed with other nationwide services like Compuserve, GEnie, The Well and Prodigy. They actively resisted the internet until people started demanding it, and it got to being ridiculous that you couldn't access the web from AOL itself. By the time AOL introduced full, unrestricted internet access, there were already a dozen or so national ISPs doing the same thing.

People don't seem to know their history when it comes to the online world.
The ARPAnet was the foundation for what became the Internet, but in the private sector, we had things called a BBS, Bulletin Board System, where people would dial into a system run by someone else, and you could read and send messages to other users, and also upload or download things.
Most of those had a single phone line, some two or three lines, but that was the way things were back in the 1980s.There were also the "Online Services".
CompuServe was the one primarily aimed at business use, you had GEnie, Prodigy, and AOL.
None of these were connected to the Internet, they were just their own service in the days of dial-up.
In time, being able to send/receive e-mail from the Internet was added, again, AOL was not ON the Internet, but it finally had the ability to send/receive Internet e-mail.
Eventually, AOL did connect to the Internet, but AOL was never a pioneer in the field.
Being an Internet pioneer would go to companies like Netcom, which was one of the first national Internet service providers back in the 1990s, where the offering really was for people to dial up to be able to get on the Internet.

From The History of GeoWorks, Microsoft Windows' Upstart '90s Competitor
[https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-history-of-geoworks-microsoft-windows-upstart-90s-competitor]Back in the early ’90s, it wasn’t a sure thing that Microsoft Windows was going to take over the market, even though they had a clear lead over many of their competitors, thanks to MS-DOS.
In fact, one of the iconic GUI-based experiences of the era, AOL, hedged its bets for a while, creating and maintaining a DOS version of its iconic pseudo-internet software using a graphical user interface platform few were familiar with: GeoWorks.
It was an operating system for an era when it wasn’t even a sure thing we’d have a modem.
And it was absurdly lightweight, something it gained from its earliest form—as GEOS (Graphical Environment Operating System), an operating system option for the Commodore 64.

AOL was an online service, kinda a counter-model to the Internet, where you had a centralized "information service" instead of a data network. While on the Internet everybody could, for example, run a webserver, having services on AOL meant having a contract with AOL.They later did offer Internet access, but that was when the service essentially was already half head. Few people cared about the "AOL" aspects of "AOL" then.
