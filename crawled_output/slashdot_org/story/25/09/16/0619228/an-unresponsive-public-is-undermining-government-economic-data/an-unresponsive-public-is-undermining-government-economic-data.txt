An Unresponsive Public Is Undermining Government Economic Data

from the growing-concern dept.
An anonymous reader shares a report: Anyone who surveys the public, from marketers to pollsters, struggles nowadays to get people to answer their questions. That phenomenon afflicts crucial government data, making it harder for policymakers and investors to know the true state of the economy. Falling survey participation is an important reason the flagship jobs report released every month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, part of the Labor Department, has undergone such big revisions recently.
This has rippled into the political sphere. On Aug. 1, President Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer
after a particularly large downward revision to jobs for May and June that owed partly to late responses from survey participants. The White House and top administration officials increased their attacks on the BLS last week after the agency published an annual revision suggesting the U.S. added 911,000 fewer jobs over the 12 months through March. The BLS blamed the initial overestimate partly on response rates.
[...] One hypothesis is known as survey fatigue: People are being asked to answer too many questionnaires. Jonathan Eggleston, a senior economist at the U.S. Census Bureau, found in a 2024 study that recent participants in that agency's monthly and annual surveys, which are voluntary, were less likely to answer the 2020 census by mail, phone or online, without a knock on the door. Another is the rise of cellphones with caller ID. In the days of landlines, people had to pick up the phone to know who was calling. These days, many decline to answer callers they don't recognize.

You see they mean "The President called it into question for his own personal reasons and without evidence but the evidence thing is not important so we have to take his marching orders and post-facto try to justify it".It's a reality distortion field going into effect, the numbers *have* to be corrupt because the numbers reflect poorly on decisions.That's what Biden should have just done when inflation was hitting like 7% MoM in 2021-22.
Just say the numbers are wrong! Political enemies! Fire the stats people, nothing weirdly authoritarian about messing with the numbers!

Someone pointed out some differences in Idiocracy: a primary plot point was that the President actively recruited a cabinet member for intelligence, without knowing what that cabinet member would recommend, and willingly followed the possibly unexpected advice provided by that cabinet member, and actively and accurately observed and judged results both when the cabinet member made a correct and when they made an incorrect decision.

Of people who aren't experts complaining about experts doing their thing. You know damn well us nerds would have a fit if somebody went off on one of our little interests.
The data is consistent. That's what matters. You use data to make predictions. If the data is off but off at a consistent and predictable amount then you can predict that and take action accordingly.
This thing where everybody thinks they can just will their preferred universe into existence and ignore reality is something dictators and fascists have been pushing for pretty much forever.
It doesn't work. Sooner or later reality always wins in the end and reality has a well-known liberal bias.

And then SSA bundles it all up and delivers to the IRS, I think around late May. So boiled down, IRS knows what you made in 2024 around May of 2025.

I mean if they're calling by phone, they won't get me...I do not answer any phone calls I do not recognize (ie on my contacts list).
I figure if it is important enough, they'll leave me a voicemail.
And even if they get through, with phone or email, I don't answer questions to unsolicited contacts from people, as that I have NO idea who they really are or what they want.
I assume most every call or email is a scam unless they prove otherwise.
I kinda figured anyone today with much common sense or even slight sense of privacy and personal security pretty much did the same.

There are different kinds of surveys. Established government survey programs in general, and the US Current Employment Statistics survey specifically, aren't usually just a random phone call. The CES is something a business agrees to do once a month for a period of time. For small businesses that seems to be about 3 years, and for large ones it's more indefinite.It is voluntary, but the alternative is to make it compulsory. The montly CES is voluntary but quarterly reporting is not. Censuses and some census related surveys are usually compulsory but more frequent surveys are usually voluntary.

All I want is an ice cream cone, I don't really care to take the time to evaluate it. My immediate reaction to surveys is to skip them. My local co-op grocery store recently got me to answer a survey by offering a $5 store credit. Maybe offering some sort of compensation for responding is part of the answer?

When I was a Lad I decided that my time and my opinion have value and, unless the survey is going to compensate me, I'm not wasting my time.
A few years later I received a work-related survey in the mail that included a crisp new dollar note.
My hubris compelled me to fill out that survey, on company time or course.

Journal
The BLS monthly numbers are always off when the underlying economy is changing rapidly, because of the "birth death problem", meaning that when large numbers of companies are being created or closed (born or died), the surveys that provide the quick data are guaranteed to be quite far off because the surveys go to companies that are already establish, i.e. those that weren't just born and didn't just die.
So when there's a lot of market change, they're sampling the part of the market that is changing less. This means the estimates are off, and the faster the economy is changing the further off they are.
A related issue is that the survey results are only a sample, but BLS needs to extrapolate to the entire population of businesses -- but they don't actually know how many businesses there are in the country, much less how many fit into each of the size / revenue / industry buckets.
So their extrapolation necessarily involves some systematic guesswork [bls.gov].
In normal, stable economic times good guesses are easy because it's not going to be that much different from the prior year and will likely have followed a consistent trend.
But when the economy is changing rapidly, that's not true, so the guesses end up being further off the mark.
Second, it's worse when things are turning for the worse, because of something kind of like "survey fatigue", but not.
The problem is that when lots of the surveyed companies are struggling, they're focused on fighting for their existence and don't have time to bother filling out voluntary government reporting forms.
It's not that they're tired of surveys, but that they just don't have the time and energy to spare.
And, of course, the companies that are going out of business are also the ones w
The phone thing is a red herring, because these BLS surveys are not conducted over the phone.
A new issue compounding the above is that the BLS was hit hard by DOGE cuts and early retirements.
They've lost over 20% of their staff, and the loss in experience and institutional knowledge is far larger than that, because the people who were fired and the people who took the buyouts tended to be very senior. So a lot of the experience that would be used to improve the estimates has walked out the door.
Anyway, the core problem is that the economy is going into the toilet, really fast.
The BLS didn't break out how much of the 911,000 fewer new jobs were added 2024 vs 2025, but I'll bet a big percentage were after Trump started bludgeoning American businesses with tariffs. Most of that pain won't really be known until the 12-month report next year, because the monthly reports are going to continue underestimating the rate of change.
Well, assuming the BLS staff isn't forced to cook the books, in which case we'll just never know.

Maybe if the government actually did something about this mess I wouldn't filter out any call not on my contacts list or that isn't hiding their calling ID?
Yes, I understand the "Do Not Call" registry exists, but it is half-assed and ineffective because the spam callers have worked around it. The spam dialers and call centers are not separate entities thus the people you end up speaking on the phone with are not the ones who made the call and thus aren't guilty of violating the do-not-call. AND they hang up immediately if you ever ask for a call-back phone number.
The phone company knows who's making all the calls. They just don't want it to to stop because they make money both ways.
So until all this background noise goes away, no one is going to response to a phonecall from a random entity.
