from the future-of-work dept.
AI will enable three to four-day workweeks, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan told The New York Times, joining Microsoft's Bill Gates, Nvidia's Jensen Huang and JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon in predicting shorter schedules. Yuan also acknowledged AI will eliminate some positions, particularly entry-level engineering roles where AI can write code, but argued new opportunities will emerge managing AI agents. Gates previously suggested two to three-day weeks within 10 years during a February appearance on The Tonight Show.

We can have shorter work weeks right now.
Technological advances have enabled that long ago.
The reason we don't have shortened workweeks has absolutely nothing to do with how productive tech has made workers, and everything to do with employers wanting long workweeks.To most employers, the phrase "short workweek" means "I pay the same but get less out of my people, meanwhile my competitors pay the same but get more from their people."
It is simply not rational for them to go for that.If we want shorter workweeks in America, the means to obtain it is not new tech, but new legislation.

At least in the US, wages have been stagnant for decades.
From a report [pewresearch.org] by the Pew Research Center:In fact, despite some ups and downs over the past several decades, today's real average wage (that is, the wage after accounting for inflation) has about the same purchasing power it did 40 years ago. And what wage gains there have been have mostly flowed to the highest-paid tier of workers.

Don't hire new people now, just keep around senior staff to supervise the AI and train it up. As they age out, the AI "should" be trained to take their work as well.Or at least it seems that's the way they are behaving.

https://www.scry.llc/2024/12/2... [scry.llc] Keynesian theory is right. The real cause of economic depressions is the mismatch between production time and consumption time which occurs gradually as productivity rises. Governments then create make-work jobs in a haphazard attempt to maintain consumption (equilibrium). Eventually, the impedance mismatch leads to collapse and a new system. We are probably on the verge of that change.

Musk himself was instrumental in the Dodgy program to cut billions in government spending that would have gone to help regular folks so that they could give tax cuts to the rich.At a guess, Musk's vision for "universal high income" is based on the assumption that the lower classes can simply be gotten rid of, leaving only the ultra-rich and the automation to take care of them. There seems to be zero plans to allow anyone not already fairly well off to partake of any part of the economy as AI and automation take larger and larger chunks of the available work.

Tech almost never delivers its promises. Social media was supposed to unite society, but it made society more polarized and divided than ever. The internet was supposed to make information more accessible and provide benefits to move society forward, but instead its generated paywalls and fueled the outrage economy in the name of clicks. Shorter work weeks and more leisure time have been promised for decades, and never delivered. People routinely work 50+ hours per week. In the 1990s, the buzz was paperless office but now there is more paper than ever before. Consumers want cheap products and managers want complaint drones as employees who live at the office. AI is going to be used (for better or worse, most likely worse) to throw more employees out of work do the ones who remain can be motivated to work 70+ hours per week. I see no reason the believe otherwise.
