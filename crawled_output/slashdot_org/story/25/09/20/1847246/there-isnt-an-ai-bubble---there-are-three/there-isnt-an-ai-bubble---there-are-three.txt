There Isn't an AI Bubble - There Are Three

from the pop-goes-the-weasels dept.
Fast Company ran a contrarian take about AI from entrepreneur/thought leader Faisal Hoque, who argues there's three AI bubbles.
The first is a classic speculative bubble, with asset prices soaring above their fundamental values (like the 17th century's Dutch "tulip mania").
"The chances of this not being a bubble are between slim and none..."
Second, AI is also arguably in what we might call an infrastructure bubble, with huge amounts being invested in infrastructure without any certainty that it will be used at full capacity in the future. This happened multiple times in the later 1800s, as railroad investors built thousands of miles of unneeded track to serve future demand that never materialized. More recently, it happened in the late '90s with the rollout of huge amount of fiber optic cable in anticipation of internet traffic demand that didn't turn up until decades later. Companies are pouring billions into GPUs, power systems, and cooling infrastructure, betting that demand will eventually justify the capacity. McKinsey analysts talk of a $7 trillion "race to scale data centers" for AI, and just eight projects in 2025 already represent commitments of over $1 trillion in AI infrastructure investment. Will this be like the railroad booms and busts of the late 1800s? It is impossible to say with any kind of certainty, but it is not unreasonable to think so.
Third, AI is certainly in a hype bubble, which is where the promise claimed for a new technology exceeds reality, and the discussion around that technology becomes increasingly detached from likely future outcomes. Remember the hype around NFTs? That was a classic hype bubble. And AI has been in a similar moment for a while. All kinds of media — social, print, and web — are filled with AI-related content, while AI boosterism has been the mood music of the corporate world for the last few years. Meanwhile, a recent MIT study reported that 95% of AI pilot projects fail to generate any returns at all.
But the article ultimately argues there's lessons in the 1990s dotcom boom:
that "a thing can be hyped beyond its actual capabilities while still being important... When valuations correct — and they will — the same pattern will emerge: companies that focus on solving real problems with available technology will extract value before, during, and after the crash."
The winners will be companies with systematic approaches to extracting value — adopting mixed portfolios with different time horizons and risk levels, while recognizing organizational friction points for a purposeful (and holistic) integration.
"The louder the bubble talk, the more space opens for those willing to take a methodical approach to building value."
Thanks to Slashdot reader Tony Isaac for sharing the article.

With regard to "model collapse" this is a very good point.So new data will not be good at all. But old data will get worse as well. The aging is a massive problem. Put this two things together and what we currently see is a straw-fire in the process of burning itself out and no more straw is to be had.My take is all that will survive is low-quality, outdated and "collapsed" LLMs for cheap or for free for the masses and small, really expensive, special purpose LLMs for some (not a lot) industrial and administrative purposes. Say, 5% of what the AI peddlers promised in actual impact. About the same as from the last AI hypes.

The cooling, electricity, and servers can be reused for more mundane tasks.
Sure, nVidia AI chips are wasted money if you can't find a use for them, but every other facet of infrastructure can be reused for any general-purpose computing. I would wager that even the GPUs can be repurposed to be powerful business servers if someone wrote some drivers to move more Java/JavaScript/Python routine processing to GPUs...it obviously won't be as efficient as a conventional CPU, but I am sure it can offset the price of buying new chips.
Just like we got a lot of cheap office furniture on eBay when the dot com bubble popped, I am sure there are going to be some firesales on cloud computing hardware or services when this horrid AI bubble finally pops.

ABSOLUTELY 10 years ago?...less confident, but you're probably right.
Today?...well...some pace of improvement is happening, but according to Gemini, looking at a $2000 GPU, a RTX 5090 is almost 2x as fast as RTX 3080 Ti in benchmarks.
That's over 5 years.
It went from 8mm to 4mm.
If we're using your 3 year benchmark, it goes from 5mm to 4mm, which is a 11% efficiency gain, according to nVidia.

It is likely that the next algorithmic improvement will happen in 30 years time at the very earliest. Until then we are likely going to be stuck in the dark ages of transformers and Markov chains calling themselves LLMs and pretending to be intelligent.
Research operates on cycles of research careers. Paradigm shifts can happen when most of the current population of researchers stop working in AI and thereby stop flooding the world with variations on the same brute force trick. This will give a new generation of students breathing room to be actually creative and innovative. But before any of that happens, people like Musk and Zuckerberg need to run out of money or die. When the money and interest dries up, AI research will no longer be attractive. That's when the dedicated, methodical kids with a real interest in the field will get their chance to shine.
