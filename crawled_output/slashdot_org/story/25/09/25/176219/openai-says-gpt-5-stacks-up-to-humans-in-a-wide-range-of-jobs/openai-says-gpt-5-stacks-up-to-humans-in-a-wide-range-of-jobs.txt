OpenAI Says GPT-5 Stacks Up To Humans in a Wide Range of Jobs

from the where-things-stand dept.
An anonymous reader shares a report: OpenAI released a new benchmark on Thursday that tests how its AI models perform compared to human professionals across a wide range of industries and jobs. The test, GDPval, is an early attempt at understanding how close OpenAI's systems are to outperforming humans at economically valuable work -- a key part of the company's founding mission to develop artificial general intelligence or AGI.
OpenAI says its found that its GPT-5 model and Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1 "are already approaching the quality of work produced by industry experts." That's not to say that OpenAI's models are going to start replacing humans in their jobs immediately. Despite some CEOs' predictions that AI will take the jobs of humans in just a few years, OpenAI admits that GDPval today covers a very limited number of tasks people do in their real jobs. However, it is one of the latest ways the company is measuring AI's progress towards this milestone. GDPval is based on nine industries that contribute the most to America's gross domestic product, including domains such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and government. The benchmark tests an AI model's performance in 44 occupations among those industries, ranging from software engineers to nurses to journalists.

The issue is that while AI can do some work done, it does make mistakes, same as humans. However, you can fire a human, and humans tend not to want that. If an AI makes a mistake... then what? You fire it? And? Replace it with what?
I really think that it is not going anywhere until there is some kind of "accountability" in what the AI does. ChatGPT looses some of the employer's money, then OpenAI covers the loss. Then we may get somewhere.

From the article:
"It’s worth noting that most working professionals do a lot more than submit research reports to their boss, which is all that GDPval-v0 tests for."
"OpenAI says that it believes Claude scored so high because of its tendency to make pleasing graphics, rather than sheer performance."
So by wide range of jobs, they mean jobs consisting of only submitting research reports with pleasing graphics. And based on recent measurements, about 1/4 incorrect or entirely hallucinated.

ChatGPT is struggling to produce valid SQL even for basic stuff. I use it to produce technical stuff, but everything is checked against at least 2 other AIs and is hand-verified by me, because otherwise there are too many errors.This is not even close to usable for anything technical.On one project, after 8 months, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini (combined) have managed to produce a technical specification that is as riddled with errors as a draft document produced by an engineer, so one could (I suppose) argue that it's not worse than a human, if given sufficient time. However, the specification has probably cost millions - if not billions - in electricity at this point. If the same amount of money had been spent on human engineers, over the same length of time, my guess is that the document would be of much higher quality and much closer to something that could be implemented.True, I would never have been given that kind of cash, so it has democratised wasteful spending, but that's not necessarily useful.

First, If LLMs are substituting for the brainpower and consciences of human workers, then the only humans around are going to be both fewer in number, and less qualified to do what the LLMs are tasked to do. So in settings such as healthcare, hardware or network failure will likely result in deaths to a greater degree than is currently the case. Multiple smaller LLMs on separate, lower-powered computers may help. But if they're isolated from each other to the degree that some of them going down won't take a
