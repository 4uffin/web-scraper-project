Amazon Blamed AI For Layoffs, Then Hired Cheap H1-B Workers, Senators Allege

from the you've-been-served dept.
An anonymous reader shares a report: Senators are demanding answers from Big Tech companies accused of "filing thousands of H-1B skilled labor visa petitions after conducting mass layoffs of American employees." In letters sent to Amazon, Meta, Apple, Google, and Microsoft -- among some of the largest sponsors of H-1B visas -- Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) requested "information and data from each company regarding their recruitment and hiring practices, as well as any variation in salary and benefits between H-1B visa holders and American employees."
The letters came shortly after Grassley sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem requesting that DHS stop "issuing work authorizations to student visa holders." According to Grassley, "foreign student work authorizations put America at risk of technological and corporate espionage," in addition to allegedly "contributing to rising unemployment rates among college-educated Americans."
[...] In the letters to tech firms, senators emphasized that the unemployment rate in America's tech sector is "well above" the overall jobless rate. Amazon perhaps faces the most scrutiny. US Citizenship and Immigration Services data showed that Amazon sponsored the most H-1B visas in 2024 at 14,000, compared to other criticized firms like Microsoft and Meta, which each sponsored 5,000, The Wall Street Journal reported. Senators alleged that Amazon blamed layoffs of "tens of thousands" on the "adoption of generative AI tools," then hired more than 10,000 foreign H-1B employees in 2025.

while possible they are doing dodgy, you can't say "look you fired 10k so you can't hire any H1B's" the ones they fired are almost certainly not the roles they filed with H1B's, they are a huge company and have strong demand in some areas and weak or even cutting back in others. You can be firing and hiring at the same time for completely different purposes.

Every time a company with H1B visa's allotted to them lays people off, an equal number of H1B visa's should be removed from that company. This should discourage the company from laying off just to bring more H1B visa holders on.

Better yet, if layoffs are to occur, you start with H1B first. When those are exhausted you move onto regular employees.

You would need the first pass a law requiring that and then you would have to stop slashing funding to bureaucrats so they could enforce it..
The dirty Little secret of America is that we vilify bureaucrats because bureaucrats are white collar wall enforcement. And billionaires commit white collar crimes so they go out of their way to make sure you take as many of them off the street as possible.
I mean it's like if you were a bank robber and you convinced the public to shut down the local police.

Not at all, in many cases it's a plus when you run a liberal California tech company and don't use H1B or outsourcing. I worked somewhere that some major clients were labor unions, they wouldn't even print t-shirts that weren't USA-union-made.

A beaver drowning stick is designed to pull the beaver under the water when they thrash about with a leg caught in the trap.If Amazon is totally dependent on H-1B's they could go belly up, if they don't pull up stakes and leave the USA to do business in the rest of the world.

I've never heard of the beaver stick, interesting stuff.Removing a H1B allocations would encourage the company to let go of H1B workers first and retrain / utilize the workers they currently have.Companies leaving are a big threat and Trump needs to discourage companies from leaving with specific tariffs against them if they leave the country.

If they pay the h1bs last. That is completely irrelevant. The problem with bringing in all that cheap labor is that even if you're paying them current market rates adding that much to the labor pool will reduce the market rates.
It really pisses me off the way we all just pretend the law of supply and demand goes on holiday whenever worker pay is being discussed.

And the employers might also then apply for an L-1B transfer visa after a year, but transfer them to a new office in some lower-cost state, so that they get the benefits of being in the same time zone or at least a similar time zone without the cost of paying people in an expensive market.You can't win.

I think the point was, rates for Indian workers overseas are so much cheaper, if they could use Indian remote labor, they already would be. That H1b worker still costs a lot more than an Indian remote equivalent.

First recognize that there ARE situations where H1B visas are appropriate.
Sometime there are not enough americans with that particular skill.
For example, if you want to start a dance studio teaching Flamenco, it makes sense to hire someone from Andalusia, Spain to teach the classes.Second, let the states determine if they want to tax the H1B visas more than Americans.
But only a general tax, not a specific industry tax.
For example, you could allow Texas to place a 80% tax on any H1B visa employee.
