Experts Urge Caution About Using ChatGPT To Pick Stocks

from the pros-and-cons dept.
An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: With AI chatbots growing in popular usage, it was only a matter of time before large numbers of people began applying them to the stock market. In fact, at least 1 in 10 retail investors now consult ChatGPT or other AI chatbots for stock-picking advice, according to a Reuters report published Thursday. Data from a survey by trading platform eToro of 11,000 retail investors worldwide suggests that 13 percent of individual investors already use AI tools like ChatGPT or Google's Gemini for stock selection, while about half say they would consider using these tools for portfolio decisions.
Unlike algorithmic trading, where computers automatically execute thousands of trades per second, investors are using ChatGPT as an advisory tool in place of human experts. They type questions, read the AI model's analysis, and then manually decide whether to place trades through their brokers. Reuters spoke with Jeremy Leung, who analyzed companies for investment bank UBS for almost two decades. Leung now relies on ChatGPT for his multi-asset portfolio. "I no longer have the luxury of a Bloomberg terminal, or those kinds of market-data services which are very, very expensive," Leung told Reuters. "Even the simple ChatGPT tool can do a lot and replicate a lot of the workflows that I used to do."
Reuters reports that financial products comparison website Finder asked ChatGPT in March 2023 to select stocks from high-quality businesses based on criteria like debt levels and sustained growth. Since then, the resulting 38-stock portfolio has reportedly grown in value nearly 55 percent. That performance beat the average of the UK's 10 most popular funds by almost 19 percentage points. But there's a huge caveat to that kind of AI success story: US stocks sit near record highs, Reuters notes, with the S&P 500 index up 13 percent this year after surging 23 percent last year. Those are conditions that can make almost any stock-picking strategy look smart.
Reuters frames the AI trading advice trend as a case of new technology tools "democratizing," or opening up, investment analysis once reserved for institutional investors with expensive data terminals. But experts warn that AI models can confabulate financial data and lack access to real-time market information, making them risky substitutes for professional advice. "AI models can be brilliant," Dan Moczulski, UK managing director at eToro, told Reuters. "The risk comes when people treat generic models like ChatGPT or Gemini as crystal balls." He noted that general AI models "can misquote figures and dates, lean too hard on a pre-established narrative, and overly rely on past price action to attempt to predict the future."

Possibly after trusting it with a decision that has real consequences.

Experts Urge Caution About Using ChatGPT To Pick Stocks Leave off the last 3.ChatGPT is decent in analyzing stocks in terms of underlying corporate financial or competitive fundamentals.
The problem is that such analysis is no better at picking stocks than human analysis.
The stock market is not bound by fundamentals.
That's why game theory is a thing.
This is not a knock on ChatGPT.
It's a knock on stock buyers who follow the recommendations from other people or machines instead of understanding the underlying company.

As an investor who often makes money betting against retarded traders, I urge more retail investors to use ChatGPT. In fact, I urge them to use Claude or something to build custom HFT apps that rely on ChatGPT.

True, but what is interesting is that it seems to be competing well with human stock advisors which perhaps says just as much about their methods too.

... they would just do that, earn lots and lots of money from doing so, and would not have the slightest reason to present advice to the public. The truth is, those "Experts" are as bad as dart-throwing monkeys or ChatGPT at picking stocks, but they earn money by making other people believe they knew something special to make them rich.

I would be shocked if any publicly available AI had access to such information.
This is why insider trading is illegal.2) Manage your risk/return ratios well.
This tends to require professional experience, and might involve things only the wealthy should do such as using long term vertical spreads.3) Pick a low priced index fund - being sure to select an appropriate index (Nasdaq Composite is
