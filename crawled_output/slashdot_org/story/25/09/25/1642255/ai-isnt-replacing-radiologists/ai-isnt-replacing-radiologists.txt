AI Isn't Replacing Radiologists

from the benchmarks-aren't-bedsides dept.
Despite AI models outperforming radiologists on benchmark tests since 2017, demand for human radiologists has reached record highs. American diagnostic radiology residency programs offered 1,208 positions this year, up 4% from 2024, while average salaries hit $520,000 -- 48% higher than 2015. Over 700 FDA-cleared radiology AI models exist, yet only 48% of radiologists use AI at all. Models trained on standardized datasets lose up to 20% points accuracy when deployed in different hospitals. Radiologists spend just 36% of their time interpreting images, with the majority devoted to patient communication, teaching, and administrative tasks that current AI cannot perform.

No the reason it's not replacing them is that it doesn't work.
AI just picks up on simple patterns and the problem was that you would feed a bunch of data into an AI for radiology and it would take the easiest route to an answer which would often be catastrophically wrong.
That's the problem when you are right 90% of the time you're basically killing 10% of the people who needed care and treatment.

But it is just another tool that they use. The better the tools work, the more likely radiologists are going to find issues, and earlier. This means they are then more valuable for diagnostic work, and the demand is even higher. Until we start addressing the cause of high cancer rates, the need for diagnosis and cures will keep going up.

Radiologists spend just 36% of their time interpreting imagesThink this translates to a lot of the 'AI should replace them' positions people think about.I'm a "software developer". There are certainly some code-heavy times, but there are days where I don't 'code' at all, and days like today where I've only messed with around 6 lines of code. A minority of my job is taken up with tasks that are even hypothetically in the discussion for AI replacement. It just so happens the LLMs tend to suck at most of my niche as well, but even if it were spot on for prose-to-code it still would only reduce a smaller fraction of my job than an outsider would guess....

The radiologist having a tool to analyze images is like the programmer having an IDE that checks for syntax errors and provides auto complete. It will help them to spot the stupid mistakes and enabled them to put their concentration on the logic instead of searching for minutes where the semicolon is missing. And as the IDE never gets tired reminding you of the missing semicolon, the image AI never gets tired of highlighting relevant parts of an image. Humans on the other hand have their ups and downs.

"AI" has been around for decades.
We use to call it machine learning, and in this field it's been going on now for about 15 years.
AI has "slowly" been gaining adoption in radiology fields for a while now; machine learning algorithms have been being used in image analysis since the early 2010s.
Most of these are the traditional place for AI, improving a skilled worker's productivity, and with machine learning image analysis systems that has been trained for some time, the AI can spot relativel

Radiologists?
Patient communication?
Come on, now, pull the other one.
Next to forensic pathologists, radiologists are the specialty least likely to communicate with patients.
Maybe they're the absolute least likely, though the communications would be rather one way with the forensic pathologists.
They do write reports, but they're short and typically intended for other doctors anyway.

A lot is hanging on what's meant by "patient communication".I worked for almost 10 years with pathologists, and there is a whole lot that goes into communication. A gastroenterologist friend once said to me "pathologists are the only ones in a hospital who make an actual diagnosis".
This means that when a pathologist or radiologist is writing their report they are laying down some key markers for how a patient will be managed as much or more than strictly documenting a diagnostic finding. That might mean c

Most of us are already slaves, just given the illusion of options. Which master do you wish to serve is hardly the question asked of free people.On top of that, it's a very short leap from your propose scenario to, "No need to enslave humans when robotics can do all they do, and more than likely reach efficiency metrics created by the AIs specifically so that robotics can meet them better than humans."

And while there might be currently some waiting time to the hospitals, there is also upper limit to how much healthcare people need.

I already commented about this
[slashdot.org] on another story, but AI caused this problem back in 2015-2017
when it was all over the news that AI would begin reading studies. This caused enough of a percentage of med students to specialize in other areas, leading to the big shortage we have now.As far as AI being used, it is very subtle and minimal. For example our hospital uses iCAD for mammogram imagery [icadmed.com], and all it does spit out a marker file that then can be overlaid on top of the images the Radiologists read, showing areas where it identified extra density and the like. These are just little marker icons showing the radiologist an area that they should review in more detail. Very basic, but it does help keep some things from slipping through.Anyway AI created this problem, and now we're almost to the point we need AI to fix it. But really, like every single other thing in healthcare, it comes down to liability, and who gets sued when a screw-up happens and who is paying the malpractice insurance that covers it. Right now the doctors bear that responsibility, so they are in demand and make the big dollars. AI reading images would decrease their demand and thus their salaries...

Obviously and clearly false. To end up with fewer diagnostic radiologists, you need fewer (or unfilled) residency positions in diagnostic radiology. While interventional radiology historically fills all its positions on match day, diagnostic radiology does indeed have some number of unfilled positions on that day, but not ones that persist into the academic year, due to the (continued) high desirability of the residency.
