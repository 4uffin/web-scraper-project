VMware Price Hikes? Between 800 and 1,500% Since Acquisition By Broadcom, Claim Euro Customers

from the no-shame dept.
Broadcom has upped VMware licensing costs by between eight to 15 times since it took over the organization, and a lack of alternatives in the tech industry means trade and end customers have no choice but to play ball. From a report: This is the according to the European Cloud Competition Observatory (ECCO), an independent body formed by customer organizations, and CISPE -- a trade association of 37 cloud providers in the region -- to monitor the behavior of software vendors accused of abusing their monopoly position. The report also calls for regulatory intervention. The current subscription model "creates a material risk for the company and their shareholders should Regulators investigate and challenge the legality of such model," the report adds.

That would have been something worth thinking about before first buying into VMWare. Most services with a subscription model havd this risk. It is not that great for software. The whole SaaS model is questionable due to this type of risk.

The Broadcom fuckers have already made it difficult to find and download the free Workstation installer for Linux. I didn't check, but it's probably equally annoying for Windows users. Player and Workstation have been free for personal use for a long time. They still are but finding them is a bitch and requires an account to access the downloads.

I was also wondering how they claimed it was a monopoly.
I guess they justify that stance from the difficulty of changing to another solution.
With this levels of price hike I assume that any time and money spent migrating to a different solution would be both an unplanned expense and a good investment.

It's not just about having a monopoly. If you have a dominant market position that also triggers antitrust law and it has to because otherwise companies will abuse their dominant market position to quickly achieve a monopoly.

Correct. When it comes to antitrust law all aspects of market dominance are considered and once the market player has that dominance they are subject to additional regulation.
It has to be that way because once somebody is in a dominant position they quickly dominate the market through underhanded means. Nobody in business plays fair so the government forces them to whether they want to or not.

It is not. VMware has support in lots of other ecosystems, which other hypervisors lack. For instance, you can manage VMM with Cisco ACI, and the only other hypervisor supported is HyperV. If you are running Cisco ACI on your network, you are basically stuck with VMM. You can get a lot of appliances in a ready-to-boot VMware image, but you don't get the images for other hypervisors, and if yes, you don't get all appliances you run as virtual machines in the same other hypervisor, which makes migrating hard.
VMware is a de facto monopoly, and just because in some specific cases you know an alternative does not mean it's an alternative for the friendly datacenter down the road.

It just seems like a big opportunity for competitors of Cisco to add support for other hypervisors in order to beat out Cisco, as well as an opportunity for third party vendors to figure out how to integrate Cisco with non-VMware hypervisors. And of course, Cisco will need to add support for other hypervisors in order to fend off its competitors.

It's not illegal to exploit your monopoly to maximize revenue from that product, it's only illegal to use the monopoly position to build or maintain market share in a different product space, or to prevent competitors in that space from competing.
