from the why-do-we-care dept.
markmcb writes "It seems that a week cannot pass without finding big news about gas prices.
They're up, they're down ... but why do we care so much?
OmniNerd posted an article that aims to put gas prices in perspective.
The author takes a look at other commodities and their price variances and applies some simple math in order to make the claim that best-gas-price-hunting is an effort that could be better used on other products.
From the article, 'Why the disproportionate emphasis on gas prices in our culture, then?
Although some cite a failure of politicians or media populists to account for inflation and purchasing power changes, I think it is simply because gas prices are in your face.'"
IMO, the other side to the price of gas is that, especially in developed countries, it has a pervasive effect throughout all layers of the economy — food prices (because of the trucking), schools (busing), etc., etc.

Perhaps the size of the price sign is what matters.
Gas prices are shown in large high contrast fonts on every street corner.
The price sticker on a bottle of shampoo is less noticeable or sometimes not noticeable at all.
You just pick it up and put it in your cart.In mathmatical terms, figuring that the price sign at a gas station is about 6 feet by 4 feet, and the price sticker on a shelf for a bottle of shampoo is 2 inches by 1 inch, the gas station sign is about 1,728 times larger and thus more emphasis is placed on the price of gas.

Another problem is that it's a big deal because the media makes it a big deal.And the media makes it a big deal because the status quo for intellegence is not very high.
Average Joe customer simply sees things on the surface and doesn't do any deep thinking.
I remember hearing someone that I know say "I guess buying a diesel car is the way to go".
No doubt he simply thought that because the price of gas on diesel cars was advertised as a few cents cheaper per gallon at the time.
Now, its the opposite.
And I don't know this for sure, but aren't diesel cars more expensive?
If that's the case then you'd be losing money overall.

The trick with small block diesel engines is that they get a much better MPG rating on average so even if diesel fuel is more exspensive than gas per gallon you still come out ahead, plus most new diesel cars (VW Auto Group TDIs anyway) are being built to run on bio-diesel without any conversion.

The only incompatibily is natural rubber fuel hoses (phased out 20 years ago for economic, not green reasons), which biodiesel tends to eat away.In hot climates, B100 is pretty much a drop-in replacement, with one catch: it'll eat away built up corrosion from years of petrodiesel, causing your fuel filter to clog up initially.Straight vegetable oil (SVO) works as a fuel, but needs to be at high temperature to have the necessary viscosity, and engines need to be modified with heaters.
We fix that by transesterifying it with methanol and turning it into biodiesel.
This still doesn't have the cold weather ease of use of petrodiesel, though.The only major issue with pure biodiesel is that its gel point is in the neighborhood of 25-30F, resulting in fuel lines that clog.
For people who will be operating in subfreezing weather for significant amounts of time, various additives are available, including basic petrodiesel (this is why B20 is so much more prevalent in the US than B100).
For subfreezing weather over an entire season, an electric heater system is highly recommended - there are already products available tailored to extreme low temperature petrodiesel use.

No, that's wrong. Building a clean burning diesel is actually fairly easy. The problem is that diesel fuel in the US is high in sulfur (though that will change in the next couple years). High sulfur fuel buggers the catalytic coverter in clean diesels. Europe mandated low-sulfur diesel years ago; that's why you only really see "clean" diesel vehicles from Euro manufacturers right now.

Add to this the fact that our society is pretty damn car-centric, and you have something that is really on the minds of everyone.
Too true.
For many of us driving is mostly non-discretionary, which means it's very difficult to cut back in order to save money.
It's like food.
In order to get to work, we have to drive.
It's not like clothing, where you can stretch out the current wardrobe a little longer before you have to replace it.
Some people (particularly my colleagues in Europe) will argue that we should take public transportation.
But in most of the US, public transportation is not really an option.
In my case, my job makes my schedule unreliable, so I can't carpool with others.
The distance from home to work is 35 miles and takes the better part of an hour to drive.
I did some research and found a way to get there via public transportation, but that would take about 2.5 hours with multiple bus changes and a total price higher than what it costs to drive.
I just can't imagine paying more to spend 5 hours commuting each day.
Some suggest that I move closer to work, but with the housing boom over the last few years I can't afford more than a crackerjack box anywhere near where I work.
I don't drive any more than I have to, but it still costs me in the neighborhood of $40/week.
My wife has a similar situation but without quite as much driving.
We have reduced the fuel budget about as much as is possible.
But regardless, our budget is definitely feeling the $150 extra per month we have to pay.

The average price for a gallon of gas in that article was about $2.90, give or take a few cents.
Here in Finland a litre of 95 octane gas costs about 1.263e [polttoaine.net] (1.295 for 98 octane and 1.008 for diesel).
1.263e / litre = 4.7809751e / gallon = $6.04697 / gallon

You speak as though 3/4 of an acre is a large lot. It's a decent sized yard at best. 1 acre is the smallest lot I'll even consider when looking at houses. It's a luxury of living in the large nation that we do. We don't have to be crowded into small spaces in dirty cities. We can choose to live in comfort and have some space for kids to enjoy, and to build shit on.

Don't think for a second that gas is actually cheaper than $6/gallon here.
In other countries, they pay the actual cost at the pump.
Here in America, we pay part of the cost at the pump and pay the rest in taxes and national debt.

I've tried taking the bus. It turns my 25 minute drive into a 70 minute bus ride. I still have to drive 2 miles to reach the bus stop, mainly because I have to cross a 6-lane road that has no pedestrian conveniences such as a crosswalk at the nearest intersections (walking to the nearest crosswalk would make the trip a 4 mmile walk). I have two choies of bus routes, and both are about equivalent in inconvenience, only a few minutes difference in travel time.
I hate driving in traffic. I would love to take the bus. However, I just can't do it with the current options. One major reason is that I have to pick up one of my children from after school care by 6:00pm. To do that, I would have to take the 4:25 bus from work, which is a little difficult when I get off at 5:00. Of course, I could start work earlier, which means I would have to catch the first bus of the day at 6:00, which is a little difficult since my son's school bus doesn't arrive until 7:25 and the school won't allow children to be dropped off until 8:00. I could enroll him in the before school care, too, but that doesn't start until 7:00, which still is insufficient for catching the 6:00 bus.
So, as much as I hate driving during rush hour (if you can call creeping at 15 mph driving), I still prefer it over riding the bus with the options I currently have.
The city here puts a lot of effort into showing how much effort they are putting into public transportation. They don't seem to put much effort into making it at all convenient for people to use.

In most Western Countries, you can choose where you live.
I could have chosen to live within the City Limits, where the store is within walking distance (and public transportation is actually quite good).
Instead, I chose to build a house in the suburbs.

If you feel that the stores are too far away, then either move to a new house (closer to the stores you shop at), or buy a more fuel-efficient car.

The US is 3,537,438 square miles (land). Finland's is 305,470 (land). So, the US driver must cover 11.58 times as much area. Now that works out to a proportionate gas price of $6.04 / 11.58, or $0.52 per gallon.

It seems that a week cannot pass without finding big news about gas prices. They're up, they're down ...
They've been in the news because they've only been going up up up until very recently.
They were also in the news because idiots were 'predicting' that they would hit $5 a gallon after Operation Iraq Freedom.
This article is just a very vigorous proof that you're an idiot if you spend any time at all searching for the cheapest gas.
We all know that some gas stations don't follow the unspoken price rule where you don't undercut your competitors and they won't undercut you.
Some people must feel very smart finding those gas stations.
How much gas they waste getting to them might be interesting to compute also.
Oh well, as long as it makes you feel good inside.
I remember when Exxon Mobile reported the largest profits ever received by a company in a single quarter.
While they were raking in that dough, they were telling me that hurricane Katrina and the war had left them with no oil at all.
They warned me gas prices were going to go up.
Then why the hell did they make record profits?

And we're subsidizing gasoline companies [ucsusa.org] through preferential tax codes?

Beware: Economics follows.
The demand for gasoline is relatively inelastic. If you raise the price, demand does not fall all that much. So, raising the price often means you would make more money. It's a typical monopoly tactic to restrict the supply of something and artifically raise the price against an inelastic demand, and thus gain more revenue. (See also: Windows.)
If anything, the higher profits associated with this price of gas after the hurricane (when supplies are lowered by other forces) should demonstrate that under normal conditions, the industry is actually fairly competitive, and you're paying a relatively fair price for your gasoline. (Well. Aside from taxes.)

It doesn't take a genius to figure out that when the price of X goes through the roof, Y% stays the same (which it did in the oil business, margin was around 10% which is actually lower than many industries), then Z goes up as well.
People who complain about this are either ignorant or anti-capitalist.

If you can make 1,000,000 gallons of gas a day, and demand is 1,000,000 of gas at $1.25 each, then you will have sales of $1,250,000.Now, if demand increases, but you can still only make 1,000,000 of gas a day, you have to adjust your price such that the demand is at 1,000,000 gallons a day again. Today, that price is around $2.85, and the company now has sales of $2,850,000.If you pay attention, you will notice that even so sales more than doubled, they didn't have to spend or invest any more money to do so.The reason why this works is because of the lack of investment in new capacity development. The only reason why this is the case is because of the lack of competition. Everyone in the industry knows they make more money by not investing (in order to increase price), than by investing billions to increase capacity at lower prices.So if you want to have lower oil prices, get writ/weaken OPEC first. Then break up some of the oil industry by seperating crude extraction from refining (break up the vertical monopolies), and then let the free market do its job.

The article basically says that if you put effort into comparing prices of every other purchase, you could save a lot more money. Here are some of the reasons why people shop for good gas prices and not other things:1). Everyone needs gas. A lot of it. Sure we all need red peppers, but not $50 a week in red peppers. The more money something costs and the more frequently we buy it, the more inclined we are to want to save money on it. And the more value. If you save $1 every time you buy 3 red peppers, is that really going to add up? You'd have to be a red-pepper fiend...2). Convenience. If Shaws, Stop n Shop and Market basket all posted the price of the items I typically buy on GIANT SIGNS I CAN READ FROM THE ROAD, I'd be much more likely to pick one store over another for that product. As it stands, by the time I get out of my car, get into the store, get a cart and go up and down the aisles to find what I need to buy, there's no way I'm going to go to another store to save 10 cents, or even a dollar. If I'd known before going in, I might have, though. I personally spend more money on gas than groceries, so it still makes sense.3). Free Money!. Cashback bonus cards give you money. It's free.

There are people who cross the George Washington bridge from New York to New Jersey to get gas at a lower price, when the cost of the bridge toll ($5) is typically well more than the savings (30 gallons of gas at $.15/gallon cheaper = $4.50, for example, and it is practically never a 15 cent difference or more)
Some years ago, I remember a widely quoted congressman who was arguing against raising the US postage rate from
$.25 to $.30 (they ended up raising it to $.29.)
My belief was that it would be sensible to have $.30 postage, with $.25/additional ounce, to make the computations easy, and that it was ridiculous to have a $.29 postage rate with a $.23 marginal rate beyond the first ounce (how many people know their multiples of 23 and want to add them to 29?)
The argument was the congressman made, which apparently resonated well, was that "people will drive halfway across town to save a penny on a gallon of gas (it was the late 80s or so) so we should do the same with postage."
This pointed out several things vividly to a young me:

I believe it is the law (i.e. state law, but similar in most states) that gas stations post prices.We have an unusual situation here in that we have a commodity product--despite advertising efforts to the contrary, few motorists truly believe that it matters whether they buy Shell or Exxon--whose price is very easily compared.One of the odd features of life in the last few decades is that it is now apparently relatively cheap for companies to launch new products and product variations, and the result is that it is fairly hard to compare prices because it is fairly hard to find exactly _the same_ product in two different stores. The stores that promise to match other stores' advertised price on "the same" product are on fairly safe ground. Two supermarkets may both carry Jif peanut butter, but store A may carry Jif Peanut Butter and Honey but not Simply Jif while store B may carry Simply Jif but not Jif Peanut Butter and Honey. If they both carry the same product, they may not carry it in the same size; store A may carry Jif Crunchy Peanut Butter in the 18 oz and 40 oz size, while store B may carry only the 28 oz size, and so forth.My state requires unit prices to be posted on shelf labels, and even here the waters are muddied because it is very common to find that adjacent products on the shelf are unit-priced using _different units_ (fluid ounces vs. gallons, etc.)Generally speaking, it appears as if companies fight commoditization tooth and nail by doing everything they can to withhold real information from consumers and sell "the sizzle" instead. Whether the proliferation of huge numbers of product variations is a deliberate strategy to avoid price comparison I don't know, but it has that effect and I'm sure that corporations find it to be beneficial.Gasoline prices are one arena where information is available--as a result of government regulation, I believe--and you have something approaching a free market.Even here, of course, deception is possible. The Boston Globe recently reported that a number of gas stations have taken to calling 89-octane gasoline "regular" and 87-octane gasoline "economy" in hopes that inattentive consumers will inadvertently purchase a more expensive grade of gasoline than they meant to.(I say "something approaching" because, at least where I live, the number of brands of gasoline has dropped dramatically in the last twenty years, the number of independent stations relative to company-owned stations has dropped, and the percentage price difference between the cheapest and most expensive gasoline in the stations I drive by regularly has narrowed very considerably).

You're also paying for artificially tight refining capacity and the risk that something disrupts the supply chain. From what I hear, the cost of extraction may still be the same, but the quality of oil has declined especially in Saudi Arabia. That means higher refining costs before low quality oil meets the standards of oil traded at index price.
The way to avoid price gouging at the gas pump is to lower the barrier to entry for refineries. The US government can contribute by cutting back on the regulation burden. Breaking up OPEC would also be nice, but I don't see anything with the power to make that happen.
Finally, I don't see the point with the automobile layoffs. This was going to happen. The US auto makers aren't competitive in quality of product or labor costs. This is particularly true of GM which is most of the current run of layoffs. They've been bleeding market share for decades. Blame transference to oil might result in bad economic decisions by the federal government but it's not going to recover those jobs.

TFA: According to the Energy Information Administration, the average cost of gas in the U.S. that year was $1.85 per gallon of regular grade4 and the average gas mileage of a new, light-duty vehicle was 21 mpg Okay, forget the rest of the damn article. Amercia, your problem is right there: MPG.Whilst American cars struggle to reach 25MPG, the average MPG of a European car is over 40MPG (source [greencarcongress.com]).How can the country that has MIT have such crappy MPG? I mean, aren't you chaps utterly ashamed of your engineers? Forget saving money, just bring it down to technical prowess. Why aren't American engineering nerds hanging their head in shame?I have a 4x4 SUV that does better than 25MPG, not just on the motorway and country lanes, but on crowded higgledy-piggledy British towns. And it's a stupid 4x4 that I only really need in the winter! My mother's sporty saloon car does 45MPG. My wife's Volvo (read: APC with upholstery) does 35MPG. What the hell are you Yanks driving to need that much fuel per mile? Do you just grab a fire truck and bolt a couch to it, or what?(Even given 1 Imperial gallon = 1.2 US Gallons, your MPG still sucks, Amercia)

This is silly.
The issue isn't our engineers, it's our preference in cars (You do realize that Ford owns Volvo, right?) .
Even if we had NO auto manufacturers, Americans would have access to any model car in the world if they would only express a desire for it.
It's the biggest automobile market in the world.
Americans don't much give a shit about fuel economy, concentrating more on roominess (we're fat), torque (we don't know how to shift gears), and sheer intimidating bulk (we're aggressive drivers).

That's pretty close.
See www.hummer.com for more details.
And it's not an engineering failure -- more of a marketing problem.
Or maybe a customer problem.
I doubt that your 4x4 is a 9000 lb monster (643 stone for you) driven by a soccer (oops, football) mom (mum).
Come to think of it, we're just applying the wrong solution to the problem of getting from here to there (fuel

It's more about what people buy than what can be engineered. And don't get too excited about your SUV. Your SUV getting 25mpg (Imperial) is only 21.2mpg US. So you're only the same as the US average you crap on. Well, if the average really were 21mpg. Which apparently it is (see updated link http://www.greencarcongress.com/2004/11/average_fu el_co.html [greencarcongress.com] there) I do think Americans should value mpg more. But we don't require it in this country, so people don't. When I n

Yeah, if you can afford it and don't mind being limited to a maximum 75mph - if you can find a hill steep enough to go that fast. 30mpg is probably about average for a reasonably affordable car.

This is referred to as "zone pricing." It is a prime example of how oil companies are gougingGood grief. I suppose it's also "gouging" when a house in San Jose costs more than an identical house in Peoria. The same people who claim gouging when gas stations have different prices would be screaming "collusion!" if the prices were always identical.

Gas prices have gone nowhere but up since Bush took office.
I always hate to interrupt a good Bush-bashing session with facts, but take a look [randomuseless.info]. Gas prices fell quite a bit during the 80s, stayed relatively constant for a while (but note the sharp increase toward the end of the Clinton administration), fell during the first few years of the Bush administration (even after 9/11, which should have been a prime gouging opportunity), and only rose significantly after the Iraq war and last year's hurricanes.
