StupidSexyFlanders writes "The Washington Post ran a story
about students protesting their school's use of anti-plagiarism site Turnitin.com, which checks papers they've written against a database of 22 million other papers. From the article:
"Members of the new Committee for Students' Rights said they do not cheat or condone cheating. But they object to Turnitin's automatically adding their essays to the massive database, calling it an infringement of intellectual property rights."
Statistically speaking, it's likely that a sizable percentage of these students download copyrighted material from the Internet. Do you think any of them are concerned about IP rights then?"

In a society where all High School teaches you to do is think inside the box and do what teachers/administration say, why the hell would they (the schools) expect anyone to be able to do any kind of work or create something new when all school has become is a baby sitting service?As someone (yes I live in backward Oklahoma, however Norman is somewhat educated) who was constantly in trouble for being different and difficult due to my overwhelming boredom with the monotonous teaching techniques used. I would frequently get in trouble for ignoring assignments, classwork, etc. to do what I wanted. The material taught in most High Schools could be learned by a student in 1/4 the time if the student is remotely intelligent.My best High School teacher saw this. We would ad nauseaum go over Algebra and Trig in class. He would assign a significant amount of homework. However for those of us that understood the work, if our homework grade was less than our test grade, the test grade would replace it (if it were 90% or higher). I would call out my daily score of 0. Test day would come. I'd review the material in the book. I would make an A or B. Our homework was only 20% of our overall grade as well.I've never seen a machine strip the creativity out of students faster than the Public School Systems of our country. Learning is a chore here, not an enjoyable endeavor for most. I would venture to guess that outside of the social aspect (learning how to interact with different people), public schools hinder our society more than assist it. It's time to scrap the system and start over.Oh I had a college biology teacher that was similar (it was a pre-college course in high school). He'd give you modules to learn at your own pace. You did X number before 6 weeks you got Y for your grade. I'd do all my work the first 2 weeks, then read the next four. I learned 10x what I did in my first two biology courses and had 12 weeks of an 18 week semester to read books, do whatever. The teacher was always there if you had questions, it just wasn't spoon fed.End of rant.

The problem is not low-quality students cheating, its low-quality teachers who need software to tell whether their students wrote their essays or not.When I was at school, good teachers would know if a parent or sibling had helped because they obversed and tended the growth of knowledge themselves, they did not leave it to a web application or 'virtual learning environment' (virtually learning=almost learning=not learning?).

Just some advice freely given, that I learned far later than I should've, but not too late: you are responsible for your own education. Not a teacher, not a book, not an educational system... you. The school system as it stands right now is better than nothing, but it sucks for a lot of people. Unfortunately, them's the breaks. It's an issue that stems from overconcerned parents, underconcerned parents, lawsuits, slacker kids, genius kids, average kids, turn-of-the-century steel magnates, bad teachers, good teachers, shitty administrators, well-intentioned school boards... and it's had a looong time to evolve. All you can do is the best you can to make sure you come out with an education. "My algebra teacher sucked" isn't going to impress a college recruiter, or a job recruiter, for that matter. If you're in math class and your teacher's droning on, try and work out some basic number theory stuff for yourself. Try to figure out the basic relationships in calculus before you get there. If you're really advanced try and come up with theorems and prove them. In history class, when the teacher brings up a famous person or an event, try to place it on a mental timeline. Think of who else was alive at the same time. Would they have known each other? How would they have interacted? What were the immediate and future causes and effects? English is sort of a lost cause if you're not simply reading in class, because you will always be saddled with dimwits who will lower the level of discourse, and the class is all about the discussion. But you can still play the mental game of placing it historically, figuring out themes, contrasting it with other works, all that sorta stuff. Actually it's sorta sad, one of the classes I think that high school really could use is some kinda philosophy, but it's absent in most curricula. I'm guessing because of the parental complaint or even lawsuit factor if people started discussing gay rights, morality through religion, civil disobedience, etc. But those are the things everyone can get a handle on, because they're basic issues to human existence. And they also might challenge some preconceptions, which is what school is really all about, after all.

Also, the most important thing to remember about this story is THIS IS A HIGH SCHOOL!
If this were a college, the school might, MIGHT just be able to work a clause into their student contract BEFORE the student registers and starts paying stipulating some use of their copyrighted works for use with this system.
However this is for mandatory highschool, this is state mandated and I think they'd have a hard time arguing that the state can force every student to hand over the copyrights to their works.The school I'm sure will make the ethical argument that if they are not cheating, they should have no reason to object to this service.
However the best case these students have (although IANAL) is that this service is profiting from retention of their papers and in fact would not be able to be in business if they were not allowed to keep copies of student papers.I've seen some people post in this story saying "but they're not DIRECTLY profiting from the student's work".
The hell they aren't!
Their service 100% relies on the ability to use existing students' work to compare against.
How is that not directly profiting?
They are incorporating the students' work into their product/service.
And the students receive no compensation.What MIGHT be acceptable is if the students had an option (very important, they should in no way be forced) to sell a license to this service to use their works and were paid an agreed upon annual fee for its use.
Yes, it would cost the service an assload of money...as it should if they are profiting from copyrighted works.

Riiiight.
So when 500 or more assignments (per semester!) get made for:
write a 2-3 page paper, using these sources, on x topic thats been written about to death; none of them are going to be similar?
My ass they aren't.
This is a point that I think is legimate, especially given the similarities in English education throughout regions, let alone states and counties.
I can't even conceive of how the sheer volume of papers written on the same topic can FAIL to produce remarkably similar papers (assuming standard rules of grammar are even remotely followed, and let's face it, even mistakes are fairly standard by regional dialect, as well as those imposed by normal composition techniques, i.e. typing errors.)
Given the lack of curricula changes at most institutions I can see how thousands upon thousands of papers of the same length, on the same topic, written by people with fairly similar educational backgrounds are going to be written within a span of just a few years.
Even worse you're talking about people who have read the same resources in preparation for writing these papers.
If that's not a system designed to produce identical papers, I don't know what is!
It's just like music composition.
People with similar music education backgrounds end up producing similar music.
That's just how it is.
Are you seriously going to argue that the standard educational texts HAVEN'T been mined for every
bloody original idea they contain a thousand times over?

I can see those students having a problem with that, after all it is your work and you don't really want others to keep hold of it while checking. It's like turning up to an airport, handing your mobile over for them to check it wasn't dangerous, and then them handing it back to you after copying your phone book and all of your messages off of it. The company should check it against the database, and then get rid of it, their database shouldn't be automatically updating with every paper that goes through it because eventually it will start catching out genuine work purely due to the amount of data that is being processed through it.
I think the problem here is that the company is permenantly keeping it, and I'd be pretty smarted about that as well, but then on the flip side of the coin for the company and the school, the more copies they have, the more likely (in their view) it is that they will catch those who for example, are using their older brothers essays to go through or using work taken from old pupils. It's a tough situation to gauge, but the students have a strong point on the IP there. That being said, why not just add Wikipedia to the database and catch 99.9% of students, heh. Juding from teachers I know, Wikipedia is the bane of their existance when it comes to schoolwork.

"the collective Slashdot response it just suck it up and deal with it, not to be so greedy, and an admonishment that information wants to be free."
Yes, this is the general response, and I personally would say the same.
But I think there are two key issues here that really differentiate this comparison.
#1:
When artists release songs/videos/movies, they are very conspicuously distributing them to a very large audience, of their own free will.
When musicians release a song, they do that because they created a (presumably) great work of art, and they want the world to hear it (and also hopefully make some money off of it).
I have several friends in bands, and when I ask them what got them into their music, they never reply "because I want to make a profit".
They want the world to enjoy their music; I don't want the world to enjoy the paper I just wrote for my class.
I do not want to distribute that paper.
I wrote it probably because I had to, and I want to turn it in to the professor/TA and get it back.
#2:
When people pirate music, they probably do it because they enjoy it (but don't want to pay for it).
If I just wrote a song, and a million punk kids download it for free, at least they are doing so BECAUSE THEY WANT TO LISTEN TO MY SONG.
Sure, I will be pissed that they undermined my work by not buying it.
But not very pissed.
At least they appreciate my art.
Turnitin?
They are not illegally making a copy of my paper because they want to read it, or enjoy it, or exercise the social value of it.
They are taking it for the specific purpose of getting other students in trouble.
Perhaps if lucky, a couple slashdotters will open their eyes to IP and realize that they are not liberating the world by using bittorrent and kazaa, but this is clearly a different issue.
At least Kazaa and similar are redistributing the artwork with the intent of end-user consumption.
Turnitin is just a gigantic slap in the face to every author and artist in the world.

Actually, a lot of cheating comes from paper mills and using old papers (yours or others'), not Wikipedia.
(He says, having taught that the college level recently.)
So keeping the papers is a very smart thing to do.
I think that legally, TurnItIn.com and other such sites are probably OK in doing that as long as the papers are not accessible except by their comparisons to new submissions *and* they take good steps to make sure that the database isn't cracked.
In many ways, it's akin to the difference between the Census Bureau publishing aggregate statistics that include you in them (even very personal data, like sex-related information) and actually publishing your census form.

Good nit-pick. You're right.
Which leads me to this interesting thought - since turnitin never even LOOKS at the paper, just copies it without authorization, it seems to me that what the students should do is this:
write their papers
register the copyright with the copyright office
after turnitin copies it, hit them with a DMCA violation
ask for $150,000 statutory damages per incident as per the copyright act (this is the limit for works that are registered - you don't have to prove damages if the work is registered).

i think we'll find that the argument will show that the school owns that copyright, just as a company you work for owns the copyright to any code you produce for them (and in some situations, code you produce for yourself).You're comparing apples and zebras, my friend.In a professional setting, a "work for hire" is what you're talking about...
You're being paid to code for XYZ Corporation, therefore whatever work you produce for them on their time, they own copyright to.
You refer to occasions where your employer might own YOUR code too, but that is legally gray, and generally based on how restrictive an employment contract/non-compete agreement you sign.
Unless you sign that, your code is your code, as long as you produced it on your own time.Compare this with a University setting.
You are paying them, not the other way around.
Clearly not a work-for-hire situation.
You are producing written (or coded) works for your own personal development and education.
The professor MAY have the right to compare your document to a database to see if you're cheating or not, but I can't see any legitimate situation where some third-party would have the right to store and use that document.
You haven't signed any contract giving the university or your professor copyright over your work, so that wouldn't seem to apply either.This is different, of course, if you're working in some sort of grad. assistant or research role to produce work for somebody else.
In THAT circumstance, work-for-hire might apply to things you actually write "for-hire."
But it certainly wouldn't give your employer blanket control of everything you produce while employed there.

That is not the case. By law, copyright belongs to the author unless other arrangements have been specifically made. "Work for hire" happens only in the context of an employment contract. I would love to see what sort of "contract" you think students (or their parents) signed for the school to retain copyright of students' work. If a student writes a really intriguing short story for an English class assignment, does the school get to sell it to an anthology compiler or a Hollywood script writer? Not a chance. They can't even print it in the school newspaper without the student's permission. How is giving copies to Turnitin any different?

The argument that Turnitin is not infringing is flawed for at least two reasons:
Copyright infringement doesn't require publication.
If you rent a DVD and make a copy of it, you have almost certainly infringed copyright, even though you haven't "published" the work by making your copy available to any third party.
In a copyright infringement lawsuit relating to a work with a registered copyright, publication may result in a larger award of actual damages, but has nothing to do with whether infringement occurred.
As I understand it, Turnitin does republish the work, or at least fragments of it.
If someone submits a paper, and Turnitin finds some degree of match with another paper in their database, reportedly Turnitin will supply the matched paper or excerpts from it to the course instructor.
I am currently taking a course that requires me to submit my papers to Turnitin.
My objection to Turnitin is that they are not only infringing my copright, but that they are doing so for commercial profit.
If they want to make money from storing my paper in a database, they should pay me for a license.
I carefully read the Turnitin terms and conditions when I signed up for the account.
I was particularly concerned that I might be forced to agree to terms that grant them a license to my work, although arguably if I was forced to enter the agreement in order to take a college course, the agreement might not be legally binding.
However, there were no such terms in the agreement.
The agreement primarily said that I would not make improper use of Turnitin's intellectual property, something that I have no interest in doing.
Every paper I submit to Turnitin contains the statement "Copyright 2006 Eric Smith.

No part of this work may be stored in a database or electronic retrieval system without explicit written permission of the author."
After the course is over, and I have received my degree from the college (expected in December), I plan to send a registered letter to Turnitin demanding that they delete my papers from the database and provide some evidence that they have done so.
I expect to either get no response, or a response stating that they will not comply.

I've used older works of my own as a basis for new work. It'd be foolish not to. Just like we all build our code into reusable chunks so that when it's needed on the next project we can leverage the time already put into it.I had an interesting conversation with this about one of the senior staff members in our electronics department. He was of the mindset that plagurism really didn't matter if you structure the question in such a way that it need to show understanding. As long as the request is sufficiently targetted that you can't wholesale copy another paper, then what's the real problem if you find a paragraph in another person's paper that fits perfectly with what you need. (although in those cases why not just cite it as a source).Engineering may be unique because papers usually need to show a deep understanding, and a professor who knows and works with you should be able to quickly see if it's not your work.I can see how it would be a much bigger problem in something like English Lit.

This actually touches on a gray legal area: the legal rights of minors.
While there are definately rights that you are born with (and a few that some people believe begin at conception, such as right to life), others are more fluid.
When minors cross the entrance of public schools, many if not most of their rights disappear.
For example, where adults have the right to property that cannot be removed without lawful cause, minors can have anything and everything taken from them by school officials if they deem it necessary (think cell phones, pagers, magazines, etc).
So, is intellectual property the next 'right' that minors will have stripped away once entering a public school?
Will schools, therefore, start claiming ownership of ideas the students think of during school hours, much like corporations claim the ideas of their adult employees?
I think we are seeing the start of a new legal debate: what rights do minors have or not have, and who can take them away?
If some 17 year old comes up with the next great business idea while sitting in his computer programming class in high school, does the school have legal rights to the idea?
Does his parents since they are legally responsible for him?
Or, since the school is a public school, does the State/Federal government have first rights?
In an age where IP rights can mean the difference between just another computer program and a billion dollar empire, questions like these are going to be asked more often.

But taking that into account, I'll be there are still a huge number of copyright violators who would be outraged if their own copyright was violated.
I find that kind of double standard pretty lame and disappointingly common.
And it's one of the many reasons that we haven't been able to get reasonable copyright limits in place... because so many people want infinite protection for their own ideas even though it's obvious that society functions better with a less restricted idea flow.At the moment I don't have anything popular enough to make a point with, but the creative projects [vendettachristmas.com] I have worked on [lisasleftovers.com] I've made freely available.

Furthermore, is it not possible that this system is based primarily on a "whoever turns it in first, is automatically the original author" type of system?
Suppose someone writes a paper for their own pleasure, or even for an entry for some type of scholarship.
Someone likes his paper so much that they make a copy and hold on to the paper.
That someone has a class and is asked to write a very similar paper, maybe at a different school, and decides to plagarize the original author's paper and submits it to turnitin.com.
However, because the original author had never submitted his paper to turnitin, turnitin now considers the plagarizer to be the "orignal author" of the paper.
Fast forward to a few years later when the orignal author is in their senior year in college and decides to submit their paper for a class that is calling for him to write something over the exact topic he wrote about years ago. When he submits it to turnitin.com, he is labelled a plagarizer, and he has absolutely no recourse nor any way to clear his name.

Lastly, and this will be shocking since I am an academic, but this IP / privacy obsession we have in this country is getting out of hand. Many people seem to have the impression that every precious thought from their head deserves protection and eternal ownership. In fact, most of it is not that interesting and will not benefit them financially. In the long run, obsessing over IP is dangerous. If we choke our transmission of original and useful ideas with overzealous IP rights, we will cease to transmit ideas. The rest of the world will be glad to take over for us in this area and they will if we are not careful. This does not mean I support the idea that ALL information should be free. But in the context of Turnitin, is that English paper you wrote for freshman comp, or even your senior thesis that financially valuable? If you are a good student, wouldn't you like to help the catch the cheaters? After all, they get the same degree you do in the end, even if they cheat to do it.
I think it's odd that for so many in this country, an original thought is only worth protecting if it can generate money. That certainly seems to be a double-standard.
Why is it acceptable for the RIAA, Microsoft, MPAA, Disney to have over 100 years of protection for their various forms of original thought, but a college student is entitled to none?
Ostensibly, your argument seems to suggest that since a kid can't generate any money from their research paper, it's not worth protecting their right to ownership of it.
Moreover, your argument seems to be that turnitin.com should profit from the college student's original work simply because the student isn't using it for profit.

To do otherwise would be a sign of mental defect, as far as I'm concerned.What you're saying is that in a school, I should be required to waste my time repeating the same work that I'd done and that I'd already proven to understand, for the sake of some professor/teacher ego, so that they know that I was forced to spend xx additional hours of my life to make them happy.
I'm sorry, but at this stage in my life, if I were to go back and take another class, and a professor attempted that kind of sanctimonious bullshit on me, they would be talking to my lawyer within that day.My work is my work, and if I choose to reuse it in a similar situation, this not only demonstrates that I understood the assignment, but that I recognized that I had already done the assignment.
It is a mark of intelligence to recognize this.

Honestly I think that if students knew that their paper was going to be shared with more than them and their English teacher I would object too.

This only works if the essay was submitted electronically.
Wayyy back when I was in high school we could only submit the essays in paper form, preferrably typed (but they did allow us to write it out in neat hand writing).
Does this high school require that people submit their essays in electronic form?
I would think that if you submitted all your work on paper then you'd at least force the teachers to scan the document before submitting it (making it that much more work).
Or if you submitted it handwritten, there's no way they would sit there and type it in to submit it to a website.Of course, if you're actually going to go through the trouble of writing it out by hand, you're probably not plagiarizing either.
But at least it would help to protect your IP.

While no document is signed to the fact, couldn't one argue that the papers are considered IP of the college since they were written at the behest of the college (professor)?

How about requiring movie producers to submit their scripts, to make sure it's not the same old recycled plots and 70s tv shows, with a soundtrack filled with remakes of pop "classics" and thinly disguised rip-offs they hope the audience is too young to catch on to?

Looks like its time to start using copyright laws to our own advantage. I can see a day, sooner rather than later, when each and every paper I write has the following attached to the bottom, similar to what websites already do today:
Copyright 2006 [Insert author's name here]. All rights reserved. No portion of this document may be duplicated, redistributed or manipulated in any form.
Hey, if its good enough for the NBA, NFL, etc for protecting their works then it should suffice for a student paper, right?

Apparently, none of these students have read the IP policy at their school. At least at my University, anything you turn in for a grade becomes the property of the University. By turning it in, you have implicitly waived your intellectual property rights over it anyway. Granted, I don't think that's fair in the first place, but the simple fact is that many of the students don't have any rights to the papers to begin with.

I don't thik this is possible. Copyright laws have strict requirement over what constitutes a copyright transfer and it requires a specific conveyance of the copyrights. So, an agreement made at the beginning of your studies can't possibly convey something that does not exist, nor can a policy possibly be construed as an instrument of conveyance.
What might be possible is that you grant a license to the university that allows the university to do whatever it likes with your papers, but you still own the copyright.
Check out
section 204 of the copuright code [copyright.gov]
Probably the university owns the physical copy of the paper that you turned in, but not the underlying copyrights.

See, the thing is, they are selling this service to other schools and institutions. The service they are selling relies on the IP, and as a result, they are making money off of IP which they acquired from students without their consent. That's the problem.

Sure, they are only using it to check against, but if you (as the student) don't explicitly allow them use of it, they are still profiting from your IP, whether or not they are profiting off of it insofar as selling copies of it.
The bottom line is that schools have to pay for this service, and are paying, in part, to violate their student's IP rights.

Copyrights are NOT like patents.
If you create an "original work of authorship," it is automatically copyrighted without you having to do a thing, and without any checks against previous copyrights.Not to say that there isn't case law covering the student-teacher case, but the basic jist is that the students do automatically have copyrights on whatever original papers they write.

Same for a copyright, if I understand.And you're teaching at the college level? No wonder there's such miseducation and cluelessness about.The moment you write a sentence, take a photo, paint a picture, or create any other kind of copyrightable work, you already own the copyright under law. You created it, it is copyright by you, and if anyone uses it without permission afterward and you can prove that you created it first, you have a court case.Registration of copyright does nothing but offer one way to demonstrate this proof--by registering your newly created item immediately with a government agency, they have a record that as of date X/Y/Z you had already called this thing into existence and claimed it to be yours.More to the point, at the college level a student's work isn't just classwork, but potentially the basis for a career in ideas. It is morally indefensible to force them to cede rights to these ideas before they are prepared to publish on their own accord. It could seriously compromise a career if the clearinghouse was sloppy with security or if it made mistakes in misidentifying plagiarism (for example, even clerical errors--my paper #234533 was reported to be plagiarized, but that's actually because some other kid's paper ended up overwriting mine at #234533 due to a filesystem or programming error). I as graduate student working on a Ph.D. absolutely wouldn't consider attending such an institution.

Why should students be upset about their IP rights when many/most of them aren't at all concerned about the IP rights of their favorite bands?
And yes, it is hypocritical.
