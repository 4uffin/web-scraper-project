Intel Weighed $20 Billion Nvidia Takeover in 2005

from the life-changing-decisions dept.
Intel considered acquiring graphics chip maker Nvidia for up to $20 billion in 2005, a move that could have reshaped the AI industry, according to The New York Times. Then-CEO Paul Otellini pitched the acquisition to Intel's board, recognizing the potential of graphics processors for data center computing. The board rejected the proposal, citing Intel's poor track record with acquisitions and the deal's unprecedented size, the report added. Today, Nvidia dominates the AI chip market with a $3 trillion valuation, while Intel struggles with declining revenue and recent layoffs of 16,000 workers.

Jensen tanked Nvidia twice, had to be bailed out by big pocketed investors. Jensen believed in quadrilaterals as primitives, whereas the industry was going forward with triangles. A former boss from LSI logic, Tom Perkins, gave Nvidia a $20m lifeline. Which they would go on to run through and come up with a design for Sega that they would eventually not use, yet pay $5m for anyways (basically a donation to Nvidia).

Bought pre-iPhone Apple stock or mined a bunch of Bitcoin in the early 2000's....Umm... bitcoin didn't exist in the early 2000's. I believe it came into existence around 2008/2009.
I actually mined Bitcoin, I think I had something like 1.2 BTC back in 2011, then I lost the wallet. It was worth next to nothing at the time. Now it's enough to buy a nice car.
But the better analogy would have been to talk about BlockBuster not buying Netflix back in the day...

We're still in the early 2000s, we've only progressed about 2.4 % of the way to 3000. If you want to say "the 00s" then say "the 00s".
I also mined Bitcoin -- 350 BTC on a CPU, and sold it all for less than 10 cents apiece. Good times!

I'll take your trolling and troll back as follows:
When someone says early 2000s they mean the 00s. I have never seen your version, though you may be technically correct (the best kind of correct), I don't believe you are contextually correct. If we take your interpretation, put into context of the original sentence it was used in, it makes no sense. In context, it's clear the author was referring to decade that was from 2000 to 2009.

Well... Blockbuster and Intel both had very profitable business models that would have concentrated the lion's share of resources, so there's a reasonable probability that the acquired companies could't have developed in the same way we see them now. It is extremely hard for established companies to pivot towards innovative business models. And by innovative I don't mean "let's turn this product into a service and charge a monthly fee", but creating/developing markets that didn't exist before.

NVIDIA has a history of doing something different every time there is competition.
When it was raster performance in games, NVIDIA was in the lead, then AMD showed signs of being competitive, so NVIDIA made ray tracing the focus, then, AMD started to show some competence with ray tracing, so NVIDIA switched direction to AI.
If MI350 or 400 turns out to be competitive when it comes to AI performance, NVIDIA will switch directions again.The Intel board was correct, Intel buys companies like Altera, but then doesn't know what to do with the purchase.

Interesting. At first this sounds like someone who can't handle competition, but it also shows the company has a lot of extra cash to throw into R&D. Then again, it sounds like they lack focus — I'd rather invest in a company that does one thing well and continues to do so in the future.
This also reminds me of an earlier post
[slashdot.org] on the different strategies of Nvidia vs. AMD. I think it partly explains why hobbyists prefer AMD: they get more raw compute per dollar, and they aren't afraid to get the

It's interesting to speculate about, but too far back in the timeline to say how things would be today.
It certainly would *not* be the case that everything else would played out the same - NVidia's increasing dominance in GPUs, then becoming the de-facto for machine learning (CUDA's first stable release wasn't until 2007), then the bedrock of current AI stuff, leading to a $3T market cap - but just with Intel as the owner.
Mergers and Acquisitions simply don't work that way.

Never. If anything, Nvidia will come up with its own ARM processor for windows and kill Intel outright. At that point, NVDA might buy intel's foundry, but there is absolutely no indication that NVDA is interested in operating a foundry because it will still be hard to compete with TSMC.
