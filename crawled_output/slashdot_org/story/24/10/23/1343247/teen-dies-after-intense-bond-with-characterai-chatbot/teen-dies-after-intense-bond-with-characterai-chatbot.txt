Teen Dies After Intense Bond with Character.AI Chatbot

from the breaking-news dept.
A Florida teenager who formed a deep emotional bond with an AI chatbot took his own life after months of intense daily interactions on Character.AI, a leading AI companion platform. Sewell Setzer III, 14, exchanged his final messages with "Dany," an AI character based on a Game of Thrones figure, before dying by suicide on February 28. His mother, The New York Times reports, plans to file a lawsuit against Character.AI, alleging the platform's "dangerous and untested" technology led to his death.
Character.AI, valued at $1 billion and claiming 20 million users, in response said it would implement new safety features for minors, including time limits and expanded trigger warnings for self-harm discussions. The company's head of trust and safety Jerry Ruoti said they "take user safety very seriously."

Do you know how many real non AI sick fuckers troll Discord pretending to be teens looking for vulnerable teens to convince them to join suicide pacs? This article is so poorly written it fails to, in any way, establish complicity on the part of the LLM. Where is the evidence that the LLM encouraged suicide? Where is the evidence that this suicide was preventable? What attempts did the parents make to limit access to a child who is at a very highly influential age of development?13,14,15 are practically imprinting years of young adult development. Influences at this age are more damaging than practically any other age of ones adult lifetime. If your kid is a recluse at 13, 14, 15 you need to try to get your kid involved in more after school activities or clubs. It doesn't really matter if its e-sports, role-playing, board-game, archerty, church youth group, or whatever. Having teammates and feeling like you are part of a team with real humans you interact with and can physically see goes a long way toward not feeling isolate.
Living in isolation will lead to either suicide, alcoholism, or drug abuse.This article explains nothing of what steps happened, what signs were present, anything. Thats trying to scrape the article from behind a paywall.
Had this been another teen victim of the suck fucks trolling Discord would the NYT even have printed the article? Journalistic irresponsibility. No way I am paying for this level of poor journalism.

While I'm normally fine with criticizing modern parenting techniques, in this case I'm far more hesitant because people can be really good at hiding their depression.
And even though I've been through numerous episodes of depression, I don't know that I would be able to spot it in a teenager who was going out of their way to hide it, especially since teenagers are often moody and distant even when they're not depressed.

Sure.
But at the same time if your tween is in front of a computer 24x7 instead of going out with friends, socialising with the family, etc... you know. You may not catch it as depression, but you should notice something.That they're trying to blame a third party shows they know and won't accept responsibility.

The level at which their lives are intertwined with their phones and social media is absurd.
My 18 year ild told me they would never ever ever take away their kids phone because they see it as being too severe of a punishment...

I'm in the same boat, hell I even rifled through my kids phone and found some conversations about suicide between them and another kid online that lives hundreds of kms away from

I'm glad I did because it lead to me calling the local police for the other kid for a welfare check to make sure their parents were aware of the situation as well.

Re: the cop's response.Absolutely.
I've had some cop friends express similar feelings about interrupting teens having sex in parked cars.
"I'd rather ruin their night than have someone tell me the next day I didn't stop a sexual assault".Even asshole cops want to be seen as heroes, so generally things like that are almost universal.

is not forming emotional bonds with fucking machines.However depressed this teen was, he knew he was talking to a machine, and the machine made him more depressed. That would not have happened if the teen kept in mind at all time, whenever he interacted with that machine, that he's really talking to a dystopian for-profit trying to profit from his emotions.The educational system needs to give our kids the tools needed to distance themselves from dystopia.

So many parents blaming the world nowadays for not taking care of their child when they couldn't be bothered to be a parent themselves.
I wonder if that's the case here?If your kid is doing something that's obviously unhealthy (physically or mentally) and you just let it continue and escalate until something tragic happens, you're not being a responsible parent.
In that case, the world should not be held accountable for your lack of responsible behavior.

In that case, the world should not be held accountable for your lack of responsible behavior.This isn't a new thing. Before the interwebs, parents who didn't want to take responsibility for their kids blamed video games, rock and/or roll music, movies, communists, hamsters, comic books, satan, et al. Always an excuse to claim it wasn't their fault. The internet was the get out of jail free card of the last generation of parents. I guess it's AI's turn now.
In my experience, it seems the more pious the parents, the faster the excuses come when something goes wrong with their kids. Most of the kids

so the parents failed at properly educating their kid and allowed them full access to the internet at the age of 14.
