Mickey's Copyright Adventure: Early Disney Creation Will Soon Be Public Property

from the copyright-war dept.
The version of the iconic character from "Steamboat Willie" will enter the public domain in 2024. But those trying to take advantage could end up in a legal mousetrap. From a report: There is nothing soft and cuddly about the way Disney protects the characters it brings to life. This is a company that once forced a Florida day care center to remove an unauthorized Minnie Mouse mural. In 2006, Disney told a stonemason that carving Winnie the Pooh into a child's gravestone would violate its copyright. The company pushed so hard for an extension of copyright protections in 1998 that the result was derisively nicknamed the Mickey Mouse Protection Act. For the first time, however, one of Disney's marquee characters -- Mickey himself -- is set to enter the public domain.
"Steamboat Willie," the 1928 short film that introduced Mickey to the world, will lose copyright protection in the United States and a few other countries at the end of next year, prompting fans, copyright experts and potential Mickey grabbers to wonder: How is the notoriously litigious Disney going to respond? "I'm seeing in Reddit forums and on Twitter where people -- creative types -- are getting excited about the possibilities, that somehow it's going to be open season on Mickey," said Aaron J. Moss, a partner at Greenberg Glusker in Los Angeles who specializes in copyright and trademark law. "But that is a misunderstanding of what is happening with the copyright." The matter is more complicated than it appears, and those who try to capitalize on the expiring "Steamboat Willie" copyright could easily end up in a legal mousetrap. "The question is where Disney tries to draw the line on enforcement," Mr. Moss said, "and if courts get involved to draw that line judicially."
Only one copyright is expiring. It covers the original version of Mickey Mouse as seen in "Steamboat Willie," an eight-minute short with little plot. This nonspeaking Mickey has a rat-like nose, rudimentary eyes (no pupils) and a long tail. He can be naughty. In one "Steamboat Willie" scene, he torments a cat. In another, he uses a terrified goose as a trombone. Later versions of the character remain protected by copyrights, including the sweeter, rounder Mickey with red shorts and white gloves most familiar to audiences today. They will enter the public domain at different points over the coming decades. "Disney has regularly modernized the character, not necessarily as a program of copyright management, at least initially, but to keep up with the times," said Jane C. Ginsburg, an authority on intellectual property law who teaches at Columbia University.

Not in three days (and they publicly announced, a couple of years back, that they wouldn't be asking for any more extensions anyway.) And Congress isn't in session right now. So, no, they won't be.Perhaps their attorneys realized that regardless of copyright status, the character is still covered by trademarks, which do not expire except through non-use.

I'm not actually all that surprised.
The constitution clearly says that copyrights are to last for a limited duration - and while the 100 year mark is largely a psychological barrier, it's *really* hard to sell a duration over a century as meaningfully "limited".Combine that with a public that has become increasingly hostile to copyright excesses since public internet access put citizens doing in more direct confrontation with an overbearing law... and I imagine the political capital needed to pass a further extension would be a LOT more expensive than it was back when the law only really affected professional counterfeiters, and bootleggers selling copies out of the back of their van.And the trademark thing - which strikes me as a completely bullshit end-run around the limits of copyright that we need to address. Trademarks are supposed to protect the integrity of a brand - you could argue that the "mickey mouse head shadow" logo has indeed been used as a trademark - but the character itself?
No.
And definitely not, e.g., the Marvel Universe characters and many others.

The time range needs to be less than the working period of an average person.
From beginning of adulthood to acceptable retirement age, then divide that by two or three.
If your book did really well the first twenty years after you published it, then hopefully you saved well.

The opinion of the Supreme Court in Eldred v. Ashcroft was that "harmonization" to the copyright term of a substantial foreign market for U.S.-produced works to prevent rule of the shorter term from causing practical problems is an acceptable excuse for a term extension, distinguishing it from "legislative misbehavior" of repeated extensions primarily to circumvent the constitutional "limited times" restriction. Timothy B. Lee reported five years ago that Hollywood studios weren't interested in trying to push a third successive extension. [arstechnica.com]I see at least four obstacles to a Chaz Bono Act:1. Proponents of an extension might have trouble avoiding legislative misbehavior when drafting a bill. The only trading partner I can think of with a longer copyright term to which to "harmonize" is Mexico, and most U.S. political capital related to Mexico may have been spent on the 2018 renegotiation of NAFTA [wikipedia.org].2. Defenders of the public domain have shown since the SOPA debate in 2012 that they are capable of organizing opposition.3. Lee's article states that the Authors Guild appears willing to fight Disney on this.4. The Republican Party controls the House of Representatives as of a week from yesterday, and members of the Republican caucus have shown interest in repealing the 1998 extension. Some reports call Senator Josh Hawley's Copyright Clause Restoration Act bill a way of punishing Disney for its opposition to Florida's "don't say gay" Parental Rights in Education Act.

TFA addresses this.
After the MMPA, this would be extremely difficult push politically.
Reading between the lines, it looks like they are laying the groundwork to be able to defend the character designs as Disney Trademarks.
That would allow public distribution and use of the original film, but new works containing characters substantially resembling the original would be a Trademark violation.
I can't recall this ever being used or litigated, so it's new legal ground and a court will have to draw a line on it.IANAL, but if I had to guess, the court will end up threading a needle where you can watch or distribute all or a portion of the original work, i.e. your characters can watch Steamboat on their TV inside their film, but you won't be able to create new animations substantially resembling the trademark of the original character.
Whatever lawyer thought that up needs to get a gold star for cleverness.
(To be clear, I'm not defending Disney. I feel the current copyright term is far too long.
I respect that it's a clever legal strategy, not an ethical one.)

This has been litigated extensively, culminating in Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. et al., 540 US 806 (2003)
[publicdomainsherpa.com], decided by the US Supreme Court.
The circuit court and appeals court both sided with Fox, agreeing that Dastar had somehow infringed on Fox's rights by not crediting Fox.
The Supreme Court intervened, and slapped them down.
The usual quote from the ruling is:Assuming for the sake of argument that Dastar's representation of itself as the "Producer" of its videos amounted to a representation that it originated the creative work conveyed by the videos, allowing a cause of action under section 43(a) for that representation would create a species of mutant copyright law that limits the public's federal right to copy and to use, expired copyrights.Followed by:A statutory interpretation that renders another statute superfluous is of course to be avoided.Basically, because copyright law exists and is distinct from trademark law, its t

Disney cannot use trademark law to perpetuate their copyright unless the image falsely claims to be authorized by Disney.

Since it is a frame of Steamboat Willy and Steamboat Willy (the film) will be in the public domain you would be ok to use it on a t-shirt. You would probably run into trouble though if you tried to sell a t-shirt with your own drawing of Steamboat Willy on a t-shirt (assuming Disney bothers to protect their trademark on Steamboat Willy).I suspect Disney does not have a separate trademark on the lead character in Steamboat Willie, as distinct from Mickey Mouse.If I were to take a still from the Steamboat Willie film and clean it up to make a nicer, but still recognizable, image for a T-shirt, the image would still be in the public domain.
If I were to alter it significantly I might be able to get my own copyright on the resulting image.
It would be derivative of Steamboat Willie, but it would have a stand-alone copyright since it would be

Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox

I doubt it. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Kellogg v. Nabisco, 305 U.S. 111 (1938), that a trademark cannot be used to extend the effective term of exclusive rights in an expired patent. It applied similar logic to copyright in Dastar v. Twentieth Century Fox, 539 U.S. 23 (2003). The exclusive right to prepare and distribute derivative works of Steamboat Willie and Plane Crazy is one of the exclusive rights set to expire in just over a year. When it expires, under the logic of Kellogg and D

Emphasis mine.
You absolutely *CAN* create derivative works of it, as long as they do not feature that character.
You could create an otherwise identical cartoon featuring a different titular character where the resulting work could as obviously a Steamboat Willie derivative as you wished, but because you are not reusing the Mickey Mouse character, you'd be in the clear.

According to Ars Technica/Timothy B. Lee you can definitely create and sell a Steamboat Willie toy if the Mickey represented looks like Steamboat Willie. Wait a year and you can give the toy white gloves.

Agreed, with a nuance: there is no international trademark protection. I wonder if there are countries where Disney did not register Mickey Mouse.

In 2006, Disney told a stonemason that carving Winnie the Pooh into a child's gravestone would violate its copyright. How incredibly douchey can you be?
I'm glad to see they backed down on that one;
