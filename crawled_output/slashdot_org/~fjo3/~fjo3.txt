Stories like this, and many others, make me hope that even though the planet is going to get *VERY* uncomfortable, human ingenuity will ultimately mitigate the worst effects of this self-created problem. If you poke your head above the constant doom and gloom, there are positive stories. It's early days, but projects to regreen the planet are taking off - and succeeding. While the CCP spraypaint dead weeds and rocks green https://www.youtube.com/watch?... other groups, including NGOs, charities, and of course the locals themselves, are doing amazing work. All you have to do is search. I am not here to endorse any particular group, but there are reputable organizations with years of effective work you can donate to. I can only fit so many trees in my back yard (currently at 10)

No Child Left Behind. It's not going to fix everything, but it would be a start. Of course abolishing it would mean passing legislation - and that is not something Congress can do more than once or twice each year, so I do not see it happening any time...ever.

An anonymous reader writes: The reporter had been left both fascinated and disturbed by the internet’s reaction not only to the apparent suicide video in 2021, but also another that had gone viral, alleged to be of Monic, who had moved to Dubai in search of a better life.This video was deeply graphic – it showed a man defecating in a woman’s mouth – and went viral on TikTok in 2021. Monic was attributed as the female involved, however this has never been verified.

fjo3 writes: Tech billionaire Mark Zuckerberg was humiliated onstage not once, but twice, as his attempts to showcase the brilliance of Meta’s new AI-powered glasses were met with dismal failure.Speaking at the company’s annual Meta Connect conference, Zuckerberg introduced the company’s second-generation smart Ray-Bans and a new neural wristband, as part of his vision for an AI that serves people in real-time.Business Insider reported the vision unraveled when the AI glitched moments after the request, ignoring basic instructions and insisting that the employee had “already combined these ingredients.”

fjo3 writes: A new MIT study titled, Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task, has found that using ChatGPT to help write essays leads to long-term cognitive harm—measurable through EEG brain scans. Students who repeatedly relied on ChatGPT showed weakened neural connectivity, impaired memory recall, and diminished sense of ownership over their own writing. While the AI-generated content often scored well, the brains behind it were shutting down.
