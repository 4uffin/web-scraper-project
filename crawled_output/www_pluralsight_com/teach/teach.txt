Frequently asked questions
What does it take to become an excellent author?
Our Authors are incredible storytellers driven by their passion for technology. They blend their knowledge and enthusiasm to communicate concepts and demonstrate tasks in a compelling way that helps people learn. These qualities make our Authors some of the best in the industry.
Who will view my content?
Our platform reaches more than one million learners and 9,500 companies in over 150 countries. Some learners are getting their feet wet, others are looking to make a change, and some want to expand their horizons and opportunities. Our goal: Make the best professional education available to them all.
How do new authors get started?
One of our Author Community Managers will guide you in creating a short audition video using our audition kit. This video helps us evaluate your energy and teaching prowess. No additional hardware or software is required.
How long does it take to create a video course?
The amount of time it takes to create your course depends on its length and what you can commit to each week. As you continue authoring for Pluralsight, the course creation process will get faster. For your first project, your Author Community Manager will work with you to give you some flexibility and set expectations.
How are authors compensated for video courses?
Video course compensation is partially based on viewership within the platform. We pay viewership payments on a quarterly basis.
How long does it take to deliver an assessment?
From start to finish, an assessment takes three months to produce. We break production into three phases:
Blueprinting: Mapping out the assessment outline, which usually takes less than 2 weeks
Question writing: Drafting questions for the assessment, which requires 4 – 6 weeks
Reviewing: Vetting the quality of the assessment, which is a 1 – 2 week process
You can work on one phase or all of them depending on your time and interest. We can work with your schedule to find the best fit.
What is written content?
We offer learners a continually growing library of resources for just-in-time learning. Guides are text-based, written content. You can find examples here: www.pluralsight.com/guides/introduction-to-guides.
What kind of support does Pluralsight provide?
We have a team ready to help you through each step of the authoring process.
Author Community Managers guide you through your audition and will help you stay engaged during your time as an author.
Project Coordinators are your go-to resource as you create content.
Content Producers help during production and editing.
Peer reviewers—who are fellow Authors and experts—review your content for technical accuracy.
