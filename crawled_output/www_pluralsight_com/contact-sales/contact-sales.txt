What our customers are saying
“As a bank, we have a commitment to ensure that we have the right skills and competencies to become a truly digital organization.”
Helen Tippell
IB Technology Chief Architect and CTO, Deutsche Bank
“This really has changed the game, in terms of the way we view the delivery of technology and how we can work with our business users to try these ideas and then move forward.”
Terry Learmouth
EMEA CIO, Nomura
"We started streamlining so there’s more time for developers to actually focus on their task. The biggest surprise was the change in coding days—it jumped from 2.3 to 3 almost immediately.”
Abesh Rajasekharan
Director of Technology, Thomson Reuters
