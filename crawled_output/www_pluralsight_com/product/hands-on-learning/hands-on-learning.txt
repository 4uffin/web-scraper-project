Learn through practice and application
Every tech leader should be able to feel confident in their team's ability to execute successful solutions for critical initiatives now and in the future—and it's hard to trust in your team's future skills without having made an ongoing commitment to skill development.
Pluralsight offers unique, hands-on learning experiences that allow learners to build their knowledge and practice applying it before bringing it into a professional setting.
Strengthen skills with these four hands-on modalities
Labs
Provide learners with a safe, provisioned environment where they can develop and test skills without the risk. By completing tasks similar to common ones tech teams tackle every day, your team members can get comfortable applying their skills in real-world scenarios and get feedback that helps them improve.
Explore labs
Sandboxes
Provide learners with secure sandboxes where they can deepen their skills through more advanced, independent practice. With no limitations to what they can explore, your team can practice completing tasks just like the ones they'll be tackling on the job.
Explore AI sandboxes
Hands-on learning
Learners can experience real-world scenarios and get valuable guidance to help them apply new skills in their local environment. Projects include automated validation and customized error messages of work done in their local environment so they can easily identify and correct mistakes before they matter.
Explore projects
Interactive instructor-led courses
Empower learners to take skill development into their own hands with experiences that include hands-on coding challenges and guided feedback. Learners start by watching a video to learn a concept, then test their knowledge through a series of challenges in a browser environment.
