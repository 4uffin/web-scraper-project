This is not a test
This is the future of skill development. Quantify your expertise. Advance toward mastery. Celebrate your progress. Skill IQ doesn’t just give you a score, it establishes where you stand on that skill’s learning path, then gives you a clear trajectory to the proficiency you need.

Take skill assessments for a test drive, no strings attached. (We won’t even be pestering you from the passenger seat.) All you’ll need is your email address.
Take assessment
See where your skills stand. Our assessments are adaptive, adjusting the difficulty as you go. The assessment should take you about 10 minutes.
Receive Skill IQ
Get your Skill IQ following your assessment. Skill IQ measures your proficiency compared to your peers who have taken the same assessment. As a bonus, get free access to 50 courses to kick-start your skill development.
