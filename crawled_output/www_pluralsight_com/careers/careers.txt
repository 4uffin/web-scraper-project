How we hire
Jobs
Brilliance is everywhere, but opportunity is not
Our solutions narrow that brilliance vs. opportunity gap by empowering teams to build better and technologists to dream bigger. (Can we get a fist bump?)
Over the past twenty years, we’ve transformed the tech skill development space, forever changing the way individuals and companies approach the ever-evolving need to learn more and innovate better. And we’re not stopping there. We’ve set our sights on new competitive landscapes and solutions that meet customer needs in bold, groundbreaking ways. We’re on a mission to inspire and empower the technology workforce to achieve their goals—and that motivates us on the daily.
Sounds good, right?

Your brilliance + our opportunity = Unparalleled innovation
Our culture of autonomy, continuous learning, and collaboration creates an environment for growth and empowers us to drive impact through innovation.
If you're all about seeking new skills, pairing data with creativity, and owning your outcomes, you’ve come to the right (work)place.
Learning & Upskilling
Where potential meets opportunity
Learning and development are kind of a big deal here—and not just because upskilling is our specialty. Whether you’re new in your career or a seasoned domain expert, here you'll hone your craft, build new skills and connections, and grow professionally and personally.
56% of team members had an upward or lateral change in the last 18 months.
Level up with mentorship programs, protected learning time, and dedicated career weeks.
People & Culture
Where individuality meets belonging
We want what makes you, you. Diverse perspectives make our team stronger and elevate our work. We foster a collaborative environment where we act as one team to support each other and work together to achieve our goals.
“Fellow team members” consistently ranks at the top for why people love working here.
We’re mission-driven, stick to our culture pillars, and champion our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs).
Autonomy & Impact
Where ownership meets excellence
Here, we're not just about projects. We're about impactful work. We expect every team member to strive to make a difference. So, we hire great people, give them the autonomy to do what they do best, and empower them to own their outcomes.
9 out of 10 team members say that their leaders empower them to take initiative.
Co-creation, flexible schedules, and clear deliverables empower you to own your outcomes.
Why applying should be top on your to-do list
We’re a proven, high-growth company with a globally distributed, remote-friendly team. With offices in the US, Ireland, Australia, and India and team members around the world, collaborating across borders is in our DNA. So is adaptability, kindness, and embracing diverse viewpoints and experiences. We strive to ensure everyone feels welcome—and it shows.
We think you’ll love it too.

Our culture pillars
These aren't just pretty words to post on the office wall. This is who we are.
As Pluralsight evolves, our culture evolves with us. These culture pillars are our guideposts as we make crucial business decisions, collaborate with one another and resolve impasses. As we commit to these pillars, we commit to ourselves and each other to build a better future for Pluralsight and our customers.
Customer Obsessed
We understand our customers' needs, analyze market trends and competitors, and aim to exceed expectations to deliver exceptional value. Our commitment to customer satisfaction is the cornerstone of our success.
Aligned and Focused
We focus on quality execution of our strategic priorities, using our programs to stay coordinated and drive results. By setting aside lower-priority tasks, we ensure we follow through on our commitments.
Always Learning
We continuously improve our operations, expertise, and customer impact. We learn by studying both inside and outside the company, reviewing KPIs and data, reflecting on past experiences, and respectfully challenging each other.
Direct and Respectful
We provide honest, actionable, real-time feedback and hold each other accountable to deliver on our commitments in a constructive manner.

places to work, it never gets old.
