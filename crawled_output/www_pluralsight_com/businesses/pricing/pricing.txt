A few frequently asked questions
Will I be charged now for a free trial?
You won’t be charged at this time, but a $1 USD hold will be issued. So, you may see a charge of $1 on your account—don’t worry, it will be reversed. After your trial ends, this info will help create your account, so you can continue to build new skills with uninterrupted access to the platform.
How does a Pluralsight plan work?
It's simple. After signing up, you'll immediately have unlimited viewing of thousands of expert courses, paths to guide your learning, tools to measure your skills, and hands-on resources like exercise files. The learning is endless, but you can cancel anytime.
Can I cancel anytime?
Of course. Your subscription will auto-renew until you cancel.
What are Pluralsight business plans?
Businesses of all sizes—from small shops to large enterprises—measure skills and track progress with plans specifically designed for their needs. In addition to all the features in our personal plans, business plans include easy group management, in-depth reporting on usage and skills growth, SSO, and more.
How long is my personal free trial?
When you sign up for a personal trial, you receive 10 days and 200 minutes of viewing. If your trial isn’t canceled within the 10 days, your trial will convert to a paid plan and auto-renew until canceled.
See more free trial info
Does my free trial include labs and sandboxes?
Unfortunately, free trials exclude popular lab and sandbox features. Sign up for a paid plan today if you want access to our hands-on labs and sandboxes to practice and refine your new skills.
