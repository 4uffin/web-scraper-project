Public sector organizations that trust Pluralsight
Solution
Upskilling and reskilling
Digital transformation starts with skills transformation. Pluralsight helps your agency index skills gaps and follow custom learning paths tailored to ensure you can meet your IT objectives around AI, cybersecurity, cloud, data, and more.
Solution
Cybersecurity
Develop the best defense by developing your people first. Prepare civilian and military personnel with cybersecurity and risk management skills to ensure flawless security and prevent breaches. And meet growing cybersecurity needs as you modernize and meet the pace of digital transformation—and tackle technology-driven mission objectives in the process.
National Cyber Security Action Plan
Give your teams the tech skills that protect critical infrastructure and support Canada’s cybersecurity by adhering to the National Cyber Security Action Plan.
Canadian Cyber Security Skills Framework
Pluralsight serves as the technical learning resource for agency personnel, providing education that supports the Canadian Cyber Security Skills Framework.
Solution
Generative AI
Enable your agency's tech team to build real-world expertise with expert-led GenAI content that covers everything from conversational literacy and prompt engineering to developing next-generation data products. Then use your team’s new skills to integrate GenAI models into agency processes for increased productivity, automation of repetitive tasks, and improved decision-making.
Solution
Cloud transformation
Give your agency the fastest, easiest way to build and maintain a cloud-first organization with data on where to focus skill development plus hands-on experiences that put knowledge into practice. Plus, your teams get the preparation they need to pass cloud certification exams, learn new frameworks, and help your agency run faster, cheaper, smarter, and more secure in the cloud.
Solution
Data
Empower your civilian and military personnel with the data skills they need to support the DND/CAF Data Governance Framework and 2023 – 2026 Data Strategy Roadmap for the Federal Public Service. They can use Pluralsight courses to learn the latest data analysis and visualization skills from experts with real-world experience in topics such as big data, cloud, mobile, and Internet of Things (IoT).
Solution
Tech fluency
Pluralsight enables every Canadian government employee, regardless of technical background, to become conversant in key technologies and learn to correctly apply tech concepts for agency objectives.
