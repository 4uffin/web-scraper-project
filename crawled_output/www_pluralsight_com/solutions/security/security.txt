Build specialized cybersecurity skills with a role-based framework
Our security role framework consolidates 25 NICE Framework roles into 16 roles, including SOC analyst, threat hunter, incident responder, pen tester, and red team operator. Use our framework to develop a solid foundation of fundamental security skills with hands-on learning experiences and projects. Or dive deeper into specific roles with a skill-centric curriculum that includes core and complementary skills, product and tool skills, relevant certification prep, and advanced persistent training.
