Instructions for nominators[edit]
ShortcutWP:DYKNOMWP:DYKNOM
If this is your first nomination, please read the DYK rules before continuing. Further information can be found at the DYK guidelines.
Nominate an article
Frequently asked questions[edit]
How do I write an interesting hook?
Successful hooks tend to have several traits. Most importantly, they share a surprising or intriguing fact. They give readers enough context to understand the hook, but leave enough out to make them want to learn more. They are written for a general audience who has no prior knowledge of or interest in the topic area. Lastly, they are concise, and do not attempt to cover multiple facts or present information about the subject beyond what's needed to understand the hook.
When will my nomination be reviewed?
This page is often backlogged. As long as your submission is still on the page, it will stay there until an editor reviews it. Since editors are encouraged to review the oldest submissions first, it may take several weeks until your submission is reviewed. In the meantime, please consider reviewing another submission (not your own) to help reduce the backlog (see instructions below). Because of WP:DYKTIMEOUT, a nomination should be reviewed within two months since the reviewer/promoter may agree to reject and close an unpromoted hook after that time has passed.
Where is my hook?
If you can't find the nomination you submitted to this nominations page, it may have been approved and is on the approved nominations page waiting to be promoted. It could also have been added to one of the prep areas,
promoted from prep to a queue, or is on the main page.
If the nominated hook is in none of those places, then the nomination has probably been rejected. Such a rejection usually only occurs if it was at least a couple of weeks old and had unresolved issues for which any discussion had gone stale. If you think your nomination was unfairly rejected, you can query this on the DYK discussion page or with the closer, but as a general rule such nominations will only be restored in exceptional circumstances. If your nomination was promoted, but it hasn't reached the main page after two weeks, you can also query this on the DYK discussion page.
Instructions for reviewers[edit]
Main page: Wikipedia:Did you know/Reviewer instructions
Any editor who was not involved in writing/expanding or nominating an article may review it by checking to see that the article meets all the DYK criteria (long enough, new enough, no serious editorial or content issues) and the hook is cited. Editors may also alter the suggested hook to improve it, suggest new hooks, or even lend a hand and make edits to the article to which the hook applies so that the hook is supported and accurate. For more information on the DYK rules and review processes, see the DYK guidelines and the reviewer instructions.
To post a comment or review on a DYK nomination, follow the steps outlined below:
Look through this page, Template talk:Did you know, to find a nomination you would like to comment on.
Click the "Review or comment" link at the top of the nomination. You will be taken to the nomination subpage.
The top of the page includes a list of the DYK criteria. Check the article to ensure it meets all the relevant criteria.
To indicate the result of the review (i.e., whether the nomination passes, fails, or needs some minor changes), leave a signed comment on the page. Please begin with one of the 5 review symbols that appear at the top of the edit screen, and then indicate all aspects of the article that you have reviewed; your comment should look something like the following:Article length and age are fine, no copyvio or plagiarism concerns, reliable sources are used. But the hook needs to be shortened.
If you are the first person to comment on the nomination, there will be a line :* <!-- REPLACE THIS LINE TO WRITE FIRST COMMENT, KEEPING
:*
--> showing you where you should put the comment.
Save the page.
After the nomination is approved, a bot will automatically list the nomination page on Template talk:Did you know/Approved.
If there is any problem or concern about a nomination, please consider notifying the nominator by placing {{subst:DYKproblem|Article|header=yes|sig=yes}} on the nominator's talk page.
Advanced procedures[edit]
How to promote an accepted hook[edit]
At-a-glance instructions on how to promote an approved hook to a prep area
See Wikipedia:Did you know/Preparation areas for details on verifying a hook's acceptability.
Promoters should not promote their own nomination or their own review.
When promoting hooks intended for a particular date, keep in mind that when the number of available approved nominations exceeds 120 we switch to two sets per day, and when that number drops below 60 we return to one set per day.
Check list for nomination review completeness
Select a hook from the approved nominations page that has one of these ticks at the bottom post:
.
Check to make sure basic review requirements were completed.
Any outstanding issue following
needs to be addressed before promoting.
Check the article history for any substantive changes since it was nominated or reviewed.
Images for the lead slot must be freely licensed. Fair-use images are not permitted. Images loaded on Commons that appear on the Main Page are automatically protected by KrinkleBot.
Hook must be stated in both the article and source (which must be cited at the end of the article sentence where stated).
Hook should make sense grammatically.
Try to vary subject matters within each prep area.
Try to select a funny, quirky or otherwise upbeat hook for the last or bottom hook in the set.
Steps to add a hook to prep
In one tab, open the nomination page of the hook you want to promote.
In a second tab, open the prep set you intend to add the hook to.
Wanna skip all this fuss? Install WP:PSHAW instead! Does most of the heavy lifting for ya :)
For hooks held for specific dates, refer to "Local update times" section on
DYK Queue.
Completed Prep area number sets will be promoted by an administrator to corresponding Queue number.
Copy and paste the hook into a chosen slot.
Make sure there's a space between ... and that, and a ? at the end.
Check that there's a bold link to the article.
If it's the lead (first) hook, paste the image where indicated at the top of the template.
Copy and paste ALL the credit information (the {{DYKmake}} and {{DYKnom}} templates) at the bottom
Check your work in the prep's Preview mode.
At the bottom under "Credits", to the right of each article should have the link "View nom subpage" ; if not, a subpage parameter will need to be added to the DYKmake.
Save the Prep page.
Closing the DYK nomination page
At the upper left
Change {{DYKsubpage to {{subst:DYKsubpage
Change |passed= to |passed=yes
At the bottom
Just above the line containing }}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line. Place comments above this line.-->
insert a new, separate line containing one of the following:
To [[TM:DYK/P1|Prep 1]]
To [[TM:DYK/P2|Prep 2]]
To [[TM:DYK/P3|Prep 3]]
To [[TM:DYK/P4|Prep 4]]
To [[TM:DYK/P5|Prep 5]]
To [[TM:DYK/P6|Prep 6]]
To [[TM:DYK/P7|Prep 7]]
Also paste the same thing into the edit summary.
Check in Preview mode. Make sure everything is against a pale blue background (nothing outside) and there are no stray characters, like }}, at the top or bottom.
Save.
For more information, please see T:TDYK#How to promote an accepted hook.

How to remove a rejected nomination[edit]
Open the DYK nomination subpage of the nomination you would like to remove.
In the window where the DYK nomination subpage is open, replace the line {{DYKsubpage with {{subst:DYKsubpage, and replace |passed= with |passed=no. Then save the page. This has the effect of wrapping up the discussion on the DYK nomination subpage in a blue archive box and stating that the nomination was unsuccessful, as well as adding the nomination to a category for archival purposes.
Alternatively, you can use PSHAW, which automates the process.
How to remove a hook from the prep areas or queue[edit]
Edit the prep area or queue where the hook is and remove the hook and the credits associated with it.
Go to the hook's nomination subpage (there should have been a link to it in the credits section).
View the edit history for that page
Go back to the last version before the edit where the hook was promoted, and revert to that version to make the nomination active again.
Add a new icon on the nomination subpage to cancel the previous tick and leave a comment after it explaining that the hook was removed from the prep area or queue, and why, so that later reviewers are aware of this issue.
Add a transclusion of the template back to this page so that reviewers can see it. It goes under the date that it was first created/expanded/listed as a GA. You may need to add back the day header for that date if it had been removed from this page.
If you removed the hook from a queue, it is best to either replace it with another hook from one of the prep areas, or to leave a message at WT:DYK asking someone else to do so.
How to move a nomination subpage to a new name[edit]
Don't; it should not ever be necessary, and will break some links which will later need to be repaired. Even if you change the title of the article, you don't need to move the nomination page.

... that an oil-rig trailer was used to help build a Texas TV station? (nom)
I don't know what an oil-rig trailer is (I can guess, but I wouldn't put my house on it) and it's not explained in the article either. Black Kite (talk) 12:31, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

and Premeditated Chaos:.--Launchballer 12:47, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Per Launchballer, I approved it as something that we probably thinking. Maybe, let's ask @Sammi Brie: to probably put a brief explanation of it on the sentence on the article, maybe not in the hook itself as it is part of the "hooky" part Warm Regards, Miminity (Talk?) (me contribs) 13:04, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I personally thought the hook was self-evident. Even if you don't know exactly what an oil-rig trailer is (and I had to look it up just now to see what one looks like), just seeing that something oil-related was involved was enough to raise curiosity. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 13:06, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Well yes, but if you then go to the article to find out what it is, you'll be disappointed. So I think Miminity's suggestion that the article has an explanatory sentence is a good idea. Black Kite (talk) 13:12, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
If the average people don't get it and it needs to be explained, I'm going to suggest it's not WP:DYKINT and should be pulled. TarnishedPathtalk 15:55, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I don't know what it is and looking it up is providing... inconsistent information. If it's an actually consistent thing, is it notable? If not, is it covered in some page we have on trucks or trailers we can link to? CMD (talk) 16:14, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I was going right off the source: With both the equipment and the fork lift at the bottom of the hill. Terry had to come up with something to transport them up the hill. That turned out to be an oll rig trailer and winch. But you're right that this is very unusual wording. Can this be salvaged with something new or rewording?

ALT1b ... that when Boating Party (pictured) was declared a national treasure of France, a €43 million donation by LVMH enabled the French Republic to buy it?
I reckon that the word national should be lower case when embedded in this sentence so, with that proviso and the currency being Euro, the ALT1b hook is ok.
I looked at the pictures.
File:Lyon 1er - Musée des Beaux-Arts - Salle 229 - Partie de bateau (Gustave Caillebotte).jpg is higher resolution and has more metadata showing its provenance.
It seems brighter and, to my eye, this seems more consistent with other coverage such as this.
I have amended the article to use that file as DYK should be consistent with the article's choice.
Fox News doesn't seem a suitable source for a French fine arts topic but, with the change of currency to Euro, it's not so relevant now.
All outstanding issues seem to have been addressed so we're good to go.

user:Andrew Davidson, my only qualm with the higher resolution file is the brown strip across the top. I am wondering if we could get a better file somewhere.

I came here to move this forward, but I'm not sure what the issue is here. Is it just about the image? If the image is an issue, the hook could run without it.

this and the image. I am going to visit the AIC on August 7 for a lecture on the painter of this image. I have requested that Canon send me a very fast prime lens (I am a member of Canon Professional Services which entitles me to request that they send me almost any piece of equipment to evaluate once for 10 days) to improve the image. They are going to ship (probably overnight) the lens next Monday. Currently, we have the low res image, high res with a band and cropped high res. I hope to get really good image. This is a really great picture slot hook. The main page viewers like high art. I'm pretty sure the hook will get 10k plus views in the picture slot, given my history with high art.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 12:53, 31 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I replied to you with a diff with an edit summary adding a second article. So obviously a second article needs to be reviewed. I do also think this article would be served by a better pic and am going to an event at the Art Institute of Chicago today to try to take one.

UPDATE I did attend a lecture today at the Art Institute of Chicago. I also took my camera and got photos of 4 subjects, including Boating Party. The other three subjects are the three subjects that are in the Art Institute app 12-stop Essentials Tour that did not have any articles on WP before my visit there on July 19 (America Windows, User:TonyTheTiger/Sandbox/City Landscape and Buddha Shakyamuni). I have about 46.5 hours remaining to timely nominate America Windows at DYK, making that the most urgent of the photography subjects to get together. This could probably sit here for at least 30 days before it becomes untimely, so I would request that you give me 7-10 days to handle editing Boating Party pics.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 01:38, 8 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I have come to a better understanding of the preexisting images and the brown strip. Basically, for a painting that is taken in a museum by a visitor, the top will likely have shadow for certain types of frames. To recover the image in the shadow is a very difficult task and will leave a discolored product like the brown strip. I don't have a significant improvement over what preexisted.

We can go forward with the current image or any of these. I am not knowledgeable enough to declare one as the best.

@TonyTheTiger: National treasures of France is long enough and new enough. QPQ is done and Earwig is clean. I'm getting confused looking at this; what is the situation regarding hooks and images?--Launchballer 15:57, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
User:Launchballer After seeing this work at the Art Institute of Chicago in July, I created this article. At one point this nomination was endorsed for the picture slot. (I don't recall ever having received such an approval before, but I do agree this would be an excellent choice, especially since fine art does pretty well in the picture slot in my experience). However, commons had three version of the painting: 1.) A low res version, 2.) A high res version with a tan band across the top and 3.) my crop of #2. Due to my inexperience in picture editing, I was unaware that the tan band represented tremendous editorial effort recovering picture data from shadows that resulted from taking the picture without a flash. I assumed I could go to the Art Institute of Chicago and retake the picture without such a band. However, I attended an August lecture about this exhibition and retook the photo. However, I too had a shadow in all of my pictures, and helpful folks at commons removed it in one version. There is was no consensus among involved editors and has been no consensus at Commons:Commons:Photography_critiques#Image_selection that anything I produced was significantly better. I will be attending another Art Institute lecture regarding this exhibition in late September. I am not so sure I will get any better result than we already have. What we have regarding a photo is not perfect, but I think we have sufficient depiction to present the subject in a picture slot. However, today an editor added {{cn}} content. I have been debating about reverting or trying to source the new content.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 16:41, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I had meant 'what hooks/images do I need to verify', though I actually read the nomination this time. I'm going to approve all of the images visible on this page and let a promoter take their pick. ALT2, however, requires knowledge of what LVMH is to be interesting; if you're alright with the trimmed hook ALT2a: ... that Boating Party (pictured) was declared a national treasure of France, I'd be able to approve it.

@Launchballer: 3a?-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 04:35, 31 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
User:Launchballer, the online sources that I see have the following content:
The english version of this source (which is a WP:IC) says "the painter's framing, almost cinematic, is particularly striking. Here the viewer does not look at the painting.he boarded the boat, facing the rower in full effort. The reflections of the water almost seem to sparkle, as if the paint was still moving."
This source (also an IC) clarifies that this is an impressionist work with content such as "emblematic and constitutive of the Impressionist aesthetic", but nothing about painterly details.
The content that was added really sounds like it came from somewhere legitimate. I am apt to just hide it until I can chase down sources after the exhibtion leaves town and high interest levels return to normal.-TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD) 02:52, 31 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
(I know you did. I watchlisted both the Blurred Lines and the Niggas in Paris GA subpages when I saw them at WP:GAN as I like both songs and spotted hooks when reading the articles, which I intend on driveby nominating if we aren't in backlog mode.) To answer your other questions; I usually issue reminders after a week, but on this occasion commenting out for now is probably the right call.--Launchballer 03:41, 31 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

marking this as rejected.
See below for a passage from our article and the corresponding passage from the source.
Please go read WP:CLOP.
It talks about the superficial modification of material from another source which is exactly what this is.
This is a fundamental concept and a core requirement.
Somebody who has over 400,000 edits really should understand this by now.
What an editor needs to do is summarize source material in their own words, not just shuffle sentences around and substitute synonyms until Earwig no longer triggers a warning.
RoySmith (talk) 22:32, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Caillebotte, who was from a wealthy family, served as a supporter/patron of impressionists and assembled a collection of over 70 works of art from Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet, Jean-François Millet, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley. He willed sixty-eight paintings by Pissarro (nineteen), Monet (fourteen), Renoir (ten), Sisley (nine), Degas (seven), Cézanne (five), and Manet (four). In his will, he gave the French government this collection as a bequest with a directive that all of the paintings would be exhibited at the Musée du Luxembourg and then moved to the Louvre. However, Musée du Luxembourg was too small to accommodate the entire bequest. His brother Martial, his executor Renoir and the museum reached a compromise and accepted 40 works, just 38 by some sources, and 38 impressionists plus 2 works by Millet according to another, to become part of the national collection in 1896 and were unveiled in February 1897, bolstering the standing of Impressionism with the first presentation of the Impressionists in a public venue in France.From a wealthy background, Caillebotte acquired more than seventy pieces by Cezanne, Degas, Manet, Millet, Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, and Sisley. He assembled a remarkable collection of modern art, a legacy for future generations, while providing financial support for his Impressionist friends. Indeed, in 1876, at only 28 years old, he wrote a will in which he bequeathed this collection to the French government. He stated that the paintings should all be exhibited at the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris (then called the "musée des artistes vivants"), then eventually moved to the Louvre.
The government initially accepted this bequest, but difficulties arose with exhibiting the works at the Musée du Luxembourg, which was too small and overcrowded. After lengthy discussions between Martial Caillebotte, the artist's brother, Renoir, the executor of his will, and the museums' administrative departments, a compromise was found: the bequest would only comprise a selection of forty works, but all of them would be exhibited. They became part of the national collections in 1896.
In February 1897, the Caillebotte room opened to the public. At that time, it was unprecedented to see such a large collection of Impressionist works in a museum. It was thanks to Caillebotte's generosity and determination that Impressionism finally gained official recognition in France.
@BlueMoonset and RoySmith:, If I had a pattern of bringing CLOPs to DYK, then I would understand your reaction, especially if RoySmith personally had cited CLOP issues multiple times in the past. This may be the first time 1000+ trips to DYK that I have been cited for WP:CLOP, so reacting like I have a huge problem is quite a bit of an overreaction. We are all here trying to help out.

Comment, not review @CNMall41: this is not yet ready for DYK, the first problem is the article needs 1,500 characters of prose, but it only has 611 at present. I would recommend reading Wikipedia:Did you know/Guidelines, especially the articles and hooks sections. Also the hooks need to include a bold link to the article. TSventon (talk) 06:02, 21 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@TSventon:, thanks for the feedback. I was aware of the 1,500 based on the popup, but submitted anyway with the intent of adding the rest right after. My mind got twisted and I went to bed without doing it, so apologies for leaving it open ended like that. I have since expanded and also bolded the hooks based on my reading (which could be wrong) of WP:DYKHOOK. CNMall41 (talk) 17:32, 21 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@TSventon: Does this above satisfy your concerns, and is this ready for a full review? Z1720 (talk) 17:00, 29 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Z1720: yes, my concerns have been resolved and this is ready for a full review. I am not sure whether a list with no inline citations for its members is suitable for DYK, but the reviewer can decide about that. TSventon (talk) 17:20, 29 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Above concerns resolved, full review needed. Z1720 (talk) 17:24, 29 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Just to clarify, I did include inline citations. I also verified there were previous lists used for DYK prior to filing as I wasn't sure myslef at first. CNMall41 (talk) 17:26, 29 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@CNMall41:, where are the inline citations for the golf courses listed? I checked ten "list" nominations and the listed items were all cited (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). TSventon (talk) 17:57, 29 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think I misunderstood your original question, but re-reading, I see you said "members" of the list (aka, the courses). The prose is where the inline were placed, not the individual courses as they are all verifiable from the linked pages. No courses are on the list (nor should they be added to the list) that do not have a Wikipedia page. I cannot tell you for sure why the lists you cited included inline sources. I will assume that lists such as this are fully cited because there are a lot of redlinks. This and similar are fairly easy with only a dozen or so entries. List of golf courses in the United States has hundreds of entries which all correspond to a live Wikipedia page (note that I did not include those which were redirects yet still listed in the category for courses based on state). I am not sure if it is a requirement for DYK or not to be honest, but all members of the list are verifiable. CNMall41 (talk) 19:15, 29 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@CNMall41: I will leave it to a reviewer to decide, but WP:DYKCITE says The article must be based on reliable sources, which must be cited inline. All content that could reasonably be challenged, except for plot summaries and that which summarizes cited content elsewhere in the article, must be cited no later than the end of the paragraph (or line if the content is not in prose). TSventon (talk) 19:56, 29 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks. I figured as must since it would similar to WP:GACR6. My interpretation is that it would not be reasonably challenged as the only claim is that a specific golf course is within a specific state as verified on that Wikipedia page for the course. But of course, that is just my opinion. Thanks for taking a look and getting me over the line to a review. CNMall41 (talk) 20:01, 29 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Apart from the sourcing issues, I have concerns about both hooks not meeting WP:DYKDEFINITE. Both numbers could easily change by the month, and they could easily be outdated. My suggestions would be to include an "as of" date as well as going with a less precise figure (i.e. over 1,200 or over 16,000). Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:24, 30 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]

When evaluating for prep, I see the hook doesn't check out. The source says nothing about this or any other album being one of the first to use a DAW, and it doesn't say who might have thought this.

I'm currently unable to search for sources using ProQuest with the Wikipedia Library card due to my lack of recent edits, and regular search engines aren't reliable these days. But even so, I think the hook checks out now. When I was doing research I don't recall seeing the album being the very first to use a DAW, but more of the band exploring a DAW. And I failed to see that ProTools was released just years before the album came out. Thank you for the review. 웃OO 03:57, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
The source doesn't even say anything about it being "one of the first", it just says it was Gane and McEntire’s first experience with Pro Tools, that DAWs were relatively new and that Pro Tools was at that moment becoming the primary platform -- but it doesn't say anything about anyone thinking this album was one of the first to be made using a DAW.

Eurostarguage, could you give a brief quotation for material that verifies the hook?

That's odd. I think this may be an error on my part. Maybe its 993–1121 for the years 1519-1520, specifically letter 999. The reason there are two citations is that there is a separate letter discussing the English basses. Eurostarguage (talk) 19:08, 6 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hello @AndreJustAndre:. If I accidentally say something offensive or stir up religious hatred please let me know - if necessary on my talk page or by email. It is not mandatory for DYK but if you have time could you possibly add a bit more context to the first paragraph for readers like me who know almost nothing about Jews.
In the first sentence you say "rationalist" so does that mean the author might have been an atheist, as by definition religion is a matter of faith not reason? If so I guess they did not use their real name as they might have been tortured? But later in the article it says the author might have been a Jew themselves, so is this a sectarian polemic? If the author was a Jew then why would they need to hide behind a pseudonym? Might they have been a rabbi themselves, and was it considered vulgar to write such a book? Or might they have been excommunicated (if there is such a thing in Judeaism) or cut off by a rich patron? Did earlier authors of such books use their real names, and if so had the religious climate changed to be less tolerant?
I don't understand the difference between "homilies" and "interpretations". Are they perhaps the same thing but one word has a positive connotation and the other a negative? Was the author a kind of early populist - were they criticising rabbis for not being able to explain the Talmud properly to ordinary people? Perhaps you can explian more about the interplay with the purported second author. For example was one asking questions or giving examples or disagreeing, and how does that help the reader understand the book? What do modern rabbis and academics and literary critiics think of this book? Is it used in theology courses at universities?
Should and could you put the text in Wikisource?
I am afraid the hook didn't hook me. Without stirring up modern day hatred is it possibly to add more of the "bitter sarcasm" in the hope we can find a better hook? Chidgk1 (talk) 09:29, 6 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi, Chidgk1. I am not sure there will be a hook with "bitter sarcasm," as 15th-century manuscripts can be a little dry. We can try to come up with something more interesting. I will have to think about some of your comments or questions. "Rationalist" doesn't mean atheist, and religion is not by definition devoid of reason. Logic and reasoning are a big part of some religions. In Judaism (and not limited to Judaism), the rationalists such as Maimonides and Abraham ibn Ezra focused on the plain meaning of the text and tried to make it all make sense or explain contradictions in religious law and practice or biblical history, while followers of mysticism might emphasize more of the unseen forces, mysteries, double meanings or hidden meanings, magical or numerological formulas and so on. Many rationalist writers were also interested in astronomy, alchemy, what passed for math and science at this time, history, literature, and other things, where you certainly need logic and reason for analysis and interpretation. They probably did believe in the God of Judaism and practice the rituals. There were also rationalists in Islamic and Christian worlds. As far as being tortured, around this time you were likely to be tortured for being Jewish if you were around the Spanish Inquisition. As far as I know no atheists or apostates were tortured by Jews, but they were occasionally ostracized or excommunicated (herem). Part of the context is the relationship between the Ashkenazi world, traditionally more traditionalist, and the Sephardic world which had a flourishing of the humanistic arts before the expulsions. Yes, the author was likely a learned, Jewish writer, probably a scribe and probably a rabbi and maybe even an influential leader of their community. So the satire was pseudonymous probably for reputational reasons and not for fear of retribution per se. "Homilies" in this context implies kind of making up a moral story of your own that is not present in the plain original text. These rationalist thinkers were basically something like textual originalists, who disliked Kabbalah, hidden codes or messages, folk superstitions, popular mythology most of which isn't found in the original texts but came later, considering that all junk. Kabbalah can be heavy on symbolism or things like making magical amulets, the rationalists were more conservative in their thinking. I wouldn't go far as to say they were populists but they did want things to be ordinarily understood and not twisted around or read too much into. As far as the 2nd author, some people think they were one and the same because they had a similar style and the 2nd author basically explains the 1st work, which is why it is "self-commenting." I do not know if this text would be used in a basic introductory theology course, but maybe in an advanced topic about the Maimonidean Controversy. Modern authors like to study these things because lots of people today still are interested in, study, and revere those figures like Maimonides, who the author probably likes, or Rashi, who the author is very critical of, but was very influential and continues to be. This particular work is probably more on the obscure side but is an interesting case to be for being such an early pseudonymous work and for its point of view and its position in time. The text itself is probably only in calligraphic medieval Hebrew on manuscript (vellum?) so I am not really qualified to transcribe it to Wikisource, though I agree it would be interesting to read it. Usually these things are readable if some modern day writer writes a critical edition and includes a translation. Andre🚐 09:48, 6 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Checked new enough, long enough, QPQ done, and Earwig shows no copyvio. Is neutral point of view as far as I can tell, which is not very far. Randomly chose a few cites to check: cite 1 good - cite 8 good - cite 13 unable to check as only abstract is outside paywall - cite 19 Google Translate gave up after first few lines so I gave up too - cite 23 I was not sure about this as the link only shows a very small bit of text which seemed to confirm the previous sentence rather than the cited @AndreJustAndre: as the sentence has 6 cites and covers 2 names could you possibly move the cites next to the name they are citing unless they cover both names in which case we probably don't need all 6? Chidgk1 (talk) 06:21, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks for checking that. Perhaps the cites should be bundled but I tend not to do that when I'm working on an article so I can move them around while I am messing with the article structure or so I can easily reuse them to expand it. Also, part of that part of the article was added by User:GordonGlottal (e.g. [2], including the Hebrew original text of Kirchheim, which is how I think those cites got a little mixed up and I didn't clean them up later, so thanks for catching it. It would appear that a few of those cites mainly just say "the Alilot Devarim of Joseph b. Meshullam (?) who wrote in Italy in 1468" and they do not exactly support that identification as you point out, so I'll move them to a different sentence, rather than remove them because they still might be useful for expanding the article. Lawee does mention the identification but not exactly in the same way. Zinberg does go further into depth about the author. I'll find what he says and get back to you. Andre🚐 06:58, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Re finding a hookier hook as I see the book is freely available (although as images as perhaps no one has put it through OCR so presumably not searchable?) if you cannot find a spicy quote yourself might it be worth you asking Wikipedia:WikiProject Jewish history or indeed on Hebrew Wikipedia. I am thinking of perhaps a sentence where he insults something which everyone nowadays agrees is bad? Chidgk1 (talk) 07:41, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, there are scans of the manuscripts[3] but translating a work like this is something rather delicate usually done by professionals as a major endeavor and takes time. As mentioned the writing is calligraphic, and it is also an archaic dialect and possibly takes poetic or literary license in ways that are going to be hard for OCR to do (or LLMs). The Hebrew is normally written sans vowels which makes it harder for a non-native speaker let alone one well-versed in the 15th century vocabulary and turn of phrase and constructions. We'll probably have an easier time finding something in one of the English sources already in the article. Zinberg is a good one but it's hard to find online in that volume, but I believe I have a print copy so I will check. There are some examples of customs he ridicules in the Jacob Schachter[4] which an LLM is capable of rendering to English (Google Translate does not, however do such a good job). I can't find an English source for that yet though. Will check ZinbergAndre🚐 08:28, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks very much for those detailed explanations and article improvements. I am now happy with everything except the hook. How about the following:
ALT1 ... that the 'Book of Accusations' excoriates halakhic interpretation, Kabbalah, magic, superstition, the commentary of Rashi, and the Ashkenazi rabbinical tradition of pilpul? Chidgk1 (talk) 07:07, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Hook says excoriates, article not only says critiques but has a clarification needed tag on it. Also, this needs a lead section and the sentence beginning Cultural needs {{clump}}.--Launchballer 12:48, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've addressed the lead section and the cite clump. I think excoriates is fair given that Lawee says, "In excoriating Rashi’s Commentary, the resisting readers were not alone. They were joined by another rock-hard rationalist of later medieval times: the author of ‘Alilot devarim." but I've changed the lead to "harshly critiques" because while you could reasonably say he was excoriating all of it, I think it reads better, and I'll use excoriate to refer to Rashi in the body. I think defensible for the hook though. The clarification tag was added by Chidgk1 in this context so I have now removed it. Andre🚐 18:27, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I don't think I've seen gangsters on DYK before, Guylaen! Fresh, long enough, cites sources, without any neutrality or copyright issues apparent to me. I do see some issues, though:
The dates and places of birth and death, the nicknames, and the spouse's name are not cited.
The article ends abruptly; do we know if he talked after the "truth serum"? And what happened to him in the end? We should at least conclude with information about his death.
The hook checks out, but could it not be simpler? Because of the unfamiliar acronyms I find myself losing interest in what could otherwise be a very fun hook.Surtsicna (talk) 13:39, 24 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Guylaen: Please address the above.

So... my main problem to begin with was that spelling out the acronyms was too many characters for the hook. OSS is pretty well-known though. FBN, not as much anymore, even though it used to be a household name, which is a shame, because Federal Bureau of Narcotics takes up so much space. I'm just not sure how to rescue this.
Maybe just remove the names of the OSS and the FBN? Like:

Well, I found the birthdate using Ancestry.com. Every time he entered through Ellis Island from Cherbourg or Bremen he would have to go through processing, and his birthdate is written down there.
Umm... I have genuinely misplaced the source on his death date because my external hard drive got corrupted, and I remember it took me like a full week to find a source that had anything about his death date. Gods I don't want to start that search again, but it looks like I have to.
As for his nicknames, they're in all of the old newspapers and in Anslinger's book. "Little Augie" is the most common name, for example, if you do a search in Newspaper Archives for August Del Gracio, Little Augie pops up in most of the articles. The name "Little Augie the Wop" is found in several places, including here: https://www.thehistoryreader.com/historical-figures/lucky-luciano-wwiis-operation-husky/
The other two nicknames I found in the Napa Sentinel from 1991, a series of articles written by Harry Martin and David Caul. Guylaen (talk) 09:47, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Great we have the sources for the nicknames, but they should be cited in the article, not here. I do not think ancestry.com is a reliable source. I would rather directly cite whichever source they cite, if they cite any. Surtsicna (talk) 10:57, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I have referenced the sources.
The League of Nations file listed in the external links actually has his birthdate on page 5, so this is the ref for that.
Also, turns out Napa Sentinel is not trustworthy, even though the name sounds like a legit newspaper, it was actually a tabloid. They had also ran stories on things like black helicopters and UFO abductions, meaning they're not reliable. (I'm adding Harry V. Martin to my list of TBW's [to be written].)
However, another League of Nations case file lists almost every alias he has ever used, so that is now the reference.
However... for the life of me I can't remember where I found his death information, so I have deleted it. Guylaen (talk) 12:51, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

The article is long enough and was submitted to DYK three days after its creation, so I believe the "new enough" criteria has easily been met too. The hook is interesting (as are the ALT hooks). Earwig is fine, but as many of the sources are in Dutch or Indonesian, it's not clear to me how this works re: copyvio criteria. The article is well drafted by a highly experienced editor
who is the nominator (with many past DYK nominations), so this seems like somewhat of a non-issue. QPQ looks fine. I'm happy to proceed with next steps of this review, but not entirely sure if something in particular needs to be done in a case like this one. Please advise. -- Cl3phact0 (talk) 10:58, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
As I don't speak Dutch or Indonesian, this may be a fool's errand. Using various machine translations, I've located a passage about a "groundbreaking speech [...] entitled 'A Matter of Life or Death.'" I've not yet found the term "prophetic" (although the source confirms the quote about "converting prime rice fields into golf courses", which may be useful for a catchy ALT hook). We may need to wait for a reviewer who speaks these languages (or use one of the ALT hooks). -- Cl3phact0 (talk) 09:21, 1 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Jeromi Mikhael: A simple solution might be a rewording of the primary hook (ALT0) along these lines ... that a speech Wisaksono Wirjodihardjo wrote for President Sukarno presciently warned against "converting prime rice fields into golf courses"? -- Cl3phact0 (talk) 10:01, 2 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@Cl3phact0: I have no problem with your suggestion. I approve the new ALT0. Regards, Jeromi Mikhael 21:35, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I have a problem with that suggestion, given that a broad audience is unlikely to know who "Sukarno" is, and I don't see the quote in the source.--Launchballer 11:13, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, I modified the text to include Indonesian president Sukarno for that reason. Also, there are a few sources that mention the golf quote (though I chose not to use the direct quote since we are working with translations). The reference source here says (in translation) "If all agricultural and engineering students were required to read it, civil engineering graduates would reconsider converting their first-class rice paddies into golf courses. Similarly, agricultural graduates would feel guilty every weekend playing golf on courses that were once first-class rice paddies." -- Cl3phact0 (talk) 11:37, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@RobinIsadorable: Hello, and welcome to DYK. Right now, I would suggest that you propose a new hook, as the current one may not be considered interesting to those unfamiliar with the Wave-Gotik-Treffen or Ships in the Night. Will you be able to do that? If you need any help our guidance, feel free to let me or another editor know. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 10:41, 31 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Narutolovehinata5: Hi, thank you for your comment! I added an alternative hook. Would appreciate any additional guidance if that doesn't work either. RobinIsadorable (talk) 14:55, 31 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, the new hook works. I've struck the original. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 23:39, 31 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thank you for article and hook, User:RobinIsadorable, - nice to meet you, and I agree with your user name ;) - The article is detailed and referenced throughout. I wonder about the pronoun, beginning with "their" but then "she"? - Please find something to link the article to. - Normally there would be a link to the performer. As they have no article, there should be a redirect from their name to this article, and the name should be bold. A bit more about the person (birth day or year, place of birth, education ...) would be nice. - The image is licensed and a good illustration. It would perhaps be stronger if cropped, because the detail on the left doesn't show well in stamp-size. I trimmed the caption. - We should not use a given name in the article once the full name was introduced, also no link is needed for New York City. - A bit about the vocals would also be great. - The last refs should be in ascending order. - In the hook, perhaps you want to include something like insomnia, rather than all three outside sounds. - --Gerda Arendt (talk) 13:04, 5 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

@Gerda Arendt: Thank you for the feedback! I'll try to address your points. In regards to pronouns, I tried to use they/them/their when referring to the musical project Ships in the Night and she/her/hers when referring to Leventhal (though I will say I don't see their pronouns personally stated in any sources, so I'm a little hesitant to stick with she/her/hers). Couldn't really find information about Leventhal's personal details. In the hook, I decided to focus on melody inspirations in order to convey the kinds of sounds that inspire the music rather than subject matter (which is inspired by or deals with a number of different topics) for brevity's sake. I could definitely expand the hook to include that. I added a redirect from Alethea Leventhal. I think your other points were addressed by other editors including a photo crop found here: File:WGT 2025 Ships In The Night 01 (cropped).jpg.
Thank you for explaining. The cropped image is better suitable for the Main page. --Gerda Arendt (talk) 06:26, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi @RobinIsadorable, Gerda Arendt, Launchballer,
and Narutolovehinata5: I'm just reopening this one because I've just reviewed this article in the Queue and I became confused by the flipping between discussion of the "band" Ships in the Night versus the "singer" Alethea Leventhal. And I see that Gerda raised similar issues in her comment above, so this seems like something that should be addressed. In particular, a few points:
It is unclear if Ships in the Night has become a de facto stage name for Leventhal, or if there is a clear distinction between the act under one name and the individual under the other. The attached image showing the individual but using the group name adds to this confusion.
There is a strong implication through the article that Leventhal identifies as non-binary, with repeated use of they/them pronouns. For example "In 2024, Leventhal signed with Metropolis Records to release their third full-length album, Protection Spells". But from what I can gather, Leventhal in fact identifies as female and is referred to in sources as she/her. I think this needs to be made clearer, probably through consistency in which bits of the article refer to the individual and which to the "band".
Nothing insurmountable here, and thanks to RobinIsadorable for writing this and submitting your first DYK, we just need a little bit of tidying up I think. I will help out myself if I have some time in the coming days, but a little busy right now. Cheers  — Amakuru (talk) 09:52, 3 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Well, this is all interesting.
(There seems to be much discussion about the article I didn't nominate and no discussion at all about the article I did nominate, August Del Gracio, who I think is more interesting than this guy.)
I'll admit it, I friggin love quotes. There are a couple of really saucy ones here that we need to keep, like Anslinger's quote. But yeah, we can paraphrase some of them. However, all of my Bacula notes are on my desktop back in California, and I'm still in Vermont with my laptop until the 16th.
As for a source to the trafficking volume, here is another one: https://archives.ungeneva.org/illicit-traffic-activities-of-carlos-fernandez-bacula . The source for the tonnage is literally on the first page of the Opium Advisory Committee (OAC) file, a French language newspaper clipping that the OAC inserted after his conviction. If you don't know French, the phrase is "d'une tonne et demie d'héroïne" which just means a ton and a half.
I can read French real easy, but I tried to write an article over on fr.wikipedia and they basically told me never to write in French until I was more advanced, haha.
Also, if you want to go with the hook, I have suggestion for alt: include the word "Peruvian Diplomat," somewhere in the hook.

That isn't proposed phrasing, just more criticism of a note that has been effective and unoffensive to everyone apart from yourself, since it already is perfectly polite assuming you're assuming good faith. As for the rest, if you had additional ALTs to propose, you're welcome to but that's what's actually making the entry seem intimidating to prospective reviewers.

Long enough, new enough. The 40% on Earwig seems to be from a direct quote from the interview. Hook is interesting, although not directly stated in the source itself. QPQ is done, although it seems a bit rushed but not a problem for me. The problem now is a bit minor one, first of all, the duplicate citations (which I tagged it), and I have a problem with citation #17 (kworb.net), which is highlighted as unreliable by CiteHighlighter per WP:ALBUMAVOID.

@TheNuggeteer and Miminity: I think this needs some more work. The source doesn't say the song is deceiving. According to the article, the band-within-the-song Saja Boys are hiding their identities.

@Dclemens1971: I tried to summarize a quote (or two). Ian Eisendrath, a main producer of the songs, said their goal was to create one of those super bubblegum-y K-pop boy band songs hence "catchy", and a later quote If you really look at them, the underpinning is like, ‘We’re going to devour you. We’re going to eat you up. We are going to drink you up’ because that’s what the demons do hence "deceiving". I also understand where you are coming from, since it looks OR-y. 🍗TheNuggeteer🍗 (My "blotter")

06:18, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@TheNuggeteer: Watch for the link to a dab page in the hook. I still think ALT1's not quite there, in part because of the "band-within-a-show" element of this song makes the mention of the movie title a bit of excessive detail. How's this? ALT1a: ... that while "Soda Pop" appears to be "bubblegum-y K-pop boy band" song, it is actually about demons devouring souls? P.S. Going to leave this for another reviewer to evaluate since I have now proposed an alternative hook. Dclemens1971 (talk) 13:23, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Thank you for going to so much effort for us, with the picture. However I have had to replace your new picture with the original, which I have rotated (using Gimp) for the same reason (and I never use AI either). However I have retained the original genuine colour. This billiard room is in a sensitively restored Victorian building, which means it has Victorian muted colours. The walls are a rich maroon, not cheap scarlet, and the baize on the tables is a discreetly gentle shade.

Welcome to DYK! What a thorough article -- you could consider nominating it as a Good Article too. The DYK criteria look well met. Regarding the hook, DYK strongly discourages "first"-based hooks and I don't think ALT0 will work. ALT1 is supported by the source, but as written doesn't strike me as very interesting to a non-specialist. I'd propose the following as something with a "catchier" wording that is still supported by the source:
ALT2: ... that Viktor Glondys converted from Catholicism to Lutheranism while the Away from Rome! movement was popular, but he had his own reasons?
If you're OK with that hook suggestion, we could go with that, or you could suggest some others. There may be something interesting to do with the wars, eg, fleeing on foot shortly after his doctorate, or the controversial Good Samarital speech. The trick (and it is tricky) is to boil down the details into something that feels accessible and leaves the reader wanting more to piece it together. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 08:47, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I came here from the WP:CGR page, where I saw that this article had been nominated for DYK. I know nothing about the DYK process, but my impression of the article itself is mostly negative. In order to avoid cluttering up the DYK template, I've started a separate section on the talk page listing some of the problems (misspellings, ungrammatical sentences, inadequate sources, sources not properly credited, at least three citations that fail verification). WP:DYK says "Articles must meet the basic criteria set out on this page, but do not have to be of very high quality". Fair enough. I don't know how low the bar is; perhaps this is within the range considered normal and acceptable at DYK. But to me, as an outsider to the process, it certainly does not seem "good to go", or ready to be featured on the front page.

It didn't redirect me to the footnote when I clicked it, which is most likely fault of my device. The sources are reliable and back the claim. As for the image, yes I think a photograph of Ivanka would be a better fit. The "(pictured)" thing also needs to follow the mention of Mar-a-Lago Face, likely with additional need to say it's Ivanka, something like "...that the Mar-a-Lago face, a (example pictured: Ivanka Trump", an appearance popular with Republican women, has been compared to gender-affirming care and drag?").

I have an issue with the image caption. There is only one source in the article supporting the idea that the face is modeled after Ivanka, and that source attributes the claim to a single surgeon. The quote is actually "often modeled after Ivanka Trump’s signature look", which is a fair distance from "based on Ivanka Trump". ꧁Zanahary꧂ 15:41, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

I still don't think a single claim attributed to some Californian surgeon in a HuffPost article is a good enough source for this to appear on the front page.

The hook covers (it took some effort) a variety of the interesting items in the article, which I worked into the hook with a fair bit of effort. So is your issue JUST with the comparison to Ivanka and the image, or is your issue with the DYK itself? I want to know your precise position so that if there is a concern, I can address it head-on, with clear focused understanding of what your issue is. And, being honest, I've had terrible luck with vague editors and those prone to move goalposts, which I am not a fan of. Can you please be crystal clear in your concerns?
— Very Polite Person (talk/contribs) 15:57, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Sure: the notion that Ivanka is the model for the face is too tenuously sourced, and the "comparison" to gender-affirming care is sourced entirely from a single rhetorical one-liner in a Mother Jones piece. Neither of these are strong enough to be on the main page. ꧁Zanahary꧂ 16:30, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I've now triple-sourced that Ivanka Trump is the basis/inspiration for the look, including direct quotes from surgeons.
— Very Polite Person (talk/contribs) 17:30, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
These sources are all poor. HuffPost's is one surgeon. Glam.com (seemingly a very low-quality source, whose front page shows me authoritative hits like 4 Common Excuses That Make You Sound Self-Centered between seemingly infinite articles about celebrities' shocking plastic surgery transformations and elegant style evolutions) just reprints a surgeon's quote in the terrible WP:Daily Mail, and the Voce di New York (an outlet with basically no pedigree or footprint at all) piece is just a few paragraphs long and claims without substantiation that two surgeons say more people are asking to look like Ivanka. Neither of the quoted surgeons in the piece seem to say anything supporting that notion, and the piece does not even posit a direct basal relationship between Ivanka Trump and Mar-a-Lago face. This is just bad sourcing for a fun claim, and I get that fun claims like this one are fun, but without actual high-quality sourcing directly supporting it, "Mar-a-Lago face is based on Ivanka Trump" does not meet the encyclopedic standard of Wikipedia's front page.꧁Zanahary꧂ 19:49, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This DYK nomination is ill-considered. The "K" in DYK is know, meaning it should be solid and notable fact.
"Compared to gender-affirming care" is weasel-wording, not a statement it is factually gender-affirming care for a DYK. Also, compared by whom? Maybe one or two utterly non-notable people who were clearly having fun with applying the phrase to the trans-phobic MAGA movement. It was not a claim the women needed surgery in order to look like women, which is what the phrase usually means.
Similarly for comparing the Mar-a-Lago look to drag, which is again very thinly sourced, is a weasely compared and not a DYK fact.
Unrelated to DYK nomination: the inclusion of the eye-catching and large drag picture in this article based on a non-notable offhand remark is ill-considered.
I'm firmly on the side of this DYK nomination is nonsense. -- M.boli (talk) 21:49, 19 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Source quote: Botox, visible facial fillers and exaggerated tans comprise the aesthetic popular among Donald Trump’s entourage.
That's as bare bones and factually accurate as there is. Is the issue article quality and composition or subject matter? Is there a subject matter restriction on DYK? Political sensitivity in the past has not been a prior valid factor with front page nominations for DYK, In the News, FAs...

A 5x expansion has been verified by DYK check and I did not find any close paraphrasing. A QPQ has been verified and it is a complete review. The article is long enough for DYK purposes and meets the referencing guidelines.
However, the hook is problematic. Firstly, it is not directly stated in the article: nowhere does it say that it was "marketed with copies signed by Henrietta Stannard". Second, even if the claim was mentioned, it doesn't seem to actually be referenced. Thirdly, and most worryingly, even if those issues were addressed, the hook would not meet WP:DYKINT. The context here is that Winter is actually Stannard's penname, but the average reader may not be familiar with either name, so the connection is lost. Even without the context, the hook does not seem very interesting if the reader is unfamiliar with Stannard and her work (FWIW I've never heard of her prior to this nomination).
You have done a good job of expanding the article, but to be honest, after reading it, I'm not sure if there's actually anything here that's workable. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 02:26, 28 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]

My apologies for the delay— my off-wiki life has been tumultuous this week. In the next few days I can look for an alternative hook; there may be something I can add to the article with the film adaptation. I personally don’t think the hook relies on knowing either name (she’s a completely obscure author) but I think it’s interesting that she basically makes her pseudonym useless (which I think the cited ad verifies); I may be able to come up with a better wording for that idea. Regardless I’d appreciate a few days to work on it, please, with my thanks for your thorough review. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 20:33, 31 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Narutolovehinata5, what do you think about ALT1: ...that Henrietta Stannard autographed copies of John Strange Winter’s novel Lady Jennifer?
That phrasing is definitely verified by the ad, which has the headline Autographed Copies of John Strange Winter's Latest Novel and says Mrs. Stannard ("John Strange Winter") will be pleased to send a specially signed copy... My aim is to intrigue someone who has never heard of either name -- I think it's interesting that she's a woman with a male pseudonym who is undermining that pseudonym with her marketing campaign.
Or, perhaps another angle is something like ALT2: ...that Henrietta Stannard bundled her novel Lady Jennifer with promotional materials for John Strange Winter's Toilet Preparations?
I'd have to beef it up in the article a bit but the mail-in autograph promo automatically gave a free copy of Comely Woman with every Lady Jennifer, and elsewhere I've seen info about how this book basically just sold her cosmetics line. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 20:04, 2 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Regrettably, I do not think this Stannard/Strange Winter angle will work out, as the main issue (that the hooks do not make sense or will not interest people who do not know either name or at least the context) remains. I understand what you're trying to get to, but it's not showing in the hook proposals, and given what is in the article, the angle just seems like a non-starter. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 22:16, 2 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
You don't think the cosmetics line part is any better? I didn't think that one relied on the author's names, and in fact we could remove Stannard's name entirely, i.e., ALT3: ... that the novel Lady Jennifer cross-promoted John Strange Winter's Toilet Preparations? (Again, I'd be able to beef up the article properly for that if it seemed like an interesting angle.) I thought "Toilet Preparations" might also be an intriguing product name for a general audience. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 23:17, 2 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
ALT3 is a bit of a weird one in that I'm 50-50. On the one hand, it doesn't solve the "you must know who John Strange Winter" issue, but on the other hand, the name itself along with "Toilet Preparations" might be enough to raise attention. I'm undecided at this point, so I think it might be a good idea to ask for a second opinion from one of the usual DYK scrutinizers like RoySmith, Amakuru, Launchballer, etc. I should note that, if ever, only ALT3 is under consideration, and all the other hooks, particularly those involving the name Henrietta Stannard, are rejected.

Comment: Most of the material in the film section belongs in the Lady Jennifer (film) article - I'm not sure the 5x expansion will stand after that is taken away. StAnselm (talk) 21:25, 2 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I wrote all of the film material after the 5x expansion so it's not needed to meet that criteria. Also, I am in the process of merging the articles on the WP:PAGEDECIDE principle that there is no need to have two articles and a DAB for a topic with so little (relatively) to say. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 23:09, 2 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Narutolovehinata5, LEvalyn, RoySmith,
and Amakuru: I'm fine with ALT3.--Launchballer 12:07, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Here since I was pinged above – personally I would not sign off on ALT3. As someone unfamiliar with the subject, the hook as written makes no sense to me. Who is John Strange Winter, and ehat are "Toilet Preparations" (particularly when rendered in title case like this)? And how exactly does the book "cross-promote" them? And then it's not immediately obvious where in the article to look. The words "Toilet" and "cross-promote" don't appear anywhere in the article and it turns out "Toilet Preparations" is actually "J. S. W. Preparations". No offence to anyone, but IMHO it seems a little weak to me to premise the hook on a pun on the word toilet that doesn't even appear in the article.
As an aside, I agree with the comment above that the film article should be redirected to this one, there isn't enough content overall for two separate articles on these closely related topics at this time and WP:NOPAGE would apply for me. It's a pity the WP:BLAR was reverted, it might have to go through AFD or a merge discussion on the talk page. Cheers  — Amakuru (talk) 13:08, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Thanks for weighing in, and thanks to Narutolovehinata5 for your patience with this one. With regret, I'll withdraw the DYK.

Though to be clear Amakuru, they really were called John Strange Winter's Toilet Preparations! I just hadn't clipped the source for the article yet. ~ L 🌸 (talk) 18:36, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi @LEvalyn: thanks for the reply, and if you're able to make the hook tally up with something in the article I'll be happy to re-evaluate it... I haven't looked at this in detail, but hopefully either way we can save something from this, no need to throw in the towel just yet! Cheers  — Amakuru (talk) 19:25, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
That's very kind, Amakuru. The article now says To promote the book, Stannard offered signed copies by mail order... With the novel, she included free copies of Comely Woman, a book of advice promoting her line of cosmetics products, John Strange Winter Toilet Preparations (with a wikilink to Toilet#Names to help solve the mystery of the name), and I've named the section "Publication and promotion" to make it easier to spot. To a certain extent I think "Who is John Strange Winter and what are 'Toilet Preparations'?" is the "intrigue" I was hoping to raise-- hopefully the article now has answers to those. Maybe some more compelling or clearer wordings:
ALT04: ... that the romantic drama Lady Jennifer cross-promoted the product line of John Strange Winter Toilet Preparations? ~ L 🌸 (talk) 21:04, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Full review to follow, but I do not see how meets WT:DYK. It is quite common for elections to not have any female candidates, even today.

Impersonation of law enforcement is not an uncommon occurrence in the United States, but the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration policies, and the particular ways in which ICE enjoys anonymity, have led to increased opportunities for such behavior, endangering and exploiting immigrants and their communities, regardless of their status.

I'm not sure if "chronic crime problem" is the best wording here, but that's getting close. The idea I had was something like, instead of saying it was a crime, the interesting fact here is that the issue exists at all, or to reverse the order of their mention. Something like "that deportation policies led to a rise in impersonation". Another possible option would be to avoid mentioning the deportation policies and instead to say that "there has been a rise of impersonations since [year]" or something along the lines of that fact; this is not just to avoid mentioning the policies, but it also avoids mentioning the reason, thus "hooking" readers to read the article and learn why it is happening.

Gen-Mina people, Mina (historical ethnic term)
( Comment or view )( Article history links: Gen-Mina peopleMina (historical ethnic term) )
... that a 16th century ethnic term used in Africa is still used today for a Brazilian religion, a Togolese and Beninese ethnic group, and their language?
Source: ""Mina" was, however, as Hall correctly notes, certainly a term which was applied in Brazil, in some contexts, to speakers of Gbe languages. The "Casa das Minas [House of the Minas]" in Sao Luis in the province of Maranhao, for example, is a cult-house of specifically Dahomian origin, venerating spirits associated with the royal dynasty of Dahomey."Law, Robin (2005). "Ethnicities of Enslaved Africans in the Diaspora: On the Meanings of "Mina" (Again)". History in Africa. 32: 258. doi:10.1353/hia.2005.0014. ISSN 0361-5413.
"The name "Minas" remained in use under French colonial rule in the twentieth century, and indeed down to the present, to refer to the inhabitants of Agbodrafo, Aneho and Glidji, and Agoue; although there remains an awareness locally that it should properly be applied only to the Elmina element in Aneho (and its offshoots), a.s distinct from the Gas at Glidji.33 It is not quite accurate, however, to state as does Hall, that these people "call themselves" Mina.34 Rather, this is an external, European coinage, which is nowadays used locally only when speaking in French. At a conference held at Aneho in 2000, I recall a member of the local community insisting that "the Minas exist only for scholars," the self-appellation of the people in their own language being "Gen.""Law, Robin (2005).

@Viriditas:, reading on this again, I'm sort of concerned that multiple usages of the university publications, the Ford Foundation, and Borgmann's own commencement address falls into WP:PRIMARY territory. The hook could've been explained in the article earlier, but you'd have to read until the legacy section where this is explicitly said. I'd also say that his climate change findings also deserve to be there as it is still talked about 60 years later. Howard the Duck (talk) 00:01, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I think you might have misread something. I would guess that 90% of this material is supported by secondary sources, some of which are connected to a university. None of it is promotional. If you have specific concerns, please share them with an example or two that illustrates what you are talking about. I don’t understand why you think the hook needs to be earlier in the article; I’ve never heard that idea before. As for climate change in legacy, you’re not exactly wrong, but you’re not exactly right.
His “legacy” of giving climate talks and writing papers on conservation was only revealed by a climate historian last month. Thinking about this further, I think you may have misunderstood my style.
The way I use primary sources most of the time is not to support the material.
Most of the secondary sources already do it.
The way I tend to do it is to point to the original source of the event or claim. So in the example of the commencement, there are multiple secondaries that point to the significance of his speech.
That’s why they published excerpts from the commencement and it’s why the journal articles cite the speech.
They are asserting the significance of it by using it. The link to the commencement, however, has nothing to do with this.
It is used to show that the speech actually occurred and as a historical pointer to his name and role in the original event. Furthermore, this isn’t the only commencement speech he gave. However, I did not cover the others because the secondary source coverage was almost nonexistent.
I found blurbs in newspapers from the time, but that’s almost primary due to its age. Therefore, they don’t appear in the bio. Viriditas (talk) 00:29, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
It's not exactly promotional, but the Ford Foundation talking about the Ford Foundation or people connected to it such as in ref #16; see for example ref #7, which is still about the Ford Foundation, but is published by a third party. Compare again ref #2, #3, ref #9; then compare to third party sources in ref #10. See WP:PRIMARYCARE: "The person's autobiography, own website, or a page about the person on an employer's or publisher's website, is an acceptable (although possibly incomplete) primary‡ source for information about what the person says about themself. Such primary sources can normally be used for non-controversial facts about the person and for clearly attributed controversial statements." (Emphasis mine.) I have no problem with these as used on the article.
There was an opportunity to explicitly say how much the reduction was on the middle part of the article. I would've preferred for this to be done that way, but won't oppose if you prefer it to be mentioned in the end.
TBH, I'm not really sure how to deal with citing speeches; I don't think Wikipedia cites MLK in proving that he delivered the I Have a Dream speech. It's obvious though that the speech was rather important in 2025 that someone dug that up and multiple WP:RS reference to it. Howard the Duck (talk) 00:37, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Yes, as I suspected, you are misreading the sources. The Ford Foundation citation is preceded by a secondary source that supports the idea it is discussing (the Sputnik crisis).
Etc. For each primary in the bio, there is usually a secondary supporting the topic. Perhaps if you read it in depth you will discover this for yourself. I’m going offline for a bit now. Viriditas (talk) 00:46, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I'm not disputing that the events didn't happen/were not true; it's just the secondary source should be used (which you had done here) and not the primary source per se. For example, when writing about laws, I do not cite the law per se a reference, but an analysis or annotation of the law. Theae primary sources can go in a "Further reading" section. Howard the Duck (talk) 18:46, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Howard the Duck: You marked your above comments as a QPQ in your edit summary, but there's nothing here remotely resembling the DYK criteria, and I'm frankly still confused by the new criteria you invented up above about the placement of a hook in an article.
I get that you're upset about the recent dispute over at DYK about your QPQs, but there's nothing here for me to respond to or address.
If you can't do an actual review, then ask for a second reviewer or I will ask myself.

This is not a review, but perhaps the greater concern here for DYK purposes is if it really is the "first Chinese literary magazine for women". That is a "first" hook, and per WP:DYKHOOKCITE, such superlative claims require exceptional sourcing (and ideally a search for possible counterexamples), since ERRORS might throw a fit if it turns out to be false. One solution could be to change "the first" to simply "a", but admittedly that might lessen the hook's punch. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 23:48, 7 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

The article is new enough, long enough, and free from close paraphrasing. The nominator provided a complete QPQ. The hooks are all cited inline and verified. Among the proposed hooks, the best hook is probably ALT2; however, I am not sure if it meets DYKFICTION as it is technically talking about an in-universe event, even if it is not plot-related. I will ask for advice regarding this over at WT:DYK. The original hook is rather vague, while ALT1 as currently written may not meet DYKINT since readers may not know who Balanchine is. For suggestions on new hooks, maybe something about its cancelation might work? Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 03:18, 9 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
ALT2 is not talking about an in-universe event. It is talking about how a dance was staged for television. It could also be a quirky hook. Cielquiparle (talk) 06:22, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Now, it seems it could be met - for example, there are good sources used in Development, in particular, [27], but it's not used in reception (I guess {{sources exist}} could be used instead...).

Source: "McCann was 17 when he first decided to become a civil engineer and it was mostly the reuslt of conversations and a desire to not kill anyone .... I was sent off to a careers fair and there were three engineering stalls that I was drawn to ...

So next I went to the mechanical engineering stall and asked what the man there was working on and he said he designed tank propulsion system,

The article meets the newness and length requirements. I did not find any close paraphrasing. A full QPQ has been completed. The hooks are cited inline and verified in the sources; admittedly, the article uses a referencing that is atypical from what I am used to, but that is not an issue for DYK purposes.
My preferences are ALT1 and ALT2, but they both cannot be approved as currently written: ALT1 could be reworded to make it "hookier" or "exciting", if you know what I mean (i.e. the searching for the rum tunnel could be reworded somewhat). ALT2 is technically correct according to the source, but also inaccurate and also not directly stated in the article. The article does not exactly say that the demolition was "announced to attract potential buyers", at least not directly. It might be better to reword the hook as saying that, to attract buyers, they put out a notice claiming it would be demolished (even though they had no plans of doing so, and could not do it anyway). It would be more accurate to the source too. Narutolovehinata5 (talk · contributions) 05:54, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Hi Narutolovehinata5. As much as I'd love to paint a picture of him crawling on his hands and knees searching a dusty old cellar for a tunnel, the source doesn't support it. It simply says that he spent hours searching for the rumoured tunnel with his sister and friends. As for ALT2, omitting context while still reflecting the source is a common practice in writing hooks, and adding that it was impossible for them to legally demolish the structure actually detracts the hookiness (which is strange, given your concerns about ALT1). The fact that this video was meant to attract buyers is already clear from its the phrase "one video", which links the hook sentence with the previous one, and the video is also mentioned (in less detail) in that sentence's source which makes the collocation clear.
To put it bluntly, I'm done with peopling for now, so I'll withdraw this nomination.  — Chris Woodrich (talk) 10:52, 5 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Crisco 1492: Well, I did not mean to say that the "they aren't allowed to demolish it" fact should be included in ALT2, but rather that it should just be rephrased to make it a bit more obvious that demolishing was never actually on the cards. Something like "to attract buyers, X claimed that the Devonshire Lodge would be demolished?" Not that exact wording, of course, but moreso the thought.

@BeanieFan11: The article has recently been expanded 5x and is free of copyright violations and neutral. The hook is interesting. However, there is a minor issue with the in-text citation. On the sentence Despite weighing 20 kilograms (44 lb) less than Sakho, Diouf defeated him in freestyle wrestling; Diouf won several years later in a rematch under Senegalese wrestling rules did not mention his opponent's bodyweight difference. Please cite the source that stipulates the weight difference at the end of that sentence. Once you're done, the hook is approved. Faldi00 (talk) 17:30, 12 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Faldi00: Thanks for the review. Looks like it was the Le Soleil reference that mentioned the weight difference (His career is also marked by his legendary confrontation with Double Less, nicknamed the "Giant of Malifara." At a time when the latter, weighing nearly 20 kilos more than Robert, was feared in the arena for his devastating punches, Robert dared to face him.) so I added it in.

Looks good; this is a neat article (I'm a fan of unusual tugs too). I didn't notice in the article, but it could be neat if you can find a source that explains why it looks visually bigger than what people may think of in terms of tugboats? Was it because of the (I'm guessing) larger size footprint needed for the steamworks apparatus?

@Very Polite Person: Thanks for the review! You're assumption about the size of the tug being related to the steamworks apparatus seems reasonable. After reading through the NRHP document more carefully, it doesn't seem to mention anything about the ship being unusually large. When I searched for images of "paddle tugs" on Google, I did find a few pictures of vessels that looked smaller though. I don't think I can give you a better answer right now, unfortunately. I only came across the article on the Portland after researching Northwest Marine Iron Works, so I don't have much info about vessels of that type on hand.

Comment: Nice article, Roast!
I fixed some typos and added some links.
My only complaint is about the hooks and prose. The prose still needs a few minor tweaks here and there, but otherwise is fine.
As for the hooks, you've got so many interesting things to choose from, I wonder if these are truly the most interesting? Also, ALT0 is a bit too long and weird.
I would recommend coming up with some new hooks.

Please review.[28] I think a hook about his photos in the 1960s would be preferred, as that's what he is known for and is in fact most interesting.

Note, there are two images available to highlight these works.
One can be used for the UT shooting, the other pertains to hobos and garbage in the 1970s.
Fun fact: this kind of garbage was a huge problem in the 1970s, with the US spending about ten years trying to educate the public about littering with public service announcements (PSA).

ALT2: "...that Shel Hershorn photographed the University of Texas tower shooting through the bullet hole of a jewelry store window (pictured)?" Source: Los Angeles Times.
@Guerreroast: That's great!
There's several minor issues to work out, but I really like this.
First issue: Hershorn didn't actually photograph the shooting but the aftermath;
What about "...that Shel Hershorn photographed the aftermath of the University of Texas tower shooting through the bullet hole of a jewelry store window?" Or, is that unnecessary?
I like your shortened version better, but will the ambiguity throw people off?
We could go with it and see what happens. Second issue: the photo you've offered is a separate photo connected to Kingsport Times.
Hershorn's famous photo of the shooting is different and was used on the cover of Life magazine.[29] He also took other photos in that same series.
Not sure how we can explain the difference. For example, is the Kingsport Times version the same photo, only cropped? As you can see with the Life cover, there's a lot more going on, so we wouldn't necessarily want to use the caption of "Hershorn's University of Texas Tower shooting photograph".
I ran into a similar problem over at At the Time of the Louisville Flood.
The solution I discovered was to find a parity between an exhibition title and a title used by a reliable publication.
In this way, I was able to drill down and find the exact image within the 23 photo set from the flood. I think we can do the same thing here.
I'm going offline now, but I'll see what I can dig up later tonight. My guess is that we can sort this out by comparing the title used in an exhibition catalog and finding how many different shots there were in the series. Viriditas (talk) 01:39, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
I discovered at least three different images of the shattered glass: 1) the Life cover, 2) an odd alternate image that was published by the Kingsport Times,[30] and 3) an unpublished image in the Getty archive that is currently cropped as the Commons image (with a discussion about what to do with it on Commons). There are additional images by Hershorn in the UT sniper series in the same Life magazine issue, and even more B&W's from the series in the Briscoe Center for American History archive at UT.
Oddly, the Commons image from Getty doesn't have his byline credit,[31] but this is more likely due to the fact that it was probably never published and passed from UPI directly to the Bettmann archive before it was acquired by Getty.
So the question becomes, can we use it as the lead image for this hook?
Waiting for the outcome of the Commons discussion.
Also, should we use this cropped version instead of the full version?
The full version is quite possibly even more interesting.
Finally, I discovered something else while I was wandering around the Getty archive.
There's a black and white photo of the woman who was apparently hit by the bullet that came through this same window.
Given that the photographer did not crop this, I don't think we should use the cropped version. Viriditas (talk) 10:19, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Update: I confirmed the photo is in the public domain and fixed the copyright tags.
I will be uploading the original, non-cropped version to compare. Viriditas (talk) 20:42, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
A new problem has arisen.
As of yet, there is no evidence that Hershorn took this photo.
This may sound overly skeptical, but here's the problem in a nutshell: 1) the original uploader claimed it was Hershorn, but the photo did not appear with a byline other than UPI and it was a different photo, so the source was all wrong.
2) Hershorn said he destroyed the window so that nobody else could take the shot, however 3) A series by photographer Kent Kirkley shows the window all taped up that same day from the outside, with Kirkley saying that Hershorn had taken his famous Life shot from that window, but not specifying before or after.
4) Without further info, it is possible that this shot does not belong to Hershorn but to another wire photographer. Still trying to find out more. Viriditas (talk) 21:34, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
This is the photo Hershorn is famous for from the UT shooting.
It's the same one that was used for the cover of Life.[32]
There's also a few others connected with it. (I can't link to the other photo as it his hosted by the Daily Mail which is blacklisted, but they attribute it to Getty). As far as I can tell, the others may or may not be Hershorn's.
As a reference point, Kirkley goes into great detail about his own separate shoot and records the time for each photo.[33]
The sniper was killed at around 1:35 p.m.
The windows were taped over by around 3:00 p.m. So Hershorn would have had to take his photos between 1:45 and maybe 2:30 p.m. or so.
And indeed, that's what happened.
Hershorn speaks of a "rival photographer" competing with him, but it's not Kirkley, who refused to send his photos to Life because he didn't think they were ready.[34] Viriditas (talk) 22:22, 13 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
After spending many, many hours looking into this issue, I have come to believe that the image may not belong to Hershorn at all but to a UPI photographer who attempted to scoop Hershorn on August 2 by publishing in the Kingsport Times.
It is my suspicion that this photo is one part of this UPI set, which eventually was acquired by the Bettmann Archive. It may be possible for someone to visit or contact the Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin to clear this up, as there's a possibility that I'm completely wrong.
But here's why I think I might be right: 1) The photo in question is connected to UPI, both in terms of the series being published by KT and as part of the Bettmann Archive. 2) Hershorn told Shelton Williams he was competing with a UPI photographer for the shot and kicked out the glass to prevent him from scooping him. 3) Kirkley's subsequent shots show the glass was taped up later. 4) The unusual framing of the shot (low, horizontal, constrained) perfectly and ingeniously hides the tape that we can see in Kirkley's images. 5) One shot from the UPI series was published the next day in the Kingsport Times with a UPI byline. 6) Why would Hershorn publish his image with his competitor when he told Shelton he was trying to prevent getting scooped because Life published their cover issue on the shooting more than a week later? 7) Summer of '66, a book by Shelton Williams, uses the best photos Hershorn took of the incident.
The famous Life photo appears, as does many other images found in the Briscoe digital archive (perhaps all of them, I haven't confirmed).
The book does not contain any images from the UPI series. 8) I was unable to find the UPI photo in the Briscoe digital archive, although not everything is digitized.
It does, however, appear in the digital Getty archive. 9) I could find no instances of Hershorn receiving credit for the image except for the claim made by the Commons uploader, which was, IMO, possibly erroneous.
10) I will continue looking for confirmation. 11) Hershorn's photos are fairly famous, and his son Tad is also a famous jazz photographer and archivist at the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers.
Given how much attention his photos have received, it seems odd that nobody has mentioned Hershorn's connection to the photo in question. Viriditas (talk) 00:45, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
@Viriditas: Yeah, "minor issues" you said. Anyway, a new hook is needed. ALTO and ALT1, which you didn't find interesting, but I also present ALT3: "... that Shel Hershorn lost interest in photojournalism after the assassination of John F. Kennedy?" (JFK or assassination of JFK can be linked if need be). Also, ALT2 is still technically usable, but that probably shouldn't be used due to the issues with the photo.

The diploma notes that her chosen course of study was to be chemistry. That young women were not expected to advance this far in their schooling can be seen from the wording of the printed diploma itself, which ends with the stock phrase: "Der unterzeichnete Prüfungsausschuss hat ihm [sic] demnach das Zeugnis der Reife zuerkannt.” (“The undersigned examination committee has therefore conferred on him [sic] the university entrance diploma.”) In Marianne’s case, the male pronoun “him/ihm” has been struck out and overwritten with “her/ihr.” Despite the opportunities that had opened up for women in the workplace due to the manpower shortages of the First World War, it was still unusual for young women to complete secondary schooling with the intention of continuing at university.

@Launchballer:Well, since they said they "don't have time or energy to fix everything" after removing 6-7K or so, it doesn't look like they have any interest in coming back. and, really, what's the point of going to that length to fix a problem and only afterwards leaving a tag describing the problem? I sure wouldn't do that sort of thing ... it's like adding a whole bunch of sources to an article largely lacking in them, and only then putting {{refimprove}} on the article or section. At the very least leave something on the talk page about some further changes that might be made on the talk page.

If the image is included, it may be appropriate to note in the caption the year the photo was taken, i.e. "Celine Dion in 2013", to avoid the mistaken belief that the photo is of Dion performing the winning song in 1988. Yue🌙 05:12, 14 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
Seasons of Change
( Comment or viewArticle history )
... that "Seasons of Change" was written by Blackfeather members, Neale Johns and John Robinson. It was recorded with help from local group Fraternity's John Bisset and Bon Scott. Robinson promised Scott that Blackfeather would not release the song as a single. Fraternity issued their rendition in March 1971 in Adelaide. When it appeared on local charts, label boss, David Sinclair reneged on that promise and released Blackfeather's version as a single in direct competition?

@Didier Landner: Hello and welcome to DYK. This nomination's hook exceeds 200 characters; please propose a second hook below my comment, either by trimming the current hook (ALT0a: ... that X?) or by proposing a different hook (ALT1: ... that Y?).--Launchballer 23:14, 10 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]
ALT0a: ... that "Seasons of Change" was recorded by Australian band Blackfeather with help from Fraternity's John Bisset and Bon Scott; after Fraternity's version charted in Adelaide, Blackfeather released their rendition as a 1971 single?
ALT1: ... that future AC/DC lead vocalist Bon Scott played recorder on Blackfeather's 1971 single "Seasons of Change"?
Better, although a hook should be one sentence, and brackets aren't allowed (possibly move 1971 to before 'single'). We have a workable hook for this, so full review needed.--Launchballer 01:52, 11 September 2025 (UTC)[reply]

Kushiro Wetlands megasolar issue
( Comment or viewArticle history )
... that Kushiro Wetlands are considered ideal for solar panels, which lead to the increase in solar panel plants in the area?
Source: 「広く平坦な土地」「長い日照時間」「湿原から市街地が近い」という3点が揃う釧路は、開発に絶好の土地。なかでも集中しやすいのは、湿原の南側にある「市街化調整区域」だという。 Kushiro is an ideal location for development, with three characteristics: wide, flat land, long hours of sunshine, and the marshland being close to urban areas. The area where development is most likely to be concentrated is the urbanization control zone south of the marshland.
ALT1: ... that the solar farms in Kushiro are called by the locals as "sea of mega solar farms"? Source: The Asahi Shimbun

Comment: Open for suggestion for new hook. Also, the issue is still ongoing and I may update it quite a few time every day. Also I moved the article.

Note: Articles intended to be held for special occasion dates should be nominated within seven days of creations from the start of expansion, or promotion to Good Article status. The nomination should be made at least one week prior to the occasion date, to allow time for reviews and promotions through the prep and queue sets, but not more than six weeks in advance. The proposed occasion must be deemed sufficiently special by reviewers. The timeline limitations, including the six week maximum, may be waived by consensus, if a request is made at WT:DYK, but requests are not always successful.
