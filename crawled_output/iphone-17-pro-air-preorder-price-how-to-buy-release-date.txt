Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.Apple’s complete 2025 lineup, including the iPhone 17, the 17 Pro, the 17 Pro Max, and the thin iPhone Air, are available to preorder. They’ll be available next Friday, September 19th, and ordering now is how you can ensure you’ll be among the first to receive your order.Beyond the Air’s shockingly slim design, Apple’s latest iPhone lineup features a number of notable updates that seem worth upgrading for, especially if you have a phone that’s a few generations old. The standard iPhone 17 — which is a shockingly good value, by the way — now features a larger 6.3-inch display with ProMotion and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Meanwhile, the Pro model has returned to an aluminum build while adding the biggest battery of any iPhone yet. The iPhone Air and Pro models have a lot in common, including having a raised “plateau” bump on the back, which contains not just cameras but some internal components, too, leaving some extra room in the phones for larger batteries.The iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and Air start at $799, $1,099, $1,199, and $999, respectively, and each model starts with 256GB of storage. Below, you’ll find more information about each new device, along with where you can place a preorder.RelatedApple iPhone Air event: the eight biggest announcementsiPhone Air hands-onOur first look at the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro MaxHere’s a first look at the iPhone 17In this articleWhere to preorder the iPhone AirWhere to preorder the iPhone 17Where to preorder the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro MaxUS carrier deals and incentivesWhere to preorder the iPhone AirThe iPhone Air finally made its debut after months of rumors.
