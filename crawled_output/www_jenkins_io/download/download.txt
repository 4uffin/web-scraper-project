Deploying Jenkins in public cloud
Many public cloud vendors provide their own Jenkins installation guides and packages.
The guides provide instructions to deploy, maintain, and upgrade on the specific public cloud.
Such guides may be used to quickly deploy Jenkins and, in many cases,
to get a controller preconfigured to be used within the public cloud
(e.g. bundled plugins, integrations with public cloud services, etc.).
