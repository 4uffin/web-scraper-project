The annual Hacktoberfest is back!
Please join us as we celebrate and support open-source during the month of October.
Contributors can earn badges and improve their open source contribution skills.
The Jenkins project will participate once again in the event.
We invite you to contribute to the Jenkins project but also, as maintainers, to welcome and help newcomers.
Contributors
This is what contributors need to know to participate and complete Hacktoberfest:
Register on the event website anytime between September 15 and October 31
Pull requests can be made in any jenkinsci or jenkins-infra GitHub repository thatâs participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the "hacktoberfest" topic in the repo)
Project maintainers must accept your pull requests for them to count towards your total
Have a total of 6 high-quality pull requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 to complete Hacktoberfest
You will unlock a digital badge when you register for Hacktoberfest, and level it up with each of your 6 pull requests accepted during Hacktoberfest
Jenkinsâ specific details can be found on the Jenkins Hacktoberfest page.

Maintainers
Jenkins plugin maintainers can prepare for Hacktoberfest contributions by following these best practices:
Add the "hacktoberfest" topic to your repository to opt in to Hacktoberfest and indicate youâre looking for contributions.
Only add the "hacktoberfest" topic to your repository if you are willing to promptly review Hacktoberfest pull requests
Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file with contribution guidelines to your repository
Apply the "good-first-issue" label to GitHub issues you want contributors to help with in your GitHub project
Add the ânewbie-friendlyâ label to Jira issues that are well suited to new contributors
Choose issues that have a well-defined scope and are self-contained
Be ready to review pull requests, accepting those that are valid by merging them, leaving an overall approving review, or by adding the "hacktoberfest-accepted" label
Reject any spammy requests you receive by labeling them as "spam" and any other invalid contributions by closing them or labeling them as "invalid"
