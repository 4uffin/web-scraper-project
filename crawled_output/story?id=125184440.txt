A study of the reef systems a year later revealed "grim" results -- especially for the threatened staghorn coral, of which less than 22% survived, according to Climate.gov. About 90% of elkhorn coral, an important primary species for reef structure building, was also lost in 2023, O'Neil said."The summer of 2023 was especially devastating for corals in the state of Florida, most notably for elkhorn and staghorn corals, which used to be very common off our coasts," O'Neil said.This image, released by The Florida Aquarium, shows Boulder Brain Coral.The Florida AquariumSurprisingly, the reefs of brain coral that had been spawned at The Florida Aquarium and planted on the coasts did "pretty well" during the 2023 bleaching event, O'Neil said."We still don't know exactly why that is," she said. "It could be because they are young and maybe just stronger, or because they weren't in the ocean as long as other corals."MORE: Climate change threatening more than 40% of the world's corals with extinction, conservation group saysFlorida's Coral Reef Restoration and Recovery Initiative aims to rebuild 25% of Florida's corals that have been lost. One of the main focuses is breeding coral species that are more resilient to future heat waves, O'Neil said.The practice of selectively breeding corals entails techniques that have been done with terrestrial species and agriculture for hundreds of years, O'Neil said"Can we breed corals that can withstand higher temperatures? We're just really starting to scratch the surface on that," she said.This image, released by The Florida Aquarium, shows Symmetrical Brain Coral.The Florida AquariumThe spawning coral parents were rescued from reefs to protect them from the effects of stony coral tissue loss disease, a "highly lethal" disease that was first detected off Florida coasts in 2014 and has since spread rapidly throughout the Caribbean.The Florida Aquarium has 100 adult corals that were rescued from disease and then rescued from the 2023 marine heat wave. They are kept in tanks that mimic the natural seasonal cues that would indicate to a coral that it is time to reproduce, O'Neil said.MORE: Indigenous communities are increasingly teaming up with scientists to conserve marine ecosystemsThe lab creates tiny coral larvae and settles them onto a small tile or piece of rock, allowing them to grow into new coral.Popular ReadsIraq's Yazidis rediscover lost history through photos found in museum archiveSep 13, 7:45 AMGov.

The hope is that they will live and grow -- and encourage new growth and marine ecosystems -- for thousands of years to come.A beautiful thriving underwater reef scene off the coast of Key Largo, Florida.STOCK IMAGE/Getty ImagesCurrently, there are so few corals left in Florida that the distance between potential parents is too far for them to reproduce on their own, O'Neil said."This is where we come in and focus on spawning them in our laboratory and producing thousands of babies every year," she said.MORE: Scientists are using underwater speakers to help restore degraded coral reefs: StudyThe new coral will represent a "lifeline" for Florida's reef system, O'Neil said. The juvenile corals will be shared with partners to support coral restoration efforts in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the Kristin Jacobs Coral Aquatic Preserve in southeast Florida.Climate change and rising ocean temperatures are continuing to threaten corals around the world.Dive site John Kennekamp Coral Reef State Park is shown in Key Largo, Fla.STOCK IMAGE/Getty ImagesApproximately 44% of global reef-building coral species are at risk of extinction due to climate change, the International Union for Conservation of Nature said in its 2024 Red List of Threatened Species.MORE: 'Strikingly warm' ocean heat wave off Florida coasts could decimate corals, other marine life, experts sayAbout 84% of the world's reefs were impacted between January 2023 and April 2025, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced earlier this year.Sponsored Content by TaboolaPopular ReadsIraq's Yazidis rediscover lost history through photos found in museum archiveSep 13, 7:45 AMGov.
