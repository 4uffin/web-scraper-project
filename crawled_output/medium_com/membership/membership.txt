That’s not what you get on Medium. You can actually find content you can build your brain with. I appreciate that, both as a reader and a writer.Cassie Kozyrkov, Chief Decision Scientist at Google and Medium memberMedium has proved a game-changer for me, and quickly became the subscription I value the most, and I have quite a few. The cost is nothing compared to the value Medium generates for me month after month.Enrique Dans, Professor of Innovation at IE Business School and Medium memberFor us tech folks, Medium membership unlocks a whole treasure trove of high-quality articles. One good technology book could sell for over the Medium membership fee amount. It’s your choice whether to buy one book, or buy hundreds and thousands of books by unlocking member-only reading on Medium.
