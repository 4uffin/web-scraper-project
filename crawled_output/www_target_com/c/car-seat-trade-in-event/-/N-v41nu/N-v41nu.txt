This limited-time car seat trade-in program allows families to trade in old car seats—whether it’s an infant car seat, toddler car seat, or booster car seat—and receive savings toward a new car seat. Not only does this event make upgrading affordable, but it also promotes recycling and proper disposal of old car seat materials that are no longer safe for everyday use. Modern car seat materials and innovations are designed with both protection and convenience in mind. Parents today are often searching for solutions that balance safety with ease of use—because parents are looking for convenience & mobility in every stage of their child’s growth. The newest options include the Graco Turn2Me car seat, a 360 car seat that rotates to make getting your child in and out easier than ever. For families on the go, a car seat stroller combo or a travel system stroller and car seat provides a seamless transition from car to sidewalk, saving time and reducing hassle. During the Car Seat Trade-in Event, you’ll find leading brands known for innovation, safety, and style. Graco, Evenflo, Joie, and Britax continue to lead with convertible and rotating car seats that grow with your child. Brands like Baby Trend, Safety 1st, and Chicco offer reliable toddler and booster options, while Maxi-Cosi and Lalo bring a sleek European-inspired touch to infant travel gear. For families focused on lifestyle products, Mockingbird, Skip Hop, 4moms, Baby Einstein, and Baby Delight extend convenience and comfort across every stage of parenting. No matter what you’re shopping for—whether it’s a rotating model for easier daily use, a booster seat for an older child, or a full travel system stroller and car seat for ultimate mobility—the Car Seat Trade-in Event is the perfect opportunity to upgrade without overspending. You’ll save money with exclusive discounts, contribute to eco-friendly recycling efforts, and most importantly, give your child the safest ride possible. Be sure to check for clearly marked drop-off boxes in stores where you can safely leave your old car seat. FAQs Q: What types of car seats can I trade in? A: You can trade in almost any seat, including an infant car seat, toddler car seat, booster car seat, and combination seats—even old car models no longer in use. Q: Do I have to buy the same type of car seat I traded in? A: No. You can upgrade to what best fits your family’s needs, from a 360 car seat like the Graco Turn2Me car seat to a car seat stroller combo or even a travel system stroller and new car seat that offers greater flexibility. Q: Why should I participate in a trade-in event? A: Car seats have expiration dates and may not meet updated safety standards. The Car Seat Trade-in Event lets you recycle safely via drop-off box locations, save money through discounts, and upgrade to the latest technology from trusted brands like Evenflo, Joie, Chicco, Maxi-Cosi, and Britax. It’s also a great way to ensure you’re using car seats made from safer, modern seat materials.Show moreSponsoredGet top deals, latest trends, and more.Email addressSign upPrivacy policyFooter
