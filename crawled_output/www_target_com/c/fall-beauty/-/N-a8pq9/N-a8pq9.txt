This season is about leaning into warmth while making sure your complexion feels healthy and hydrating, even as the weather pulls moisture away. From bold lips to effortless skin, this year’s makeup trends celebrate balance and versatility, so you can craft makeup looks that transition seamlessly from day to night. Skin First: Hydration Is the Hero Before you reach for your favorite fall makeup, think about the canvas. Cooler weather often brings dryness, so swap lightweight summer products for richer creams and serums that lock in hydration. Ingredients like ceramides, squalane, and hyaluronic acid help reinforce your skin barrier, ensuring your base makeup glides on smoothly. Layering a luminous primer or a dewy SPF sets the stage for glowing, natural-looking beauty trends that feel seasonal yet wearable. Fall Makeup Trends to Try This fall, complexion is less about matte perfection and more about lived-in radiance. Lightweight, medium-coverage foundations paired with cream blushes in terracotta, berry, or burnt rose shades create a cozy, just-in-from-the-cold flush. Add a subtle candlelit highlight to the high points of your face for that effortless autumn glow. For eyes, this year’s makeup trends lean toward earthy metallics—bronze, copper, and golden tones—that capture the richness of fall foliage. Pair a soft smoky liner in espresso or plum with a sweep of shimmer on the lid for an instantly seasonal vibe. If you’re feeling bold, forest green and burnt orange accents are having a moment, turning classic makeup looks into fresh, modern statements. Lips: The Statement of the Season Bold, plush lips define fall beauty every year, but 2025 brings an emphasis on comfort. Matte formulas are giving way to balmy stains and hydrating bullet lipsticks in shades of deep blackberry, brick red, and cinnamon rose. The key is impact without dryness—a lip that makes a statement but feels soft all day. Finishing Touches Don’t forget nails: cocoa, oxblood, and mossy greens are perfect seasonal companions. To keep your overall look modern, balance is everything—pair bold lips with minimal eyes, or play up smoky eyes with a neutral lip. FAQs Q: How can I keep my fall makeup from drying out my skin? A: Choose formulas that are labeled as hydrating, and always prep with moisturizer and primer. Cream-based products work best in cooler months to avoid emphasizing dryness. Q: What are the top fall makeup colors this year? A: Bronze, copper, terracotta, and berry shades dominate the season. For lips, deep reds and blackberry tones are trending, while eyes get playful with forest greens and burnt oranges. Q: What’s the easiest way to update my look for fall beauty trends? A: Swap your summer gloss for a hydrating berry lipstick, add a warm-toned blush, and incorporate metallic eyeshadows in copper or gold. Small tweaks create instantly seasonal makeup looks without a full overhaul. Show moreSponsoredGet top deals, latest trends, and more.Email addressSign upPrivacy policyFooter
