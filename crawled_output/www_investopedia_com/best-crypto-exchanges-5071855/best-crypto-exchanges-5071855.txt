Why We Chose It
The Kraken crypto exchange is Investopedia’s choice for low fees. Investors who value low cost but need access to high-quality amenities and resources won’t find a better exchange that consistently offers both. With a minimum deposit of just $10, Prospective clients can set up an account and start trading their favorite cryptocurrency.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Low fees for beginning and advanced cryptocurrency traders
A good selection of educational resources and research amenities
Access to web, desktop, mobile, and Kraken Pro platform
Cons
Kraken is not available in all 50 U.S. states
Does not offer FDIC or SIPC insurance or other criminal insurance.

Overview
Kraken was founded in 2011. While the company has gone fully remote, its head office is in San Francisco, CA. Aside from its digital presence, Kraken operates worldwide in over 190 countries, services over 15 million clients, and has established itself as one of the premier cryptocurrency exchanges that offer the best low-fee service.
Depending on the user's 30-day trading volume, Kraken clients pay maker fees between 0.00% and 0.25% and taker fees between 0.08% and 0.40%. Other fees, such as deposit and address setup fees, come at no extra cost. In addition to its low-fee structure, Kraken offers a unique service that caters to multiple types of clients at various skill levels.
For instance, Kraken’s regular platform enables beginning and low-volume traders to start trading and storing their cryptocurrency with a $10 minimum deposit, access to over 480 cryptocurrency assets, an excellent selection of educational and news content, and the ability to create and utilize Kraken's exclusive wallet. Advanced traders who need more sophisticated features should consider Kraken Pro. This platform is designed for traders who need access to advanced order types, charting, and screening capabilities not offered on the original platform.
The Kraken Pro's best feature is that it’s free to use and adheres to the same fee structure as the basic platform, so advanced traders don’t have to worry about extra costs. However, Kraken comes with potential drawbacks. While Kraken operates in many countries, the exchange is not available in all 50 U.S. states, such as Washington, New York, and Maine. Furthermore, in many other states, additional restrictions apply to activities such as staking, payment services, funding, and custody. Prospective clients interested in a specific service should check if it is legal in their respective state. It’s also important to note that Kraken does not offer any insurance for its users.

Why We Chose It
Best For Security
Gemini is our top choice for security. The crypto exchange has sound security standards, a commitment to compliance, and third-party audits that ensure its security infrastructure operates at a high level. It’s also one of the few crypto exchanges to offer FDIC and crypto insurance to help further safeguard traders’ accounts.
Best for Experienced Traders
In addition to being our choice for security, Gemini is also our top choice for experienced traders due to its ActiveTrader software. The platform offers experienced users the ability to conduct advanced charting techniques, use advanced order types, and trade futures and perpetual contracts.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Highly secure and compliant platform
Available in all 50 U.S. states
Pass-through FDIC insurance for uninvested cash and crypto insurance
Cons
Offers a low number of cryptocurrencies
Customer support only has a request form
Complex fee structure
Overview
Gemini was founded in 2014 and is currently headquartered in New York, N.Y. Due to its high security standards, Gemini is our choice for users who value security for their cryptocurrency holdings. By default, user accounts are equipped with two-factor authentication. However, Gemini also supports external hardware security keys, such as YubiKey, to secure accounts further.
Gemini holds most customer assets in offshore cold storage, and it works to facilitate easy transfers of assets between the exchange and consumer wallets. Gemini also subjects itself to routine third-party audits and affirms that it has completed SOC 1 and SOC 2 Type 2 exams and its ISO 27001 certification. Users also have the option to store their cryptocurrency in either Gemini’s hot wallet, which is insured, or its cold wallet.
Gemini is also our choice for experienced crypto traders. While high-net-worth individuals can enjoy its high-security standards, they can also appreciate the advanced software it offers with its trademarked tool, ActiveTrader. Even though it offers more than 70 cryptocurrencies, it's still considered a low amount for a major crypto exchange. However, Gemini’s ActiveTrader deserves recognition as a highly advanced platform capable of reaching trade execution speeds of 65 microseconds. Experienced traders also have access to high-risk assets such as perpetual contracts and indices. ActiveTrader also provides advanced charting and order types that further assist traders in their cryptocurrency ventures.
Gemini does have some drawbacks. Its fee structure, at first glance, appears reasonable. Depending on your 30-day trade volume, maker fees can range from 0.00% to 0.20%, while taker fees can range from 0.03% to 0.40%. However, your order type to execute a trade can trigger more fees. Other fees include a 2.50% fiat transfer fee for using PayPal and a $25 wire transfer fee for fiat withdrawals. Customer support should also be noted, as traders must submit a form to deal with issues like account management and fraud.

On with Coinbase
Why We Chose It
Coinbase is best for beginners due to its sleek user interface, solid security infrastructure, and a reasonable fee structure that is easy to understand. While Coinbase offers an excellent service for investors new to crypto trading, the company also provides more advanced features, which are nonetheless vital for beginning crypto traders. With Coinbase's comprehensive educational resources, beginners can enhance their skills and utilize Coinbase’s more advanced trading tools when they are ready, without having to jump to another exchange that caters to more experienced traders.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Excellent educational and research resources
Reasonable fee structure and a good selection of cryptocurrency
Available in 172 countries and offers access to web, desktop, and mobile platforms
Cons
It may not be a good fit for established traders
Does not offer margin or option trading and only provides future trading on select crypto
Must chat or request a call when contacting customer service
Overview
Coinbase is headquartered in San Francisco and was founded in 2012. Since its inception as a cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase has become one of the premier leaders in the cryptocurrency space and has done the one thing many crypto exchanges fail to do: cater to beginner crypto investors.
Cryptocurrency is a complicated alternative investment that requires careful study by traders. However, Coinbase’s educational resources, which cover basic and advanced trading topics, can help clarify its complexity. In addition, Coinbase offers two charting versions: a basic and an advanced version.
The basic version is a simple chart with essential data such as market cap, volume, and other metrics that beginning traders will find valuable. However, it does not provide any charting tools, which is why Coinbase also has an advanced version. The advanced version offers charting features such as Fibonacci, drawing tools, and projections. Even with advanced trading software, Coinbase may not be a great fit even for experienced traders, as the exchange lacks options and margin trading and only offers futures trading on specific coins.
Investors who open an account with Coinbase will see that it has a reasonable fee structure. Its maker fee ranges between 0.00% to 0.40%, and its taker fees are 0.05% to 0.60%. Also, users can trade more than 300 cryptocurrencies while being able to survey over 9,000 digital assets. While Coinbase provides web, desktop, and mobile platforms, its customer service could be better. Users can contact a service rep through chat or request a call for further assistance.

Important
On May 11, 2025, Coinbase received an email communication from a threat actor notifying the company that internal data and customer information, including names, contact details, partial SSNs, and transaction history, had been accessed after allegedly bribing non-U.S. contractors. The attacker demanded payment to keep the data private. Coinbase says no passwords or funds were compromised and has not paid the ransom.

Why We Chose It
Best Mobile App
Crypto.com is our choice for the best mobile app provider due to its major focus on its mobile platform and all that that entails. Crypto traders can buy, sell, use, and trade crypto from the palms of their hands.
Best for Bitcoin
Crypto.com is also our choice for Bitcoin traders and investors due to its reasonable fee structure and excellent security infrastructure, which is important to many Bitcoin investors and users. Crypto.com provides Bitcoin options and futures for Bitcoin derivative traders.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Allows Bitcoin options and futures
Reasonable fee structure and a good selection of cryptocurrency
Excellent mobile platform and debit card program
Cons
Available in fewer than 100 countries
Only offers chat service for assistance
Crypto.com only provides access to a hot wallet
Overview
Crypto.com, headquartered in the Central Region of Singapore, boasts an impressive customer base of over 150 million users in more than 90 countries, which isn’t bad for a company that was founded in 2016. The main reason why Crypto.com is so popular goes far beyond its marketing campaigns. It's one of the best crypto exchanges for mobile-first traders and Bitcoin holders.
Mobile users considering Crypto.com can expect a sleek and fully intuitive mobile platform that offers more than convenience. Mobile users have access to more than 400 cryptocurrencies. Depending on the eligible cryptocurrency, users can earn rewards through Crypto.com’s Earn program and its Staking program. In addition to buying, selling, and using cryptocurrency as well as trading derivatives, Crypto.com also provides its mobile users with sophisticated trading features, allowing them to automate their trades. Furthermore, Crypto.com includes access to its Visa debit card, a cryptocurrency-connected card enabling users to easily use their crypto to buy goods and services on the private market.
Along with its mobile capabilities, Crypto.com is also best for Bitcoin. The platform offers a wide array of trading, from derivatives to regular long-term investments. The company has a reasonable fee structure, which also applies to its mobile platform. However, depending on their 30-day trade volume, users can expect maker fees to be between 0.08% and 0.25% and taker fees to be between 0.18% and 0.50%. VIP users who hold a tiered amount of Cronos (CRO) can enjoy additional benefits, such as discounts on maker/taker fees and debit card rewards. Bitcoin traders will also have access to Bitcoin options and futures, which is an important feature for traders and investors alike.
Before users sign up for an account, they should consider the downsides. For instance, Crypto.com is not readily available in many countries. Before committing to opening an account, you should check to see if Crypto.com legally operates in your geographical location. While Crypto.com has an excellent support center to help users resolve issues on their own, it only provides access to a live chat feature for further assistance.
Best for Altcoins

BitMart

Open Account
(opens in a new tab)
Why We Chose It
Bitmart, which offers over 1,700 cryptocurrencies, is our top choice as the best crypto exchange for altcoins. While the exchange lacks fundamental trading features, it's an excellent place to buy cryptocurrency that traders would not usually have to access on other exchanges.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Access to over 1,700 cryptocurrencies
Allows social trading through its copy-trading feature
BitMart Academy provides excellent educational resources
Cons
Does not display its security infrastructure
Its fee structure is not publicly disclosed
Only supports crypto deposits to fund account
Overview
BitMart, founded in 2017 and headquartered in New York, N.Y., is our top choice for altcoins due to its accessibility to over 1,700 tradable cryptocurrencies. While still offering access to the most important coins on the market, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, it provides other coins that may be difficult to find on other exchanges. It's important to note that cryptocurrency poses significant risks even with established digital coins. Smaller, less established coins pose even more risks, with liquidity and market manipulation being a serious concern for crypto holders.
BitMart also offers its users an interesting way to trade cryptocurrency: copy trading. BitMart users can access statistics for its top traders and see metrics such as return on investment (ROI) for cryptos they traded, along with their trading history and current trade positions. However, traders should remember that past success does not automatically lead to future gains and should proceed cautiously. While BitMart has advanced charting capabilities, it’s only for futures trading. In addition, BitMart does not offer some of the order types that certain competitors offer. To date, BitMart only provides two order types: market and limit orders.
Through BitMart Academy, the exchange offers excellent educational resources that cover various topics, from basic knowledge to more complex subjects. While it offers a robust selection of crypto, there are some drawbacks. Its fee structure is not publicly disclosed. Prospective customers will need to create an account to see it. In addition, the only way to fund a new account is to transfer crypto from a wallet or another exchange.
BitMart claims to have an advanced risk control system with multi-signature technologies and a hybrid hot and cold wallet storage. Unlike some competitors, BitMart does not reveal its security infrastructure for users' accounts. For instance, it does not publicly state its security certifications or disclose whether it subjects itself to third-party audits. We can confirm that the company equips users with multifactor authentication.
