The best 1-year CD rate right now is 4.50% APY from HUSTL Digital Credit Union—nearly 2.8 times the national average rate for a 12-month CD. All CDs and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Sept. 24, 2025.
Certificates of deposit (CDs) allow you to lock in a fixed rate on your savings for a certain amount of time. Opening one now could be an especially smart move because yields are expected to fall later this year when the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. CD rates have declined from their peak in the past couple of years, but they're still in the mid-4% range, well above inflation.
Investopedia has been researching CD rates every business day since 2019, tracking more than 200 banks and credit unions offering nationally available CDs. Below are the top CD and annuity rates available from our partners, followed by the best CD rates that we've found from our research.

To find you the best 1-year CD rates nationwide, we look at factors that help readers choose the best CD, like term, early withdrawal penalty, and minimum opening deposit. CDs with terms of 10 to 14 months and minimum deposit requirements of up to $25,000 are eligible for our 1-year rankings.
In cases where more than one institution pays the same annual percentage yield (APY), we've prioritized CDs by the shortest term, then the CD requiring a smaller minimum deposit, and if still a tie, alphabetically by institution name.
Tip
The CDs in this list may be a good fit if you're looking to reach a short-term savings or investment goal. If a 1-year CD is too much of a commitment though, you can always consider the best CD rates now for shorter terms or even a top-paying high-yield savings account.
Why You Can Trust Our Recommendations for the Best 1-Year CD Rates
Investopedia collects thousands of CD rates from hundreds of banks and credit unions every weekday. When ranking CD rates, we look at factors that will help readers choose the best CD, like term, early withdrawal penalty, and minimum opening deposit.
Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best CD rates since 2019. Back in 2019 when we first started tracking CD rates, the highest rate on a 1-year CD was 2.60%. Over the years, we've seen CD rates decrease and then increase again to the levels they are at now. The top 1-year CD rate today is over 2x what the top rate was when we started writing about the best CD rates in 2019.
The CDs we recommend must be available nationwide and these certificates typically pay three times the national average. To be eligible for our 1-year CD rankings, each CD's minimum opening deposit requirement cannot exceed $25,000 and must be offered by an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union (which covers up to $250,000 per depositor). Terms of 10 to 14 months are included in our 1-year CD rankings.

In the News
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at its Sept. 17 meeting. This is the first rate cut since December 2024 and lowers the federal funds rate to a range of 4.00%–4.25%. Committee members are projecting two more quarter-point reductions before the end of the year. CD rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which means CD rates are expected to decline as the Fed lowers rates.
What Is a 1-Year CD and How Does It Work?
Certificates of deposit (CDs) with a 1-year term are special types of accounts with interest rates that are usually higher than other savings accounts. In exchange for the high rate, you must keep your funds locked up for about 10 to 14 months. This may be good for your short-term savings since you can access the money by next year.
The reason banks and credit unions are willing to pay higher rates on 1-year CDs is because they can generally count on those funds staying in the account, unlike funds that can come and go unpredictably in a savings, money market, or checking account.
Banks and credit unions offer CDs in a variety of terms, from 1 month up to 10 years, so you can choose how long you're willing to lock up your funds. The most common CD terms, however, range from 6 months to 5 years, with 1-year certificates being the most widely available of all.
The date your CD ends is called its maturity date, and although it’s not impossible to withdraw your funds before maturity, you’ll incur a financial penalty if you do so.
Fast Fact
When asked in June where they would be most likely to put an extra $10,000, 11% of Investopedia readers said they would choose CDs, above high-yield savings accounts and stock index funds, but trailing individual stocks and ETFs.
Who Is a CD Best For?
CDs are best for people who want to grow their money in a low-risk account and can afford not to touch it for months or years. They're good for short- to medium-term goals like buying a home. A CD could help you save for the down payment, earning a guaranteed rate that's more than you'd get on a basic savings account, and without the risks of investing in the stock market. Because CDs have an early withdrawal penalty, they're also helpful if you want to make sure you're not tempted to tap your savings for other expenses.
Other types of accounts are generally better for long-term savings, such as for retirement. Historically, the stock market has delivered better returns than CDs over the long term. But as you get closer to retirement, you may want to diversify your portfolio and lower your risk by putting some of your money into a CD.
If you're building up emergency savings, you'd be better off choosing a high-yield savings account instead of a CD. If you suddenly need to access your money for an unexpected cost, it will be much easier to withdraw from a savings account than a CD.
Is a 1-Year CD Right for You?
"We got two 1-year CDs because the interest rates were better than what we were earning on our savings accounts. It was very simple to sign up and only took a few minutes at the bank. The time frame for the CD was good; short-term worked for us in case we need the money," said Helen Koby, a retired New Jersey resident who opened two 1-year CDs with her husband in 2023.
Pros and Cons of the Best 1-Year CDs
Pros
Fixed rate for a full year
Higher APY than liquid accounts
Predictable earnings and date of withdrawal
Extremely safe account
Helps deter spending
Cons
Withdraw early and pay a penalty
Can't add to deposit
If rates rise, you may miss out
If rates drop, you may wish you had a longer-term CD
Pros Explained
Fixed interest rate for a full year: Once you open a CD, you lock in the rate you’ll receive for the full term, no matter what the Federal Reserve does or how other interest rates move. This is a big advantage if rates are predicted to fall, and it can help you stay on track toward your short-term savings goals.Higher APY than liquid accounts: Banks and credit unions are willing to pay higher rates on CDs, where they know the money will stay put, than on savings, money market, and checking accounts, where you can withdraw funds more often.  Fully predictable earnings and date of withdrawal: Since a CD’s rate and term are fixed, you know exactly when you’ll be able to withdraw the funds and exactly how much interest you’ll have earned by that date. Extremely safe, with almost no risk: When you open a CD at an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union, you are federally protected on up to $250,000 in deposits, even if the institution fails.Helps deter spending: If you find it hard not to dip into your savings, the early withdrawal penalty on CDs can serve as a useful roadblock to unwanted spending.
Cons Explained
Early withdrawal of the funds will incur a penalty: If you find you need the funds in your CD sooner than the maturity date, you’ll be hit with an early withdrawal penalty that will reduce your earnings.
You can’t add to your deposit: Once you make your deposit for a CD, that’s a final decision. You cannot make additional deposits or add money.
If rates rise, you may miss out on a higher rate: If rates go up while you own your CD, you may have been able to score a higher rate if you had locked in later.
If rates drop, you may wish you’d chosen a longer CD: Alternatively, if rates begin declining, you may regret not locking in your great rate for a much longer duration.
Tip
Be sure to carefully review the terms of your prospective CD before signing off on it and funding the account. But if you change your mind about the CD within the first few days of opening it, some banks offer a grace period enabling you to quickly exit penalty-free.
How Much Money Does $1,000 Make in a Top-Paying 1-Year CD?
The amount of money in interest that a $1,000 deposit can make in a 1-year CD will depend on the interest rate. Below are three different scenarios based on three different interest rates you could get on a 1-year CD:
Deposit
APY
CD Term
Interest Earned
Total
$1,000
5.00%
1 Year
$50.00
$1,050.00
$1,000
4.75%
1 Year
$47.50
$1,047.50
$1,000
4.50%
1 Year
$45.00
$1,045.00
The higher your deposit, the higher the interest you will earn from a CD. If you had $10,000 to deposit in a 1-year CD with these same rates, you could earn between $450 and $500 in interest in one year (as long as you do not withdraw your money early).
How to Find the Best 1-Year CD
Shop around to learn where the highest 1-year CD rates are offered. You may find CD options at banks, credit unions, or even brokerage accounts.
The best 1-year CD for you will be where you feel most comfortable stashing your cash and leaving it for 12 months. While 12 months can feel like a long time, it may help you reach your short-term savings goals faster.
Look at the early withdrawal penalty. If you need the money sooner than the term's end, you'll likely pay this penalty (though there are some CDs with no penalties).
Compare your options, review the terms, and then deposit the money to start earning interest.
How to Open a 1-Year CD
Opening a CD is generally no more difficult than opening a savings or checking account. Follow these steps—almost all of the certificates in our rankings of the top nationally available CD rates can be opened online within 10 or 15 minutes.
Provide personal information and identify yourself in the application—online or in person.
Specify how you’ll fund the new CD. The most common approach is an electronic transfer from another financial institution. However, depending on the institution, you may also have options to send a check or wire money.
Read the written terms of your CD agreement, which will stipulate the interest rate you'll be paid, the date of the CD's maturity, the frequency with which your interest will be paid and compounded, and the specific penalty calculation that will be used if you request to withdraw your funds before maturity.
Important
If you are funding the new certificate with a very large deposit, you’ll want to check with the institution on any external transfer limits that could be an obstacle.
Once your CD is open and funded, it's generally a "set it and forget it" product. You'll receive monthly or quarterly statements showing your certificate's growth, but hopefully, you can leave the funds untouched until the maturity date rolls around.
Although the bank or credit union will notify you in advance of the CD maturing, it's wise to set a calendar reminder for yourself so you can be ready with a decision on what to do with the funds when the CD expires.
When Is the Best Time to Get a 1-Year CD?
The best time to get a 1-year CD is right before interest rates drop. There's no easy way to know when that will happen, though, so you'll have to decide when the time is right for you.
For example, if the 1-year CD you're planning to open has a rate of 5.00% APY right now, and you believe the Fed will lower the fed funds rate in the next month or two, then now might be the best time to get that CD. That's because CD rates typically track the fed funds rate, so if the Fed lowers rates, your choice of 1-year CD could also see its rate fall.
Of course, the best time to get a CD will also depend on your situation, and you may need to have a certain amount for the deposit, as well.
Note
The national average interest rate for a 1-year CD is 1.70% APY, according to the FDIC. The best CD rates nationwide are nearly three times higher, so be sure to shop around to find the winning rate and institution for you.
What If I Need to Withdraw My Money Early?
Early withdrawal penalties, or EWPs, differ greatly among banks and credit unions.
"Before purchasing a CD, make sure you know what would happen if you needed to break the CD prematurely," said Douglas Boneparth, a member of Investopedia’s Financial Advisor Council. "Would you be giving up all or some of the interest you've earned?"
For a one-year term, the most common EWP is three or six months' worth of interest. What that means is, if you cash in your CD before its maturity date, the funds returned to you will be docked by the amount of interest the CD would have earned in three or six months.
But don't assume all EWPs are similar, or even reasonable. You may find one that charges a whole year's worth of interest, while another assesses a mild 30 days' interest. Still others have more complicated or onerous policies that can even eat into your principal. That's why due diligence is critical before funding any CD. You want to be sure you understand what you're signing up for. And when two choices are relatively equal, choose the CD with the milder penalty.
CD Rates From Big Banks and Credit Unions
Some of the biggest banks and credit unions—like the ones you may see commercials for on TV—don't offer the highest CD rates. When choosing a CD, we always recommend looking for one with a high interest rate, a minimum deposit that you can afford, and a term that works for your timeline. If one of the top nationwide CD rates doesn't meet your needs, you can always look at a big-name bank or credit union. You may already have a relationship with one of these institutions, making opening a CD easy. Here are a few banks and credit unions you may want to explore:
Citibank CD Rates
U.S. Bank CD Rates
Chase Bank CD Rates
Bank of America CD Rates
Navy Federal CD Rates
Capital One CD Rates
Wells Fargo CD Rates
TD Bank CD Rates
PNC Bank CD Rates
Charles Schwab CD Rates

Alternatives to a 1-Year CD
A 1-year CD won’t be the best savings option in all cases, of course. Fortunately, there is no shortage of alternatives, depending on your situation.
1-Year CDs vs. Longer-Term CDs
If you can leave your funds untouched for longer than a year, it’s worth shopping the longer CD terms, such as 18 months or 2 years. You may be able to score a higher rate on one of those CDs. Or you may want to opt for a CD rate that’s not quite as high, but that will last further into the future.
1-Year CDs vs. Shorter-Term CDs
If you want to move some of your money from regular savings into a CD, but you just don’t feel comfortable with the year-long commitment, 3-month and 6-month CD terms are available from most banks and credit unions that sell CDs.
1-Year CDs vs. Savings Accounts
If one year seems like too long to keep your money locked up in a CD, a savings account may be a better option. But don't open just any savings account—a high-yield savings account that pays a competitive interest rate is best. While you may not be able to earn as much as the highest rate on a 1-year CD, you will still earn more than you would in a traditional savings account. Plus, the money is accessible whenever you need it.
1-Year CDs vs. Money Market Accounts
Another option if you want to keep your money more accessible is a money market account. A money market account acts like a savings account, but allows check-writing privileges. Money market accounts also pay high interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts and allow more flexibility with withdrawals than a CD.
Note
Remember that the interest rates on liquid accounts, like savings and money market accounts, can change at any time.
1-Year CDs vs. Investing and Brokerage Accounts
Investing accounts can help you save and invest money in stocks, bonds, ETFs, index funds, and more. However, when you invest money like this, usually with a brokerage, it's not as easy to withdraw it if you should need it.
While CDs come with early withdrawal penalties and taxes on the earnings, investing accounts work differently. If you sell investments you may be selling them for more or less than you bought them for. You may have to pay capital gains taxes, which vary depending on how long you invested the money. It may take a few days to get your money from the broker and into your bank account.
With a CD, you know exactly when you'll get the money back after the term ends. You may also be able to open a CD right at your current bank or credit union. You'll also be taxed on the CD's earnings, but it's taxed as ordinary income, not as capital gains taxes.
Note
Some brokerage and robo-advisor accounts also offer cash management accounts that pay high interest rates and can house your uninvested cash, much like a savings account.
1-Year CDs vs. I Bonds
I bonds are U.S. government bonds designed to protect your savings against inflation, hence the name. But while they sometimes pay rates much better than CDs, sometimes the rate is inferior. For example, for I bonds issued between May 1, 2025, and October 31, 2025, the interest rate is 3.98%. Also, you absolutely cannot withdraw your funds from an I bond until one year passes, not even with a penalty. CDs, on the other hand, allow you to withdraw before the term is up, with a penalty.
1-Year CDs vs. U.S. Treasuries
Treasuries allow you to lend money to the U.S. government for a fixed amount of time. Considered one of the safest investments in the world, a T-Bill is a note with a duration of up to 1 year. Unlike CDs, interest earned on Treasuries is not subject to state income tax. Treasuries are also more liquid because you can sell them before maturity on the secondary market. While there's no guarantee what price you'll get when you sell a Treasury early, there is no official penalty, as there is with a CD.
1-Year CDs vs. Bond Funds
Though it is difficult to research individual bonds, such as corporate offerings, you can easily invest in a bond mutual fund or ETF, which is diversified across many different bond issues. You can enter and exit the fund at any time, but bonds are uninsured and could lose value. When interest rates are high, a CD may have a better return than a bond; when the opposite is true, a bond generally pays more in interest.
1-Year CDs vs. Money Market Funds or Cash Reserve Accounts
If you have a brokerage account, you can hold savings in the brokerage’s cash reserve account or its money market fund. Just be sure to research what rate you’ll earn because, in many cases, it will be far less than what you can earn in an outside CD, savings account, or money market account. Money market funds are not insured by the FDIC, but they are insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC) for up to $500,000, including $250,000 in cash.
As with a money market account, money market funds are more liquid than CDs. You can withdraw your money whenever you want. But their APY is also variable, so it could change at any time.
Frequently Asked Questions
Who Has the Highest 12-Month CD Rate Today?
HUSTL Digital Credit Union has the top rate of 4.50% APY today for a term of 12 months. Opening an account online is fairly easy, with an affordable minimum deposit of $500.
What Is a 1-Year CD Paying Right Now?
Right now, the best 1-year CDs have APYs in the mid-4% range, much higher than the national average rate. Depending on the day, the top 1-year CD may or may not hold the title for best CD rate overall.
Can You Get 6% on a 1-Year CD?
You may be able to get a 6% interest rate or higher on a 1-year CD that is offered by a local or regional bank or credit union. Right now, though, there are no 6% CDs offered nationwide. With higher rates, there are often more rules such as minimum deposit requirements, specific terms, or large penalties. For our list of the best 1-year CD rates, we rank CDs that are available nationwide and do not have a minimum deposit of more than $25,000.
What Is the Best Place to Open a 1-Year CD?
The best place to open a CD will be a bank or credit union that pays the highest rates. These may differ from the big bank you work with for your checking account. In fact, some of the biggest banks pay among the worst rates. In contrast, smaller brick-and-mortar banks, online-only banks, and credit unions tend to offer substantially higher returns. Our daily rankings of the best CD rates is an easy way to find the top nationwide rates.You may also wonder about the inconvenience of having your funds at more than one bank. With CDs, however, this is not a big deal since you won’t be regularly interacting with your CD account. Even with a savings or money market account, internet transfers between institutions are easy these days. But you won’t be making transfers to or from your CD account until you cash out.
Are 1-Year CDs a Good Short-Term Investment?
A 1-year CD will be a good short-term investment for you if you can deposit money and leave it untouched for 10 to 14 months. If so, finding a 1-year CD with a high interest rate can offer returns of 4.50% or more. For example, if you deposit $5,000 in a 1-year CD (12 months) with a 4.50% APY, you'd earn $225 by the end of the term. If you need the money sooner than that, consider a 6-month CD.
How Much Will a $10,000 CD Make in a Year?
A 1-year $10,000 CD could make $450 if it's paying the top rate of 4.50%. But your earnings will depend on the rate you get. The national average for CDs right now is only 1.75%, so if you get a CD at that rate, you'll only earn about $175. Your payout also depends on how often the interest is compounded. More frequent compounding means a slightly higher payout.
Are 1-Year CDs Safe?
CDs are safe because they are usually insured by the FDIC or NCUA when they are opened at a bank or credit union. If you open a CD at a brokerage, check to see what type of insurance the account has. As with other bank accounts, your money at a bank or credit union is insured for up to $250,000 per depositor (across all your accounts at that institution). Each time you open an account at a new bank or credit union, your money at that institution is insured for up to $250,000 as well.
Can You Lose Money on a 1-Year CD?
Generally speaking, you can't lose the money you deposit in a 1-year CD if you only withdraw it when the term has matured, or there's no penalty. Most CD accounts are also insured by the FDIC or NCUA, so your money is safe if it's at a bank or credit union with this insurance. The only time you can "lose" money on a 1-year CD is if you withdraw it early and there's a penalty, such as the loss of one month's worth of interest. But in that case, you'd only lose interest, not your initial principal payment.

How We Find the Best 1-Year CD Rates
Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide, and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000, and any specified maximum deposit cannot be under $5,000.
Banks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. For more about how we choose the best rates, read our full methodology.
