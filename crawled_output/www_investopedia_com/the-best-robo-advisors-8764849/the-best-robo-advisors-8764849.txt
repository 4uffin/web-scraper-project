How Do Robo-Advisors Work?
Who Are Robo-Advisors Best For?
Common Terms
Pros & Cons
Methodology
A robo-advisor is an automated investment service that applies algorithmic investing strategies to an investor's portfolio. This automated approach takes the emotion out of investing. That prevents investors from committing self-inflicted errors such as overreacting during periods of high volatility in the market, like we are experiencing in 2025. The best robo-advisors make it easy to set up an investment plan, provide robust rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting features, offer a wide range of pre-built portfolios, and more to help investors reach their long-term goals.
After careful analysis, Investopedia’s in-house research and editorial staff determined that Wealthfront is the best overall robo-advisor thanks to key features that include stock investing, low-interest rate borrowing, and dynamic tax-loss harvesting. Investopedia researched 20 digital wealth management platforms and evaluated them on 59 criteria, including cost, account services, and goal-planning tools.
This report highlights the best robo-advisors. It aims to help you decide which one is the right fit for you and your investing approach.

Why We Chose It
Best Overall
Wealthfront is the best overall robo-advisor. It offers investment and money management products that meet the needs of any type of investor. The platform has low fees and a low required minimum investment of $500. It offers individual stock investing, high-yield cash, digital financial planning, automated tax-loss harvesting, and lending capabilities.

The platform also offers a digital financial planner, known as Path, which can answer up to 10,000 questions and offer personalized recommendations for an account owner’s portfolio.
Best for Goal Planning
The platform’s digital financial planner, Path, can help investors plan for the future, answering questions like, “Can I live my current lifestyle in retirement?” and, “How much should I be saving today?” The tool can help investors set financial goals and offer guidance on achieving them, from retirement and homeownership to college planning.
Best for Portfolio Construction
Wealthfront portfolios cover 17 global asset classes—including stocks, bonds, and inflation assets—offering some of the best-constructed portfolios from a robo-advisor. They’re constructed based on investment management research, including modern portfolio theory (MPT), created by Harry Markowitz.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Core and ESG portfolios with many customization options
Wide range of account types, including 529 plans for college savings
Direct indexing with individual stocks for accounts over $100,000
Low-fee S&P 500 Direct indexing with a minimum of $5,000
Best-in-class Path digital financial planner
Cons

Overview
Wealthfront was founded in 2008 by tech entrepreneurs Dan Carroll and Andy Rachleff and has since become one of the most innovative robo-advisor platforms, serving over 700,000 customers. The company has grown to include hundreds of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and an automated bond portfolio, beyond the Core and ESG robo-advisory portfolios. It gives investors access to automated investment portfolios spanning 17 global asset classes tailored to their unique goals, time horizons, and risk tolerance. Investors can view other portfolio options with greater or lesser risk levels, and then rebalance their portfolios with an asset mix that meets their needs.
New & Notable
On Dec. 17, 2024, Wealthfront announced the addition of its new S&P 500 Direct portfolio to its lineup. With a $5,000 minimum and a management fee of 0.09%, this new product combines the performance of the S&P 500 with the added tax benefits of automated tax-loss harvesting for the same price as the most popular ETF that tracks the S&P 500.

Why We Chose It
Best for Beginners
Betterment allows individuals to start investing with just $10, enabling first-time investors to easily create goals and access a range of portfolio choices.
Best for Cash Management
Betterment stands out from competitors because of its automatic sweep functionality, access to a high-yield cash reserve and checking account through partner banks, and reimbursement for ATM fees. Betterment's cash reserve account has no minimum balance requirement and you can easily automate your saving and investing with the account tools.
Best for Tax-Loss Harvesting
Betterment seeks optimal after-tax returns by integrating client transactions, asset rebalancing, and tax-loss harvesting. The platform also maintains a list of comparable funds for each asset class to help investors diversify their portfolios and avoid the wash sale rule.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Easy setup and goal tracking
Multiple portfolio choices, including smart beta, three socially responsible investing (SRI) options, target income, crypto, and more.
$0 account minimum and $10 to begin investing
Low-fee financial advice packages for digital customers

Premium plan requires $100,000

Overview
Founded in 2008 by Eli Broverman and Jon Stein, Betterment now serves more than 900,000 customers, making it one of the largest standalone robo-advisors. The platform has users answer a brief questionnaire to help it determine their investment goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Using customers’ questionnaire answers, Betterment recommends an investment portfolio to each user designed to meet their financial needs. Betterment users can choose from among 11 portfolios with a range of asset allocation choices—including a portfolio aimed at long-term investing with low costs and portfolios focused on high-growth tech companies and others on undervalued U.S. companies.
Betterment’s powerful cash management product goes a step beyond the competition by offering a tax strategy that reflects a customer’s circumstances and goals. Essentially, Betterment can place assets in a taxable, tax-deferred, or tax-exempt account according to its taxation risk while using the customer’s overall target asset allocation.
On Feb. 26, 2025, Betterment announced that it has acquired the automated investing business of Ellevest, a woman-focused wealth management firm and robo-advisory.
Cash Reserve is only available to clients of Betterment LLC—which is not a bank— and cash transfers to program banks are conducted through the clients’ brokerage accounts at Betterment Securities. For Cash Reserve (“CR”), Betterment LLC only receives compensation from our program banks; Betterment LLC and Betterment Securities do not charge fees on your CR balance.

Fidelity Go
Investopedia's Rating
4.3 out of 5 stars
Fidelity
Account Minimum: $0 to open an account, $10 to be investedFee: $0 for accounts under $25,000, 0.35% annual fee for balances over $25,000
Learn More
(opens in a new tab)
Why We Chose It
Fidelity Go is Investopedia’s choice for the best robo-advisor for low costs because the platform doesn’t charge any fees on accounts with balances of less than $25,000. In addition, when the 0.35% annual fee does kick in on accounts with balances above $25,000, customers get access to unlimited one-on-one coaching with an advisor, plus they benefit from Fidelity Flex funds that come with no management fees or expense ratios.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Quick and hassle-free account setup
Low management fees, plus access to no-cost Fidelity Flex funds
Ability to preview and tweak your portfolio’s risk level before committing funds
Smooth integration for existing Fidelity customers managing multiple accounts
Cons
Access to human financial advisors only available for accounts with balances over $25,000
No tax-loss harvesting feature
Investment choices limited to Fidelity’s own mutual funds
Overview
Fidelity Go, launched in 2016, makes investing feel pretty effortless—especially if you're a beginner, a hands-off investor, or someone already plugged into Fidelity's massive ecosystem. The platform keeps it simple, with a setup process that avoids the need to make potentially confusing decisions. The platform charges nothing on your first $25,000, and even the Flex funds it uses are free of ongoing management fees. For accounts with balances larger than $25,000, customers pay a competitive 0.35% annual fee. Fidelity Go also offers a financial wellness section that points customers to available tools and allows users with over $25,000 in assets to access unlimited one-on-one coaching with an advisor.

Why We Chose It
Investopedia chose SoFi Automated Investing as the best robo-advisor for access to licensed financial advisors. In an industry where access to human advice often comes with high barriers to entry, SoFi's Automated Investing platform includes a complimentary 30-minute meeting with a financial planner.
Pros & Cons
Pros
All clients have access to a complimentary one-time 30-minute video meeting with a financial planner
$50 minimum to begin investing
Access to Additional lending and cash management tools
Cons
No tax-loss harvesting service available
No portfolio customization options

Overview
SoFi® was founded in 2011 by four Stanford University business school students and, in 2012, was the first company to provide student loan refinancing. Since its inception, the company has become known for its many financial offerings, including banking, lending, credit card, insurance, and travel services. The company offers digital investment management with a 0.25% management fee and a complimentary one-time video meeting with a financial planner. Investors can also start investing using Sofi's Automated Investing platform with just $50, making it a powerful option for investors looking for professional advice before getting started.

M1 Finance

M1 Finance

(opens in a new tab)
Why We Chose It
Best for Sophisticated Investors
M1 Finance is best for sophisticated investors who want to choose their own stocks and ETFs and access customized portfolios focused on themes that align with their goals. M1 Finance also offers high-yield cash accounts and borrowing.
Best for Cryptocurrency Portfolio Selection
M1 Finance is our pick for best cryptocurrency portfolio selection because it is one of the few digital wealth management platforms that allows you to go beyond ETFs. You have to open a separate crypto account, but then you can build what M1 Finance calls a crypto pie, or a pre-made portfolio designed by experts, and use M1 Finance’s auto-invest features to manage it.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Numerous customized expert pies or portfolios
Thousands of ETFs and stocks for self-directed investors
Fee-free plan
High-yield cash account
Low interest rate margin available
Cons
No quiz to determine investors’ goals or risk tolerance
No tax-loss harvesting
No financial advisors
Platform requires some level of investment knowledge
Overview
M1 Finance, founded in 2015 by Brian Barnes, gives users more control over their portfolio selection compared to many other digitial wealth management platforms—which is why it’s best suited for sophisticated investors. M1 Finance offers Pies, and allows users to rebalance their self-directed stock and ETF assets according to their preferred asset allocation. The Pies are designed based on themes, including general investing, retirement planning, responsible investing, and income-earning investments.
The $3 monthly fee—which applies to investors who do not meet the $10,000 account balance requirement—may not be worthwhile for investors with small balances. However, M1 Finance offers self-directed investors access to thousands of stocks and ETFs, cryptocurrency, as well as high-yield cash and lending.
M1 Finance combines self-directed brokerage features with pre-built portfolios and automated portfolio management capabilities. M1 Finance does not provide advisory services and, therefore, is not considered a traditional robo-advisor.

(opens in a new tab)
Why We Chose It
Acorns is a good fit for people who find it difficult to save money to put toward investments. The platform has a “round-up” feature that automatically invests spare change. When people use the debit and credit cards linked to Acorns, the platform automatically takes the difference between the purchase amount and the next whole dollar and invests it.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Helps customers to begin saving and investing
The Multiplier feature enables faster investment growth
Low-fee, diversified investment portfolio options
Cons
Fees can be burdensome to small accounts
The round-up feature may take a long time to build a meaningful investment amount unless users contribute additional savings
Limited account types
Overview
Acorns was founded in 2012 and is a valuable tool for those who have trouble saving money to invest. The platform rounds up a person’s spending and diverts the difference into an investment account. To date, $3 billion has been invested through this round-up feature. Acorns recommends a diversified investment portfolio to users based on their answers to several questions about their goals. Investors can also use the platform’s Round-Ups Multiplier, which will double, triple, or multiply by 10 the amount of the round-up.
Note that if an investor only invests using the round-up tool, it can take a very long time to build a meaningful investment portfolio. In addition, because the rounded-up investment contributions are pulled from the user’s checking account, it’s important to monitor that account closely to avoid overdraft fees.

Pros & Cons
Pros
Multiple investment strategies, including core, ESG, and smart beta

Access to the broad Morgan Stanley lineup of investment and financial management services
Cons
More expensive than competitive robo-advisors at lower cost

Overview
E*TRADE was founded in 1982 and acquired by Morgan Stanley in 2020. It offers a wide range of investment services, beginning with a questionnaire to assess an investor’s goals, liquidity needs, time horizon, and risk tolerance. Based on their responses to the questionnaire, investors get a core investment portfolio that aims to fit their needs. The choices include a core portfolio, socially responsible portfolio, and smart beta portfolio.
The E*TRADE app is easy to navigate, allowing users to open an account and transfer money into or out of their portfolios while providing checking, bill payment, and cash management services.

Why We Chose It
Merrill Guided Investing—which is integrated with Merrill Lynch and Bank of America resources—provides a vast library of educational content and a range of excellent calculators and tools that can be accessed without even having an account.
Pros & Cons
Pros
24/7 customer service
Superior educational resources, calculators, and tools for a range of investors
Integration with Bank of America and Merrill Edge financial products, making it a one-stop shop financial portal
Cons
Higher fees than other robo-advisor platforms
No tax-loss harvesting
$20,000 balance and an 0.85% annual fee required for financial advisor access
Overview
Merrill Lynch & Co. was founded in 1914 by Charles E. Merrill and was acquired by Bank of America in 2009, according to Reuters. While the company was once known for catering to the wealthiest Americans, Merrill Guided Investing now aims to offer a wide range of clients investment management expertise and educational tools.
The robo-advisor’s investment portfolios are designed to reflect each investor’s goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. Unlike standard passively managed robo-advisor offerings, Merrill Guided Investing’s portfolios are built and managed using strategic and tactical asset allocations. Merrill’s pitch here is that having the human element can add value in terms of investment selection and portfolio construction beyond what a solely rules-based system can achieve.
From an educational perspective, the platform offers webinars, investor education videos, and the Morningstar Investing Classroom, which includes free courses on investment topics ranging from stocks and bonds to mutual funds and ETFs.
Why Trust Us
Investopedia aims to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to help readers make the best decisions with their money. To create this list, Investopedia collected 2420 data points from 20 robo-advisor companies, focusing on the factors that are most important to investors. We reviewed each robo-advisor platform for fees, portfolio management services, goal-planning tools, and other key features in order to give each a rating. Investopedia has been helping readers find the best tools and platforms for managing their finances since 1999.
How Do Robo-Advisors Work?
Robo-Advisors provide automated investment planning based on specific algorithms. They simplify the management of an investor's portfolio based on the type of account you have and your investment goals. One of the first things you'll do when establishing an account is provide answers to key questions about your financial goals. Depending on which robo-advisor you choose, options for investing include stocks, bonds, and more.
Most robo-advisors use a passive investing approach, which can involve basing one's portfolio on an index such as the S&P 500 in order to match the performance of the index. More active approaches and more customization sometimes are possible, but those services typically will cost more.
Who Are Robo-Advisors Best For?
Those who don't have the time or the confidence to take a close, hands-on approach with their investment portfolios might be a good match for a robo-advisor. Because such a service is automated, one of the benefits is the amount of time it can save account holders. Robo-advisors also might be a good option for those who are new to investing because they provide a way to get started in investing while still learning the best approach.
Robo-advisors can also be a good fit for those who want the convenience of 24/7 access to their accounts. Working with a traditional financial planner does not provide this kind of access.
Common Robo-Advisor Terms to Understand
If you are considering using a robo-advisor for your investing needs, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with these terms:
Modern portfolio theory: Robo-advisors often use an approach based on modern portfolio theory, which is an approach designed to maximize returns within an acceptable level of risk. A key to this is a diversified portfolio.
Diversification: Having a diversified portfolio involves spreading out your investment dollars among a broad range of stocks, bonds, and other assets. This is in contrast to having a large percentage of your investments committed to a single security.
Asset allocation: One way to describe asset allocation would be that it is how an investor chooses to diversify assets, including equities, cash, and fixed income. The best approach to asset allocation depends on your needs and goals. Someone saving for the short-term would take a different approach than someone saving for the long term.
Retirement planning: Determining your approach to retirement planning involves knowing how much income you think you'll need in retirement, then creating and following a plan to get there. Some robo-advisors can help specifically with this common type of investment planning.
Index investing: Robo-advisors commonly use index investing as a passive approach. This involves trying to create an investment portfolio that closely follows a specific market index.
Pros & Cons of Robo-Advisors
Pros
Ease of use
Lower costs
Investment models
Cons
Impersonal
Limited flexibility
Pros Explained
Ease of use: One of the main draws of robo-advisors is that they are easy to use. It can be as simple as creating an account and answering questions about your investment goals. This ease of use also includes 24/7 access, which avoids having to fit someone else's schedule.Lower costs: Because robo-advisors take a passive approach, their costs typically are lower than those of working with a personal advisor or trying to actively manage your own investments.Investment models: Robo-advisors offer choices of many investment models to follow. For example, if you want to focus on investing in environmentally conscious companies, there are robo-advisors that can handle that.
Cons Explained
Impersonal: An automated process built on algorithms is definitely easy to use, but for times when you might want specific advice or a certain kind of feedback, it's difficult to get exactly that with robo-advisors.Limited flexibility: While there are a lot of investment models to choose from, customization is limited or nonexistent depending on the robo-advisor.
How We Picked the Best Robo-Advisors
Providing readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of digital wealth management companies, more commonly known as robo-advisors, is a top priority of Investopedia. We combined our industry research and subject matter expertise to guide the research and weightings for our 2025 robo-advisor rankings. To collect the data, our researchers gathered data points through online research of provider websites. To fill in any gaps, our research team reached out to the individual companies. In some instances, our researchers did much deeper online research to get the information they needed to complete the data collection. The data collection process spanned from April 5, 2025 to April 11, 2025.
We then developed a quantitative model that scored each company to rate its performance across nine major categories and 60 weighted criteria to find the best robo-advisors. The score for each company’s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria:
Goal Planning - 21.00%Portfolio Contents - 17.00%Portfolio Management - 17.00%Fees - 15.00%Account Services - 10.00%Account Setup - 5.00%Customer Service - 5.00%Security & Education - 5.00%User Experience - 5.00%
Through this all-encompassing data collection and review process, Investopedia has provided you with an unbiased and thorough review of the top robo-advisors.
