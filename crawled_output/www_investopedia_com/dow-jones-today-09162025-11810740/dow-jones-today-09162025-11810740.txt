The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the first time this year.

Close
Stocks ended slightly lower Tuesday, a day before the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates.
The benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both ended down roughly 0.1% after each set a fresh all-time intraday high soon after markets opened. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3% lower.
Wall Street is overwhelmingly confident that the Fed will lower borrowing costs for the first time this year when it concludes its policy meeting Wednesday. Traders are pricing in a 96% chance that central bankers will cut the rate by a quarter of a point, to 4.00%-4.25%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which forecasts rate movements based on fed funds futures trading data.
Before markets opened Tuesday, Census Bureau data revealed U.S retail sales rose 0.6% month-over-month in August, while economists had anticipated a 0.3% rise, further evidence that tariffs haven't yet significantly weighed on consumer spending. Retail sales figures for July were revised up to 0.6% growth from the initial reading of 0.5% last month.
Oracle (ORCL) shares closed up 1.5% on expectations the tech giant would be involved in a deal that would allow Chinese-owned TikTok to avoid being banned in the U.S. Oracle chair and co-founder Larry Ellison has close ties to President Donald Trump.
Tesla (TSLA) shares rose 2.8% following a 3.6% advance Monday after a regulatory filing showed CEO Elon Musk bought $1 billion of stock, which was seen as a demonstration of Musk's commitment to the electric vehicle maker. Tesla's board recently proposed awarding Musk a pay package that could top $1 trillion.
Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) ended 0.2% lower following yesterday's 4.5% surge that pushed its market capitalization above $3 trillion, making it the fourth company to achieve the milestone.
The 10-year Treasury yield, which affects borrowing costs on a variety of consumer and commercial loans, slipped to 4.03% from 4.04% at Monday's close. Gold futures hit a fresh all-time high Tuesday and were up 0.2% to above $3,725 at 4 p.m. ET. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were 2% higher at around $64.55. Bitcoin was more than 1% higher at nearly $117,000. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies, was down 0.6% to 96.69.
Biggest S&P 500 Movers on Tuesday
September 16, 2025 06:18 PM EDT
Decliners
Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares tumbled 6.2%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock. With the downturn on Tuesday, the stock gave back a portion of the massive gains posted last week after reports that industry rival Paramount Skydance (PSKY) was considering a buyout bid. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) criticized the potential takeover, and TD Cowen analysts downgraded Warner Bros. Discovery stock to "hold" from "buy," noting the recent run-up may not be sustainable if a deal between the two media giants fails to materialize. Paramount Skydance shares dropped 5.7%.
Shares of Emerson Electric (EMR) declined 4.9% after the industrial automation firm said it now expects full-year sales to come in at the low end of its previous forecast. The company cited headwinds in China and Europe as factors behind its more modest expectations.
Advancers
Crude oil futures moved higher as strikes on key Russian production facilities by Ukrainian drones raised concerns about global supply and traders positioned themselves ahead of this week's anticipated interest-rate cuts. Shares of exploration and production APA Corp. (APA) surged 7% to log the day's top performance in the S&P 500. Shares of Occidental Petroleum (OXY) were up 5%, and other oil producers also rose.
Steel Dynamics (STLD) issued stronger-than-expected outlook for its third quarter, and its shares jumped 6.1%. The steelmaker highlighted strong demand in the residential construction, automotive, energy, and industrial sectors, along with an anticipated boost to profitability from a more favorable metal spread, with scrap raw material costs falling faster than average realized steel prices.
Shares of Hershey (HSY) added 4.3% after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to "buy" from "sell." Analysts attributed the double upgrade to their belief that strong pricing and improving market share trends could help the chocolate maker offset pressures related to elevated cocoa costs and tariffs.
Moderna (MRNA) shares gained 4% after the biotechnology firm released positive preliminary data on its latest version of the COVID-19 vaccine. The company said the updated shot generated a strong immune response for high-risk individuals and people over age 65, and Moderna said the safety profile was in line with prior studies.

Microsoft to Invest $30B in UK on AI
September 16, 2025 04:22 PM EDT
Microsoft will make a $30B investment into UK AI initiatives through 2028, it said.

Microsoft (MSFT) vice chair and president Brad Smith wrote in a blog post Tuesday that the tech giant would be making a $30 billion investment in AI infrastructure and ongoing operations across the United Kingdom through 2028.
Smith, who noted President Donald Trump's forthcoming visit to the country, added that "Microsoft is proud to reaffirm its deep and enduring commitment to the UK—one that sets a new benchmark for transatlantic technology collaboration."
Shares of Microsoft ended down 1.2%.
Emerson Electric Stock Falls on Orders Outlook
September 16, 2025 03:33 PM EDT
Emerson Electric (EMR) was one of the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500, with shares down nearly 5%, after management issued fiscal fourth-quarter orders guidance that disappointed investors.
Speaking at the JPMorgan U.S. All Stars Conference, executives said they anticipated Q4 orders growth of 5% to 7%, but that they expect the metric to come in at the lower end of that range due to weakness in Europe and China.
Including today's declines, Emerson Electric shares are up about 4% year-to-date.
Hims & Hers Health Stock Drops on FDA Warning Letter
September 16, 2025 02:31 PM EDT
Shares of Hims & Hers Health (HIMS) sank 6% after the company received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration.

The FDA said the firm's "claims concerning compounded semaglutide products are false or misleading."
Semaglitude is the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster weight-loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic.
"Compounded drug products are not FDA-approved," the agency wrote. "Your claims imply that your products are the same as an FDA-approved product when they are not. As a result, these claims are false or misleading and your products are therefore misbranded."
Energy Stocks Rise Along With Price of Crude
September 16, 2025 02:00 PM EDT
The price of crude oil is rising. It's taking energy shares along for the ride.
Several energy firms were among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Tuesday afternoon.
APA (APA) was up 8% and led the benchmark index. Occidental Petroleum (OXY) shares were up about 5%, and those of Devon Energy (DVN), Diamondback Energy (FANG), ConocoPhillips (COP) and Valero Energy (VLO) all were up roughly 3%.
Chipotle's Stock Is Under Pressure. The Company Says It's Time to Buy
September 16, 2025 12:54 PM EDT
The latest limited-time offers at Chipotle? Carne asada—and, just maybe, its stock.
Management at burrito giant Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) in a Monday regulatory filing said it was updating the company's buyback program ahead of schedule, announcing that on Sept. 3 it voted to approve a $500 million repurchase authorization that lifts its authorized amount to three quarters of a billion dollars.
The update might normally have come with Chipotle's quarterly report. The next one, however, isn't scheduled to arrive before the end of October—and the shares are beaten-down these days, off some 35% this year through Monday's close and at levels last seen more than two years ago.
A downbeat outlook for same-store sales has weighed on the stock despite management's optimism of better days ahead.
"Chipotle is announcing the additional authorization early to be in a position to opportunistically repurchase shares using the additional authorization prior to filing" the third quarter's report, the company said in Monday's filing.
Chipotle spent roughly $1 billion buying back shares in the first half of 2025, according to a midyear filing, at an average price just above $52.
More recently, the stock is closer to $39 even after rising more than 1% in morning trading Tuesday. Wall Street analysts, for what it's worth, broadly see current prices as an opportunity. Visible Alpha's mean price target is $58.65, a more than 50% premium to yesterday's close.

Warner Bros. Discovery Stock Tanks as Sen. Warren Says Potential Paramount Deal 'Should Be Blocked'
September 16, 2025 12:27 PM EDT
Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 early Wednesday afternoon after Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) criticized a potential takeover of the firm by fellow entertainment giant Paramount Skydance (PSKY).
Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery were down about 8.5% Tuesday afternoon.

"The ink is barely dry on the shady $8 billion Paramount/Skydance merger, and now Paramount wants to add Warner Bros Discovery to its growing list of owned media companies," Warren wrote in an X post. "This deal would be a dangerous concentration of power over our media and news. It should be blocked."
Warner Bros. Discovery shares were down 8.5%. Paramount Skydance shares were down 3%.
Delta Air Lines Stock Falls as US Orders Carrier to Dissolve Joint Venture With Aeromexico
September 16, 2025 11:44 AM EDT
Shares of Delta Air Lines (DAL) were down more than 2% in late-morning trading after the Trump administration ordered the carrier to end its joint venture with Aeromexico.
The Department of Transportation finalized an order, beginning Jan. 1, 2026, ending antitrust immunity for the SkyTeam alliance partners on transborder flights.
Delta can remain a stakeholder in Aeromexico, but the airlines no longer will be able to coordinate on fares and schedules.
S&P 500 Up by Similar Percentage After 164 Sessions During Trump 2.0 as During First Administration
September 16, 2025 11:19 AM EDT
Bespoke Investment Group noted a statistical oddity about the S&P 500 through Monday's close: It was up by almost the exact same percentage 164 sessions into President Donald Trump's second administration as it was after the same duration in his first.
Through Monday, the S&P 500 had advanced 10.32% in Trump's second term, while it had risen 10.37% through 164 sessions in his first, back in 2017.
However, while the S&P 500 declined 17% at its low this time around, it never turned negative during the first 164 trading days of Trump's first administration.
Novo Nordisk Stock Rises on Trial Results for Cagrilintide Obesity Treatment
September 16, 2025 10:42 AM EDT
U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO) gained after the drugmaker reported positive results from a late-stage study of a weight-loss drug that works differently than traditional GLP-1 inhibitors.
The company said the Phase 3 trial of cagrilintide found patients taking it over 68 weeks had an average weight loss of 12.5 kilograms (27.6 pounds), or 11.8% body weight reduction, compared to 2.5 kilograms (5.5 pounds) or 2.3% body weight reduction with placebo.
Cagrilintide is being studied as a weekly subcutaneous injectable treatment for adults who are overweight or obese and not diabetic. Novo Nordisk has been looking at alternative weight-loss treatments as its current drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, have been losing market share to rivals' alternatives.
The data provided was a sub-analysis of cagrilintide, and Novo Nordisk explained that because of the outcome, it would be moving the medicine into a dedicated Phase 3 clinical program later this year.
Despite today’s 2% gain in morning trading, U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk remain down more than 30% year-to-date.

Jobs Are Weak And Prices Are High, But Consumers Kept Spending in August
September 16, 2025 10:25 AM EDT
U.S. retail sales were up 0.6% in the Census Bureau’s report, while economists expected sales to slow in August.
The report also showed that sales in July were better than first reported.
The positive sales report follows negative news out of the labor market, where job growth has slowed and unemployment has ticked higher. The results come as economists are watching for impacts from President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, especially as inflation has remained persistently high.
U.S. retail sales grew at a steady pace of 0.6% in August to surprise economists.
"It’s a weird macro environment right now,” wrote Bret Kenwell, an eToro U.S. investment analyst. “Inflation continues to edge higher, while labor market measures — like payrolls, unemployment, layoffs, and job openings — are moving in the wrong direction. Despite all this, consumers remain resilient and continue to spend.”
The data showed that some items subject to tariffs were still selling, including motor vehicles, electronics, appliances, clothing and sporting goods. Online sellers like Amazon recorded a big monthly gain of 2%.
“The spending was rather broad-based as consumers even spent generously on discretionary goods such as those related to hobbies and recreation and restaurants and bars,” wrote Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.

Dave & Buster's Stock Dives After Q2 Results
September 16, 2025 10:01 AM EDT
Shares of Dave & Buster’s Entertainment (PLAY) plunged in morning trading when the game-themed restaurant posted worse-than-expected results as comparable store sales declined and it warned that inflation and tariffs might hurt future demand.
The operator of Dave & Buster’s and Main Event locations reported second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.40, less than half of what analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for. Revenue was basically flat at $557.4 million, also short of estimates. Comparable store sales fell 3.0% compared to a year earlier.

The company noted that big jumps in inflation, “whether due to imposed tariffs or standard economic conditions, could affect the United States or global economies and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.” It added that if its other expenses rise at the same time, “we may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand.”
CEO Tarun Lal, who took over in July, said that his “immediate focus is clear: reinforce our guest-first culture, deliver memorable experiences, and drive meaningful growth in sales, cash flow and shareholder value.”
Shares were down more than 15% soon after the opening bell. Prior to today’s session, Dave & Buster’s Entertainment shares had lost about 18% this year.

Steel Dynamics Stock Pops on Improving Profit Outlook
September 16, 2025 09:43 AM EDT
Steel Dynamics (STLD) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the company issued improving profit guidance for its fiscal third quarter.
The Fort Wayne, Ind.-based firm anticipates current-quarter earnings per share of $2.60 to $2.64, up from $2.01 per share in the second quarter and $2.05 in Q3 2024. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha are calling for $2.60 per share.
Steel Dynamics is slated to release Q3 results after the market closes Oct. 20.
Webtoon Stock Jumps 30% on Disney Investment, Collaboration
September 16, 2025 09:09 AM EDT
Shares of Webtoon Entertainment (WBTN) soared 30% in premarket trading as the digital comic platform said that Walt Disney (DIS) would be taking a stake in the firm as they collaborate in creating a new outlet for Disney’s comic franchises.
Webtoon said the companies have agreed on a “non-binding term sheet for the development of an all-new digital comics platform that will feature current comic book runs and include decades of past comics from across Disney’s portfolio including Marvel, 'Star Wars,' 20th Century Studios and more.” The comics “will be available in a single digital comics service with one convenient subscription, adding more stories than ever before in one location,” Webtoon said.
As part of the deal, Disney will acquire a 2% equity interest in Webtoon. Both the Disney investment and collaboration agreement are still to be finalized.
Webtoon Entertainment shares spent most of 2025 in negative territory before spiking last month after announcing another collaboration with Disney.

Webtoon Founder and CEO Junkoo Kim called the partnership “a powerful next step for our growing global business, and a strong foundation for even greater collaboration with Disney in the years ahead.”
Webtoon Entertainment shares spent most of 2025 in negative territory before spiking last month after announcing another collaboration with Disney.
Shares of Walt Disney are also higher year-to-date.

Rocket Lab Shares Fall on Stock Sale Plan
September 16, 2025 08:57 AM EDT
Shares of Rocket Lab (RKLB) fell 4% about 30 minutes before the opening bell after it said in a regulatory filing late Monday that it plans to sell up to $750 million worth of stock.
The Long Beach, Calif.-based firm said it terminated its sales agreement of March 11 to sell up to $500 million worth of shares.
Rocket Lab shares entered Tuesday having more than doubled this year.

Oracle (ORCL) shares are surging in premarket trading Tuesday on a report that the software firm is among a consortium of companies that would let Chinese-owned TikTok to continue operating in the U.S.—if a “framework deal" between Beijing and Washington is finalized.
According to CBS, which cited sources with knowledge of the negotiations, the final deal over TikTok will include multiple companies. It wasn’t immediately clear who will control TikTok’s recommendation algorithm or what role parent company ByteDance will play, the report said.
Oracle shares, which entered Tuesday up 80%, are rising 5% in premarket trading. TikTok parent ByteDance has until Wednesday to agree to sell the social media platform to a U.S.-based owner or be banned in the country, unless President Donald Trump extends the deadline. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has close ties to Trump and his software firm has frequently been reported as a potential bidder for the social media app.
The CBS report comes a day after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the U.S. has reached a “framework for a TikTok deal" following two days of trade talks between Beijing and Washington in Madrid. Trump also suggested a deal had been reached on Monday.
Oracle shares soared earlier this month after it reported a substantial backlog that suggested the AI spending boom has legs. The surge lifted Ellison's net worth above that of Elon Musk, according to Bloomberg, for a while making the 81-year-old database pioneer the richest person in the world.
