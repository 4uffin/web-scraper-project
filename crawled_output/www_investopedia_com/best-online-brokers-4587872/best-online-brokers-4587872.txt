Why We Chose It
Best Overall
For the fourth consecutive year, Fidelity reigns supreme in bringing critical full-service brokerage features, sophisticated tools, and low fees to a wide range of traders and investors across continually enhanced platforms.
Best for ETFs
Fidelity is our top broker for ETFs because of its rich exchange-traded fund (ETF)-focused educational content and research tools, expansive ETF offering, and fractional ETF trading. Fidelity is a repeat winner in this category, having earned the top spot from Charles Schwab in 2023.
Best for Low Costs
Fidelity has long been an industry leader when it comes to lowering fees, and its transparent and compelling fee schedule is the reason why—for the fourth year running—it wins for low costs.
Best for Cash Management
Finding the best brokerage account for cash management is not just about earning the highest interest rate possible. It’s also about seamless integration with essential, no-fee banking features and insurance. In these areas, Fidelity’s cash management offering is unmatched, and it comes with solid passive earnings power on uninvested cash, along with reimbursable access to a global network of ATMs.
Pros & Cons
Pros
No payment for order flow (PFOF) makes for excellent order execution
Strong portfolio analysis and account features
Superior trading platforms for all types of investors
Top-tier educational content, screening tools, and research capabilities
FDIC insurance up to $5 million on uninvested cash
Cons
Only three digital coins available for trading
Minimum balance required for some index trading
Multiple platforms may be required to access all tools
Overview
In an industry full of innovative companies competing for the attention of an incredibly diverse universe of traders and investors, Fidelity delivers the most well-rounded product offering to suit the needs of nearly every investor. Headquartered in Boston, Fidelity’s storied history began in 1946. As of September 18, 2025, the company holds $6.4 trillion in discretionary assets and is ranked among the top brokerage firms in terms of assets under management.
Investopedia began evaluating online brokerages in 2019, and Fidelity has shown a commitment to improving its financial products and services ever since. Improvements in financial advisor support, bond liquidity analysis, and the new Fidelity Youth app were the highlights of our 2024 product demonstration with the company. But the enhancements didn't stop there: Fidelity also revamped its process for opening core brokerage accounts, further streamlining the online experience for new users. The accounts now also have a comprehensive cash management product that is jam-packed with banking features.
Fidelity has long been an industry leader in lowering fees, but it is also widely-regarded for its vast customer service network, which includes 217 customer centers, and provides excellent client support for its low-cost, high-value offering. Investors looking for an online broker that keeps trading costs low, all while delivering some of the most powerful tools in the industry and resisting the common industry practice of collecting PFOF, will be hard-pressed to find a better broker than Fidelity.
ACTUAL USER EXPERIENCE
"I moved all of our family’s investment accounts to Fidelity in 2021 for one simple, but valuable, reason: It’s the only brokerage firm that offers every single account type we have, allowing me to house all of our investments under the same roof. We have a lot of different account types—from various retirement and taxable accounts, to an inherited IRA, to 529s and custodial accounts, and even an investable HSA. Before consolidating to Fidelity, I had to log into multiple places to check on our various investments. Now, except for a new workplace 401(k), I have one login that shows me everything on a single screen. And when I need customer support, Fidelity advisors can also view things as a whole. Moving to Fidelity has added a lot of ease and efficiency to my financial life." - Sabrina Karl, Staff Writer for Investopedia

Why We Chose It
Even before TD Ameritrade’s educational content was incorporated into its ecosystem, Charles Schwab—which acquired TD Ameritrade in 2020—was known as one of the best platforms for new traders and investors. With the integration now complete, Schwab has taken over the top ranks in this category, a position TD Ameritrade used to dominate. Schwab now houses the most comprehensive library of evergreen learning materials, along with seemingly endless coaching programs and regularly scheduled live training events, making it the best for beginner investors.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Industry-leading educational content
Multiple user-friendly platforms
Superb ETF research and scanners
Over 420 branches in 48 states
Access to the highly regarded thinkorswim® platform
Cons
Relatively high margin rates
Low interest earned on uninvested cash
Lacks fractional ETF trading
No direct investments in cryptocurrencies
In the News
On July 21, 2025, Charles Schwab announced a significant expansion to the list of securities that users of the company's thinkorswim platform can now trade overnight. Schwab retail clients can now trade more than 1,100 securities, primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 24 hours a day, five days a week, using extended + overnight session orders (EXTO). EXTO orders are continuous orders that expire at 8 p.m. ET each market day.
Overview
Chuck Schwab and his partners formed First Commander Corporation in April 1971, and later changed the company’s name to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. in 1973. Charles Schwab has since grown into a household name in the brokerage industry and, in October 2020, completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade, with full client integration finalized by mid-2024. Not only does Schwab provide the right mix of usability, tools, education, and research to its diverse customer base, but it does so across multiple top-tier platforms. As of September 18, 2025, Schwab’s total client assets stood at $11.23 trillion.
With Schwab’s integration of TD Ameritrade complete, the combination of Schwab’s exceptional lineup of products and services and TD Ameritrade’s powerful trading capabilities has boosted the company even closer to the top of our comprehensive rating model. One of the most anticipated additions to Schwab's lineup occurred on April 11, 2024, with the company announcing that futures and forex trading, along with a new Portfolio Margin feature, have been made available on its thinkorswim platform.
Then, on Oct. 30, 2024, the company announced even more exciting news when it introduced overnight trading in S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100-traded stocks, as well as hundreds of additional exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 24 hours a day, five days a week (24/5). On Feb. 12, 2025, the company made overnight trading available to all clients via the thinkorswim platform. Prospective customers should note, however, that crypto spot trading still isn’t available, but spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are offered.

Why We Chose It
Best for Advanced Traders
Interactive Brokers’ lineup of advanced analytical tools, trading technology, and breadth of assets is, quite frankly, awe-inspiring. Ongoing enhancements to legacy platforms like the masterfully constructed Trader Workstation (TWS) and the addition of the next-generation IBKR desktop offer just a small glimpse into how Interactive Brokers equips advanced traders to capitalize on fundamental dislocations and pricing inefficiencies better than any other platform we reviewed. This is the fourth straight year Interactive Brokers has earned this award.
Best for International Trading
Simply put, not one of the 27 online brokerage companies we reviewed comes close to offering the scope of global research capabilities, international trading, support access, and currency-based funding variety that Interactive Brokers offers. That's why, for the fourth straight year, the company is our top broker for international traders.
Best for Algorithmic Trading
As trading technology continues to advance, so too does the interest in algorithmic trading. Advanced traders will find a powerful lineup of algorithmic trading features in Interactive Brokers’ pre-built algos, a laundry list of API languages, available algorithmic paper trading accounts, and so much more.
Best for Risk Management
With its powerful rebalancing features, robust portfolio and risk analysis tools, nearly boundless opportunities for asset diversification, and available access to licensed brokers, investors will be hard-pressed to find a better platform for managing portfolio risk than Interactive Brokers.
Best for Generating Stock Trading Ideas
For professional and retail traders looking for investing and trading ideas across the vast universe of equities, over short-, intermediate-, and long-term time horizons, Interactive Brokers brings together leading industry research vendors, proprietary search tools, and the industry’s largest universe of investable stocks to provide a nearly endless source of ideas that suit every investing and trading strategy.
Also Good for Cryptocurrency Trading
Already known as a platform with industry-leading trading technology and access to abundant account amenities for traders of all levels. Interactive Brokers offers 11 cryptocurrencies that can be traded, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Ripple, Dogecoin, and more. Its existing crypto lineup can be traded with no spreads added to the relatively low commission of 0.12% to 0.18%.
In The News
On July 10, 2025, Interactive Brokers announced the launch of IBKR InvestMentor, a new mobile "microlearning" app designed to deliver free and easily accessible educational content to beginner and aspiring investors through short, interactive lessons that build foundational knowledge in economics and investing.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Increasing availability of beginner-friendly platforms
Superior order execution
Industry-best selection of contingent orders
Unparalleled range of investable foreign and domestic assets
Powerful and highly customizable professional-level functionality
Cons
IBKR's SmartRouting not available to IBKR Lite clients
TWS can be difficult to learn
No in-platform backtesting
Often confusing tiered pricing
Overview
Founded under the name T.P. & Co. in 1978 by its current chairman, Thomas Peterffy, the company pioneered the use of computers in trading. Eventually, Interactive Brokers Inc. was incorporated as a U.S. broker-dealer in 1993, and the company has since developed into one of the industry’s most complete online brokerage platforms. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) offers astonishing access to 160 markets in 36 countries and support for its services in 200 countries and territories, all with funding and trading capabilities in up to 28 currencies. Simply put, this is by far the broadest global coverage in the industry. As of September 2025, IBKR held over $713B in client assets.
One of the first adopters of technology in the financial markets, both algorithmic and active traders have long regarded the company highly for its advanced trading features, highly customizable tools, low margin rates, and alpha-generating capabilities. Investopedia's team of industry experts is constantly delighted by IBKR’s innovative enhancements, which make so much sense from a purist’s perspective.
IBKR’s latest product innovation is IBKR Desktop, a next-generation platform that combines a simple user interface with many of the company’s powerful trading solutions. It features innovations like Option Lattice, a graphical options chain display highlighting potential outliers in key metrics, and MultiSort, which enables users to sort data using multiple factors simultaneously. Always looking for ways to use the latest technology to give clients an advantage, the company also recently launched AI-powered news summaries.
This idea of simplicity is really where things have been getting interesting for Interactive Brokers, as the company has committed to making its platforms more accessible to beginners. With notable touches like the expansion of educational content across several platforms, including its entry-level IBKR Lite platform, available fractional investing, and the innovative and helpful Options Wizard tool offered on its user-friendly Global Trader mobile app (as well as other platforms), Interactive Brokers is quickly gaining ground on the industry’s top all-around brokerage platforms.

Why We Chose It
For the fourth year in a row, we chose tastytrade as the best options trading platform because of its industry-leading options pricing structure, which includes pricing caps that make it the lowest-cost brokerage for high-volume, high-frequency option traders. In addition, tastytrade optimizes tools and content to specifically suit the needs of its options-focused client base.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Capped commission structure for options
Highly regarded tools for analyzing and monitoring options trades
Fantastic options-specific content and educational material
Fully customizable trading experience
Follow Feed feature allows users to follow trades of tastylive contributors
Cons
No on-platform paper trading support
Few investing and retirement resources
Lacks some key investment choices like mutual funds
Overview
Ask any options trader, and they are likely to tell you that this form of derivative trading is complex and difficult to master. But with the right guidance, the many options strategies that are available to use can become powerful weapons that allow both traders and investors to benefit from key factors like time decay and leverage. Created by the same people who developed TD Ameritrade’s highly regarded thinkorswim platform, tastytrade maintains its stance as the best broker for options because of its intuitive delivery of an industry-best mix of comprehensive options-focused tools and content.
Launched as tastyworks in 2017 and headquartered in Chicago, tastytrade delivers very competitive transaction fees for options trading, including standout commission caps for large lot sizes, as well as the absence of any fees when closing positions. Fortunately for tastytrade users, these low commissions come with a platform that continues to undergo enhancements, which complement its already powerful delivery of options analytics, platform workflow, trade execution, and valuable digital content. On Oct. 16, 2024, tastytrade even launched an options backtesting tool–a highly advanced feature that very few competitors boast.

Why We Chose It
Robinhood is Investopedia's choice as the best traditional broker for trading cryptocurrency because of its industry-leading selection of available digital assets and sleek, user-friendly platform.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Simple, intuitive trading experience
$0 trading commissions
Brokerage industry's largest selection of supported crypto assets
Solid cash management features
Available IRA match
Cons
Lack of full transparency around crypto spread pricing
Limited research
Limited account types
Not all crypto assets are tradable through Robinhood Legend
Overview
Robinhood was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in Menlo Park, California. It began as a simple, bare-bones mobile-focused platform determined to disrupt the brokerage industry with no-commission trading on stocks and ETFs. Since then, the company has gone on to introduce options and futures trading, has made solid cash management and IRA matching services available to its Robinhood Gold members, rolled out its more advanced Legend trading platform, and launched a wealth management product known as Robinhood Strategies, along with a number of additional products the company plans to roll out later this year.
Along the way, Robinhood has also introduced cryptocurrency trading to its customers and has continued to build its list of tradable crypto ever since. U.S.-based crypto enthusiasts who appreciate Robinhood for its easy-to-use trading platforms will enjoy selecting from the company's list of 33 supported crypto assets, the brokerage industry's largest. For more advanced traders, however, Robinhood still lacks access to some of the critical research and sophisticated trading tools that some larger industry competitors offer. In addition, commission-free crypto trades still come with spread charges, and roughly half of the cryptocurrencies that Robinhood supports are not tradable through the new Legend platform.
E*TRADE: Best for Mobile Investing & Trading

Why We Chose It
A pioneer in both mobile and online trading, E*TRADE has mastered the art of developing a mobile experience with the right mix of intuitive navigation, robust portfolio and risk management capabilities, deep research, easy-to-digest education, and complex trading tools to cater to investors and traders of all levels. Ongoing enhancements to E*TRADE's mobile capabilities over the past couple of years have solidified its position as our best mobile trading and investing platform for the first time ever.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Excellent range of tools and resources
Pre-built and automated portfolio options
Educational content library
Top mobile apps for traders and investors of all levels
Cons
Lacks international exchange trading
No direct crypto investing
Fractional shares only available through a robo-advisor portfolio or dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP)
Overview
Since its founding in 1982, E*TRADE has been at the forefront of embracing innovation that makes for one of the best customer experiences in the industry. Following Morgan Stanley’s acquisition of E*TRADE in 2020, the company has only continued to advance its capabilities by integrating many of Morgan Stanley’s highly regarded research materials, thought leadership insights, and large pool of financial advisors.
As one of the largest online brokers in the country, E*TRADE brings an expansive list of investment choices and trading tools to clients via its website, desktop, and two mobile platforms.E*TRADE’s already vast educational catalog has only grown with the Morgan Stanley integration, complementing the intuitive site design in a way that lets new investors enter the market with confidence.
For more experienced investors, the ability to do deep analysis has never been greater than now, when proprietary Morgan Stanley research joins highly regarded third-party research and consensus ratings. While E*TRADE only offers these more advanced traders exposure to cryptocurrencies via Spot Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs and related stocks, traders have access to a wide array of analysis tools, charting functionality, and trading technology to make the most informed decisions in this and many other asset classes.
Editor's Note
In addition to our review of E*TRADE’s online brokerage platform, we also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service, E*TRADE Core Portfolios.
The Bottom Line
Through our exhaustive research, we found that Fidelity not only outshines the competition when it comes to ETF investing, low costs, and cash management features, but it is also the best online brokerage platform overall. While International Brokers’ ongoing evolution into a more beginner-friendly platform is driving it closer to parity with the industry’s top all-around brokerage platforms, it remains a top choice for advanced trading techniques and risk management, as well as international trading.
For traders planning to make options the main strategy they use to reach their investment goals, tastytrade’s platform and market content are hard to beat. Charles Schwab’s integration of TD Ameritrade's educational programs and trading personalities has produced an unparalleled body of actionable learning materials and live training content for beginners.
E*TRADE’s long history of enhancing the user experience continues to shine through with its fantastic mobile apps, while Robinhood makes crypto trading fun and easy for crypto enthusiasts.

Why You Should Trust Us
Investopedia collected 89 criteria that are critical to investors from 27 online brokerage companies. We used this data to review each brokerage platform for fees, usability, research amenities, and other key features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decision for their investing needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best online brokerage accounts since 2019.
How to Choose an Online Brokerage Account
Investors choosing an online broker will find a wide range of options, each with varying product offerings, cost structures, and features. The best online broker for you will ultimately depend on your individual goals, priorities, and preferences. Some investors may require advanced platforms with access to niche markets and exotic instruments, while others happily settle for a simple, user-friendly mobile app and cost-effective pricing. Whatever your objectives, here are some key factors to consider when choosing an online broker.
Commissions and fees
The commissions and fees your broker charges directly impact your bottom line and can be a major factor to consider, especially for active traders. Nowadays, with rare exceptions, online brokers offer commission-free stock, ETF, and mutual fund trading, but still charge for options trades. Brokers also generally charge for trading more advanced instruments, like futures, and more exotic asset classes, like cryptocurrencies.
Available assets and instruments
The breadth of assets and instruments available to trade determines how flexible your investment portfolio or trading strategies can be. Most online brokers offer trading in stocks, ETFs, and options. A sizable number also provides access to futures and mutual funds. A small, but steadily growing group allows clients to trade cryptocurrencies.
Some brokers now offer fractional shares, which allow investors to buy a portion of high-priced stocks. This feature can be especially helpful for those with smaller accounts, as it makes expensive stocks more accessible. Access to a specific asset class can be a deciding factor when choosing an online broker.
Your own investing or trading style
Different brokers cater to different trading styles. Whether you manage a long-term stock portfolio, trade complex options strategies, or actively scalp intraday, make sure the platforms and features offered by your broker complement your style and facilitate your trades.
User experience
A well-designed, intuitive platform can make trading easier and more enjoyable for traders of all levels, but especially for beginners. In recent years, many online brokers have invested significant time and money into making the user experience as seamless as possible. Although advanced platforms are improving, they may still come with a learning curve due to the number of instruments and the complexity of tools on offer.
Research tools
Research tools help investors make better trade decisions. Among others, this may include access to market data, analyst ratings, charting tools, and the latest financial reports. Brokers with robust research capabilities may provide traders with an edge by offering quicker access to essential market data.
Educational content
Educational resources are a way for beginners and experienced investors alike to continue improving their knowledge and strategies. A broker offering tutorials, webinars, and in-depth guides can help users stay informed about new trading strategies and grow their trading expertise.
Other key features
Other considerations may include account minimums and benefits, supported order types, customer support accessibility, and premium account offerings. Brokers with zero account minimums are more accessible to new investors, while traders with large account balances may benefit from earning interest on unused cash.
Active traders will value a broker’s support of complex order types, and those who trade international markets or cryptocurrencies will appreciate the ability to get customer support 24/7. More recently, some brokers also began offering premium accounts - providing additional services or offering better pricing, usually in exchange for a monthly fee. Such accounts may be beneficial to certain investors.
Financial Advisor Insight
"When you're thinking about opening a brokerage or investment account, it’s good to start by considering your goals and how hands-on you want to be," said Taylor Kovar, CFP, MBA, a member of Investopedia’s Financial Advisor Council. "Are you looking to invest for something long-term, like retirement or a big purchase, or are you focusing on shorter-term goals? And don’t feel like you have to go all in right away—you can always start small and gradually increase your contributions as you get more comfortable."
What Is the Difference Between a Full-Service Broker and an Online Broker?
This report identifies the best online brokers and trading platforms. It is natural to ask, “How do these brokers and platforms differ from full-service brokers?” One key difference is that online brokers cater to do-it-yourself (DIY) investors. In contrast, full-service brokers aim to relieve you of as much heavy financial lifting as possible by shifting it to their own advisors or affiliated experts.
While online brokers harp on their low costs–not just for trades but also low minimums to open accounts and low costs for access to research, tools, and services–full-service brokers boast of the wide range of their offerings. Those include everything from personal financial planning to insurance, estate planning, retirement planning, accounting services, tax advice, and more.
Still, the boundary between the two categories of brokers is more and more blurry. Online brokers increasingly offer more services, while full-service brokers increasingly cut costs. In fact, many investors would be hard pressed to explain why some online brokers–especially the larger ones–should not be thought of as full-service firms.
Financial Advisor Insight
Certified financial planner Michael Donnelly, who is account director of corporate relations at the CFP Board of Standards, said, “The financial services landscape has dramatically changed over the past 30 years. Firms that once served specific clients now compete to keep pace with broader client needs and lower-cost competitors. [Full]-service and online brokers have had to expand their offerings and cut costs to stay competitive. As a result, investors benefit from more similar and competitively priced products across the financial planning ecosystem.”
Frequently Asked Questions
What Is the Number One Online Stock Broker?
The online brokerage industry is a highly competitive space consisting of a wide range of companies, each offering its own set of features that will appeal differently to individuals. After two months of comprehensive research, Investopedia found that Fidelity offers the best overall online brokerage services and trading platform. Not only did Fidelity earn the highest overall score when measured by our proprietary scoring model, but it also scored highly for its low costs, excellent ETF selection and research, and robust cash management product.
What Is an Online Brokerage Account and How Does it Work?
A brokerage account is a type of account similar in function to the accounts you have with a bank. With a brokerage account, you deposit funds with an investment firm (the brokerage). This is usually done by a transfer from your existing bank account. Once funds are added to your brokerage account, you can put the money to work using the brokerage's trading platform to invest those funds in the market. The assets you buy with your cash can be anything offered by that brokerage, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, and even cryptocurrency.Your online brokerage account will display your holdings (the assets you've purchased) as well as your cash balance (your buying power). If you invest in something that gains in value, you can sell it and the profits will be deposited in your online brokerage account. From there, you can place another trade or even transfer the funds out to your regular bank account to use elsewhere. Some brokerage accounts even allow you to earn interest on your uninvested cash.
How Much Money Do you Need to Open a Brokerage Account?
There is no longer a real minimum to start investing in the financial markets. With many brokers offering margin accounts with access to fractional shares and no required minimums, you can open and fund an account with any amount of money. If you don't have a lot of money to invest, however, it will influence how you approach the market. Although you could invest $1 in fractional shares of a specific stock, the better approach with limited capital is to use ETFs. Index tracking ETFs, for example, offer greater diversification for your dollar than a single company stock because every share (and fractional share) of the ETF replicates an index made up of many companies in many different industries. You could also consider using options to leverage your dollars with a directional bet on the market or a specific stock, but this is an investment strategy best reserved for risk capital—not the whole of your limited investment capital.When investing with small sums, consistency is the key to building wealth. If you can regularly put a set amount of money into the market—even $10 a week—you will be surprised at how quickly it begins to grow. This consistency also helps to smooth market effects, as you will be buying dips and peaks as the market goes up and down.
Can You Invest With a Small Amount of Money?
Many online brokers allow for small minimum deposits which can be a great alternative for those with limited funds. Account minimums (if any) are displayed at the top of our reviews, as well as in our selection of the best platforms for different types of investors. If you are looking for more general guidance on investing with limited capital, check out our article on smart investing on a small budget.
Do Brokers Offer Mobile Platforms?
Some online brokers have powerful mobile apps delivering nearly all the features that their desktop counterparts do. For example, E*TRADE's app, which we picked as our best app for mobile investing and trading, offers two mobile platforms that are streamlined versions of the company's powerful desktop platform.
Can You Lose Money in a Brokerage Account?
Yes, you can. It is a reality of the market that no reward comes without risk. You can lose money buying a bad investment, but you can also lose money by buying a good investment at the wrong time. Investment decisions should be guided by extensive research and careful consideration of your risk tolerance. When it comes to the financial markets, there are endless possibilities for making and losing money. Unless all the funds in your brokerage account are sitting in uninvested cash (brokerage cash accounts are afforded up to $250,000 of protection by Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance), there is a risk you will lose money.Another way of looking at that, however, is that a brokerage account sitting full of uninvested cash isn't at risk of making any money either. You can use strategies like asset allocation and diversification to reduce the risk of losing money, but you will never fully eliminate it without also eliminating your chances of making a decent return.
Can I Buy Stocks Without a Broker?
Yes, you can actually buy and sell stocks without a broker, but it is not a common approach these days. Some companies still offer direct stock purchase plans that allow you to buy shares directly from the company. Companies administer these plans according to internal rules, and some are only open to company employees. You need to contact companies to find out whether they offer a direct stock purchase plan and what the terms and conditions are. These plans initially helped investors avoid brokerage fees, but the rise of online discount brokers with zero fees has removed this barrier, making the direct stock purchase plan somewhat of a relic.
What Is the Difference Between Investing and Trading?
An important thing to consider is the distinction between investing and trading. When people talk about investing, they generally mean buying assets to hold long-term. The goal of investing is to gradually build wealth and reach your retirement goals. Conversely, trading involves short-term strategies that maximize returns on a short-term basis, such as daily or monthly. Trading is generally considered riskier than investing.All these factors are worth considering before choosing an online broker. Do you want to trade or invest? Do you want a great mobile app to check your portfolio wherever you are? What types of assets are you looking to invest in? Answering these questions is not always easy.

We combined our industry research and subject matter expertise to guide the research and weightings for our 2025 online broker rankings. To collect the data, our researchers collected data points through online research of provider websites. To fill in any gaps, our research team reached out to the individual brokerages. In some instances, our researchers did much deeper online research to get the information they needed to complete the data collection. The data collection process spanned from Dec. 20, 2024 to Feb 19, 2025.
We then developed a proprietary model that scored each company to rate its performance across 11 major categories and 120 criteria to find the best online brokers and trading platforms.
