Key Takeaways
There are many options you should consider before withdrawing your retirement savings early.Check your employer's benefits, find creative ways to boost your cash flow, reduce or pause your plan contributions, tap into an emergency fund instead, or see if you qualify for penalty-free withdrawals or loans.Withdrawing from your retirement account early can result in a 10% penalty, on top of the taxes you'll pay on the funds.
Financial emergencies happen, but making an early withdrawal from a retirement account isn’t your only option.
In fact, withdrawing from your 401(k) or other retirement accounts before age 59 and a half can lead to a steep 10% penalty fee, on top of the taxes you’ll pay on the funds.
Yet, nearly 40% of employees report having done so, and a third plan to do so again next year, according to a new survey by Payroll Integrations.
They’re not typically trying to cover discretionary costs. Of those who report tapping into their retirement funds early, 37% said they did so to pay emergency expenses like car or home repairs.
More than 40% of Gen Z employees report withdrawing funds to pay off debt. More than one-third of respondents also said they’ve withdrawn money from their retirement account to cover rising everyday costs, or plan to do so.
“For many people, dipping into their retirement funds feels like the only option they have left,” said Doug Sabella, CEO of Payroll Integrations. “They’ve likely already cut out non-essential expenses, tightened their budgets, and still can’t afford to make ends meet. But before withdrawing from retirement accounts, it’s worth it to explore a few other strategies.”
Here’s how you can cover expenses without paying a harsh penalty or cutting into retirement funds.
Check Out Your Employer's Benefits
If you have benefits through your employer, you might be able to cut costs in surprising places, Sabella said.
“Look into pre-tax commuter benefits, wellness stipends, WFH reimbursements, or technology allowances—all of which can add up quickly,” he said. “Some companies also offer hardship grants, employee assistance programs, or even pay advances in emergency situations.”
Many of these options are overlooked, and though small to start, they can make a big difference.
Find Creative Ways To Boost Cash Flow
If your paycheck isn’t enough to make ends meet, additional revenue streams might be enough to supplement the shortfall. This doesn’t have to mean taking on a second full-time job.
“While these revenue streams may not cover all expenses, they can relieve short-term pressure and help you preserve your retirement savings for the future,” Sabella said.
He recommends leveraging your professional skills through freelancing opportunities, like writing, tutoring, design work, or data analysis.
“You could also consider selling items for a quick cash infusion, such as designer clothing or handbags, small appliances, gym equipment, electronics, [or] lawnmowers,” said Lindsay Theodore, certified financial planner and thought leadership senior manager at T. Rowe Price.
Spending an afternoon decluttering your home and selling unused items on Facebook Marketplace, eBay or in a local consignment shop could earn you enough to cover an unexpected expense.
Reduce or Pause Retirement Contributions
If you’re still making contributions to your retirement account, lowering those contributions or pausing them altogether to free up cash is better than tapping into it early.
That money can then be redirected to a more accessible emergency fund, Sabella said. Starting an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account allows the money to grow, just like it could in a 401(k) or similar account.
Build an Emergency Fund
Unexpected expenses highlight the importance of having an emergency fund. Not only are emergency funds crucial to financial planning in general, but they can also help safeguard your retirement savings.
For instance, those enrolled in a Vanguard-administered 401(k) plan who also have at least $2,000 saved in an emergency fund not only contribute more to their retirement accounts but also take fewer withdrawals while working and are less likely to cash out their accounts after leaving their jobs.
It might seem impossible to build an emergency fund if you’re already being stretched thin paying for groceries, bills, medical care, and other expenses. But it doesn’t have to be a lot of money.
Meagan Dow, senior strategist at Edward Jones, said that while they recommend saving at least three to six months of living expenses, she recognizes that “that's a huge number for most people.”
It’s easy to see a large recommended rule of thumb for saving, but think it’s not feasible for you, and not even start, she said. But any emergency savings is better than none, especially if it curbs retirement withdrawals.
Explore Penalty-Free Options
In addition to an emergency fund, taxable investments can also be used to fall back on instead of your retirement savings. Consumers should consider withdrawing from any taxable investments they may hold before touching their retirement, said Theodore.
If you’re still feeling stretched thin to pay for necessities in cases of hardship, you may be able to take a penalty-free early withdrawal from your 401(k) as a last-resort option.
Savers can take a hardship withdrawal from their 401(k) if they have an “immediate and heavy financial need” according to the IRS.
You can take a hardship withdrawal from your 401(k) to cover the following:
Medical bills for you, your spouse, dependents, or beneficiary.Costs directly related to the purchase of your principal residence, though mortgage payments don't count.Payments necessary to prevent eviction or the foreclosure of your primary residence.Certain expenses to repair damage to your principal residence.Tuition, educational expenses (including fees), and room and board for the next 12 months of college for you or your spouse, children, dependents, or beneficiary.Funeral expenses for you, your spouse, children, dependents, or beneficiary.
These withdrawals will still be taxed as income.
Taking a loan from your retirement account rather than a full withdrawal is also a penalty-free option. In most cases, you need to pay the borrowed money back, plus interest on the loan, within five years.
However, you won’t owe extra taxes on the money, since it will go back into your account once you pay it back. The amount you can borrow from your retirement account depends on your employer.
