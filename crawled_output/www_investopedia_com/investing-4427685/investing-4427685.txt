Bond
A bond is an investment representing part or all of a loan to a person, government, or other entity. Bonds are issued at a set par value, usually $1000 or $100, and their prices fluctuates based on interest rates and perceived credit-worthiness of the borrower.
Learn More
Bond Yield
A bond’s yield is the investment return that an investor will gain from a bond, usually expressed as a percentage. This is the percent of the bond’s price that each set interest payment will be. Yields go up as a bond’s price goes down and vice versa because they are a percent of the bond’s value, therefore the higher the bond’s price, the lower a percentage of that value a set interest payment will be.
Learn More
Technical Analysis
Technical analysis is a form of stock analysis that involves looking at the price movements of stocks over time in order to predict where they will go. It attempts to find patterns in stock movements based on statistical trends such as the moving average of a stock or its trading volume. This contrasts with fundamental analysis which looks at the financial values of the business that issued the stock and economic conditions affecting the market and that business in order to assess where a stock’s price will go.
Learn More
Sector Breakdown
A sector breakdown is a way to look at a portfolio by organizing it by which sector of the economy each stock is in. This allows an investor to, depending on their investing strategy, avoid stocks from companies in sectors they don’t believe to have strong prospects, focus on stocks from sectors they believe are in a good position for growth, or ensure their portfolio is diversified.
Learn More
Short-Term Investments
Short term investments are investments that are designed to be held for a year or less or investments a company intends to sell within 12 months. They are also known as “marketable securities” or “temporary investments,” and can be easily sold for cash.
Learn More
Investment Banker
An investment banker works for a bank that deals mostly with raising capital for large institutions such as governments and corporations. They also deal with corporate restructuring as well as corporate mergers & acquisition (M&A).
Learn More
Wall Street
Wall Street is a street in New York City which, due to having been a historical center of the U.S. financial industry, is used as a term to refer to that industry as a whole. It is often contrasted to Main Street, which is used as a term to represent the broader economy outside the financial industry, especially small businesses.
