Key Takeaways
You can still earn up to 5.00% with today’s best high-yield savings rates, even after the Federal Reserve’s rate cut.
Expect deposit yields to slip if the Fed follows through with another half-point in cuts this year.
Rate forecasts for 2026 and 2027 point lower, too, though long-term predictions are far from certain.
The best nationwide CDs let you lock in guaranteed returns in the 4%–5% range, protecting today’s yields through 2027, 2028, or even 2030.

Despite Fed Cuts, These Top Accounts Still Pay up to 5.00%
Most of the top-paying savings and money market accounts haven’t flinched in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s rate cut last week.

The leading money market account, paying 4.80%, has also held steady.
Here are the 13 highest-paying accounts you can open today, with full details provided in our daily rankings of the best high-yield savings accounts and best money market accounts.

It may be surprising to see so many top annual percentage yields (APYs) holding firm after a Fed rate cut. But that’s in part because the move was anticipated for weeks, and many banks and credit unions had already priced in the expected rate move.

How Long Can Today’s Savings Yields Last?
No Federal Reserve rate move is a sure thing until it’s officially announced, so projections about where interest rates are headed should always be viewed as estimates, not certainties. Alongside Wednesday’s quarter-point cut, the Fed also released its quarterly “dot plot” forecast showing where officials expect the federal funds rate to be at the end of this year and over the next two years.
Matching the market’s predictions, the median forecast among central bankers was for another half-point in cuts by year-end. If that proves true, the best savings and money market yields could also drop by about the same amount—though each bank or credit union will make its own decision that could be more or less than the Fed’s move.
Looking further out, the dot plot pointed to another quarter-point cut in 2026 and again in 2027. Forecasts that far into the future aren’t especially reliable, but they do signal that deposit rates on savings, money market, and CD accounts may gradually drift lower in the coming years.
Of course, none of these projections are certain. Six of the Fed’s 19 committee members said last week they don’t expect rates to fall any further this year. While not the majority view, that’s nearly a third of the committee—underscoring that the path from here will depend heavily on upcoming inflation and jobs data.
CDs Let You Protect Today’s High Yields Before They Disappear
If you can set aside part of your savings, now is an excellent time to open one of today’s top nationwide CDs—before rates fall further. Unlike savings account yields, which can drop quickly, a certificate of deposit locks in your return for the full term—whether that’s 3 months, 5 years, or anything in between. The APY you secure today is yours to keep, no matter how much or how fast the Fed cuts rates.
Right now, the best CDs in the country are led by a 5.50% offer on a 9-month term—though it’s capped at deposits of $5,000. For larger balances, the national leader is paying 4.60% for 7 months—or you can secure up to 4.50% for a full year.
Prefer to lock in your rate for longer? There are plenty of options in the low-4% range for terms from 18 months to 5 years, letting you guarantee today’s yield until 2027, 2028, or even 2030.

Important
Note that the "top rates" quoted here are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is much different than the national average, which includes all banks offering a CD with that term, including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, the national averages are always quite low, while the top rates you can unearth by shopping around are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher.
How We Find the Best Savings and CD Rates
Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify a maximum deposit amount that's below $5,000.
Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. For more about how we choose the best rates, read our full methodology.
Article Sources
Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work. These include white papers, government data, original reporting, and interviews with industry experts. We also reference original research from other reputable publishers where appropriate. You can learn more about the standards we follow in producing accurate, unbiased content in our
