Key Takeaways
The Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points to 4% to 4.25% on Wednesday, a decision that had investors positioning their portfolios ahead of time.
Major investors weren't the only ones speculating on the move: Prediction markets saw over $300 million wagered on this week's Fed decision across platforms managed by Kalshi, Polymarket, Robinhood Markets (HOOD), and Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR).
The growth in prediction markets has helped transform monetary policy into America's newest betting spectacle.
Americans wagered more than $300 million on the Fed's quarter-point interest rate move this week—not through complex derivatives or bond trades, but on platforms that work like DraftKings for monetary policy.
The Federal Reserve's expected 25 basis point cut was anticlimactic—experts had expected it for weeks—so the real drama unfolded on prediction market platforms where you can bet yes/no on cultural, political, and economic questions.
Is this sophisticated hedging, or has America's gambling problem found a new game? Wall Street quants still have intricate ways to speculate on the Fed's moves, but with platforms already lining up to take bets on October's meeting, it's clear that the dryness of monetary policy jargon and Jerome Powell’s pressers haven't stopped them from joining the Super Bowl as spectacles Americans are ready to bet big on.
How Fed Funds Rate Changes Turned Into Big-Time Wagers
While the hundreds of millions wagered on this week's Fed decision pales next to Polymarket's $3.2 billion presidential election bonanza, it still represents serious money—and serious growth.
Kalshi's $91 million nearly doubled their previous two Fed meetings combined.
Polymarket's volume topped $208 million.
Interactive Brokers, which only recently launched Fed-focused contracts through its ForecastTrader platform, said they've become "among our most popular instruments," according to director of public relations Kat Ewert.
Robinhood, too, saw a spike in trading related to the Fed's moves, telling Investopedia that nearly 40 million contracts traded within its Fed prediction market this month.
Robinhood's representatives said the retail platform has seen over 2 billion contracts traded so far this year across all prediction markets. While the platform saw about 500 million contracts traded in the week leading up to the presidential election, Fed decisions generated their own surge—tens of millions of contracts this month alone, the company said.
"Whether it's sports, economics, financials, politics, or any other type of prediction market we offer, there is always a spike in interest and activity as the event approaches," JB Mackenzie, vice president and general manager of futures and international at Robinhood, told Investopedia.
Across all platforms, traders overwhelmingly bet on a 25-basis-point cut, with odds climbing to 80% to 90% in the final days, falling in line with analysts' predictions and, indeed, the Fed's rate cut this week.

Trading the Fed: Then vs. Now
The traditional way to speculate on the Fed's moves was to buy or sell Treasury bonds: if you thought the Fed would cut rates, you'd buy shorter-term bonds, expecting yields to fall and bond prices to rise. If you expected a hike, you'd sell or short bonds, betting yields would climb.
Another avenue was the Fed funds futures market, where traders essentially placed bets on where the overnight lending rate would land at a specific future date. Some investors used interest rate swaps or short-term debt instruments like Treasury bills to play the same game, while more aggressive traders shorted high-yield debt or piled into floating-rate notes.
How the Prediction Markets Work
All of these indirect methods are complex and often require significant capital. By contrast, today's prediction markets strip the bet down to its simplest form: a dollar-for-dollar contract that pays off if you're right and zeroes out if you're wrong.
This approach has appeal. In an email to Investopedia, Jack Such, head of media for Kalshi, said that Kalshi has seen "exponential increase in new users and trading volume in 2025." And, just like in Vegas, the action isn't stopping: betting lines for October's Fed meeting are already live, with traders placing 80% odds on another 25 basis point cut on Polymarket.
On platforms like Kalshi, Fed decisions are priced as yes/no contracts, with each cent representing a 1% probability, ranging between $0.01 and $0.99. Buy "Yes" on a 25 basis point cut at 79 cents, and you'll receive $1 if you're right—a 27% return. If you're wrong, your contract goes to zero.
"Using Kalshi is a superior way to trade on the Fed's decision because of the lack of abstraction," Such said. Unlike the bond market, where "you can be right and still end up losing money," prediction markets strip the bet down to its essence: a dollar-for-dollar contract that pays off if you're right and goes to zero if you're wrong.
The appeal goes beyond simplicity.
"Prediction markets leverage the power and rigor of financial market structure," Mackenzie said. "Customers can access event contracts in real time and manage risk by adjusting—or exiting—their positions right up until a contract expires."
Tip
Each cent in a contract price is often read as 1% odds, but that’s only a guide. Trading fees, liquidity, and risk preferences can push your actual returns away from the “true” probabilities.
But the legal landscape remains murky.
Kalshi won a crucial victory last fall when a federal judge ruled that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) exceeded its authority in blocking Kalshi’s election contract. In May 2025, the CFTC dropped its appeal, clearing the path for those listings for political prediction markets. That ruling emboldened platforms to expand beyond politics into Fed decisions, earnings reports, and economic data—all operating in a regulatory gray zone between financial derivatives and gambling.
Polymarket operates offshore, while Kalshi has CFTC approval as a designated contract market. Interactive Brokers offers similar contracts through ForecastEx. Each platform insists they're offering legitimate financial instruments for hedging and price discovery, not gambling products—a distinction that many state gaming regulators and representatives of America's gaming industry dispute.
"We have serious concerns regarding their lightly regulated offerings and potential effects to consumer protections, gaming integrity, and responsibility," Joe Maloney, a senior vice president of strategic communications at the American Gaming Association, told Investopedia. The group says its surveys show that a vast majority (85%) of Americans view the sports version of these contracts as gambling, not financial instruments.
The Bottom Line
The more than $300 million wagered on this week's Fed decision shows how everyday Americans checking on monetary policy is about more now than the potential direction of mortgage and bond rates. Whether events contracts signal the democratization of finance or the gamification of policy, the effect is the same: Fed meetings are now marquee events with odds, payouts, and hundreds of millions at stake.
