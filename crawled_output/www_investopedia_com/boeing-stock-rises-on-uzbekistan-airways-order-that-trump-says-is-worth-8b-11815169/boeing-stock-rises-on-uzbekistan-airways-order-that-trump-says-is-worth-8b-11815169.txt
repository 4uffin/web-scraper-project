KEY TAKEAWAYS
Boeing has logged its biggest-ever single order with a sale of up to 22 787 Dreamliners to Uzbekistan Airways in a deal President Donald Trump said is worth more than $8 billion.The companies said Monday that Uzbekistan Airways would buy 14 of Boeing’s 787-9 Dreamliner jets, with options for eight more.The companies said the investment will support “nearly 35,000 U.S. jobs.”The two companies announced the deal as Washington and Beijing reportedly are in the final stages of talks for a “huge” Boeing aircraft order, according to Bloomberg.
Boeing (BA) has logged its biggest-ever single order with a sale of up to 22 787 Dreamliners to Uzbekistan Airways, in a deal President Donald Trump said is worth more than $8 billion. The companies said the investment will support “nearly 35,000 U.S. jobs.”
Boeing and the Central Asian airline said Monday that Uzbekistan Airways would buy 14 of Boeing’s 787-9 Dreamliner jets, with options for eight more. The airline said the order would help modernize its fleet and "expand its international routes to the U.S. and other long-haul destinations as demand for international travel continues to rise." The Dreamliner is a wide-body jet known for being fuel efficient.
“Earlier this month I spoke with the Highly Respected President of Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev. Today I want to congratulate President Mirziyoyev on signing a GREAT Deal with Boeing!” President Trump said in on his Truth Social platform. He added that the deal is "worth over $8 Billion Dollars."
After the announcement, shares of the U.S. plane maker were up 3% in morning trading. The stock entered 2025 up 20%, after stumbling last year following a series of safety incidents and a crippling strike at its Washington plants.
The two companies announced the deal as Washington and Beijing reportedly are in the final stages of negotiations for a “huge” Boeing aircraft order, Bloomberg reported, citing U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue at a briefing in Beijing.
“This is a huge order, and it’s very important to the president. Very important for Boeing. I think it’s very important to China,” Perdue said Tuesday. “I think that we’re in the last days of that, weeks of that negotiation, and we’re hopeful that that will turn out to be the case.”
According to the Bloomberg report Tuesday, Perdue didn’t offer details on the size of the potential order from China, but noted that a deal for Boeing aircraft would be the centerpiece of a trade agreement between the two countries. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
UPDATE—Sept. 23, 2025: This article has been updated with the latest share price information and a report that the U.S. and China are close to a deal on a Boeing order.
