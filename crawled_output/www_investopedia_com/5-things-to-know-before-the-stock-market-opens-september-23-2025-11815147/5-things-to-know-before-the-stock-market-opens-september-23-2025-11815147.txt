Stock futures are little changed this morning after major indexes hit record highs for the third straight session yesterday; Nvidia (NVDA) shares are down slightly in premarket trading after surging following news of the company's $100 billion investment in OpenAI; Micron Technology (MU) is expected to report strong earnings when it releases its financials after markets close today; Boeing (BA) shares are rising after the aircraft manufacturer signed its biggest-ever single order; and the OECD projects U.S. GDP growth will remain resilient this year but will slow in 2026 as tariffs and lower immigration weigh on the economy. Here's what investors need to know today.
1. Stock Futures Flat After Three Days of Record Highs
Stock futures are flat after major market indexes hit record highs for the third consecutive session yesterday. Investors will be following remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell today after the central bank last week made its first interest rate cut of the year. Futures tied to the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.1% in recent trading, while those linked to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell fractionally. Gold futures hit another record high this morning, trading at around $3,820 an ounce. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was up slightly at around $113,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects borrowing costs on a wide array loans, was at 4.12% recently, down from 4.15% at yesterday's close.
2. Nvidia in Focus After $100 Billion Investment in OpenAI
Nvidia (NVDA) shares are in focus after the world’s most valuable company said yesterday it would invest up to $100 billion into ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Shares of Nvidia surged on the news yesterday, gaining close to 4%, while other chipmakers also moved higher.  "This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward—deploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a release. Nvidia said the first of those 10 gigawatts is expected to be deployed in the second half of next year. Nvidia shares were down about 1% in premarket trading.
3. Micron Expected to Report Strong Earnings Growth
Memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU) is set to release its earnings report after markets close today. Analysts are expecting continued strong sales from the company as the Nvidia-partner has seen strong data center sales from AI-driven demand. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha expect Micron's adjusted earnings per share to more than double to $2.82, while quarterly revenue is estimated to have risen 43% from the year-ago quarter to $11.12 billion. The chipmaker’s stock hit a new record high last week amid bullish analyst sentiment over the company’s AI exposure. Shares of Micron were up more than 1% ahead of the opening bell.
4. Boeing Shares Rise on News of Big 787 Dreamliner Order
Shares of Boeing (BA) are moving higher this morning after the company announced its single largest order in history. Boeing will sell up to 22 787 Dreamliners to Uzbekistan Airways, which the company said will support 35,000 jobs. In a Truth Social post, President Donald Trump said the deal was worth over $8 billion deal and came after he spoke with Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev earlier this month. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. and China are in the final stages of negotiations on a large order for Boeing aircraft. Boeing’s second-quarter deliveries shot past analysts' estimates as the plane maker continues its turnaround under a new CEO. Shares of Boeing, which through Monday's close had gained 20% so far this year, were up more than 2% in premarket trading.
5. OECD Says Tariffs, Lower Immigration to Weigh on U.S. GDP in 2026
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Tuesday raised its growth forecast for the U.S. economy in 2025 on the back of AI investments, but noted that tariffs and lower net immigration would lead to slowing growth next year. The OECD said it expects the U.S.'s annual real GDP growth rate to come in at 1.8% in 2025, up from from its previous projection of 1.6%. However, U.S. GDP is projected to grow by just 1.5% next year. "Strong AI-related investment boosted outcomes in the United States," the Paris-based body said, but also noted that GDP growth is falling from 2024 as "strong investment growth in high technology sectors is more than offset by higher tariff rates and a drop in net immigration."
