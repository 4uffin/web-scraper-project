Stock indexes rose Monday, aided by news that Nvidia and OpenAI were partnering on AI data-center infrastructure.

U.S. stock indexes rose to begin the week, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average, benchmark S&P 500, and tech-heavy Nasdaq all setting record intraday and closing highs for a third straight session.
The Nasdaq and S&P 500 ended up 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively, while the Dow was 0.1% higher. The indexes were aided by the news that Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI were partnering on a buildout of data centers, and that the AI chipmaker would be investing up to $100 billion in the ChatGPT developer. Nvidia shares hit an all-time high and closed up 4%.
Stock investors mostly ignored a potential U.S. government shutdown, but safe-haven gold futures were up 2% to trade at an record-high $3,780 an ounce at 4 p.m. ET, and riskier assets like cryptocurrencies sold off. Bitcoin was down 3% at around $112,100, while Ether was 7% lower at $4,150.
The 10-year Treasury yield, which affects borrowing costs on a variety of consumer and commercial loans, rose to 4.15% from 4.13% at Friday's close. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, was fractionally lower at $62.65 a barrel. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies and hit its lowest level since early 2022 Wednesday, slipped 0.3% to 97.32.
Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) closed up more than 4% and nearly 2%, respectively, after both received price-target hikes. Piper Sandler raised its price target on Tesla stock to $500 from $400, while Wedbush lifted its target for Apple shares to $310 from $270.
Oracle (ORCL) stock surged more than 6% after the company unexpectedly said CEO Safra Catz would be shifting to an executive vice chair role and that executives Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia were being promoted to run the company.
Kenvue (KVUE) shares dropped 7.5% to lead S&P 500 decliners on a report the Trump administration was set to link use of Tylenol by pregnant women to autism.

The day's top performance in the S&P 500 belonged to shares of semiconductor equipment maker Teradyne (TER), which surged 13%. Susquehanna Financial boosted its price target on Teradyne stock, with its analysts saying the provider of automated test equipment for semiconductors and robotic systems could benefit from strong demand trends over the coming years and highlighting Teradyne's increasing partnership with chip industry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM).
White House officials confirmed that Oracle (ORCL) is part of a consortium set to control the U.S. operations of the social media platform TikTok. Oracle also announced that Clay Magouyrk, current president of cloud infrastructure, and Mike Sicilia, president of industries, will take the reins of the enterprise software giant as co-CEOs. Current CEO Safra Catz will remain with Oracle as the executive vice chair of its board, while co-founder Larry Ellison will maintain his role as chief technology officer and board chair. Oracle shares jumped 6.3%.

Moderna (MRNA) shares gained 5.2% after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine panel voted on updated recommendations related to COVID shots. While the CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices removed guidance calling for all people to be vaccinated against COVID and now recommends that patients consult with their doctor before receiving the shot, the panel opted not to require patients to obtain a prescription for the vaccine.
Decliners
Shares of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (WAB), a provider of equipment for freight and passenger railway systems, added 4.9%. The company also known as Wabtec announced a deal worth more than $4 billion to deliver 300 of its Evolution Series locomotives to Kazakhstan's national railway company over the coming decade and provide long-term service support. Citi analysts initiated coverage on Wabco stock with a "buy" rating, suggesting the company could benefit from increasing infrastructure investment as well as moves by railroad operators to renew and expand their fleets.
Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue (KVUE) dropped 7.5%, the most of any S&P 500 stock, following reports that the Trump administration planned to make an announcement linking use of the painkiller during pregnancy to autism. A presentation on the matter happened at the White House after the closing bell. Kenvue, the consumer health company that spun off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, said that scientific studies show no link between acetaminophen and autism.
Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) launched a pair of new features for its Facebook Dating service—an AI assistant that provides support throughout the dating process and a function that offers automatic matches with potential partners based on Facebook's algorithms. Shares of Match Group (MTCH), operator of Tinder, Hinge, and other dating platforms, fell 5.4%.
Lennar (LEN) shares fell 4.3% on Monday, extending losses posted Friday after the homebuilder missed quarterly sales and profit forecasts. Following the softer-than-expected earnings results, Raymond James downgraded Lennar stock to "underperform" from "market perform." Analysts suggested that Lennar's margins could remain under pressure, citing the company's use of selling incentives to attract buyers and its elevated on technology and teams.

Gold Rally Still Has Room to Run, Expects Say
3 hr 59 min ago
Gold surged to a fresh record high on Monday after notching its first inflation-adjusted record since 1980 earlier this month.
Gold prices have been boosted by several interconnected factors: geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty, a weaker U.S. dollar, and the interest rate outlook.
Veteran bond trader Jeffrey Gundlach last week forecast gold would reach $4,000 an ounce before the end of the year, and said a 25% allocation to the precious metal was "not excessive" given underlying trends.

How Concerning Is Inflation Right Now? Fed Officials Are Divided
5 hr 26 min ago
Today's inflation trends are either something to worry about or no big deal, depending on which Federal Reserve official you ask.
On Monday, at least four members of the central bank's policy committee discussed whether the Fed should cut its key interest rate further in the months ahead. This is the first time some have spoken publicly since the central bank's policy-setting committee decided last week to cut borrowing costs for the first time in 2025.
Three speakers explained why they favored a cautious approach and were concerned about the risks of high inflation. Meanwhile, the newest member of the committee advocated steep rate cuts.

The comments shed light on the reasoning behind the division among Fed officials, which was clear in the FOMC's policy predictions released last week alongside the rate decision.
Seven of 19 FOMC members thought the September rate cut would be the last for the year, while 11 favored at least one additional quarter-point cut this year. Fed Governor Stephen Miran was a conspicuous outlier, calling for the Fed to cut its rate by one and a quarter percentage points to a range of 2.75% to 3% in its remaining two meetings this year."The chasm between the maximum and minimum dots was immense, particularly considering there are only two meetings remaining this year," economists at Deutsche Bank wrote in a research note.

New Student Loan Limits May Force More Borrowers to Take Out Private Loans
6 hr 59 min ago
Borrowers will be restricted in the amount of federal student loans they can take out, which could lead to more students—especially those pursuing a medical degree—taking out private loans.
The "One Big, Beautiful Bill" generally lowers the amount of federal money that college students can borrow starting in the 2026-27 academic year. Students may need to bridge the gap between the amount of money they can borrow and the cost of school.

Some advocates and experts say borrowers will be forced to take out private loans to cover the costs.
“Proponents of these lending caps argue that by limiting federal aid, schools will be forced to lower decades-worth of price hikes. However, data has shown that this is simply not the case," Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at Protect Borrowers, a loan borrower advocacy group, said in a Senate hearing last week. "Instead, students and families will be simply pushed into more expensive, riskier, predatory, private student loan debt."

Low Expectations for Apple's iPhone 17 Could Be Helping Boost the Stock. Here's Why
7 hr 38 min ago
Apple’s iPhone 17 is turning some heads on Wall Street with signs of surprisingly strong demand, after a lackluster launch.
Shares of the stock were up more than 3% at around $254 Monday afternoon, after Wedbush analysts led by longterm Apple (AAPL) bull Dan Ives raised their price target to a new street high of $310 from $270, pointing to signs of better-than-expected demand.
"Heading into this iPhone 17 cycle we were expecting this upgrade cycle to be a good, but not great one," the analysts told clients in a Sunday note, amid some worries consumers waiting for bigger design changes and delayed AI features could hold back demand.
However, “we are positively surprised," the analysts said, with their checks indicating the iPhone 17 "tracking 10%-15% ahead of iPhone 16 so far.” The "Street is clearly underestimating this iPhone cycle," they said, with muted expectations helping fuel enthusiasm for the stock.

Nvidia to Invest Up to $100B in ChatGPT Maker OpenAI as Firms Partner on Data-Center Infrastructure
8 hr 58 min ago
Nvidia and OpenAI's business relationship is entering a new phase.
The world's most valuable company and the maker of ChatGPT announced a partnership that "enables OpenAI to build and deploy at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers with NVIDIA systems representing millions of GPUs for OpenAI's next-generation AI infrastructure." Nvidia added it "intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI progressively as each gigawatt is deployed."
"NVIDIA and OpenAI have pushed each other for a decade, from the first DGX supercomputer to the breakthrough of ChatGPT," Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in the press release announcing the deal. "This investment and infrastructure partnership mark the next leap forward—deploying 10 gigawatts to power the next era of intelligence."
"Everything starts with compute,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. "Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale."
Nvidia shares soared 3.5% on the news.
Oracle Names Pair to Replace CEO Catz as Software Provider Raises AI Bets
10 hr 2 min ago
Oracle (ORCL) Monday named a pair of new CEOs, including the former head of its cloud infrastructure business, to take over from Safra Catz as the software firm boosts its bets on AI.
Oracle said Monday that Clay Magouyrk, president of Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business, and Mike Sicilia, president of Oracle Industries, will be co-CEOs. Catz, who has been CEO of the firm since 2019 and was named co-CEO in 2014, will shift to a role as executive vice chair of the software company.
Oracle shares have surged this year as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom boosted its cloud computing business, with the company recently saying that its backlog swelled to $455 billion after it signed four multibillion-dollar cloud deals in its fiscal first quarter.
"Safra led Oracle as we became a hyperscale cloud powerhouse—clearly demonstrated by our recent results. In her role as Vice Chair, Safra and I will be able to continue our 26-year partnership—helping to guide Oracle's direction, growth and success,” co-founder Larry Ellison said Monday.

Kenvue Stock Drops on Report White House Plans to Link Tylenol to Autism Risk
10 hr 49 min ago
Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue (KVUE) are dropping in morning trading on a report that the White House is expected to make an announcement Monday linking pregnant women's use of the painkiller to increased risk of autism.
According to The Washington Post, Trump administration officials plan to unveil that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, can lead to higher risk of autism and will warn pregnant women against using the medication unless they have a fever.
Tylenol parent Kenvue said that scientific studies showed that there was no link between acetaminophen and autism.

The report cited four people with knowledge of the plans for the announcement plan. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has previously been widely reported as planning to unveil that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy may be one of several causes of autism.
Kenvue said that scientific studies showed that there was no link between acetaminophen and autism.
“We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,” a Kenvue spokesperson said in response for comment. “We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.”

Pfizer Jumps Into Weight-Loss Drug Segment With $7.3 Billion Metsera Deal
11 hr 58 min ago
Metsera (MTSR) shares skyrocketed 60% in premarket trading after Pfizer (PFE) agreed to purchase the biopharma firm for up to $7.3 billion to jump into the lucrative weight-loss drug segment. Shares of Pfizer were up slightly.
Pfizer announced that it would pay $47.50 per share in cash for all outstanding shares of Metsera, a 43% premium to Friday’s closing price. Metsera investors could receive as much as $22.50 more per share “tied to three specific clinical and regulatory milestones” for Metsera’s experimental MET-097i+MET-233i combination obesity treatment.
Pfizer noted that Mesera has a portfolio of weight-loss medicine candidates “aimed at addressing key unmet needs via fewer injections while achieving improved efficacy and tolerability.”
Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said the acquisition “aligns with our focus on directing our investments to the most impactful opportunities and propels Pfizer into this key therapeutic area.” In April, the company ended development of its experimental danuglipron obesity pill on concerns about potential liver damage.
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Metsera only began trading at the end of January, and are up 25% since then.

Trump Says Murdochs, Dell Likely Part of Group Buying TikTok in the US
13 hr 9 min ago
President Donald Trump said that Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch, as well as Dell Technologies (DELL) CEO Michael Dell, may be involved in the group buying Chinese-owned TikTok’s U.S operations.

"You know, they’re very well-known people. And Larry Ellison is one of them. He’s involved. He’s a great guy. Michael Dell is involved. I hate to tell you this, but a man named Lachlan is involved,” Trump said, referring to Lachlan Murdoch, CEO of Fox Corp, parent company of Fox News. Trump also said that Rupert Murdoch “is probably going to be in the group" and added the buyers were all "American patriots."
President Donald Trump in an order last week extended to mid-December the deadline under which TikTok parent ByteDance would have to sell the social media platform to a U.S.-based owner or be banned in the country over national security concerns. TikTok has around 170 million users in the U.S.
