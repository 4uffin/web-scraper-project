Key Takeaways
This fall, 8.2 million New York state residents are set to receive one-time inflation refund checks ranging from $150 to $400, depending on filing status and income.
Eligibility is based on 2023 income, residency status, and whether you were claimed as a dependent on another person's tax return.
Checks will be automatically mailed to the address listed on recipients’ most recent New York State tax return, so those who are eligible won't have to take any action.
If you were a New York state resident in 2023, you may be eligible to receive an inflation refund check this fall.
These one-time checks, which are either $150 or $200 for single-filers, or $300 or $400 for married couples filing jointly, will be sent to eligible recipients starting at the end of this month and through November.
Governor Kathy Hochul first announced these checks back in May as a way to refund residents for inflation costs. This money comes out of the state's sales tax revenue, which grew as rising inflation increased the cost of goods and services.
“Starting in October, over 8 million New Yorkers will get an inflation refund because it's simple—this is your money and we're putting it back in your pockets,” Governor Hochul said in May.
Roughly 8.2 million households in New York state are expected to receive checks. Regions with the most recipients are New York City (3.5 million), Long Island (1.25 million), and Mid-Hudson (924,000).

Who Is Eligible To Receive A Check?
These checks will be sent automatically to eligible New York residents. Whether you receive a check depends on your income from the 2023 tax year, your residency status at the time (part-time residents are not eligible), and if you were considered a dependent on someone else's tax return.
To qualify, you must have filed form IT-201, a New York State Resident Income Tax Return, for tax year 2023.
These checks will be mailed to the address on your most recently filed tax return.
"You may receive your check sooner or later than your neighbors, as mailings are not based on ZIP code or region," the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance states. "We cannot provide a specific delivery schedule, and our Contact Center representatives will not have additional information on the status of your check."
