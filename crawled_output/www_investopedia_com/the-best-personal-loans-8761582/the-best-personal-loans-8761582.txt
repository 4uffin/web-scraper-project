Why We Chose It
LightStream makes our list twice, as Best Overall and Best for Large Loan Amounts. It hit the sweet spot in our scoring rubric: low APRs, a wide range of loan amounts, and a very wide range of repayment options. If you need a large sum, for a home improvement or a boat, LightStream lends up to $100,000. You’ll have up to 20 years to repay for specific loan uses (like home improvements).
Pros & Cons
Pros
Low APRs
No fees
Loan amounts up to $100,000
Loan terms up to 240 months (20 years)
Same-day funding
Cons
High minimum loan amount
No pre-qualification
Requires good to excellent credit
Limited customer support options
Overview
In our research, LightStream scored well in all the areas that matter most to most borrowers. Its advertised APRs are competitive, and there are no fees, not even for late payments. It offers lengthy repayment terms and loan amounts of up to $100,000. With autopay, you can shave 0.50% of your APR. If you find a better rate on an unsecured loan from another lender, LightStream will beat it by 0.10%.
Fund dispersal is fast, as soon as the same day if you accept a loan proposal before 2:30 p.m. ET. You can also delay funding up to 90 days, which can help if you’re planning a home improvement and don’t want to begin repaying a loan before you’ve spent any of it.
Although LightStream is our top choice, it has some flaws. The most glaring is the lack of loan pre-qualification, which Investopedia considers an important shopping tool. You’ll have to complete an application to find out your loan details, which means a small hit to your credit score.
LightStream’s minimum loan amount of $5,000 may be too high for some borrowers, depending on their needs. LightStream is a solid choice if you have good to excellent credit, but you’ll have to shop elsewhere if you don't. Finally, we also found LightStream’s customer service options lacking, as they are limited to telephone support.
LightStream is the online-lending arm of Truist Bank, which was formed by a merger between BB&T and SunTrust Bank in 2019. Truist is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.

SoFi, a former Best Overall winner in Investopedia’s ranking, offers loans of up to $100,000, highly rated customer service, pre-qualification, and a bevy of SoFi membership benefits.
Pros & Cons
Pros
No late fees
Same-day funding available
Access to SoFi membership benefits
Cons
Optional origination fees
Can’t apply with a co-signer, but co-borrowers are accepted
High minimum loan amounts
Overview
You can find lenders offering lower rates and more flexible loan minimums. But only a few lenders we researched offer loan amounts up to $100,000, and only one, specialty lender BHG Financial, offers larger ones (up to $200,000). Plus, you’re unlikely to find a lender that offers more customer perks and benefits than SoFi. Those benefits include free financial advice and discounts on other banking and financial products it offers.
That focus on customer experience is working for SoFi. It ranked fourth in J.D. Power’s 2024 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study. Sofi also received an Investopedia Combined Consumer Review rating of 4.4 (out of 5 possible), a calculated aggregate of consumer review ratings on Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau developed by Investopedia’s researchers.
Like LightStream, SoFi has a high loan minimum of $5,000, so if you need a smaller loan, you must look elsewhere. In years past, the lender touted its lack of fees. That’s changed now, and SoFi offers borrowers the option to pay an origination fee of up to 7% in exchange for a lower interest rate overall. You still won’t face late fees and prepayment fees.
San Francisco-based SoFi was founded in 2011 as a fintech specializing in student loans. Today, it offers a full suite of banking and financial products, including checking and savings accounts, home loans, investment accounts, insurance, and more.

Fixed rates from 8.99% APR to 35.49% APR. APR reflects the 0.25% autopay discount and a 0.25% direct deposit discount. SoFi Platform personal loans are made either by SoFi Bank, N.A. or, Cross River Bank, a New Jersey State Chartered Commercial Bank, Member FDIC, Equal Housing Lender. SoFi may receive compensation if you take out a loan originated by Cross River Bank. These rate ranges are current as of 04/24/25 and are subject to change without notice. Not all rates and amounts available in all states. See SoFi Personal Loan eligibility details at https://www.sofi.com/eligibility-criteria/#eligibility-personal. Not all applicants qualify for the lowest rate. Lowest rates reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers. Your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed above and will depend on a variety of factors, including evaluation of your credit worthiness, income, and other factors. Loan amounts range from $5,000– $100,000. The APR is the cost of credit as a yearly rate and reflects both your interest rate and an origination fee of 9.99% of your loan amount for Cross River Bank originated loans which will be deducted from any loan proceeds you receive and for SoFi Bank originated loans have an origination fee of 0%-7%, will be deducted from any loan proceeds you receive. The SoFi 0.25% autopay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account. Autopay is not required to receive a loan from SoFi. To be eligible to receive an additional (0.25%) interest rate reduction on your Personal Loan (your “Loan”), you must set up Direct deposit with a SoFi Checking and Savings account offered by SoFi Bank, N.A., or enroll in SoFi Plus by paying the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee, all within 30 days of the funding of your Loan. Once eligible, you will receive this discount during periods in which you have enabled Direct Deposit to an eligible Direct Deposit Account in accordance with SoFi’s reasonable procedures and requirements to be determined at SoFi’s sole discretion, or during periods in which SoFi successfully receives payment of the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee. This discount will be lost during periods in which SoFi determines you have turned off Direct Deposit to your Checking and Savings account or in which you have not paid for the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee. You are not required to enroll in Direct Deposit or to pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee to receive a Loan.

Why We Chose It
Discover, with competitive APRs and no origination fee, is a good choice for personal loans for any reason. But because it will pay your creditors directly, it’s an especially good choice for debt consolidation.
Pros & Cons
Pros
No origination fee or late fee
Excellent customer satisfaction ratings
Creditor direct pay
Cons
No co-signers or co-borrowers
Lower maximum loan amount
Can’t be used for secured debt consolidation
Overview
We picked Discover as the best lender for debt consolidation because of its low advertised APRs, range of repayment terms, and the option to have Discover pay your creditors directly. This is convenient for you, but also offers a bit of risk reduction for the lender. Loan funding is fast, as soon as the next business day, if everything in your application is accurate.
Discover’s reputation for customer service was borne out during our research. Our reviewers rated the website and its broad collection of tools, calculators, and educational material a 4 (out of 5 possible). Meanwhile, Discover rated second in the J.D. Powers 2024 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.
One downside with Discover is that it does not accept co-signers or co-borrowers who can help borrowers with lower credit scores qualify for a loan. The maximum loan amount ($40,000) is not as high as many competing lenders, although the lower minimum ($2,500) makes it a good choice if you’re looking for a smaller loan.
Discover, founded in 1986, was a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Company, which was created to offer Sears shoppers credit card services. Today, from its headquarters in Illinois, it offers credit cards, home loans, CDs, and savings and checking accounts.

On Investopedia
Why We Chose It
Upgrade is our choice for emergencies and quick funding because of its fast funding time and relaxed lending criteria, which makes a loan from Upgrade available to a broad range of borrowers in a pinch. You’ll pay for the convenience with origination fees as high as 9.99% and APRs that reach nearly 36%.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Low minimum credit score requirement
$200 checking account bonus offer
Allows co-borrowers
May offer a secured loan option
Cons
Steep origination fee
Potentially high APR for some applicants
Overview
Upgrade accepts applicants with fair credit scores—as low as 580. You can apply with a co-borrower, too, if you need help getting approved or want to try for a better rate. Upgrade may also offer you a secured loan, using your car as collateral, instead of an unsecured loan.
You’ll pay for this flexibility, though. Upgrade charges origination fees between 1.85% and 9.99%, and its maximum APR is 35.99%. Borrowers with thin or weak credit profiles should expect to pay on the higher end of those ranges. Discounts for setting up autopay, using loan proceeds for debt consolidation, and opting for a secured loan are available, but the lender doesn’t reveal the details. A $200 bonus is also available for setting up and funding a checking account with Upgrade during your loan application. You can fund your new account with your loan funds.
Upgrade was founded in 2017 and is headquartered in San Francisco. Since its founding, it has provided more than $35 billion in loans and credit.

Why We Chose It
Upstart says its AI loan underwriting system results in lower-cost loans for more borrowers with less risk to the lender. In practice, that means it accepts borrowers with credit scores as low as 300. Moreover, students and college graduates with an income can qualify without a credit history.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Low minimum credit score
Fast funding
A wide range of loan amounts
Cons
Potentially high origination fee
High APRs for some borrowers
Fewer loan term options than competitors
Overview
If your credit score is below 580, you don’t have many options to borrow. Loan offers you do receive will be expensive, with high origination fees and APRs. Upstart’s minimum required credit score of 300 is the lowest of the 59 lenders in our database. It will even consider borrowers without a credit score. Despite this flexibility, its rates, fees, and terms are not prohibitively expensive.
Upstart works with various lenders with different underwriting requirements, so borrowers with weaker or stronger credit profiles will match with lenders offering rates and terms that fit. Loan amounts range from $1,000 to $50,000, covering a range of borrower needs.
Rates start at 6.60% and max out at 35.99%, the industry's de facto APR cap. (That rate cap is linked to the Military Lending Act, which limits APRs on consumer loans for military service members at 36%.)
Upstart has made available nearly $40 billion in credit of various types through its platform, including personal loans, since it was founded in 2012. The fintech lender is headquartered in San Mateo, Calif.

Why We Chose It
Not all major national banks offer unsecured personal loans (Bank of America, for example), but Citibank rated the highest in our scoring among those that do. The bank’s maximum advertised APR is low, and existing Citibank customers are eligible for same-day funding. Plus, you can get in-person help with your application at a local branch.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Low maximum APR
No fees of any kind
Repayment terms up to 5 years
High J.D. Power ranking
Cons
High starting APRs
Lower loan limits than other lenders
Must be an existing Citibank customer
Overview
Citibank doesn’t charge origination fees or late fees, and its maximum advertised APR is low, keeping borrowing costs down. The autopay discount of 0.50% is higher than many other lenders offer (0.25% is typical). Citigold and Citi Priority customers can get an additional 0.25% rate discount.
Another perk for existing customers is same-day funding, which is sent directly to their Citibank account.  In the 2024 J.D. Power Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study, Citibank ranked third.
With all that in its favor, it’s disappointing that Citibank now limits personal loan applications to existing customers.
Citibank, founded in 1812, is the third-largest U.S. bank, with total assets exceeding $1.7 trillion, as of September 2024. It operates 648 branches in the U.S. In a $70 billion deal, Citicorp and Travelers Group merged in 1998 to form Citigroup.

On Investopedia
Why We Chose It
A local credit union is your best bet for an affordable personal loan. This is especially true if you want a loan under $1,000. We chose Lake Michigan Credit Union as the Best for Small Loan Amounts because its minimum of $250 is the lowest in our database of 59 lenders, but plenty of credit unions have minimums of $300 or $500.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Small loan amounts
No origination fees
Credit life and disability insurance available
Option to skip a monthly payment for $25
Cons
No pre-qualification
Membership required
Overview
We chose LMCU as Best for Small Loans because of its $250 minimum. However, many credit unions offer loans under $1,000 and even under $500, so you have plenty of options.
You won’t pay an origination fee on a loan from LMCU. Because it is a federal credit union, you won’t pay more than 18% interest. If something unexpected happens, you can skip a monthly payment (for a $25 fee), up to twice a year. The minimum credit score of 650 means LMCU loans are available to people with “fair” credit. You can also apply with a co-borrower.
Unfortunately, LMCU does not offer pre-qualification; you must complete an application to see what rates and terms you are approved for. That means a slight negative hit to your credit score. And because it’s a credit union, you need to become a member to borrow. If you don’t meet LMCU’s affiliate or regional qualifications, you can join by donating $5 to the ALS Foundation.
LMCU was founded in 1933. Today, it has over $14 billion in assets and more than 600,000 members. It’s the largest financial institution headquartered in West Michigan.

With Navy Federal Credit Union, eligible service members and their families qualify for personal loans with no origination fees, low rates, and same-day funding. You can borrow up to $50,000, and if you’re borrowing for a home improvement, you will have up to 180 months (15 years) to repay it.
Pros & Cons
Pros
Same-day funding
Strong customer-service ratings
Wide range of loan amounts and terms
Allows co-borrowers
Cons
Membership restrictions
Doesn’t offer pre-qualification
No online application for some loan types
Overview
Navy Federal Credit Union’s personal loans have a lot to offer. Borrowers can choose from a wide range of loan amounts and terms and rates start at 8.99% and won’t exceed 18%. Plus, there are no origination fees. If you’re borrowing at least $30,000 for a home improvement, you can take up to 180 months to pay it off. Just be aware that late payments will result in a $29 late payment fee.
Navy Federal earned the second-highest score in the 2024 J.D. Power Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study and a Combined Consumer Review rating of 4.5 (out of 5). This rating, developed by Investopedia researchers, is an aggregate of consumer review ratings on two third-party review sites: Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau.
Unfortunately, only military service members, Department of Defense personnel, and their families can join. Another knock against Navy Federal is that it does not offer pre-qualification; you’ll need to complete a loan application to learn the rates and terms you qualify for. Moreover, you’ll need to join the credit union before you can begin an application.
Navy Federal, founded in 1933 and headquartered in Vienna, Virginia, is the nation’s largest credit union.

Pros & Cons
Pros

Patelco offers two rate discounts. The first is a customer loyalty discount of 0.10% for members with several accounts that meet deposit or loan minimums. The second, a 0.50% reduction, rewards borrowers who make on-time payments for 12 consecutive months. This one can be earned three times for a rate discount of up to 1.50%. Patelco also offers payment protection insurance and several hardship programs if borrowers need more time to make a payment.

How Does a Personal Loan Work?
A personal loan is a type of installment loan where borrowers receive a lump sum and then repay it in increments over a period of time. Personal loan amounts can range from a few hundred dollars to $100,000. The repayment terms may also vary: some can be paid off in a few months while others may be repaid over years.
Personal loans can be unsecured or secured, although most are unsecured. Secured loans require the borrower to provide collateral to back the loan, while unsecured loans don’t. Since unsecured loans don’t require collateral, lenders typically determine the terms of your loan by evaluating your creditworthiness—the higher your credit score, the more likely you are to receive favorable terms, including a lower APR.  Lenders may also examine your annual income, credit history, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.
Typically, the interest rate, or Annual Percentage Rate (APR), on personal loans is fixed, which means it doesn’t fluctuate.
Tip
If your credit score is low or your credit history is thin, you may not think you're eligible for a personal loan. However, some lenders specialize in loans for people with challenging credit. Learn more about them: Best Personal Loans for Bad Credit and Best Emergency Loans for Bad Credit.
Who Is a Personal Loan Loan Good For?
A personal loan is best for people who want flexibility in how they use their funds, prefer a lump-sum payment, and have a strong credit score.
Unlike other types of debt, like an auto loan or mortgage, a personal loan offers versatility: You can use the funds to pay off medical expenses, finance moving costs, purchase a big-ticket item, and more.
While personal loans typically offer lower APRs than credit cards, borrowers need a solid credit score when applying for a personal loan to qualify for the best rates. Therefore, they may be a budget-friendly lending option for those who have strong credit scores and histories.
Common Personal Loan Terms
Annual percentage rate (APR): This is the yearly interest rate, including fees like origination fees, and is represented as a percentage. The APR will be same as the interest rate unless the lender charges additional fees.
Origination fee: This is a one-time fee that a lender may charge for processing your loan application. Origination fees are represented as a percentage of the total loan amount, typically ranging from 1% to 8%. They are included in the APR. Since these are upfront fees are often deducted before you begin making payments, subtract the origination fee from the total loan amount to calculate the funds you’ll receive.
Credit Score: A credit score is a three-digit number that indicates a borrower’s creditworthiness. Credit scores are calculated by evaluating factors like someone’s payment history, length of credit history, and credit utilization. Lenders will look at a borrower’s credit score to approve someone for a loan and determine the terms of the loan. A higher credit score generally means that a borrower will receive better terms on a loan.
Pre-qualification: Some lenders offer borrowers the option of seeing if they qualify for a loan before applying. The lender will run a soft credit check, an inquiry into your credit report that doesn’t affect your credit score. They may require certain information like your name, address, and income. You will then be denied or given possible loan offers. However, pre-qualification does not guarantee approval. You'll still need to complete the whole process of applying for a personal loan to receive funding.
Pros & Cons of Personal Loans
Pros
Flexibility when using funds
Lower APRs than credit cards
Unsecured personal loans don’t require collateral
Fixed interest rates
Cons
Strong credit required for lower APRs
Origination fees and late fees
Lack of continued access to credit
Pros Explained
Flexibility when using funds: With personal loans, borrowers can generally use the funds as they see fit. That means you could use a personal loan to help finance a wedding, pay off moving expenses, and consolidate your debt. A debt consolidation personal loan lets you wrap multiple debt payments into one monthly payment. To make sure you’re actually saving money on interest, pay close attention to the interest rates and loan terms of the new loan.
Typically offer lower APRs than credit cards: Personal loans can charge much lower APRs than credit cards, though you'll need a strong credit score to be eligible for the best rates.
Unsecured personal loans don’t require collateral: Many personal loans are unsecured, so you won’t have to put up collateral, which can be seized if you default on the loan. However, if you default on an unsecured loan, your account can be sent to collections, which can still negatively impact your credit score.
Interest rates are fixed: Many personal loans offer fixed interest rates and fixed payments, so you don’t need to worry about how interest rate changes influence your monthly payments once you’ve taken out a loan.
Cons Explained
Need a good credit score to qualify for lower APRs: To get the best terms on a personal loan, you’ll probably want a FICO credit score that’s considered “good” or better—that means having a score of more than 670. If you have a lower credit score, you may still qualify but could receive worse terms.
May have origination fees and late fees: Before you sign up for a personal loan, pay careful attention to any fees the lender charges. Origination fees are upfront fees that are subtracted from your loan, late fees can be incurred if you fail to make on-time payments, and if you pay off your loan early, you may be on the hook for a prepayment penalty.
Lack of continued access to credit: While receiving a lump sum is useful to some, if you prefer having access to an open line of credit that allows you to borrow money as needed, you may consider opting for a credit card or something like a home equity line of credit (HELOC) over a personal loan.
Alternatives to Personal Loans
A personal loan—available from many online lenders, banks, and credit unions that offer personal loans—can help you cover an emergency expense, make a home improvement, or help you consolidate higher-cost debt, but it’s not your only choice.
Credit Cards
With credit cards, cardholders receive a revolving line of credit up to a fixed credit limit and then make monthly payments to pay down their debt. Like personal loans, credit cards allow you to use money flexibly but often charge higher APRs. And since credit cards have variable APRs, the interest rate (plus fees) may fluctuate with changes in the federal funds rate.
Some credit cards offer rewards for the money you spend. Depending on the card, you may receive cash-back, rewards points, or miles on your everyday spending. However, if you’re not diligent about paying off your balance on time and in full every month, the interest you pay on your credit card debt will exceed the value of the rewards you earn.
Warning
Credit cards may not be right for everyone. Interest rates are high, especially if your credit score is fair or poor. If you carry a balance from month to month, interest costs can get expensive.
In contrast, personal loans generally have fixed interest rates, so your monthly payment is fixed. And unlike credit cards, personal loans provide borrowers with a lump-sum—if you need additional money, you’d have to apply for another loan.
Generally, credit cards are a better choice if you’re looking to finance everyday expenses, while a personal loan is a better choice if you want a lump-sum payment for debt consolidation or paying off a major expense. Whether you opt for a credit card or a personal loan, they’re both types of debt. Failing to make your payments in full and on time will hurt your credit score.
Home Equity Loans
A home equity loan is a type of mortgage loan that allows you to borrow against the equity you have in your home. Like personal loans, home equity loans provide a lump sum of cash and have fixed interest rates and terms, meaning borrowers have fixed monthly payments.
While home equity loans generally offer lower APRs than credit cards and personal loans, they can be risky. Since your home equity is considered collateral with a home equity loan, you could be at risk of foreclosure if you can’t pay it off. Plus, if the value of your home declines, you may end up paying more than your home is worth.
One upside of a home equity loan is that your interest payments can be tax-deductible if you use the funds to “buy, build, or substantially improve the residence,” according to the IRS.
Frequently Asked Questions
Who Is the Best Lender for a Personal Loan?
According to our research, LightStream is the best personal loan lender, based on its combination of competitive rates, large loan amounts, and wide range of repayment terms.If you're looking to borrow from a traditional bank, our choice is Citibank. It offers a low maximum APR and same-day funding for Citibank account holders. If you live near a Citibank branch, you can get in-person assistance with your application.
What Credit Score Is Needed for a Personal Loan?
The average personal loan borrower had a credit score of 685 during the final quarter of 2022, according to the Federal Reserve.However, this can vary quite a bit; some lenders, such as Upstart, have no minimum credit score requirement. Others require a credit score over 700. Banks and credit unions tend to have higher credit score requirements. Fintech lenders generally accept lower credit scores.
How Much Would a $5,000 Personal Loan Cost per Month?
The monthly cost of a personal loan, of whatever amount, will depend on the loan amount, the loan term (or the number of monthly payments), and the interest rate. The easiest way to calculate a monthly payment is to use a personal loan calculator. A $5,000 loan, with no origination fees and repaid over 24 months (or two years), with an interest rate of 12.33% (the current average rate charged on two-year personal loans, according to the Federal Reserve) would result in a monthly payment of $236.14. Total interest cost would be $667.33.
Should You Get a Personal Loan From a Bank or a Credit Union?
Based on our analysis of rates, terms, customer experience, and other factors, we encourage borrowers to check with a credit union while gathering loan offers. Credit unions generally offer better rates to a broader range of credit profiles than traditional banks or fintechs. However, credit unions may not be as convenient as banks or fintechs, due to credit union membership requirements. And few credit unions offer the streamlined application and approval processes that fintechs, and many banks, now offer.

How We Chose the Best Personal Loans
Investopedia collected more than 2,600 data points from 59 lenders, including traditional banks, credit unions, fintechs, and finance companies to evaluate and rank the best personal loan providers. We identified and collected 45 criteria, including APRs, loan amounts and terms, fees, customer experience, and more. Our criteria and ratings are also informed by speaking to hundreds of borrowers about their personal experiences with personal loan lenders and their views on the process. Research and data collection began on July 23 and concluded on October 18, 2024.
We organized the 45 criteria into four categories. We then scored and weighted 26 criteria to develop our overall star rating for each lender (1,500 data points in all), using the remaining criteria for background and editorial richness. The categories and their weights for this project are:
Loan Costs (APRs, origination and late fees, autopay discount): 30%Borrowing Requirements (Secured loans, membership requirement, minimum credit score, and four other factors): 24%Lender Features (Online experience, educational resources, pre-qualification, and seven other features): 24%Loan Terms (Loan terms and amounts, funding time, approval process): 22%
To maintain the integrity of the data following collection and analysis, Investopedia’s compliance team monitors changes to key details, like interest rates and fees. Compliance team members then update our pages to ensure they are accurate as of the date on the byline.
