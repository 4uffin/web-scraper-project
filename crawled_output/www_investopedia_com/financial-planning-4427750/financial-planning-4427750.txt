Frequently Asked Questions
How are RSUs taxed?
RSUs are taxed as ordinary income at prevailing federal and state income tax rates. RSUs are subject to tax upon delivery, which is usually when they become vested. You should expect the value of your RSU’s vesting in a given year to count toward your taxable income for that year.

Can non-citizens collect Social Security benefits?
Yes, non-U.S. citizens are eligible for social security. Non-citizens must be in the country legally and have a Social Security number. As with citizens, retirement benefits are only available for workers with a minimum of 40 work credits, which take at least 10 years to accrue. Non-citizens with fewer than 40 credits may be able to count work outside the U.S. toward Social Security credits if their home country and the U.S. have a totalization agreement.

The market value of the gifted stock (up to 30% of adjusted gross income if held for more than one year) is deductible, and no capital gains tax is paid on the appreciated stock.
