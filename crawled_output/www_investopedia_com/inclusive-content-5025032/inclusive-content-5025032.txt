Improving the Inclusiveness of Investopedia Content
Financial education needs to serve readers of all backgrounds. We aspire for our content, staff, contributors, and partner organizations to further the financial empowerment of those from all ethnicities, genders, generations, sexual orientations, abilities, and socioeconomic backgrounds, particularly those who may be disadvantaged.
Content. We continually seek to remove bias from our content in the service of being as objective and helpful as possible for all readers.
Since 2020, we’ve reviewed every educational article in Investopedia’s library. That review resulted in edits made to articles that were deemed to have biased language or information. Just as importantly, the review helped identify opportunities for making our content more inclusive to all audiences. We also created content to offer deeper examinations of subjects like housing discrimination.
Community. There are many organizations help serve the needs of disadvantaged groups. We currently partner with five such organizations and use Investopedia’s reach and expertise to help them execute their mission.
https://www.wallstreetbound.org/ - Investopedia is a proud partner of Wall Street Bound, which teaches the technical “hard” skills of finance and the “soft” skills of corporate culture to empower under-represented young adults to achieve beyond their present horizons.
https://www.nefe.org/ - NEFE champions effective financial education. They are the independent, centralizing voice providing leadership, research and collaboration to advance financial well-being. Investopedia is hosting NEFE's Spring Personal Finance symposium.
https://www.schools.nyc.gov/ - Investopedia supports NYC Public Schools by providing free financial literacy curriculum to K-5 students, teacher training, and school visits to host classes on saving and investing.
https://www.jumpstart.org/ - Investopedia is a national partner of Jump$tart, an organization that supports the financial education and literacy efforts of its partners and affiliates, and brings together the financial literacy community to foster cooperation and collaboration.
https://www.stemeducationalinstitute.com/index.html Investopedia is a proud partner and supporter of the STEM Educational Institute, providing financial literacy lessons and in-person sessions for this non profit organization dedicated to teaching career-building skills in technology and finance to high school students in New York City.
