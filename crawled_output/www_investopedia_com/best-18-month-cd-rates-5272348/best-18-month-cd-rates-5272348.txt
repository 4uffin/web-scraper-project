The best 18-month CD rate is 4.25% APY from multiple institutions. CD rates are near historic highs, with the top 18-month CD rates ranging from 4.05% to 4.25% APY. To find you the best CD rates nationwide, we review CD rates from hundreds of banks and credit unions every weekday morning. We've been tracking 18-month CD rates since 2019, and the top CD rates in our rankings typically pay three to five times as much as the national average—or even more. All CDs and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Sept. 25, 2025.
In the News
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at its Sept. 17 meeting. This is the first rate cut since December 2024 and lowers the federal funds rate to a range of 4.00%–4.25%. Committee members are projecting two more quarter-point reductions before the end of the year. CD rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which means CD rates are expected to decline as the Fed lowers rates.
Below are the top CD and annuity rates available from our partners, followed by the best CD rates that we've found from our research that are available to U.S. customers everywhere:

CD terms of 15 to 20 months are eligible for our 18-month rankings. Where more than one institution pays the same top rate, our rankings prioritize CDs by the shortest term, then the CD requiring the smallest minimum deposit. If there is still a tie, we rank alphabetically by institution name.
Tip
The annual percentage yield (APY) is the interest rate earned on an investment in one year, including compounding interest. A higher APY is better as your return will be higher.
Detailed information on these top-paying nationally available 18-month CDs is provided below, including specifics about minimum deposits and early withdrawal penalties. For credit union CDs, information is also provided on how to easily join the credit unions offering them.
Why You Can Trust Our Expert Recommendations for the Best 18-Month CD Rates
Investopedia collects thousands of CD rates from hundreds of banks and credit unions every weekday. When ranking CD rates, we look at factors like term, early withdrawal penalty, and minimum opening deposit. We also research banks and credit unions to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decisions for their needs.
Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best CD rates since 2019. Back when we first started tracking 18-month CD rates, the top interest rate on an 18-month CD was 2.70% APY. By October 2023, the top 18-month CD rate was 6.00%—over two times what it was four years earlier. While CD rates have fallen since then, they remain high in 2024.
The CDs we recommend must be available nationwide and these certificates typically pay three to five times as much as the national average—or even more. To be eligible for our rankings, each CD's minimum opening deposit requirement cannot exceed $25,000 and must be offered by an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union (which covers up to $250,000 per depositor).

What Is an 18-Month CD and How Does It Work?
Certificates of deposit (CDs) are fixed-interest accounts where you can deposit your money and then withdraw it later. You can get a CD from a bank or credit union. An 18-month CD requires you to keep the funds untouched for about a year and a half. For our rankings, we consider 18-month CDs to be anything with a term of 15 to 20 months.
In exchange for giving up access to your funds, you'll generally be rewarded with a higher interest rate than the bank pays on savings and money market accounts.
When opening a CD, deposit a lump sum of funds into the account at or above the minimum required deposit for that CD. The funds will sit in the account for about 18 months, earning interest along the way. When the CD hits its maturity date, you can withdraw the funds plus their earned interest from the account with no penalty.
Fast Fact
When asked in March where they would be most likely to put an extra $10,000, 10% of Investopedia readers said they would choose CDs, above high-yield savings accounts and paying down debt, but trailing individual stocks, ETFs, and money market funds.
Pros and Cons of 18-Month CDs
Pros
Offers a guaranteed rate for 18 months: No matter what happens with the Federal Reserve and interest rates, the bank cannot change the APY you secure when you sign your CD agreement and make your deposit.May pay a higher APY than other terms: Shopping around is critical, as rates can vary widely across institutions and also across different CD lengths.Pays reliable and predictable earnings: Because your CD rate is fixed and your term is known, you can calculate exactly how much your earnings will amount to once the CD matures.Is safe and virtually risk-free: CDs opened at an FDIC bank or NCUA credit union are federally insured, protecting up to $250,000 of your deposits in the unlikely event that the institution fails.Can deter the temptation to spend since funds are tied up: Withdrawing your funds before the CD matures will trigger an early withdrawal penalty, which may be enough to stop you from pulling the funds out for unplanned spending.
Cons
Incurs a penalty if you withdraw early: Every bank and credit union specifies their policy on how they'll calculate your penalty if you don't keep your CD funds deposited until maturity. Typically, the penalty is a number of months' interest that you'll forfeit.Allows only one deposit amount: With most CDs, you get one chance to decide how much you want to invest in the certificate. Additional deposits are generally not allowed.If rates fall, you may wish you'd opted for a longer term: Investing in a longer CD would have allowed you to retain a good rate for a longer period of timeIf rates rise, you'll be locked at a lower rate until maturity: If you lock into an 18-month CD and then rates rise, you'll be stuck with your current rate until you can withdraw your funds.
Important
Though consumers tend to think about CD terms in nice round numbers, be sure to consider odd-term CDs, such as 15-month, 18-month, or 21-month certificates. It's not uncommon for promotional rate CDs to have unusual durations, so don't limit yourself to only the conventional terms.
Factors to Consider When Choosing a CD
When choosing a CD, consider the following factors:
Your goals: Both short-term financial goals and long-term financial goals are important.How much money you can deposit: CDs have minimums, so if you only have $500 to deposit, you'll need to find a CD with that minimum balance requirement.How long you can leave that money in the CD without touching it: This will help you determine the right term—whether that's a 1-year CD or a 3-year CD.Interest rates offered for your term and minimum deposit: The higher the rate, the more you will earn on your deposit during the CD term.CD type: Is it a bump-up CD or a regular CD? This will ensure you're choosing one that meets your needs and goals.
Once you choose a CD, open the account, and deposit your money to start earning interest.
Financial Advisor Insight
"The key to choosing the right CD is matching the term length to your needs," said Ryan Greiser, CFP, a member of Investopedia’s Financial Advisor Council. "If you won’t need access to the money for a year or more, consider locking in a higher rate with a longer-term CD."
18-Month CD Penalties and Fees
Almost all CDs—not just 18-month CDs—come with an early withdrawal penalty. That means that if you decide to take your money out of the CD before the date the CD matures, you have to pay a fee. The fee is typically in the form of interest you earned, such as three or six months' worth of interest.
For example, let's say you deposited $1,000 in an 18-month CD with a 5.00% APY. The total interest you would earn by keeping it in the CD for 18 months is $75.93. If the CD comes with an early withdrawal penalty worth six months of interest, then you would have to pay $25.31 if you decided to take your money out early.
Other than the early withdrawal penalty, CDs don't typically come with any other fees (though the banking institution may require some).
Hilarey Gould, Senior Editorial Director for Financial Products and Services at Investopedia
When choosing an 18-month CD, be sure to review the early withdrawal penalty. If you think you might need to withdraw your money before the CD matures, look for a CD with a lower penalty so that you end up with the most money possible when you withdraw. If you are positive that you won't touch the money in the CD until maturity, you may feel comfortable opening a CD with a more expensive penalty.
How to Find the Best 18-Month CD Rates
This list includes the best 18-month CD rates, meaning that they are the highest 18-month CD rates nationwide. To find you the top 18-month CD rates, we look at hundreds of banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions every day and gather the CDs with the highest rates that are available nationwide, including CDs with terms of 15 to 20 months.
When looking for an 18-month CD, consider the amount of money you want to deposit, the interest rate on the CD, and the early withdrawal penalty. For example, if a 20-month CD offers a 5.00% interest rate on a $25,000 deposit, but a 12-month withdrawal penalty, you may want to compare it with a 15-month CD with the same deposit but a six-month withdrawal penalty.
This comparison is important to think about because if you need that money back sooner than maturity, you need to know what amount of interest you'll lose by withdrawing early. With that in mind, you'll need to first compare your options based on your deposit amount, then look at the rate and early withdrawal penalty.
Note
CD rates are the same for everyone who applies to open a CD. Your credit score and other financial history and experience are not determining factors like they are with credit cards or loans. So even if you have bad credit, you can earn a high interest rate on your savings by locking it up in a CD for a period of time.
How to Open an 18-Month CD
After you find the right CD for you, you'll need to apply to open the account. This may be easy if you're already a member of the bank or credit union. If you're not, you may need to open another savings account first, or apply to be a member of the credit union by joining another free or low-cost organization (the American Consumer Council is a popular one).
To open an 18-month CD, follow these steps:
Find the CD you want to open, whether online or in-person at the bank or credit union.
Have a current membership or relationship with the bank or credit union via an open account like a savings or a checking account, and/or through a non-profit organization (typically only applies to credit unions).
Fill out the application with your name, deposit amount, and other personal info.
Wait for approval.
Fund the CD and let your money earn interest. You may be able to send a check, wire the money, or electronically transfer it, depending on the institution.
Read the CD's terms. This fine print info will tell you the interest rate you'll be paid, the date of the CD's maturity, how often your interest will be paid and compounded, and the early withdrawal penalty (if any) that you need to pay if you request to withdraw your money before maturity.
Once your 18-month CD is opened, it's a set-it-and-forget-it process to earn your interest.
There are just two times when you may need to take action on your 18-month CD:
When you need your money back before maturity: You'll likely pay an early withdrawal penalty and will need to withdraw the funds before transferring them into another account. Then the CD will be closed.When your CD matures: You may need to indicate if you want the CD to roll over into another CD at the institution or if you want the money withdrawn and deposited back into your other account.

Alternatives to 18-Month CDs
18-Month CDs vs. Other CD Terms
Instead of an 18-month CD, you could choose a shorter certificate to limit the amount of time your funds are tied up, but you may have to settle for a slightly lower rate. The same is true if you go with a longer-term CD: rates could be lower than what you can earn in 18 months. It all depends on the current rate environment, so it's important that you shop around.
For example, if rates are higher now than you think they will be in the future, locking in one of today's rates for as long as possible can be a smart move. This allows you to retain your APY for longer than if you chose a shorter-term CD.
CDs vs. Savings and Money Market Accounts
Opening a top-paying high-yield savings account or a money market account is an alternative option to a CD. These accounts let you earn a competitive return on your funds with more flexibility. The downside is that savings and money market accounts pay a variable rate, which means that if interest rates go down in the future, so will the rate you're earning in these accounts.
The same applies to cash reserve and money market funds at brokerage firms. Many of these pay much lower rates than you can earn with a high-yield savings account at a top-paying bank. But even when the APY on a brokerage cash account is competitive, it too is a variable rate that you can't lock in like you can with a CD.
CDs vs. US Savings Bonds & Treasuries
You could alternatively put your funds in U.S. savings bonds or Treasuries. The U.S. government offers two types of savings bonds: EE bonds and I bonds. EE bonds offer a fixed interest rate that you'll know at the time of making your deposit decision, while I bonds offer a rate that changes every six months based on current inflation levels (hence, the name I bonds). These investments are exceptionally safe, but they do not allow a withdrawal within the first 12 months for any reason.
You can also lend money to the U.S. government by purchasing Treasury bonds. These are called T-bills for durations of four weeks to one year, and Treasury notes for durations of two to 10 years. Treasuries are considered one of the safest investments in the world, but their rates are not always as high as the best CDs or high-yield savings accounts.

Where Are CD Rates Headed in 2025?
CD rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which the Federal Reserve lowered for the first time since 2020 at its September 2024 meeting, then again in both November and December. The rate had held steady at a range of 5.25%–5.50% since July 2023, but it now stands at 4.25%–4.50% and CD rates can be expected to follow suit.
With rates possibly headed lower yet this year, now is the time to lock in a higher CD rate while it is still possible. In August, the inflation rate was 2.9%, an increase from from July's 2.7% rate.
Frequently Asked Questions
What Are the Best CD Rates for 18 Months?
The best CD rates for an 18-month term will have an APY of 4.15% or better. The best 18-month CD will come with a high rate, low early withdrawal penalty, and low minimum deposit required. Most of the top 18-month CDs have an early withdrawal penalty of three to six months and a minimum deposit of $500 or more.
Is an 18-Month CD a Good Investment?
Right now, an 18-month CD is a good investment because you can earn a high rate on an 18-month CD. Once you open that CD, you are guaranteed that rate until the CD matures (as long as you do not withdraw the money early). Considering the Fed is watching inflation and interest rates closely, there's a chance it could cut the fed funds rate in the next 18 months. That would mean that CD rates would also fall in the future. So locking in an 18-month CD now can help you get the highest rate possible before any rates fall.
Do 18-Month CDs Beat Inflation?
An 18-month CD can help you hedge against high inflation because the rate you can earn may be more than the inflation rate. For example, in August 2025, the inflation rate was 2.9%. At that same time, top 18-month CD rates paid 4.40%. You can earn more on your savings with an 18-month CD to help combat the additional costs you'll incur, thanks to inflation.
When Is an 18-Month CD a Good Choice?
An 18-month CD is a suitable option for money you won't need in the coming year or longer. For those with a specific plan for the money, such as a down payment on a house or paying college tuition bills for a child, an 18-month CD might provide just the time frame you need to keep funds safe and reliably earning interest.Another appeal of 18-month CDs is to provide one rung of a shortened CD ladder. A CD ladder is a strategy for investing your funds in five CDs of differing terms rather than all at once. For a yearly ladder, you would own a 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, and 5-year CD. But you can also create a shorter ladder, with six-month increments between the CDs (e.g., 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, etc.).
Are Online Bank CDs Safe?
Many of the highest deposit rates, whether for CDs, savings accounts, or money market accounts, are offered by online banks. Some of these are online-only banks, meaning they operate solely on the Internet, while others are brick-and-mortar banks with a separate online banking arm. Sometimes the online operations of physical banks even have an entirely different name and brand identity.Though you may feel nervous depositing your funds into an Internet bank instead of at a physical branch, online accounts and institutions are just as safe as their more traditional counterparts. That's because FDIC insurance doesn't discriminate—the $250,000 in deposit insurance it provides consumers in case of bank failure applies equally to online and brick-and-mortar banks.
Why Do Shorter CDs Sometimes Pay More Than Longer CDs?
Shorter CDs sometimes pay more than longer CDs because the institution wants you to open an account with them. These shorter CDs may be promotional CDs with high rates but low terms. The lower the term, the less you'll earn on your money, even if it's a higher interest rate.Another factor is that banks and credit unions decide their CD yields based on where they think the federal funds rate will be in the future. So when it's expected that future interest rates will be lower than today's rates, it's common to see short- or mid-term CDs paying the best rates.
How Do You Build a CD Ladder?
A CD ladder enables you to access the higher rates typically offered on 5-year CDs, but with the twist that a portion of your money becomes available every year, rather than every five years. Here's how to do it.Take the amount of money you want to invest in CDs and divide it by five.Put one-fifth of the funds into a top-earning 1-year CD, another fifth into a top 2-year CD, another into a 3-year CD, and so forth through a 5-year CD. Let’s say you have $25,000 available. That would give you five CDs of varying lengths, each with a value of $5,000.When the first CD matures in a year, you take the resulting funds and open a top-rate 5-year CD.One year later, your initial 2-year CD will mature, and you'll invest those funds into another 5-year CD.Continue doing this every year with whichever CD is maturing until you end up with a portfolio of five CDs all earning 5-year APYs, but with one of them maturing every 12 months, keeping your money a bit more accessible than if all of it were locked up for a full five years.
Can You Lose Money in a CD?
You can't lose your principal when you deposit it in a CD. But you can lose out on interest in the CD if you withdraw it early. Most CDs come with an early withdrawal penalty (but not all CDs have penalties) so if you take your money out of the account before the term is up, you may pay a price. CDs are federally insured though, so if you're worried about losing money in a CD due to a bank failure, you can rest assured that your money is backed by the FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000 per institution.

How We Find the Best 18-Month CD Rates
Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide, and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000, and any specified maximum deposit cannot be under $5,000.
Banks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. For more about how we choose the best rates, read our full methodology.
