KEY TAKEAWAYS
The U.S. has launched national security investigations into imports of robotics, industrial machinery and medical devices, including personal protective equipment like masks, putting imports of these products at risk for the next stage of tariffs.The inquiries started on Sept. 2, and they appear to be part of the president's move to boost domestic manufacturing in key industries by making imports more expensive.
The U.S. has launched national security investigations into imports of robotics, industrial machinery and medical devices, including personal protective equipment like masks, putting imports of these products at risk for the next stage of tariffs.
According to Federal Register filings, the Department of Commerce said that the investigation, under “Section 232” of the Trade Expansion Act, will look into whether importing these products infringes on national security. The inquiries started on Sept. 2, and they appear to be part of the president's move to boost domestic manufacturing in key industries by making imports more expensive.
Why This News is Significant
Tariffs imposed on imports raise costs for U.S. consumers unless the companies bringing the products in absorb the levies. Tariffs on medical devices would also affect hospitals' costs, while those on robotics would hurt the American auto industry and big companies deploying robots in production.
The filings said the Commerce Department is “particularly interested in comments and information” on how much current U.S. production of these products can meet domestic demand, the extent of foreign supply chains in these goods, and how much foreign nations can "weaponize" their control over the supply of these products.
The investigation into medical gear, aimed at redirecting production of these imports in the U.S., appears to target China. During the pandemic, the country halted exports of PPE, such as the virus-filtering N95 mask and nitrile gloves, putting hospital workers at risk.

3 Ways Robots Affect the Economy
The probe into robotics, meanwhile, would especially affect the auto industry, according to CNBC. According to the International Federation of Robotics, the majority of industrial robots are made in four countries: Japan, China, Germany and South Korea. Meanwhile, robots are increasingly a big part of production in the U.S., with major tech firms like Amazon (AMZN) close to using as many robots in its warehouses as it does humans.
The U.S. has already used the “Section 232” law to impose tariffs on the imports into the country of automobiles and parts, copper, steel and aluminum. That’s apart from the “Liberation Day” reciprocal tariffs that went into effect in August.
