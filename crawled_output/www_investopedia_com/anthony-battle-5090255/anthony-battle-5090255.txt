Quote from Anthony Battle
Obtaining a wealthy mindset requires learning from the past and applying it in the present. Dwight D. Eisenhower once said, "Accomplishments will prove to be a journey, not a destination." In finance, these accomplishments can only be sustained by those that take on "good risk" and learn to be comfortable in uncomfortable situations.
