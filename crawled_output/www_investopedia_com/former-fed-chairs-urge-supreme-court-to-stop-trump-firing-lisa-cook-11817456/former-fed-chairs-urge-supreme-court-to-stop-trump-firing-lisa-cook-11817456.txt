Key Takeaways
A slew of prominent Federal reserve experts urged the Supreme Court to block President Donald Trump from firing a Fed board member.The brief supported keeping Fed governor Lisa Cook on the job while courts decide whether Trump can legally fire her.The outcome of the case could determine whether Trump can take over the Fed and get it to dramatically lower interest rates.
A who's-who list of former Federal Reserve and White House officials urged the Supreme Court to preserve the central bank's independence and prevent President Donald Trump from firing Fed governor Lisa Cook, at least for now.Every living former Fed chair — Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Alan Greenspan—signed the brief filed with the high court Thursday, as did former Treasury secretaries, White House economic advisors from both parties, and prominent academic economists. If Trump is successful, it would be the first time in history a president has fired a Fed governor.
The Importance of Fed Independence
The brief laid out the case, supported by many mainstream economists, for blocking Trump's attempts to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook from her spot on the seven-member board that controls the central bank. The Fed was set up to be independent from direct control of the White House to give it more leeway to make monetary policy decisions based on economic rather than political considerations.
"The Federal Reserve’s independence and the public’s perception of that independence are important for economic performance, including achieving the goals Congress has set for the Federal Reserve of stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates," they wrote. "Allowing the removal of Governor Lisa D. Cook while the challenge to her removal is pending would threaten that independence."
How This Affects Your Finances
If the Supreme Court allows Lisa Cook to be removed, officials say, that could pave the way for Trump or future presidents to effectively use the Federal Reserve to print money, buying temporary popularity at the price of stoking inflation and undermining the economy in the long run. This could squeeze the finances of virtually every American.
Trump moved to fire Cook in August, citing unproven allegations that she had committed mortgage fraud prior to being appointed to a 14-year term by former president Joe Biden.  Cook then sued to stop the firing, arguing Trump did not have the authority to remove her. A lower court judge sided with her, allowing her to remain on the job while the case proceeded. The case is now in the hands of the highest court.
The outcome of the case will effectively decide whether Trump will be able to take over the Fed. Trump has repeatedly demanded that the Fed lower interest rates dramatically. The idea has garnered no support on the Fed's 12-member policy committee other than from Stephen Miran, a White House economic advisor who Trump installed on the board this month.
The Potential Threat to the Economy
The brief summarized arguments of mainstream economists who contend that allowing the president to control interest rates would undermine the economy and risk stoking high inflation. The Fed typically raises its key fed funds rate, which influences borrowing costs on all kinds of short-term loans, if it needs to push down inflation. It cuts the rate when inflation is low and wants to boost the job market.
Political leaders will always face the temptation to cut interest rates and boost the economy in the short term, while raising the risks of higher inflation down the road, the brief argued.
"Insulating the Fed from short-term political pressures is important to preventing such abuse, including attempts to artificially overstimulate the economy or to have the Federal Reserve effectively print money to cover the government’s budget deficit," they wrote.
The brief called for the court to allow Cook to stay on the job while courts determine whether Trump is justified in firing Cook. The law that originally established the Fed stipulates that the president can only remove governors "for cause." The Cook case hinges on whether Trump has cause to remove her.

"Allowing the government to remove a member of the Board of Governors for the first time in the Nation’s history, while under the cloud of legal challenge, will erode public confidence in the Fed’s independence and threaten the long-term stability of our economy," the former Fed officials wrote.The brief cited decades of research showing that countries with less independent central banks typically have higher inflation and less stable economies.
