Key Takeaways
Webtoon Entertainment and Walt Disney signed a non-binding agreement to create a new platform for Disney comics.As part of the deal, Disney will take a 2% equity stake in Webtoon.The news sent shares of Webtoon Entertainment skyrocketing in premarket trading.
Shares of Webtoon Entertainment (WBTN) soared 30% in premarket trading as the digital comic platform said that Walt Disney (DIS) would be taking a stake in the firm as they collaborate in creating a new outlet for Disney’s comic franchises.
Webtoon said the companies have agreed on a “non-binding term sheet for the development of an all-new digital comics platform that will feature current comic book runs and include decades of past comics from across Disney’s portfolio including Marvel, 'Star Wars,' 20th Century Studios and more.” The comics “will be available in a single digital comics service with one convenient subscription, adding more stories than ever before in one location,” Webtoon said.
As part of the deal, Disney will acquire a 2% equity interest in Webtoon. Both the Disney investment and collaboration agreement are still to be finalized.
Webtoon Founder and CEO Junkoo Kim called the partnership “a powerful next step for our growing global business, and a strong foundation for even greater collaboration with Disney in the years ahead.”
Webtoon Entertainment shares spent most of 2025 in negative territory before spiking last month after announcing another collaboration with Disney. Shares of Walt Disney are also higher year-to-date.
