Key Takeaways

Two of the biggest names in the real estate brokerage industry are joining forces.
Christie’s International parent Compass (COMP) is acquiring Anywhere Real Estate (HOUS), which owns Century 21, Coldwell Banker, and others, in an all-stock transaction that would create a firm valued at some $10 billion. The news sent Anywhere shares jumping nearly 60% in morning trading, while shares of Compass dropped.
Compass said the deal would have Anywhere investors receive 1.436 Compass shares for every one they owned. Compass priced that at $13.01 each, which is an 84% premium to Anywhere’s closing price Friday. Compass shareholders would control a 78% stake in the new company, with Anywhere investors having the other 22%.
Compass Founder and CEO Robert Reffkin, who will be CEO of the combined firm, said that by combining “two of the best companies in our industry, while preserving the unique independence of Anywhere's leading brands, we now have the resources to build a place where real estate professionals can thrive for decades to come."
The transaction is expected to close in the second half of next year.
Prior to today’s session, shares of Anywhere Real Estate more than doubled so far in 2025, and Compass shares were 61% higher for the year.
