In a year when his administration has attacked the Chinese regime, cracked down on immigrants, ended visas for scores of foreign students, and criticized American universities, Trump's change of tact on Chinese students has raised eyebrows.

Key Takeaways
President Donald Trump recently said that more international students are needed to prevent U.S. colleges from “going to hell very quickly.”
Public universities rely on higher tuition from foreign students to offset shrinking state funding, and local economies benefit from their spending.
Chinese students make up nearly a quarter of all international students, many in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields that the U.S. needs to stay competitive in technology and other fields.
President Donald Trump stunned many by announcing recently that he wants the U.S. to allow 600,000 Chinese students into American universities, a figure that more than doubles the current enrollment. It’s a sudden reversal from earlier this year and from his previous administration. Visa restrictions and tighter vetting made studying in America more difficult for students from China, with administration officials often suggesting they were spies for a communist regime.
Trump argues that U.S. colleges—especially public institutions with shrinking state funding—simply can’t survive without the tuition dollars foreign students bring in. “I hear so many stories about we’re not going to allow their students—we’re going to allow their students to come in,” he said. “We’re going to allow, it’s very important, 600,000 students.”
How Many Chinese Students Are in the US?
During the 2023-2024 academic year, 277,398 Chinese students were enrolled in U.S. universities, according to the Institute of International Education (IIE) and the U.S. Department of State. That’s down sharply from the 2019 peak of 372,532.
According to the IIE, only students from India, who make up 29% of the international student population, comprised a larger share than those from China.

Saving Universities, Jobs, and Towns
Trump justified his welcoming of Chinese students, which seemingly marked a departure from his “America First” policy, as a way to save U.S. colleges, saying they’d “go to hell very quickly” without them. This sentiment was shared with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who told Fox News that the move is an economic one that prevents the bottom 15% of universities and colleges from going out of business.
With state funding dwindling, public universities in the U.S. are increasingly turning to international students, who pay higher tuition, to sustain their finances. A Financial Times analysis reveals that a 10% decline in international enrollment would result in a $3 billion revenue loss for U.S. colleges and universities. The University of Illinois reportedly even took out a $60 million insurance policy to protect against a 20% or greater decline in revenue from Chinese students.
Universities aren’t the only ones banking on Chinese students, who often come from wealthier families and can boost local economies by spending on rent, food, and other goods.
According to NAFSA, an association of international educators, during the 2023-2024 school year, the 1.1 million international students in the U.S. contributed $43.8 billion to the economy while supporting 378,175 jobs. That means each spent $39,818 on average on universities and in their local economies. Chinese students made up a quarter (24.5%) of the international student population that year, which, if their spending is like that of other international students, means they added $10.73 billion to the U.S. economy.
44.3%
About half of Chinese students (44.3%) in the U.S. are pursuing graduate degrees.
Human Capital
Beyond dollars and cents, Chinese students play a significant role in America’s talent pipeline. Many pursue degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) — areas where the U.S. faces both skills shortages and global competition. Allowing more of these students to study in the U.S. could help fill critical gaps in the workforce and keep industries such as technology, medicine, and engineering moving forward.
Many in Trump's party have argued that most of these students will return home after graduating. Yet research shows a significant share stay in the U.S. if visa pathways are available, contributing to discoveries, startups, and tax revenues. In fact, many of the world’s leading researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs began their careers as international students. Making it easier for them to stay could turn today’s tuition payments into tomorrow’s breakthroughs.
The Bottom Line
Trump’s push for 600,000 Chinese students may seem surprising, but it’s ultimately driven by economic considerations and competitiveness. International students help fund U.S. universities, boost local economies, and help fill U.S. labor shortages in critical fields that drive innovation and economic growth.
