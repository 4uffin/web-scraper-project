The best high-yield savings account rate is 5.00% APY, available from Varo Bank and AdelFi. That's more than 12 times the FDIC's national average for savings accounts of 0.40% APY. A high-yield savings account is great because it pays more interest, while still giving you the flexibility to withdraw your money when needed. Every business day, we publish a ranking based on the highest savings account APYs available that day from nationally available institutions. All savings accounts and rates in our rankings were collected, verified, and available to open as of Sept. 19, 2025.
Below, you'll find our partners' savings and cash management accounts—from banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that use partner banks—followed by our top 15 ranking of the best savings account rates available nationwide.

Important
Note that some banks call their savings accounts "money market" accounts. Money market accounts traditionally offer the ability to write checks, while savings accounts do not. None of the accounts listed here offer check-writing privileges, even if the name might suggest otherwise. It's smart to also check our ranking of the best money market accounts, some of which pay comparable interest rates.

In the News
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at its Sept. 17 meeting. This is the first rate cut since December 2024 and lowers the federal funds rate to a range of 4.00%–4.25%. Committee members are projecting two more quarter-point reductions before the end of the year. Savings rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which means savings rates are expected to decline as the Fed lowers rates.
Why You Can Trust Us
Investopedia collects savings account rates from over 100 banks and credit unions every weekday. When ranking high-yield savings account rates, we look at factors that will help readers choose the best savings account, like minimum opening deposit. We also research banks and credit unions to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decisions for their needs. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best high-yield savings account rates since 2019.
What Is a High-Yield Savings Account?
As the name implies, high-yield savings accounts pay much higher interest rates than traditional ones. Often offered online, whether by an internet-only bank or the online division of a brick-and-mortar bank, they're a type of savings account that's based on the idea of holding your savings wherever it can earn a competitively high yield, even if that's a different bank than where you hold your checking account.
The difference in savings account interest rates can be dramatic, with the top accounts in the country typically offering 10 to 12 times the national average rate. And you can still keep your checking account where it is, because it's simple to link a high-yield savings account to your primary account for easy transfers.
Reasons to Open a High-Yield Savings Account
Stashing some of your cash in a savings account is smart whether you're saving for something specific, or just want to sock money away for when you'll need it in the future. Here are some common reasons to open a savings account:
Build an emergency fund: By putting your emergency money in a high-yield account, you'll be able to boost your balance with monthly interest earnings, while also leaving your funds fully accessible should a financial emergency arise.Reach a specific goal: This may include buying a house or a car, sending your son or daughter to college, or going on a special vacation.Grow your savings: Earning interest on your money means your savings balance will grow faster than if you were making monthly contributions and not earning anything.
Expert Take
I first opened a high-yield savings account with American Express in 2019, and have urged friends and family to open high-yield savings accounts, too. While Amex doesn't offer the top rate nationwide, it has a great mobile app, which is how I do most of my banking. I can see my high-yield savings account right next to my credit cards, and can easily deposit money from my checking to my savings via the app. ~Hilarey Gould, Editorial Director at Investopedia
How Much Will a High-Yield Savings Account Pay on $1,000, $5,000, or Higher Balances?
The amount of money you can earn in a high-yield savings account will be based on how much you deposit and what your interest rate is. Based on initial deposits of different amounts from $1,000 to $100,000, we calculate below what your balance would be at the end of one year if you put the funds in a top-paying high-yield savings account, paying 5.00%, vs. a savings account paying the national average of 0.40% APY.
Warning
Note that while you can earn a great deal more than the national average rate, your bank may also pay a lot less. For instance, Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo all pay close to zero interest on their traditional savings accounts, at just 0.01% APY.

Of course, you can boost your balance even more by regularly adding deposits to your savings account. One smart way to do this is to set up an automated transfer from your checking account once a month.
How to Choose the Best High-Yield Savings Account
Once you've decided to open up a new high-yield savings account, you'll want to do your homework to make sure you're choosing the best one for your needs. Searching for a top annual percentage yield (APY) is a good starting point when choosing a high-yield savings account, as you'll want to earn a competitive rate.
Though the interest rate can change, it makes sense to choose an account that is paying one of the highest rates in the country, since the higher your rate, the more interest you'll collect every month and every year. Also, through the power of compounding, you can make interest off your interest, and the higher the APY on your account, the better.
But beyond the interest rate, you'll also want to make sure the account either doesn't have a minimum balance requirement, or has one that you feel confident you can regularly maintain. Also, note if there is a minimum balance required to earn the top APY.
Why Different Banks Pay Different Rates
Each bank is a business that has different needs for customer deposits, operating in its own regional market. As a result, some banks have to work harder to attract funds, such as smaller banks with names you may not be familiar with.Also important is the lending activity the bank is undertaking. If, for instance, a bank is in a strategic push to build its commercial lending portfolio, it will need to attract more customer deposits in order to fund those loans it hopes to make. One way they can do this is offering a promotional APY for a short period to boost their deposits balance, but then lowering it after they've accumulated enough funds.
Common Savings Account Terms to Understand
When researching high-yield savings accounts to find the best one for you, be sure you understand what these commonly used terms mean.
Minimum opening deposit or initial deposit: Some bank accounts—whether a savings, checking, or money market account—stipulate a minimum deposit you need to make to open the account. It could be quite low, like $25, or could be as much as $25,000 for some high-balance accounts. And some accounts have no requirement, letting you open the account with no money deposited. Note that if an account has a initial deposit requirement but then no minimum ongoing balance, you do not need to keep that money at the bank after your initial deposit.
Minimum balance requirement or ongoing balance: Unlike a minimum initial deposit, a minimum balance requirement refers to the least amount of money you can keep in the account on an ongoing basis. For instance, a bank may require your balance to stay at or above $100 or $1,000 for its account—or any other amount the bank prefers. Falling below the minimum requirement could mean being hit with a fee, or could instead mean you won't earn the high-yield interest rate on the account. So be sure the account you choose either has no minimum ongoing balance or one that you feel confident you can always stay above.
Monthly maintenance fee: Banks and credit unions charge various types of fees. Unlike ones triggered by a transaction, such as an insufficient funds fee or a wire transfer fee, the monthly service fee is a standard fee you could be charged every statement cycle. Many accounts do not have a monthly maintenance fee, while some others provide ways for you to avoid the fee each month. Be sure you understand the fee rules for any account you're considering.
Mobile check deposit: The ability to deposit checks using the camera on your smartphone or tablet—rather than having to take the check to a branch—is called mobile check deposit or remote check deposit. Most institutions' mobile apps offer this as an easy way to get money deposited into your account.
External or ACH transfer: The electronic process of moving funds between two financial institutions is called an external or ACH transfer. Virtually every high-yield savings account allows you to send or receive external transfers so that you can easily move money in and out of your savings account.
How to Open a High-Yield Savings Account
After comparing the best high-yield savings account and landing on a choice, the next step is to open the account online. Here's how that generally works:
The bank or credit union will ask you to provide various personal information, including your social security number, since your interest earnings will be reportable to the IRS.The bank's account opening process will also involve security measures designed to ensure you are who you say you are.You'll also be presented with one or more options on how to fund your account. The most common method is by ACH transfer from another bank, and you'll be provided with instructions on how to set this up.Alternatively, some institutions allow you to make your initial deposit with a debit card, a credit card, or even a paper check sent through the mail.
Once the application process is completed, you may be able to set up online banking right away, or you may need to wait a day or two for your account to be fully opened.
Tip
Transfers between different institutions will take one to three days to complete, so be sure to keep enough of a cash cushion either in your checking account or in a linked savings account at that same institution. That way you won’t run into trouble if you can’t get funds from your high-yield account for a couple of days.
Pros and Cons of High-Yield Savings Accounts
Pros
Higher APY than traditional savings accounts
Ability to withdraw or deposit funds at any time
Extremely safe, with virtually no risk
Excellent vehicle for an emergency fund or saving for a big goal
In times of rising rates, your APY may go up
Cons
Earning a top yield may require opening an account with a new institution
Some accounts have withdrawal limits of six per month
Easy access can make it tempting to dip into savings
Account could have a fee or minimum balance requirement
In times of decreasing rates, your APY may go down
Who Is a High-Yield Savings Account Best For?
Anyone with surplus savings in the bank can benefit from a high-yield savings account. If you have more money in the bank than you need to hold in your checking account, high-yield savings accounts offer a way to sock some of those funds away to earn an especially high annual percentage yield (APY). High-yield savings accounts are also well suited to those comfortable with internet or mobile banking, as moving money in and out of an online savings account must generally be done on your computer or via a mobile banking app on your phone.
When choosing the best savings account for you, you'll want to check the rules of the account, such as whether it limits the number of withdrawals you can make in a month, and if you'll be assessed a monthly maintenance fee. Lastly, check that the bank is an FDIC member (or an NCUA member if it's a credit union) so that your money is insured by the federal government—up to $250,000 per depositor—should the bank or credit union fail. Online reviews of a bank's customer service may also prove useful.
Alternatives to High-Yield Savings Accounts
High-yield savings accounts are just one vehicle for stashing your cash, and they often pay the highest APYs. But there are several alternatives for holding your funds until you need them.
High-Yield Savings Account vs. Checking Account
While the easiest place to keep surplus funds is in your checking account, this has two major downsides. First, money kept in your everyday checking account is very easy to spend, making it difficult to leave earmarked as savings. Second, checking accounts tend not to pay any interest—or if they do, the rate is a pittance. A high-yield savings account offers an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on your money.
Some high-yield or rewards checking accounts do exist, with rates that are more competitive. But these accounts require jumping through some hoops—sometimes every month—in order to earn their high rate. Still, if you're a heavy debit card user, one of the best rewards checking accounts may be a good option for you.
High-Yield Savings Account vs. Traditional Savings Account
There is no formal definition of how high a rate needs to be to qualify as "high yield". In short, it's up to each institution how to name their savings accounts. Traditional banks and credit unions more often offer traditional savings accounts, while online banks are more likely to offer a high-yield savings account. But again, the distinctions are fuzzy, rather than hard-and-fast rules.
Why You Don't See Big Name Banks on Our List
We track the savings account rates of over 100 banks and credit unions every weekday. While we do check the rates at big banks—including the five largest banks of Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi, and U.S. Bank—their rates aren't usually high enough to make our ranking. Meanwhile, other institutions may not qualify for our ranking because they aren't available to customers in at least 40 states, or they significantly limit the balance on which you can earn their high-yield APY.
High-Yield Savings Account vs. Money Market Account
A money market account operates very much like a savings account, with the exception that it allows writing checks. In the past, money market accounts typically imposed high minimum deposit requirements in exchange for higher rates than savings accounts. This has shifted in recent years, however, with savings and money market accounts both having a variety of required minimum balances—including no-minimums accounts. In addition, high-yield savings accounts often pay more competitive rates than money markets, though sometimes you can find a higher APY among the top-paying money market accounts.
Financial Advisor Insight
"When a client has money they won't need in the next 12 to 24 months, I encourage them to take advantage of a high-yield savings account or money market account to hedge against inflation as well remove the funds from their actively used checking accounts. Basically, a 'hands off account,'" said Sibyl Slade, a member of Investopedia’s Financial Advisor Council.
High-Yield Savings Account vs. Certificate of Deposit (CD)
If some of your savings can be socked away and not touched for a period of time, you may be able to earn a higher rate with a certificate of deposit. CDs require you to commit your funds to remain on deposit for a number of months or years, imposing a penalty if you request to withdraw the funds before the CD’s maturity date. But in exchange, your interest rate is locked and guaranteed, even if the Fed lowers rates. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs can lead you to the highest available APYs no matter the CD term you choose.
Frequently Asked Questions
What does "HYSA" mean?
HYSA is simply an acronym for "high-yield savings account". In contrast to traditional savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts aim to attract customers and their deposits by offering a much more competitive interest rate.
Are High-Yield Savings Accounts Safe?
Some people wonder if you can lose money in a high-yield savings account. In a worst-case scenario, a savings account will pay no interest, meaning your funds don't grow at all. But you would never lose the money you put into the account, other than due to fees you've been assessed. So it's important to choose an account where you can easily avoid paying any fees.As for losing money due to a bank failure, the vast majority of banks—whether physical or online—are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which protects banking customers by insuring up to $250,000 of their deposits per institution if the bank fails. The U.S. government similarly backs credit union customers for up to $250,000 by providing insurance through the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).That means whether your institution is a traditional brick-and-mortar bank with branches or is an online bank or credit union, and whether it’s big or small, your deposits up to $250,000 are equally safe and protected.
Who Has the Highest-Paying High-Yield Savings Account?
The top-paying institutions for savings accounts vary, with no one bank perpetually leading the rate rankings. In general, the top rate contenders tend to be online operations, whether owned by a physical bank or set up as a fully online-only institution. You can always find today's highest rates—currently near 5.00%—and the institutions that offer them by regularly checking our ranking in this article. Or for a list that is exclusive to banks (no credit unions), you can check our daily ranking of the best banks for savings accounts.
Which Banks Are Paying 7% Interest on High-Yield Savings Accounts?
While it would be nice to earn 7% on money held in savings, no banks or credit unions are paying that much on a regular savings account. The only account paying a 7% APY right now is a savings account for kids, but only on balances up to $1,000. Savings account rates surged in 2023 and 2024, thanks the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hike campaign. But at its highest point, the top savings account rate available to anyone in the country reached 5.55% APY in April 2024.
Do You Pay Taxes on a High-Yield Savings Account?
Yes, you must pay taxes on the earnings of a savings account. The interest you earn from a bank account—whether paid on a savings, checking, money market, or CD account—will need to be reported on your annual tax return. You'll be able to see on your monthly statement or online register how much you were paid each month, and at the end of the calendar year, it will be taxed along with all of your other income from employment and other sources.The bank where you hold your high-yield savings account will not tax you directly, but in January of each year, they will send you and the IRS a Form 1099-INT indicating how much interest you were paid in the previous calendar year. You must then report this interest income on your tax return.
Do High-Yield Savings Account Rates Change?
Yes, savings account rates can change. The APY on most savings accounts is variable, meaning it will most likely change sometime in the future. It can change at any time without warning.Whether the rate goes up or down, and how often it changes, is largely influenced by the Federal Reserve. When the Fed adjusts the federal funds rate, banks and credit unions often follow suit in the same direction.That said, rate changes among savings accounts are not typically a daily or weekly event. Barring recent moves by the Fed, rates often remain at the same level for weeks or months at a time.
Can You Ever Lose Money With a High-Yield Savings Account?
The risk of losing money in a high-yield savings account is very low. Banks and credit unions are typically insured by the FDIC or NCUA. Interest rates on high-yield savings accounts are variable, but they are guaranteed based on the balance in the account (the bank won't take that money back after paying it to you). So if you're worried that a high-yield savings account comes with the same risk as investing in the stock market, think again. These accounts are much safer and there's virtually no risk of losing money in the account (unless you spend it of course).
Can You Have Multiple High-Yield Accounts?
Yes, you can have as many high-yield accounts as you'd like. In addition to a savings account, you may want a high-yield checking account, a high-yield money-market account, and/or a high-yield CD.

How We Find the Best High-Yield Savings Account Rates
Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of about 100 banks and credit unions that offer high-yield savings accounts to customers nationwide. We determine daily rankings of the top-paying savings accounts first and foremost by the annual percentage yield (APY) offered. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000.
Banks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. If the savings account is accessible only through a mobile app, we require that the app be available on both the iOS and Android platforms.
