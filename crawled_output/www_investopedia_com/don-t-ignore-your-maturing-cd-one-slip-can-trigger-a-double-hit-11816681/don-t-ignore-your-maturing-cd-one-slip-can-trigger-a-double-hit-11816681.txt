Key Takeaways
When your CD nears maturity, you must choose what to do with the balance—or risk automatic renewal at a bad rate, plus enter a new commitment you didn’t plan for.
The Fed already cut rates last week, and more reductions may follow, so exploring your options before renewal is more important than ever.
If you want another CD, compare offers—today's best CD rates are likely far higher than what your bank will automatically roll you into.
Prefer flexibility? Moving part or all of your balance into a top high-yield savings account can give you access to cash and steady growth.
The full article continues below these offers from our partners.
The Costly CD Oversight That Can Hurt You Twice
Whenever a certificate of deposit (CD) nears maturity, you face a deadline: give instructions or your bank will decide for you. If you take no action, the balance usually rolls into a new CD—and that can hurt in two ways.
First, the renewal rate is often far below today’s best CD yields. Banks typically default to a single, uncompetitive option—sometimes so low it borders on abysmal compared with what you could earn elsewhere.
Second, the rollover can lock up your money for longer than you planned. A 1-year CD could turn into committing for two, a 2-year CD turns into four years, and so on. And if you need to cash out before that second maturity date arrives, you'll face an early withdrawal penalty.
But there's good news. By planning ahead, you can avoid both pitfalls—and choose the option that works best for your savings goals.

4 Steps To Take Before Your CD Renews
Avoiding a bad rollover isn’t complicated—but you do need to act before maturity. These four steps can help you sidestep low rates, keep flexibility, and put your money where it will work harder.
Step 1. Decide Whether To Lock In Again or Keep Your Money Flexible
If you may need access to your money soon, a top high-yield savings account could be the smarter choice. The best accounts right now pay 4%–5%, offering a strong return with full access to your funds when you need them.
But today’s savings yields won’t stay this high forever. The Federal Reserve already cut rates last week and could cut again this fall—as well as next year—which means today’s top rates could drift significantly lower in the future.
In a declining rate environment, a CD can really shine. For money you don’t need to access soon, locking in one of today’s best CD rates guarantees the yield until maturity—no matter how many more Fed cuts come.
The Fed Could Make More Cuts
The Fed’s latest forecast, released last week, points to the possibility of another half-point in rate cuts this fall, and potentially further reductions in 2026. These moves aren’t guaranteed, but the outlook suggests interest rates will trend lower this year and next.
Step 2. Compare Your Renewal Offer With Today’s Best Rates
When your bank or credit union alerts you that a CD is about to mature, they’ll usually present a single renewal offer—with its set term and rate. But those rollover deals are almost always lousy compared with the top options available elsewhere.
To see how the renewal offer measures up, check our ranking of the best nationwide CDs. You’ll find the highest CD rates across multiple terms, so you can choose the option that truly fits your savings timeline.
Step 3. Give Instructions Before You're Renewed With a Bad Rate
A few weeks before maturity, your bank or credit union will send instructions on how to direct your CD funds. Ignore the deadline, and your balance will roll into a new certificate you probably don’t want.
But don’t worry if you can’t decide. You can always instruct the bank to simply move your CD balance into a savings account—either at the same institution or one you’ve linked. This keeps your money flexible and ready to redeploy, even if you choose to put it in another CD.
Missed the Deadline? Act Fast
Most banks and credit unions give you a short grace period after renewal. If your funds have already rolled into a new CD, you may still be able to reverse it—if you get in touch quickly. Grace periods typically last 5 to 10 days, though the exact window varies by institution.
Step 4. Plan Your Next Move To Keep Your Savings Growing
If you’ve decided on another CD, act quickly. With yields already slipping and more Fed cuts projected, moving sooner boosts your chances of locking in a stronger APY.
Have extra funds and don’t mind doubling up briefly? One savvy strategy is opening a new CD before your current one matures. That could allow you to capture a better rate than may be available after your original CD matures.
Another smart approach is to split your savings into two buckets: one in a top high-yield savings account for easy access, and one in a CD for higher guaranteed returns. That way, you’ll have flexibility if something comes up, without breaking your CD early.
Smart Tip from Seasoned CD Savers
Anytime you open a new CD, set a calendar reminder 6–8 weeks before maturity. That gives you time to shop rates, compare options, and avoid an unwanted auto-renewal.

Important
Note that the "top rates" quoted here are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is much different than the national average, which includes all banks offering a CD with that term, including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, the national averages are always quite low, while the top rates you can unearth by shopping around are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher.
How We Find the Best Savings and CD Rates
Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify a maximum deposit amount that's below $5,000.
Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. For more about how we choose the best rates, read our full methodology.
