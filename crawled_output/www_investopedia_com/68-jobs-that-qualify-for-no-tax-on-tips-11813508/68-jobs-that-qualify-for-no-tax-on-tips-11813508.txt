KEY TAKEAWAYS
The IRS has outlined 68 jobs that will be eligible for the new "no tax on tips" deduction.The new deduction, established by the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' will allow tipped workers to deduct the tips they earn from their federal taxes next year, reducing their taxable income.About 2.6% of all tax-paying households and individuals will be eligible for the tip deduction.
The IRS has listed nearly 70 types of workers eligible to deduct the tips they earn when they file their taxes next year.
The 'One Big Beautiful Bill' established a new tax break, allowing taxpayers to deduct the tips they earn from their federal taxes until the end of 2028. This new "no tax on tips" rule essentially means that eligible taxpayers can subtract up to $25,000 in "qualified tips" from their total taxable income, lowering their total federal tax burden. However, tips will still be subject to state and local taxes and payroll taxes that go toward Social Security, Medicare, and FICA.
"Qualified Tips," as defined by the IRS, are cash tips received by a worker who customarily and regularly received tips before Dec. 31, 2024. The tips must also be given voluntarily and determined by the payor. The IRS clarified that some automatic service charges, like the automatic gratuity added to checks for large parties, are not a qualified tip.
According to a preliminary estimate from the Tax Policy Center, only about 2.6% of all tax-paying households and individuals can take advantage of the new tip deduction. Tipped workers cannot use the deduction if they do not provide a Social Security number when filing, or if they are married but file separately. The deduction also begins to phase out for single taxpayers who make $150,000 a year and for married taxpayers filing jointly who make $300,000 together.
The IRS's list of qualifying jobs is a proposal and will be open to public comments until Oct. 23, 2025.
