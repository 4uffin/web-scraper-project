In a command economy, a centralized government controls the means of production and it decides the output levels for that production. This type of economy is often associated with communist nations. The advantages of this approach include better equality and lower unemployment, but there is often a lack of efficiency or innovation in those economies.

What does inflation do to an economy?
Inflation means the rate at which the same goods and services come to cost more. If a person's income doesn't keep up with inflation, it can decrease your purchasing power. It can also lower the value of Treasury bonds. But if some level of inflation is expected, it can drive consumer spending, which drives economic growth.

Economy
An economy encompasses all activity related to the production, consumption, trade, and distribution of available goods and services. The management of those resources is used to satisfy the needs of the people, businesses, organizations, and governments in a specific area.
Learn More
Money
Currency, or money, is a generally accepted, recognized, and centralized medium of exchange that market participants use to engage in transactions for goods and services in an economy. Each government has its own money system that is monitored by a central authority.
Learn More
Trade
The buying, selling, or bartering of goods and services is known as trade. In an economy, a trade takes place between a producer and a consumer, usually in exchange for money. An exchange of goods and services between two countries is international trade.
Learn More
Knowledge Economy

Learn More
Wealth
Wealthy is an abundant supply of valuable economic assets or resources owned by a person, company, community, or nation. It can be determined by subtracting debt from the total market value of all physical and intangible assets.
Learn More
Law of Supply and Demand
The law of supply and demand is an economic theory based on two separate "laws" that explain the interaction between the sellers of a resource and the buyers of that resource. The theory defines the relationship between the price of a given good or product and the willingness of people to either buy or sell it. Generally, as the price increases, people are willing to supply more and demand less and vice versa when the price falls.
Learn More
Inflation
A decline of the purchasing power of a specific currency over time is known as inflation. You can see the rate of decline reflected in the increase of an average price level of a basket of selected goods and services in an economy over a specified period of time. The rise in the general level of prices, often expressed as a percentage, means that a unit of currency effectively buys less than it did in prior periods.
Learn More
Organized Labor
An association of workers united as a single entity, known as organized labor or a union, seek to improve the economic status and working conditions of employees through collective bargaining with management.
Learn More
Sluggish Economy
The colloquial phrase "sluggish economy" is not an exact and quantifiable thing. It is derived from an analogy to a slug and refers to an economy in which growth is slow in macroeconomic terms. It can be used to describe an entire economy or a segment of it.
Learn More
