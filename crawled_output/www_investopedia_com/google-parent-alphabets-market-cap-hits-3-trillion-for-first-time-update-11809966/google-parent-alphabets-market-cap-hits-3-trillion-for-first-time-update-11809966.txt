Google parent Alphabet’s market value reached a major milestone today.
Its shares rose more than 4% on Monday, closing at a record high near $252. The move pushed Alphabet’s (GOOGL) market capitalization above $3 trillion, making it the fourth company to do so.
The only others to have reached that level are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and AI darling Nvidia (NVDA), the latter which earlier this year became the first company to top $4 trillion. (It remains the only member of that club.)
Alphabet’s stock has gotten a boost this month after a federal judge ruled Google doesn't have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy an antitrust case, a major legal win for the search giant that eased worries it might be forced to sell a key part of its business.
In a note to clients Monday, Citi analysts became the latest to boost their price targets for the stock to a Street high of $280 from $225, citing an “improving legal landscape” in the wake of the decision, as well as growing adoption of Google’s artificial intelligence tools across its ad and cloud businesses.
With Monday's gains, Alphabet's stock has added roughly a third of its value this year, making it the best-performing member of the Magnificent Seven for 2025 so far.
