Pros & Cons
Pros
Lowest fees among the best debt settlement companies
Nationwide availability (except for four states)
Highest-rated company that works with credit card debt
Cons
Doesn’t offer live web chat
Residents of Connecticut, Oregon, Vermont, and West Virginia are not eligible
Savings account fees are not provided
Why We Chose It
We picked National Debt Relief (NDR) as the best overall debt settlement company because it beat the competition in just about every respect. NDR will attempt to help you settle your outstanding debt for less than you owe; if it’s successful, it charges 15% to 25% of the settled debt. NDR works with many common types of debt, including credit card balances, lines of credit, personal loans, collection accounts, and even business debts.
You’ll need to be at least $10,000 in debt to work with National Debt Relief, which is a bit more than most companies we researched. NDR is accredited by two well-known names in the industry: the American Association of Debt Resolution (AADR) and the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators (IAPDA).
National Debt Relief has good customer reviews for the most part, too. It scored 4.7 out of 5 on Trustpilot, with over 42,000 reviews, and 4.7 on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) with over 5,000 reviews. But the company isn’t transparent about the fees involved with the savings account that you’ll need to open as part of the process, and those fees can add up quite a bit over the months it takes to resolve a debt settlement program. (You’ll usually have to pay those fees with any debt settlement company.)
National Debt Relief was founded in 2009 and has headquarters in New York City. Read more in our full National Debt Relief review.
Fees and Costs
By law, debt relief companies can’t charge upfront fees. So, you’ll start with a free consultation to see if the program is a good fit. If you decide to move forward, you’ll get a savings account to hold your settlement funds, which will likely have a setup and monthly fee.
Other than that, you’ll only be charged a fee if National Debt Relief is able to reach a settlement for any given debt and you agree to the terms. NDR will charge 15% to 25% of the settled debt—it’s a hefty fee, although the lower end is almost as low as any of the debt settlement companies we researched.

Pros & Cons
Pros
$7,500 minimum debt requirement
Discloses fees on website
Works with a variety of debts
Great customer ratings and reputation
Cons
Unavailable in a handful of states and D.C.
Savings account is somewhat expensive (but fees are disclosed)
Consumer protection law violations on record
Why We Chose It
Freedom Debt Relief (FDR) has been in operation for over 20 years (founded in 2002), and in that time it claims to have helped over one million customers find relief from a total of $18 billion in debt. Despite its consumer protection law violations (settled in 2019), the company enjoys high customer satisfaction ratings.
Debt relief companies have different minimum debt requirements—some require as much as $10,000 before they'll work with you. But FDR only requires $7,500, making it one of the more accessible companies included in our research.
FDR’s Trustpilot rating is an “Excellent” 4.6, with over 45,000 reviews, and the BBB has it at 4.45. On Google Reviews it’s a similar picture, with 4.6 stars. Overall, the company is almost as highly rated as our top pick for customer satisfaction.
Freedom Debt Relief covers a wide variety of debts, from the common (credit card bills) to the less common (payday loans). Its service may be expensive because it charges based on your initial amount of debt, but FDR offers a program guarantee that limits the fees you’ll pay.
Freedom Debt Relief is based in San Mateo, California. Read our full Freedom Debt Relief review.
Warning
Freedom Debt Relief’s program guarantee states that if your settlement cost is more than the amount of debt you enroll in the program, they’ll “refund you the difference from [their] collected fees, up to 100%.” Be aware that debt settlement usually causes your outstanding balances to swell because you’re instructed to stop making payments, and so you accrue late fees and interest charges. That means you may end up having more debt to deal with than expected.
Fees and Costs
Freedom Debt Relief’s program starts with a free consultation to go over your debt situation. If you decide to work with FDR, you’ll open up a savings account with a separate bank. FDR is one of very few debt relief companies to mention how much this account costs—in this case, there’s a $9.95 setup fee and an ongoing $9.95 monthly charge. This is unfortunate, given that many savings accounts are available for free, but this is par for the course if you hire a debt settlement company.
If Freedom Debt Settlement is able to negotiate a debt settlement with your creditors, you’ll pay 15% to 25% of your initial enrolled debt.

Pros & Cons
Pros
Best overall customer satisfaction score among best companies
Low fees
Claims to reduce debts by an average of 57%
Cons
Minimum debt requirement of $10,000 is high
Fees are charged based on initial debt, rather than settled debt
Not available in Maine, Oregon, and Iowa
Why We Chose It
New Era Debt Solutions has a higher debt minimum than many other debt relief companies, but it also has over 25 years of experience helping people settle their unsecured debts for less. And its fees are about as good as it gets (the high end of 23% is the lowest among all companies we researched).
New Era has great customer reviews, too. Trustpilot gives it 4.9 stars with over 400 reviews, and its BBB profile boasts 4.94 stars (but with about 50 reviews). Customers on Google Reviews rated it 4.9 stars, with over 220 reviews. The company has no complaints with the CFPB.
New Era Debt Solutions is based in California and was founded in 1998. Read our full New Era Debt Solutions review.
Fees and Costs
As usual, your experience with New Era starts with a free consultation. Then, if you think debt settlement and New Era are the right way for you to become debt-free, you’ll get a savings account that may come with an initial and monthly fee. You’ll make monthly payments into that account to fund your settlement offers.
If any of your debts are successfully settled, New Era will charge 14% to 23% of the initial amount of the debt.

Cons

Why We Chose It
Accredited Debt Relief (a division of Beyond Finance) is our number one choice for customer service for a few reasons: It provides a variety of ways to get in touch with customer support, with great daily availability, and it has top-notch reviews from past customers.
Customer service is available by phone, email, and live web chat (web chat through its partner, Beyond Finance). Accredited Debt Relief has better availability than many other companies—you can get in touch with them from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. EST on weekdays, and 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. EST on weekends. Beyond Finance offers a mobile app (a rare feature), available for iPhone and Android, although it’s not clear if customers of Accredited Debt Relief can use it.
Accredited Debt Relief earned one of the highest overall customer satisfaction ratings among all of the debt settlement companies we researched. It has 4.8 stars on Trustpilot and 4.89 on the BBB, with thousands of reviews. It also holds a variety of accreditations: AADR, IAPDA, and Consumer Debt Relief Initiative (CDRI).
Unlike many other companies, Accredited Debt Relief usually charges 25% for any debts it can successfully settle, rather than a range of fees. This can give you some peace of mind because you can more easily calculate your total costs, but it also means you might end up paying more than you otherwise would.
Accredited Debt Relief was founded in 2011 and is based in Houston, Texas. Read our full Accredited Debt Relief review.
Important
Be aware that Accredited Debt Relief (and some other debt settlement companies) often use confusing language on their websites. They may talk about “debt consolidation”—in some cases they can connect you with actual debt consolidation loans from their partners, but at other times they’re simply referring to debt settlement. These are very different, and it’s important to be clear about what you’re signing up for.
Fees and Costs
Accredited Debt Relief’s service begins with a free consultation. If you decide to pursue debt settlement to get out of debt faster, the company will negotiate with your creditors to attempt to settle your debts for less than you owe. You’ll likely be charged fees for the associated savings account, in which you’ll make deposits to build up your settlement fund.
If Accredited Debt Relief is able to negotiate a settlement and you agree to the terms, you’ll be charged 25% of the settled debt.
You may also be offered debt consolidation loans through Accredited Debt Relief’s partners, but we don’t usually recommend getting a loan this way. Instead, check with a variety of debt consolidation loan lenders to find the lowest rates you can get before making a decision.

Pros & Cons
Pros
Low fees, based on income
Counseling services for taxes, housing, student loans, and more
Several customer support channels make it easy to get help
Cons
Weekend customer support is not available
Some counseling courses may not have much or any human interaction
Certain counseling services have higher fees
Why We Chose It
Apprisen earned the top spot among credit counseling agencies, with great scores across the board. It has low fees, offers a wide variety of services, and has excellent (but limited) customer ratings.
Apprisen offers debt management plans, not debt settlement. Apprisen can negotiate with your creditors to figure out a payment plan and may be able to help get your interest rates reduced. But debt management plans require you to pay off the debt you owe—there is no debt forgiveness involved, but that also means you won’t have a settlement on your credit reports bringing your credit score down. You’ll make one monthly payment to Apprisen to cover all the creditors involved in your debt management plan until your debts are paid off.
Credit counseling services charge fees based on income, and they usually have a maximum amount they’ll charge. Apprisen may waive the enrollment and monthly fees entirely, depending on your financial situation, or it may charge up to $45 for each for DMPs. That’s a bit less expensive than the average among credit counseling services we researched.
Apprisen also offers comprehensive counseling services to help with all kinds of debt problems, from housing to bankruptcy.
Apprisen was founded in 1955 and is headquartered in Gahanna, Ohio. Learn more in our full Apprisen credit counseling review.
Fees and Costs
Apprisen starts with a free financial review session. You’ll speak with a counselor about your debt, and together you’ll figure out which service would be most effective (and how much it’ll cost). As mentioned, Apprisen’s fees are reduced or waived entirely for those who qualify.
Debt management plans: $0 to $45 to enroll; $0 to $45 per month.Credit health plan: $65 for individuals or $85 for couples; includes a deep dive into your credit and development of a plan to improve it over time.Financial coaching: A one-time fee of $300 for financial goal setting, action plan, on-demand access to a counselor, and other financial tools.Financial health plan: $95 for a personalized financial plan covering your budget, debts, credit, savings, and goals.Bankruptcy counseling: $25 for an online pre-bankruptcy counseling course; $50 for an in-person post-bankruptcy workshop. Pre-purchase mortgage counseling: Up to $90 for advice on getting ready to take out a mortgage, as required by some lenders.
In addition to the paid counseling options above, Apprisen offers free counseling for the following situations and needs:

Pros
No minimum debt requirement

Long-established business (since 1958)
Cons
Debt management plan fees can be somewhat high
Does not offer debt settlement
Why We Chose It
Any amount of debt could be too much, but many debt relief companies have minimum debt requirements—you might need $7,500 or as much as $10,000 in debt before they’ll work with you. But Money Management International (MMI) has no minimum debt requirement to enroll in a debt management program, so you don’t have to wait until the problem is that big before seeking help.
MMI offers debt management plans (DMPs) —these are payment plans that can help you pay what you owe without major damage to your credit. Fees for debt management plans are on a sliding scale, based on income; enrollment fees can be as low as $0 or as high as $75, and monthly fees range from $0 to $59. MMI also provides help with housing issues, bankruptcy, disaster recovery, and more.
Money Management International offers superb customer service availability, with phone support open 24/7. Past customers agree that MMI provides a high-quality service, giving it 4.7 stars on Trustpilot and 4.89 on the BBB. Many reviewers praise the company’s friendly, helpful credit counselors and efficient service.
Money Management International was founded in 1958 (the oldest among debt relief companies we researched) and is based in Stafford, Texas. Learn more in our full review of Money Management International.
Fees and Costs
Money Management International’s program begins with a free initial consultation, which you can sign up for online or by calling the company. You’ll discuss your financial situation with a debt counselor and explore some options. MMI’s paid services are available on a sliding fee scale and include:
Debt management plans: One-time enrollment fee of $0 to $75; monthly fee of $0 to $59 after that. Debt management plans are usually intended to pay off your debt within five years.
Bankruptcy counseling: Up to $50 for pre-filing and pre-discharge courses.
Reverse mortgage counseling: $199 for a course in how reverse mortgages work, required if you're taking out an HECM loan.
First-time homebuyer counseling: Up to $149 for a course on buying your first home, required by some lenders.
Credit report reviews: Up to $59 for an in-depth credit report review and recommendations about how to improve your credit.
Money Management International also offers free support in these areas:
Student loan counseling
Disaster recovery counseling
Foreclosure and eviction counseling

Pros
One of the only companies to help with tax debt
Live web chat on website
Accreditations from the AADR and IAPDA
Cons
Fees based on amount of initial debt, rather than settled
Available in 41 states
Old-fashioned website
Why We Chose It
CuraDebt is our top-rated company with resources to help with tax debt; in fact, it’s the only company to make our best list that works with tax debt. The company’s website looks like a relic of the past, but it offers comprehensive debt settlement services that cover most debt problems people are likely to have.
CuraDebt’s fees are relatively low, so you shouldn’t expect to be charged extra just because you’re dealing with tax debt. Customer reviews are decent overall, but there aren’t many of them to see—the company has 4.9 stars on Trustpilot and 4.7 on the BBB, but with under 100 reviews across those sites.
One downside is CuraDebt’s availability—it’s available in 41 states and D.C., although it can refer people to local law firms in most other states.
CuraDebt was founded in 1996 and is based in Florida. Read more in our full CuraDebt Debt Relief review.
Fees and Costs
You’ll begin with a free consultation, as is the norm with debt settlement companies. If you decide to proceed with typical debt settlement, you’ll stop making your regular monthly payments to creditors and instead make payments into a savings account—this account will likely have fees, although these are not disclosed. The procedure for tax relief may be different.
CuraDebt’s customer support informed us that, if the company is able to settle any of your debts, you’ll be charged 15% to 25% of the initial amount of that debt. CuraDebt’s website says that fees may vary by state and that it offers “flat-fee pricing,” although it’s not clear what that means.

Why We Chose It
Pacific Debt Relief is only available in about half the country, but its debt settlement fees are just as low as our best overall pick, so it’s worth a look if you live in an eligible state. You’ll pay 15% to 25% of any debt that Pacific is able to settle; according to a customer support rep, the percentage you pay is based on the amount of settled debt. Unfortunately, like many companies, it doesn’t disclose the fees for the savings account that will hold your settlement fund.
Past customers are pleased with Pacific’s debt settlement services, with very few exceptions. Raters on Trustpilot give it 4.7 stars, with nearly 2,000 reviews; most of the comments refer to professional, pleasant interactions with customer support. It’s even better at the BBB, where Pacific has 4.9 stars and a similar number of reviews.
Pacific Debt Relief has been in business since 2002 and is based in San Diego, California. Learn more in our full Pacific Debt Relief review.

Why You Should Trust Us
Investopedia was founded in 1999 and has provided original recommendations on the best debt relief companies since June 2020. Investopedia’s research and editorial teams collected over 2,000 data points on debt relief companies (including debt settlement and credit counseling services) to develop comprehensive, unbiased recommendations that serve people in a variety of circumstances.
Warning
The Federal Trade Commission publishes a list of companies and people banned from participating in the debt relief business. Given how common debt relief scams and unrealistic promises to solve debt problems are, it's worth checking this list before working with a debt relief company of any kind.
How Does Debt Relief Work?
There are many forms of debt relief, including debt settlement companies that work with creditors on your behalf to pay off your debts for less than what you owe. The fee for their services is usually a percentage of your settled debt. For example, if the fee is 15% and your settled debt is $2,000, your cost would be $300. Some companies might base their fees on your initial debt.
However, your debt relif costs are not limited to that fee. You'll need to establish a savings account from which your debts will be paid off, and you will be responsible for the setup fee and any other fees associated with that account. The debt relief company will use the funds you add to that savings account to pay off your creditors.
Debt settlement companies cannot charge you any fees until they have settled your debt, so they won't agree to work with you until after a consultation that determines their services are a good fit for your situation. You may be charged initial fees for opening the savings account, however; these fees can be charged because they come from the bank providing the savings account, rather than the debt relief company.
Who Is Debt Relief Good For?
Debt relief options may be worth considering for those who can't keep up with their monthly payments but still have enough income or cash on hand to settle their debts and pay the fees charged by a debt relief company.
It's also best for those who are prepared to handle the hit their credit scores will take. If creditors are settling your debts for less than what you initially owed, you should expect your FICO scores to go down, whether you are working with a debt relief company or not.
Tip
Nonprofit credit counselors can provide free or low-cost advice for people struggling with debt. We recommend seeking credit counseling before agreeing to work with a debt settlement company. Credit counselors offer free initial consultations, and they can help you understand your debt and your options before committing to a debt relief plan.
How Fast Can I Get Debt Relief?
Different forms of debt relief have different potential timelines.
When it comes to debt settlement, companies say it typically takes 24–48 months to complete the program. The actual amount of time it takes will depend on the amount of debt you have, how quickly you can build up a settlement fund, the willingness of your creditors to negotiate, and the negotiation skills of the debt relief company. The faster you can build up a settlement fund and the less your creditors ask for, the sooner you can be out of debt.
Debt relief through credit counseling is similar. Credit counselors can negotiate lower interest rates for you, which helps prevent your debt from growing as fast, but they can't usually reduce the amount of debt you owe. So, the amount of time it takes to get out of debt depends mostly on fast you can pay it off.
Debt relief through bankruptcy may be completed relatively quickly. Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which doesn't require repayment, may take three to six months from filing to discharge of debts. Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which does require a repayment plan, may take 36 to 60 months to finish repayment.
Common Debt Relief Terms to Understand
If you are considering working with a debt relief company, you should familiarize yourself with these common terms:
Creditor: A creditor is the institution that holds your debt. It is who you owe money to. Creditors will try to collect on the debt you owe, even if you are working with a debt relief company, but they may be willing to accept less than the full amount.
Unsecured debt: If you are working with a debt relief company, it is for unsecured debt, which is not tied to any physical property. A car loan or a home mortgage, for example, is considered a secured debt, because the car or home secures the loan and can be taken by the creditor.
Bankruptcy: Working with a debt relief company is a way to avoid bankruptcy, which is a legal process that discharges your debt in the extreme event that you cannot repay it. Bankruptcy is more damaging to a person's credit score than settling debts for less than what you owe.
Debt consolidation: An alternative to working with a debt relief company is a debt consolidation loan. In this case, you would obtain a single loan, preferably with a lower interest rate than what you are paying on your outstanding debts, and use those funds to pay off your other loans. The goal is to consolidate multiple loans into a single loan with a lower monthly payment than your previous loans combined.
Financial plan: In addition to working with a debt relief company, it's important to have a financial plan for long-term financial health. More than just a budget, it helps to identify financial goals for the short-term and the long-term and establishes a framework for reaching those goals.
Pros & Cons of Debt Relief Companies
Pros
Reduces debt
Saves time
Cons
Reduces credit scores
May not work
Complicated fees
Pros Explained
Reduces debt: If everything goes according to plan, you could possibly reduce your debt by a significant amount, even after paying the debt relief company.Saves time: You could negotiate with individual creditors yourself, but that can be time-consuming, and you might not have the skills or experience to be successful. Debt relief companies make it so you don't need to handle this on your own.
Cons Explained
Reduces credit scores: Settled debts will have a negative impact on your credit, but the negative effects may not be as bad as what you'd experience after filing for bankruptcy.May not work: Debt relief companies are motivated to succeed because their fees are based on their ability to settle your debts, but that doesn't guarantee that they'll be able to do so. Even if they can, the reduced debt plus the fees might end up being just as much as what you started with.Complicated fees: Some debt relief companies base fees on settled debt while others base them on initial debt. Plus, you need to pay to set up a savings account from which your debts will be paid.
Frequently Asked Questions
What Is the Highest-Rated Debt Relief Company?
National Debt Relief is the highest-rated debt relief company, according to Investopedia's independent research. It offers debt settlement services across most of the country, for relatively low fees compared to other debt relief companies.
Does Debt Relief Destroy Your Credit?
Different debt relief options have different effects on your credit. Debt settlement—paying off an account balance for less than you owe—will cause quite a bit of damage to your credit, but it could be well worth the price of debt forgiveness. It'll stay on your credit reports for seven years, although the negative effect diminishes over time even before it drops off. Bankruptcy is similar, although your debt may be completely eliminated. A debt management plan through a credit counseling agency has no direct effect on your credit.
Are There Government Grants to Pay Off Debt?
In general, there are no federal government debt relief programs to pay off personal debts like personal loans, credit cards, and auto loans. There may be programs to help with those kinds of debt from your state of residence, but not from the federal government.You can find some forms of federal government debt relief for other types of debt, however. Mortgages may be eligible for forbearance or modification, and special situations may prompt the government to act—a Homeowner Assistance Fund, for example, was set up for homeowners who struggled to make payments during the COVID pandemic. There are also debt relief programs for federal student loans (not private student loans), like deferment, forbearance, forgiveness in certain circumstances, and income-based repayment plans.
What Are the Downsides of Debt Relief Programs?
The main downsides of debt relief programs are their costs and their effects on your credit. Debt settlement, for example, requires you to pay some portion of the debt; if you work with a debt settlement company, you'll also be charged a hefty fee based on the amount of debt involved. Debt settlement requires you to become delinquent on your debts, which is bad for your credit, and then debt settlement itself has a negative effect.
Which Is Better, Debt Consolidation or Debt Relief?
The right option for you depends on your situation. If your debts are fairly manageable and you have decent credit, debt consolidation may provide some relief by lowering your total monthly payment and maybe your APR. If your debts are more overwhelming, debt relief through debt settlement or bankruptcy may be required. We recommend speaking with a credit counselor (for free) to better understand your situation and your best options.
Should I Pay Off Credit Card Debt First?
Yes, in general it does make sense to pay off credit card debt first because credit cards tend to have some of the highest interest rates among types of debt. This fits with the debt avalanche method of debt repayment, in which you make the minimum payment on all your debts and then allocate any extra money toward the debt with the highest interest rate. This helps you save the most money on interest over time.
How Fast Should I Pay Off My Student Loans?
Compared to other types of debt, paying off student loans usually isn't a priority. This is because student loans tend to have relatively low interest rates, so they're not as expensive to hold as other types of debt, like credit cards and personal loans. But, if you have some money in savings and some cash to spare, it generally makes sense to pay extra toward your student loans to pay them off faster and save on interest.
