Key Takeaways
Starting Sept. 30, physical Social Security checks will no longer be issued. Beneficiaries will have to shift to some form of electronic payment.This is part of the agency's move to become more modernized, something it says will improve efficiency and security.Beneficiaries can choose to get their checks via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card designed for federal benefit payments.
Starting Sept. 30, physical Social Security checks will no longer be issued, and beneficiaries need to make changes before the end of the month to receive electronic payments.
While most Social Security beneficiaries are already receiving electronic payments, nearly 400,000 have received physical checks so far this month. If you or a loved one still receives Social Security benefits via check, here are your options.
Opt for Direct Deposit
Beneficiaries have two electronic payment options to choose from: direct deposit or the Direct Express card.
Beneficiaries can enroll in direct deposit to have their payments deposited directly into their checking or savings account.
To opt into direct deposit, beneficiaries can sign up online through their "my Social Security" account on the Social Security Administration's website. They can also call the administration or visit a local field office.
Opt for a Direct Express Card
For those without a bank account or unwilling to provide their bank details, the Direct Express card is another option. It is a prepaid debit card specifically designed for federal benefit payments, the SSA said.
Millions of Americans are unbanked, meaning they don’t have a traditional bank account with a direct deposit option.
According to AARP, about one out of every five households headed by someone over the age of 65 is unbanked or underbanked, which is someone who may have a bank account but primarily relies on alternative banking services to handle their money.

Request an Exemption
In some circumstances, beneficiaries may be granted an exemption from opting into the electronic payments. In order to request a waiver or to receive more information about whether you’re eligible, you must call the U.S. Treasury.
Shannon Benton, the executive director of nonpartisan seniors group The Senior Citizens League, said she hopes every beneficiary has someone watching out for them to ensure they are prepared for these changes and don’t miss any payments. But that isn’t always the case.
“That’s why there needs to be outreach to seniors and other beneficiaries, especially from the Social Security Administration, but also from local senior centers or agencies on aging, to make sure everyone is included,” Benton said.
The SSA said it has sent notices to people who still receive paper checks to explain the changes, as well as highlight the benefits of making the switch to digital payments. Recent benefit checks have also included an insert detailing the steps beneficiaries need to take to switch to electronic payments, according to the agency.
“Even if just 10 people don’t know [about the changes], that’s 10 too many that could potentially lose their only source of income," Benton said.
