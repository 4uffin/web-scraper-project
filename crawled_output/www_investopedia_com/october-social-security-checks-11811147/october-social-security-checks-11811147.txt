Every month, the Social Security Administration mails more than 74 million checks to people who receive retirement, spousal, survivor, or disability benefits. That's a lot of checks, so they aren't all mailed at once.
Here's the breakdown of how they're distributed.
Most beneficiaries are paid according to their birth date. There are some exceptions, such as separate payment dates for individuals who started receiving benefits, whether retirement, spousal, or survivor, prior to May 1997, or people who also qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSI is a federal program that provides additional income for people with disabilities and adults 65 and older who have little to no income.
In October, checks will be issued:
Oct. 1 - SSI payments will be paid to those who are qualified. Oct. 3 - Retirement benefits will be paid to those who have been collecting since before May 1997.Oct. 8 - Retirement, spousal, and survivor benefits will be paid to those born between the first and 10th of any month.Oct. 15 - Benefits will be paid to those with birthdays between the 11th and 20th of any month.Oct. 22 - Benefits will be paid to those with birthdays between the 21st and 31st of any month.Oct. 31 - SSI payments will be paid to those who are qualified for November.
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, here's when you can expect to receive your benefits.
In November, checks will be issued:
Nov. 3 - Retirement benefits will be paid to those who have been collecting since before May 1997.Nov. 12 - Retirement, spousal, and survivor benefits will be paid to those born between the first and 10th of any month.Nov. 19 - Benefits will be paid to those with birthdays between the 11th and 20th of any month.Nov. 26 - Benefits will be paid to those with birthdays between the 21st and 31st of any month.
