Major stock indexes ended lower for a third straight day before Friday's PCE inflation reading.
Close
U.S. stock indexes closed lower for a third straight session Thursday, a day ahead of key inflation data, as investors digested several other economic indicators.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq, benchmark S&P 500, and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%, 0.5%, and 0.4%, respectively. The three indexes had posted three straight record-high closes through Monday before their recent skid.
Investors were digesting several economic readings, including the final revision to second-quarter GDP, which was revised higher once again, this time to a 3.8% annual growth rate from 3.3%. Weekly jobless claims fell to 218,000 from 232,000 the week before, monthly durable goods orders rebounded, and August existing home sales were near flat. The 10-year Treasury yield, which affects borrowing costs on a variety of consumer and commercial loans, rose to 4.18% from 4.15% at Wednesday's close.
Tomorrow, the August reading for the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, will be in focus.
Bitcoin declines accelerated as the afternoon progressed, with the price of the largest cryptocurrency down 3.5% to below $110,000. Crypto-tied stocks MARA Holdings (MARA) and Strategy (MSTR) were down 9% and 7%, respectively.
Oracle (ORCL) shares fell 5.6% for their third straight day of declines, while Tesla (TSLA) stock ended down more than 4%. Micron Technology (MU) shares were down 3%, adding to nearly a 3% decline yesterday even though the memory-chip maker had posted record quarterly sales after the bell Tuesday. Amazon (AMZN) shares slipped almost 1% after it agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle a FTC lawsuit over allegedly deceptive subscription practices for Prime memberships.
However, Intel (INTC) shares surged roughly 9% to pace the S&P 500 and Nasdaq after jumping more than 6% Wednesday as Bloomberg reported that the chipmaker had discussed Apple (AAPL) buying a stake. Shares of IBM (IBM) paced the Dow, up 5%, after HSBC said it had a "positive trial" using quantum computers from "Big Blue" for algorithmic bond trading.
Shares of Costco Wholesale (COST), which reports quarterly results after the bell, were down 0.2%. Starbucks (SBUX) shares slipped 0.5% after it announced it would be laying off 900 corporate employees and closing underperforming stores.
CarMax (KMX) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500, with shares down 20% after the used-car retailer's second-quarter results widely missed analysts' estimates.
West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, were up slightly at $65.15 per barrel at 4 p.m. ET after surging more than 2% yesterday. Gold futures, which set another record high early Wednesday before ending about 1.5% lower, were up 0.3% at $3,780. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies and hit its lowest level since early 2022 last week, rose 0.7% to 98.52.
Biggest S&P 500 Movers on Thursday
3 hr 46 min ago
Decliners
CarMax (KMX) shares plunged 20%, falling the furthest of any stock in the S&P 500, after the used car retailer reported lower-than-expected sales and profits for its fiscal second quarter. CEO Bill Nash pointed to challenges including a pull-forward of demand into the previous quarter along with depreciation in the inventory CarMax built up to support sales.
Intel (INTC) shares added to their recent string of gains, popping 8.9% to secure the S&P 500's top daily performance. The move followed reports that the semiconductor maker has been seeking an investment from Apple (AAPL). The iPhone maker was once a major Intel customer but has more recently moved toward the use of its own chips. Shares of Apple were off 1.8% today.
Although Jabil (JBL) topped revenue and earnings per share forecasts in its latest quarterly report, shares of the electronic parts supplier slipped 6.7%. CEO Mike Dastoor said artificial intelligence helped drive demand in Jabil's capital equipment, data center, and networking markets, but the integrated circuit maker acknowledged pressure facing its automotive and renewable energy segments.
Rothschild Redburn initiated coverage of Oracle (ORCL) stock with a "sell" rating. The research firm believes markets could be pricing in an overly optimistic outlook on Oracle's contracted cloud revenue, optimism about which has driven enthusiasm for the stock since its latest quarterly report arrived. Shares of the enterprise software giant dropped 5.6%.
Advancers
Global banking giant HSBC (HSBC) said that it had conducted a successful bond trading trial using quantum computers from International Business Machines (IBM) to optimize market predictions. According to the financial firm, incorporating IBM's quantum computing resources resulted in a 34% improvement in predicting the likelihood that a trade would be executed at a particular price compared with using only classical computing techniques. IBM shares powered 5.2% higher, while HSBC's American depository receipts slipped.
After nearly doubling Wednesday after reports that the Trump administration was considering a government stake in the company, shares of Canada-based miner Lithium Americas (LAC) added another 23% Thursday. The company holds a majority stake in the Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada, which is on track to become one of the largest sources in North America for the battery component. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium miner, gained 4%.

Why Friday's Inflation Report is a Big Deal
4 hr 31 min ago
Friday's key report on inflation is even more significant after recent data showed the economy has been more resilient than expected in the face of tariffs.Forecasters expect a report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis to show that prices as measured by Personal Consumption Expenditures rose at a rate of 2.7% in August, up from a 2.6% annual rate in July, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal. "Core" PCE—which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors and is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, is expected to have risen 2.9% over the year, the same rate as July.
The Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates at its next meeting in October. But it could leave them unchanged if inflation comes in higher than expected, especially in the wake of several other stronger-than-expected economic reports this week.
A report Thursday showed that GDP rose more than originally estimated in the second quarter, while a separate report found that jobless claims fell last week. Data out Wednesday showed that sales of new homes jumped a very healthy 20% in August. All of this indicates that the economy remains resilient in the face of tariffs, potentially reducing concerns that the job market is deteriorating.
That's significant because Fed officials have been torn between their dual goals of supporting the job market (which calls for lower interest rates) and keeping a lid on inflation (which requires higher rates for longer.)

Dick's Stock Just Got a Bullish Call From Goldman Sachs. Here's Why.
5 hr 35 min ago
Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) stock is getting cheers from Goldman Sachs after the retailer’s $2.4 billion purchase of rival Foot Locker closed earlier this month.
The analysts wrote in a note to clients that a “strong sporting goods industry backdrop along with the global reach and scale of the combined company should result in even stronger vendor relationships which will further differentiate the banners against its competitors.” Dick's moved to acquire Foot Locker in May.

Goldman reiterated a “buy” rating on the stock, adding that with the addition of Foot Locker, it has a price target of $274. That's among the higher targets on Wall Street, according to Visible Alpha, which has a mean near $246. The shares are nearly 2% lower today, falling alongside broader markets, so Goldman's target reflects a roughly 20% premium to recent prices.
“We expect Dick’s management can improve Foot Locker's top line meaningfully as it manages its brand portfolio to include higher brand heat products, improve the store layout, and instill Dick’s service levels, which should help drive conversion," Goldman's analysts wrote.

President Trump Set to Sign Deal to Put TikTok Under US Ownership, Report Says
6 hr 25 min ago
President Donald Trump is reportedly set to sign an executive order on Thursday that would help bring TikTok’s U.S. operations under American control, averting a ban on the popular Chinese-owned social media app.
NBC News reported today that the president will issue an executive order laying out the terms of the deal.
The ownership group is expected to include billionaires Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch, Michael Dell, and Oracle.

Trump had earlier said that the U.S. group that would control TikTok in the U.S. would include Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch, Dell Technologies (DELL) CEO Michael Dell, and Oracle (ORCL).
TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance will copy and lease the algorithm to the joint venture that will control TikTok's U.S. operations. Oracle, which was co-founded by billionaire Larry Ellison, will oversee the recommendation software, a White House official had confirmed earlier.
ByteDance "will create a duplicate copy of the TikTok algo and then lease it to the new joint venture, which would then operate and retrain the algo on U.S. servers," a White House official told Investopedia previously.

Former Fed Chairs Urge Supreme Court to Stop Trump From Firing Lisa Cook
7 hr 9 min ago
A who's-who list of former Federal Reserve and White House officials urged the Supreme Court to preserve the central bank's independence and prevent President Donald Trump from firing Fed governor Lisa Cook, at least for now.Every living former Fed chair — Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Alan Greenspan—signed the brief filed with the high court Thursday, as did former Treasury secretaries, White House economic advisors from both parties, and prominent academic economists. If Trump is successful, it would be the first time in history a president has fired a Fed governor.

The brief laid out the case, supported by many mainstream economists, for blocking Trump's attempts to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook from her spot on the seven-member board that controls the central bank. The Fed was set up to be independent from direct control of the White House to give it more leeway to make monetary policy decisions based on economic rather than political considerations.
"The Federal Reserve’s independence and the public’s perception of that independence are important for economic performance, including achieving the goals Congress has set for the Federal Reserve of stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates," they wrote. "Allowing the removal of Governor Lisa D. Cook while the challenge to her removal is pending would threaten that independence."

Opendoor Stock Jumps as Trading Giant Jane Street Discloses Stake
7 hr 59 min ago
Trading giant Jane Street now owns 5.9% in Opendoor Technologies, the online real-estate platform that has become a favorite of retail traders.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, Jane Street said its stake in Opendoor (OPEN) amounted to around 44 million shares, translating to a value of roughly $362 million based on Wednesday’s closing price.
Jane Street is known for its sophisticated high-frequency trading systems. It's unclear if the investment is a bet on the company or marks a hedging position.
Opendoor shares were up more than 6% in recent trading. They have been on a tear since July as retail investors piled in and have gained 450% so far this year.

Starbucks Is Closing Shops and Cutting Costs as Its Turnaround Effort Continues
8 hr 43 min ago
A year into its turnaround attempt, Starbucks says its strategy won’t work in dozens of its locations—which are now set to close.
Starbucks (SBUX) is shutting cafes where it's “unable to create the physical environment our customers and partners expect” or make the finances work, CEO Brian Niccol said in a letter Thursday that was published online. The Seattle-based coffee chain will end its fiscal year in the coming days with 18,300 American and Canadian outposts, 1% fewer than a year earlier, the letter said, though it expects to finish the coming year with more.

Starbucks is also laying off 900 non-retail employees to cut costs and put resources toward “key areas that drive long-term growth,” Niccol said.
Niccol last year announced Back to Starbucks, an attempt to improve sales by making cafes a more enticing place to spend time and money. Starbucks sought to serve to-go customers within four minutes and bring order to cafe lines. Cafes would also become more inviting due to new seating, the return of ceramic dishes and free refills, the company said.

The Hunt for AI Gains Is Lifting Chinese Stocks. Here's What You Need to Know.
9 hr 19 min ago
As the U.S. wrestles China for AI dominance, investors are playing both sides.
Chinese stocks have seen a big boost this quarter, extending year-to-date returns amid improving sentiment around the U.S.-China trade talks and higher conviction arounds its capabilities in artificial intelligence. The Shanghai Composite and CSI 300 are up 18% and 20% year-to-date, compared to 13% for the S&P 500, the U.S. benchmark.
Shares of Alibaba and other big Chinese tech companies are recent winners.

Much of the action in China has been driven by Chinese money, but foreign investors are also buying in. Invesco's Golden Dragon ETF (PGJ), which tracks an index of U.S. exchange-listed shares of China-based companies, is up more than 29%, while the Invesco China Technology ETF (CQQQ) is up more than 51% over the same period. Global hedge funds in August logged their strongest month of investment in Chinese companies in six months, according to Morgan Stanley.
Some of the demand may have been driven by investors seeking out ways to play the AI theme at comparatively low prices. The MSCI China Index traded at 12 times projected earnings, compared to the S&P 500's 23 through the end of August.

IBM Paces Dow After Quantum Computing Trial With HSBC on Algorithmic Bond Trading
10 hours ago
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was outperforming the other two major stock indexes in late-morning trading Thursday, and IBM (IBM) was the reason why.
The blue-chip index was down just 0.1% compared to 0.4% declines by both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, with shares of "Big Blue" rising more than 5% after HSBC (HSBC) said it had used IBM quantum computers "for solving real-world problems in algorithmic bond trading."
The British bank said the experiment, which utilized IBM's advanced Heron quantum processor, "delivered up to 34% improvement in predicting the probability of winning customer inquiries in the European corporate bond market."
With today's sharp rise, IBM stock has risen about 28% year-to-date.

GDP Revision Shows US Economy Grew More Than Previously Thought in Second Quarter
10 hr 47 min ago
The output of the U.S. economy as measured by Gross Domestic Product bounced back more than previously thought in the second quarter, powered by an increase in consumer spending.
That's according to a report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which said that GDP grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 3.8% in the second quarter, compared with its previous estimate of 3.3% growth. It was the fastest growth since the third quarter of 2023, and a rebound from the 0.6% decline in GDP in the first quarter. Forecasters had expected growth to stay at 3.3% according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.
The increased estimate was largely due to an upward revision in consumer spending, which rose at a 2.5% annual rate over the quarter, the BEA said.

The revised figures suggest the economy is staying resilient amid President Donald Trump's trade wars, which economists say have slowed down hiring and stoked inflation, at least temporarily, and have made consumers more pessimistic about inflation and the economy according to surveys. Consumer spending is the main engine of economic growth, responsible for 68% of the GDP.
"The big surprise is how strong U.S. consumers continue to be: despite so much uncertainty and an ongoing gloominess in sentiment, consumers keep spending," Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in a commentary.

11 hr 17 min ago

US Investigates Imports of Medical Devices, Robotics for National Security; Tariffs Possible
11 hr 54 min ago
The U.S. has launched national security investigations into imports of robotics, industrial machinery and medical devices, including personal protective equipment like masks, putting imports of these products at risk for the next stage of tariffs.
According to Federal Register filings, the Department of Commerce said that the investigation, under “Section 232” of the Trade Expansion Act, will look into whether importing these products infringes on national security. The inquiries started on Sept. 2, and they appear to be part of the president's move to boost domestic manufacturing in key industries by making imports more expensive.
The filings said the Commerce Department is “particularly interested in comments and information” on how much current U.S. production of these products can meet domestic demand, the extent of foreign supply chains in these goods, and how much foreign nations can "weaponize" their control over the supply of these products.
The investigation into medical gear, aimed at redirecting production of these imports in the U.S., appears to target China. During the pandemic, the country halted exports of PPE, such as the virus-filtering N95 mask and nitrile gloves, putting hospital workers at risk.
