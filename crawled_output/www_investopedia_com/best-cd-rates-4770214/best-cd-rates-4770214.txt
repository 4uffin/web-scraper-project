In the News
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at its Sept. 17 meeting. This is the first rate cut since December 2024 and lowers the federal funds rate to a range of 4.00%–4.25%. Committee members are projecting two more quarter-point reductions before the end of the year. CD rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which means CD rates are expected to decline as the Fed lowers rates.
Why You Can Trust Our Expert Recommendations for the Best CD Rates
Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been helping readers find the best CD rates since 2019. To do this, we collect thousands of CD rates from hundreds of banks and credit unions every weekday. We then rank the best CDs according to APYs, with the top certificates certificates typically paying three to five times as much as the national average—or even more. We then also provide details on factors like CD term, early withdrawal penalty, and minimum opening deposit.
To qualify for our rankings, a CD must be available nationwide and its minimum opening deposit requirement cannot exceed $25,000. It must also be offered by an FDIC-insured bank or NCUA-insured credit union, which protects up to $250,000 in deposits per person and per institution).

Why You Might Not Recognize the Banks and Credit Unions in Our CD Rankings
You typically won't see big names like Chase, Wells Fargo, PNC, Navy Federal, or Bank of America in our rankings of the best CD rates. We research their rates, but they don't make our list simply because they don't pay enough. Extremely large banks typically don't need to attract customers and deposits like smaller institutions do, so they don't need to use rates to win business. In fact, some of the biggest banks pay interest rates very close to zero, but it depends and can change from month to month. Our best CD rates are based on careful research, and we update this article every weekday to give you the best CD rates available nationwide.
What Is a CD Rate?
A CD rate is an interest rate that shows what a bank or credit union will pay you for depositing your money with them for a certain time in a certificate of deposit (CD). For example, if the rate is 4.50% for a 1-year CD, the bank or credit union will pay you 4.50% in interest on your money for keeping it in the account, untouched, for 12 months. If you deposit $1,000 in that account and keep it there for 12 months, you will earn $45 at the end of the term.
Note that the interest rate and the APY offered on a CD are slightly different. An interest rate is the raw rate you earn on your money, while the annual percentage yield (APY) is the full amount of interest earned after compounding at the end of one year. APYs are therefore usually higher than the interest rate. For example, an interest rate on a 3-month CD could be 4.41% while the APY on that same CD is 4.50%.
How Does a CD Work?
A certificate of deposit (CD) is similar to a bank deposit account. The difference is what you're agreeing to when you sign on the dotted line (even if that signature is now digital).
A CD works by locking your deposit up for a set time. When time is up, the CD pays you the set interest rate you agreed to when you opened it. A CD locks you into four specific things:
The interest rate: Most CDs pay a fixed interest rate. The bank cannot later change the rate and therefore reduce your earnings. On the flip side, a fixed interest rate may hurt you if rates later rise and you've lost your opportunity to take advantage of higher-paying CDs.The term: This is the length of time you agree to leave your money deposited to avoid any penalty (such as six months or 1 year, etc.) The term ends on the "maturity date," when you can withdraw your money penalty-free.The principal: Except for some specialty CDs that allow add-on deposits, this is the amount you agree to deposit into the CD, at the time of opening.The institution: The bank or credit union where you open your CD will determine aspects of the agreement, such as penalties for early withdrawal and whether your CD will be automatically reinvested if you don’t provide other instructions at the time of maturity. Credit unions may also require you to open a high-yield savings account or money market account before you open a CD.
Once your CD is established and funded, the bank or credit union will set the terms and conditions, just as it does with other deposit accounts. You'll have either monthly or quarterly statement periods, paper or electronic statements, and usually monthly or quarterly interest payments deposited to your CD balance, where the interest will compound. The money you put into a CD is insured like other deposit accounts—up to $250,000 per customer, per institution.
How Much Does a $10,000 CD Earn in One Year?
If you invest $10,000 in a CD for one year, you could earn at least a few hundred dollars, depending on the interest rate. For example, with an APY of 4.55%, you'd get $455 in interest after one year. CD rates can change, so locking in a high interest rate today could guarantee you the maximum earnings, especially if CD rates drop by next year.
There are a few scenarios you may encounter or need to decide between when it comes to investing $10,000 in a CD. It'll depend on the rate and CD term you choose. Here are a few scenarios:

Who Should Get a CD?
If you're looking to save money for a certain amount of time and want to make sure you don't touch it until you need it, consider a top-paying CD. If you're risk-averse and don't want to invest money in the stock market because there's no guarantee you'll see a return, that's another reason to open a CD. CDs offer a fixed rate of return that guarantees your earnings until the CD's term ends. And right now, CD rates are high—over 4% in many cases—so you can earn a solid return on your deposit.
CDs Can Help You Beat Inflation
In August 2025, inflation was 2.9%, while the top APY offered across all CDs was 4.60%. CD rates reached historic highs in 2023 as a result of the Fed's rate-hike policy to cool inflation, which had reached 9.1% in June 2022. CDs can help you combat inflation by paying you interest on your money, even though you may be paying more for goods and services. This will not always be the case, though. Interest rates are often increased to help combat high inflation. With inflation trending toward the standard 2% mark the Fed aims for each year, the federal funds rate was reduced in September for the first time in four years, then again in both November and December. CD rates have subsequently begun to decline.
Right now, the best CD rates are still over 4.50%, which is much higher than what CD rates were just a few years ago. Buying a CD now is a good idea since you'll be able to earn a higher interest rate than you might be able to earn in a year from now. Right now, you're guaranteed a high interest rate, even if the Fed decides to lower rates during the term of your CD. Waiting to buy a CD could mean earning a lower interest rate on a CD and losing out on higher guaranteed earnings. So if you are debating whether to buy a CD or not, don't wait.
Types of CDs
Regular CDs: A regular CD is a CD with a fixed interest rate for a set period. Brick-and-mortar traditional banks, as well as online institutions and credit unions, offer these kinds of CDs. They may also be called traditional CDs.
Variable-rate CDs: A variable-rate CD is one where the interest rate can change based on the prime rate, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Treasury bills, or a market index. The entire term for a variable-rate CD is still fixed, though, and does not change. These are sometimes called "flex" CDs.
Jumbo CDs: A jumbo CD is a CD that requires a larger opening deposit, such as $50,000 or $100,000.
No-penalty CDs: A no-penalty CD is exactly what it sounds like—you do not pay a fee for withdrawing your money early.
Brokered CDs: A brokered CD is one that an investor can buy through a brokerage firm or from a sales representative other than a bank or credit union.
Step-up CDs: A step-up CD allows you to increase your interest rate when you can. Your rate is not fixed for the entire term; you can capitalize on higher interest rates with a step-up CD. A step-up CD may also be called a bump-up CD.
Promotional-rate CDs: This CD offers a promotional rate that may be higher than a regular CD rate and is only offered for a certain time period. You may be able to lock in a high rate by opening this kind of CD within a promotional period, like 30 days or before the end of the month.
Note
Online banks or credit unions tend to offer high CD rates because of the lower overhead costs. If you're worried about opening an online bank account, just do your research to ensure the institution comes with FDIC or NCUA insurance. It may also be an online arm of a larger, brick-and-mortar institution, which could give you peace of mind. Big banks like Citibank, U.S. Bank, Bank of America, Chase, Capital One, Wells Fargo, American Express, and more offer CDs too, but they may not pay the highest CD rates. It's important to shop around and consider all financial institutions before choosing a CD.
Pros and Cons of CDs
Pros
Guaranteed yield for the CD's full term: Most CDs are a fixed-rate product, so you're guaranteed to earn the rate you lock in until the CD's maturity date, no matter what the Federal Reserve does with the fed funds rate in the future.
Higher interest rates than liquid accounts: Banks generally offer higher rates on CDs than on savings and money market accounts, in exchange for you keeping the money in the account and not touching it until you're allowed to withdraw it.
Fully predictable earnings and withdrawal date: Because you know the CD's rate and term, you can calculate exactly how much you'll earn and when you can withdraw the funds without penalty.
Extremely safe, with almost no bank or market risk: When you open a CD at an FDIC bank or an NCUA credit union, up to $250,000 in deposits are federally protected against the institution's failure. You're also safe from the market volatility—and potential loss in value—that can occur with stock and bond investments.
Can deter spending temptations: Withdrawing funds before your CD matures causes you to pay an early withdrawal penalty, which can help keep you from giving in to temptations to dip into your savings for an unplanned purchase. This means a CD could be good for building your emergency fund.
Cons
Early withdrawal of the funds incurs a penalty: If you do need to withdraw your CD funds before maturity, the bank or credit union will impose an early withdrawal penalty. Typically, it's calculated as a certain number of months of forfeited interest earnings.
You can’t add to your deposit: With the rare exception of add-on CDs, you can only deposit funds into the certificate at the time of initial deposit. This means you miss out on compound interest since you're not able to grow the account and apply the interest rate to your new balance every month like with a savings account.
If CD rates rise, you may miss out on a higher yield: If you lock in your CD rate, but rates increase shortly after, you may wish you'd waited to score a higher return.
If CD rates drop, you may wish you’d chosen a longer CD: Though you'll still be well-served by any CD yield you have locked in before interest rates drop, you may wish you'd locked in a longer-term CD to extend that competitive yield for a longer period.
Typically return less than stocks over long periods: Though stock investments involve more risk and less predictability, they may offer greater returns over long periods.
How to Choose the Best CD for You
When choosing a CD, consider the following factors:
Your financial goals: Both short-term goals and long-term goals are important.How much money you have to deposit: CDs have minimums, so if you only have $500 to deposit, you'll need to find a CD with that minimum balance requirement.How long you can leave that money in the CD without touching it: This will help you determine the right term—whether that's a one-year CD or a three-year CD.Interest rates offered for your term and minimum deposit: The higher the rate, the more you will earn on your deposit during the CD term.CD type: Is it a bump-up CD or a regular CD? This will ensure you're choosing one that meets your needs and goals.
Once you choose a CD, open the account, and deposit your money to start earning interest.
Christine DiGangi, Investopedia Product Reviews Team
I had two short-term savings goals, so I looked for a 6-month and a 1-year CD with a high APY that I could ladder. I checked out a few of the options on our list and decided to go with CIT Bank and Bread Savings, because applying for the CDs online was really easy, and they offered mobile apps—I’m one of those people who checks their financial accounts frequently, if not daily. I’d keep accounts with both of them (assuming the rates are good when the two terms end).
What Do You Need to Open One of the Best CDs?
To open a CD, you'll need some personal information including, but not limited to:
NameAddressPhone number
For example, the bank's customer service team may ask you to provide a copy of your license or ID if you don't have an account with that institution already.
When you have that info handy, fill out the application for your CD account:
State how you'll fund the CD, whether via an electronic transfer or another method.Fund the CD.State how you want to receive the interest, all at the end or in monthly installments (if required).
Once you've done all that, you should officially have a CD in your name, though check with the institution to ensure you've taken all the right steps.
Financial Advisor Insight
"Look for the best CD rates and consider laddering the term of the renewals, whenever possible to hedge for potential liquidity needs in the future and not miss opportunities to lock in potential higher rates," said Sibyl Slade, a member of Investopedia’s Financial Advisor Council.
How to Build a CD Ladder
Smart CD investors have a specific tactic for hedging against rate changes over time and maximizing their return. It's called a CD ladder and it enables you to access the higher rates typically offered on 5-year CDs, but with the twist that a portion of your money becomes available every year, rather than every five years. Here's how to do it.
Take the amount of money you want to invest in CDs and divide it by five.Put one-fifth of the funds into a top-earning 1-year CD, another fifth into a top 2-year CD, another into a 3-year CD, and so forth through a 5-year CD. Let’s say you have $25,000 available. That would give you five CDs of varying lengths, each with a value of $5,000.When the first CD matures in a year, you take the resulting funds and open a top-rate 5-year CD.One year later, your initial 2-year CD will mature, and you'll invest those funds into another 5-year CD.Continue doing this every year with whichever CD is maturing until you end up with a portfolio of five CDs all earning 5-year APYs, but with one of them maturing every 12 months, keeping your money a bit more accessible than if all of it were locked up for a full five years.
What Happens if I Withdraw From a CD Early?
If you withdraw money early from a CD, you'll likely have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. This is usually a certain number of months' worth of interest that you earned in the CD thus far. For example, if you had deposited $10,000 in a 12-month CD with a rate of 5.00%, and withdrew it early, you might have to pay three months' worth of the interest you had earned. So instead of cashing out $500 at the end of the CD term, you'd walk away with less interest earned, the exact amount depending on how early you withdrew the money.
Now, not all CDs have early withdrawal penalties. Some no-penalty CDs are available and have more flexibility, However, they may also come with lower interest rates.
How Are CDs Taxed?
Just like how the interest you earn on any money you have in savings, money market, and checking accounts is taxable as interest income at both the state and federal levels, the interest you earn on your money in a CD is too.
Your CD earnings will be reported to the IRS in the year they were earned and posted to your account, so that's when they're taxable—even though you may not withdraw the funds for one or more years into the future.
For example, if you have $1,000 in a 1-year CD with a 5.00% interest rate, you'll earn $50 in interest. You owe taxes on that $50, but not on the $1,000 principal you deposited at the start of the term.
If you decide to add a CD to your IRA, you may not have to pay taxes until you're ready to withdraw in retirement. You can add CDs in both traditional and Roth IRAs. With a Roth IRA, you are not penalized for withdrawing money from the account if it's open for at least five years because it's funded with after-tax dollars. However, if you want to withdraw money from your Roth IRA CD before it matures, you will be hit with a CD early withdrawal penalty. If your CD matures in a traditional IRA before your retirement age, then you may not be able to withdraw that money without first paying taxes and fees.
Alternatives to CDs
CDs vs. Traditional Savings Accounts
Traditional savings accounts tend to offer lower interest rates. Banks or credit unions with no high-yield savings account options may only offer traditional savings accounts that pay 0.01% to 0.10%. While the national average for savings rates is 0.40%, according to the FDIC, many banks pay much less. For example, Wells Fargo's Way2Save account pays 0.01% APY and Chase offers just 0.01% with its Chase Savings account. When interest rates are high, the top CD rate can be up to 600x the rate you may earn on your money in a traditional savings account.
CDs vs. High-Yield Savings Accounts
If you just aren't sold on committing your funds for a certain amount of time, or can't afford to because you may need the money in the near term, a high-yield savings account may be a better option. You'll be free to withdraw and deposit funds as you like, though some institutions will limit how many withdrawals you can make each month. Some savings accounts may also require a minimum balance.
CDs vs. Money Market Accounts
If you're looking for other high-yield accounts, a money market account may serve your needs. Money market accounts offer the feature of allowing you to write checks on the account. Some money market accounts come with debit cards, but money market accounts tend to act more like savings accounts. They may also come with minimum deposit or balance requirements, and money market account rates can easily compete with savings account rates.
CDs vs. Bonds
If you're interested in venturing out of the bank and into the world of bonds, you have numerous options. You could put cash savings into U.S. government I bonds, which are designed to track or beat the inflation rate. Or you could invest in U.S. Treasuries, in which you lend money to the U.S. government for a fixed amount of time. The Treasury notes with durations of four weeks to one year are called T-Bills.
Another option is corporate and municipal bonds. Though it's difficult to research individual bonds on your own, you can easily invest in a bond mutual fund or bond exchange-traded fund which is diversified across a bundle of different bond issues. You can also enter and exit these funds at any time.
CDs vs. Brokerage Accounts
If you have a brokerage account, you can also hold savings in the brokerage’s cash reserve account or their money market fund (not to be confused with the money market accounts offered by banks). Just be sure to research what rate you’ll earn because in many cases, these brokerage cash accounts pay far less than what you can earn by keeping your money in an outside CD, savings account, or money market account. Some brokerages may also offer brokered CDs, another option if you're already investing with a broker and want to open a CD.
CDs vs. Annuities
An annuity is a type of fixed-income investment provided by financial institutions. You can buy an annuity and pay it monthly or in a lump sum. Then, in the future, you receive fixed monthly payments. Annuities are insurance contracts that can guarantee income. While they are similar to a CD in that the income is guaranteed as long as you follow the rules of the contract, they are not as short-term as CDs may be. Annuities are most often used in retirement planning. CDs can also be used for retirement planning, but they are usually bought and held for terms of 6 months to 5 years rather than an annuity, which could be owned for 20 years or something similar. There may also be different withdrawal rules and limits and tax consequences with annuities.
CDs vs. Treasury Bills
Treasury bills are debt obligations backed by the U.S. government. They usually have maturities of one year or less. That timing is similar to CDs with shorter terms, but Treasury Bills may not offer the same level of return on the investment. Rates are comparable, ranging from 4.10% to 4.59% as of Nov. 7, 2024, but they can fluctuate daily.
CD rates can also change daily. The thing with T-bills is that you buy them at a discount and when they mature, you receive the full amount back, plus a little more. For example, you might buy a $1,000 T-bill for $950. When the bill matures, you will get $1,000, or $50 more than what you paid for it. This increase of $50 is the interest you earn. CDs are a little less complicated, where you put in a set amount, and then receive a fixed interest rate when it matures.
Frequently Asked Questions
Who Is Paying the Highest CD Rate Right Now?
The highest CD rate right now is 5.50% APY from Nuvision Credit Union on a 9-month term. This is a special offer good through Sept. 27, 2025. The top rate could change, though, as interest rates fluctuate daily and institutions can offer CDs with high interest rates for as long or as short of a time as they want.
Are CDs Safe?
CDs are safe because they are usually offered by banks or credit unions which are insured by the FDIC or NCUA. This means your money at a bank or credit union, across all of your accounts (CDs, savings, and checking, etc.) is insured for up to $250,000. CDs also come with virtually no risk since the interest rate is usually fixed; you'll know what to returns to expect before even opening the CD.
How Have CD Rates Changed Over Time?
The top CD rates continually change, based on the U.S. interest rate environment. When the federal funds rate is low, CD rates tend to be low, and when the fed funds rate is high, CD rates tend to be high. To combat high inflation between 2021 and 2023, the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee dramatically raised the fed funds rate to its highest level in more than 20 years. That in turn pushed CD rates to a peak of 6.00% in 2024. Compare that to 2021, when the top CD rate was around 1.35%.
Do You Pay Taxes on CD Interest?
Yes, your earnings on a CD are considered interest income, and are taxed in the same way as interest earnings from a savings, money market, or checking account. The bank or credit union will send you a tax form early in the calendar year, showing how much interest you earned in the previous tax year, which you'll use to file your tax return.
Can I Get 6% on a CD?
There are currently no nationally available CDs offering 6% APY, but you may find local offers that are higher than the best national CDs. Although 6% CDs may have been available in the past, the top options today tend to be below 5%.
How Long Can You Have Money in a CD?
CD terms often range from 3 months to 10 years, so you can have your money in a CD for generally any length of time in between. Some CDs have terms of 8 or 9 months, others have 15-month terms, and there are 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, 5-year, 6-year, 7-year, 8-year, and 10-year terms—though the longer terms may be offered by fewer banks or credit unions.
Is Now a Good Time to Buy a CD?
Putting money into a CD right now may be a smart move if you're looking to earn a high interest rate on money you don't need. CD rates are over 5.00% for many terms right now, and locking up your money for six, 12, or even 24 months could help you in the long run if CD rates decline in the next year or two. CD rates are higher in 2024 than they have been in 20 years. So yes, now is a good time to buy a CD.
What Is a Jumbo CD?
A CD with a minimum deposit requirement of $100,000 or more is usually considered a jumbo CD. While the required minimum deposit is higher than traditional CDs, the interest rates on jumbos are not always higher. That means you could earn a higher interest rate by depositing $100,000 in a traditional CD instead of a jumbo CD. Just shop around to learn which CD is best for your money and situation.

How We Find the Best CD Rates
Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying certificates in every major term. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), the CD's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000, and any specified maximum deposit cannot be under $5,000.
Banks must be available in at least 40 states. While some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. For more about how we choose the best rates, read our full methodology.
