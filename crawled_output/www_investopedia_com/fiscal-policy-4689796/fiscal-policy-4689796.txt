Frequently Asked Questions
Can state and local governments in the US run fiscal deficits?
There is nothing inherent preventing state and local governments from running deficits in the same way that national governments do. However, almost all U.S. State constitutions have balanced budget amendments, which legally prevent those specific states from doing so.

Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act
The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, the colloquial name for the United States Tariff Act of 1930, raised U.S. tariffs on many goods by 20%. This tariff, passed after the onset of the Great Depression, provoked retaliatory tariffs from many other countries. This trade war likely resulted in economic damage, but the amount is disputed.
Learn More
Implementation Lag
Implementation lag refers to the length of time between when an economic event, like a recession, begins, and when government interventions to deal with it are put in place. As such, governments need to try and take this lag into account or their interventions may be tailored to situations that are now passed.

Works Progress Administration (WPA)
