Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue (KVUE) dropped Monday ahead of an anticipated report by the Trump administration linking pregnant women’s use of the painkiller to autism.
Kenvue shares fell over 7% to a record low during Monday's session ahead of an announcement at the White House. The stock climbed in after-hours trading.
President Trump said at a press conference with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, can lead to higher risk of autism and warned pregnant women against using the medication.
Kenvue said that scientific studies showed that there was no link between acetaminophen and autism.
“We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,” a Kenvue spokesperson told Investopedia ahead of the announcement. “We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.”
