U.S. stocks were mixed Tuesday ahead of comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 hitting new all-time highs and the Nasdaq Composite pulling back.
The blue-chip Dow advanced 0.7% and the benchmark S&P 500 was up 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was 0.2% lower. The indexes all recorded intraday and closing highs for a third consecutive session Monday.
Market watchers are awaiting Powell's first comments since the central bank last week cut interest rates for the first time this year. Powell is scheduled to speak at 12:35 p.m. ET at the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce in Warwick, R.I.
Major stock indexes advanced yesterday on news that Nvidia (NVDA) and OpenAI were partnering on a buildout of data centers, and that the AI chipmaker would be investing up to $100 billion in the ChatGPT developer. Nvidia shares hit an all-time high and finished the session up 4%, although they pulled back 2.2% Tuesday morning.
Nvidia partner Micron Technology (MU) is slated to report its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results after the bell. Shares of the memory-chip maker, which have nearly doubled this year, rose 2%.
Shares of Oracle (ORCL) sank 5% after soaring 6% yesterday as the technology firm boosted its bets on AI by naming two new CEOs, including the former head of its cloud infrastructure business, to take over from Safra Catz.
Kenvue (KVUE) shares rebounded 5% after dropping 7.5% yesterday to lead S&P 500 decliners ahead of a press conference by President Donald Trump in which he said that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, can lead to higher risk of autism and warned pregnant women against using the medication.
Boeing (BA) shares advanced 3% after the company inked a lucrative contract to make planes for Uzbekistan Airways. President Trump called it "a GREAT Deal" worth more than $8 billion in a post on his Truth Social network, noting that last month he had spoken with Uzbekistan's president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev. Bloomberg also reported that U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue said the countries were negotiating a "huge" Boeing plane order.
Gold futures rose 1% to set another record high of more than $3,800 an ounce. West Texas Intermediate futures, the U.S. crude oil benchmark, was up 1.5% at $63.25 per barrel.
The 10-year Treasury yield, which affects borrowing costs on a variety of consumer and commercial loans, ticked lower to 4.14% from 4.15% at Monday's close. Bitcoin was nearly 1% higher to trade around $113,000. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies and hit its lowest level since early 2022 last Wednesday, was little changed at 97.32.
Nvidia Levels to Watch After Chip Giant's $100B Deal With OpenAI
1 hr 3 min ago
Nvidia (NVDA) shares lost ground in early trading Tuesday after logging their largest one-day percentage gain since July on news the AI favorite plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI.
Under the deal, Nvidia will supply OpenAI with its next-generation Vera Rubin platform to help the ChatGPT maker build data centers and other AI infrastructure with a capacity of at least 10 gigawatts of power. The companies said they anticipate finalizing the details of the partnership in the coming weeks.
Nvidia shares were down 2% at around $180 in recent trading after surging nearly 4% on Monday. Through yesterday's close, the stock had gained 37% so far in 2025, handily outpacing broader market returns over the period. Investors have piled into the stock as big tech hyperscalers and sovereign customers invest heavily in the company’s products as they ramp up their AI capacity.

After setting their record high last month, Nvidia shares consolidated within a symmetrical triangle before breaking out from the pattern in Monday’s trading session.
The breakout indicates a continuation of the stock’s extended move higher, with increasing volume in recent days signaling conviction from larger market participants.
It’s also worth noting that the relative strength index has moved back into bullish territory, confirming strengthening price momentum.

Boeing Stock Rises on Uzbekistan Airways Order That Trump Says Is Worth $8B
1 hr 42 min ago
Boeing (BA) has logged its biggest-ever single order with a sale of up to 22 787 Dreamliners to Uzbekistan Airways, in a deal President Donald Trump said is worth more than $8 billion.
The companies said Monday that Uzbekistan Airways would buy 14 of Boeing’s 787-9 Dreamliner jets, with options for eight more, sending shares of the U.S. plane maker rising 2.2% in premarket trading. The stock entered 2025 up 20%, after stumbling last year following a series of safety incidents and a crippling strike at its Washington plants.
“Earlier this month I spoke with the Highly Respected President of Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev. Today I want to congratulate President Mirziyoyev on signing a GREAT Deal with Boeing!” President Trump said in on his Truth Social platform. He added that the deal is "worth over $8 Billion Dollars."
The companies said the investment will support “nearly 35,000 U.S. jobs.”
Uzbekistan Airways said the order would help modernize its fleet and "expand its international routes to the U.S. and other long-haul destinations as demand for international travel continues to rise." The Dreamliner is a wide-body jet known for being fuel efficient.

2 hr 22 min ago
Shares of IonQ (IONQ) advanced 4% before the bell after the quantum computing company said it achieved a "milestone" advancement.

This critical milestone paves the way for interconnecting quantum computers over vast distances using the current existing fiber optic infrastructure."

OECD Says US GDP Growth to Slow Next Year
2 hr 46 min ago
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Tuesday raised its growth forecast for the U.S. economy in 2025 on the back of investing around the AI boom, but noted that tariffs and lower net immigration are taking a toll and would lead to slowing growth next year.
The OECD said it expects the U.S.'s annual real gross domestic product growth rate to come in at 1.8% in 2025, up from its 1.6% projection in June. That is, however, well below the 2.8% GDP growth registered in 2024. U.S. GDP is projected to rise by just 1.5% next year.
The OECD forecasts 1.5% economic growth for the U.S. in 2026.

"Strong AI-related investment boosted outcomes in the United States," the Paris-based body said, but also noted that GDP growth is falling from 2024 as "strong investment growth in high technology sectors is more than offset by higher tariff rates and a drop in net immigration."
The OECD said that the overall effective tariff rate in the U.S. rose to around 19.5% at the end of August, the month when President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs went into effect. That is the highest rate since 1933, it said. The OECD also noted a softening in U.S. labor markets.
