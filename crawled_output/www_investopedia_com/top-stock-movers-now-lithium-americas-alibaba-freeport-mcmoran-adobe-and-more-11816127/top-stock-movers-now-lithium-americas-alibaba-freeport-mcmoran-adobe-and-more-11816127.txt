Alibaba (BABA) shares surged after the Chinese tech giant said it is planning to spend even more on AI in the next three years than the $53 billion it projected previously.
Shares of Diamondback Energy (FANG), APA (APA), and other energy providers continued to climb along with the price of oil, which rose after U.S. crude inventories declined.
Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the miner said it expects lower sales of copper and gold in the current quarter.
Shares of Adobe (ADBE) also slid after a downgrade from Morgan Stanley, which raised concerns about the software maker’s ability to monetize AI.
Motorola Solutions (MRI) shares fell as Piper Sandler warned the telecom equipment maker’s stock may be overvalued.
