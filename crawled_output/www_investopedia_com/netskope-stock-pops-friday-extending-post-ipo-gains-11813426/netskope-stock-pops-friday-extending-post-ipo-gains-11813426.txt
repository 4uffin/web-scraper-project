Key Takeaways
Shares of Netskope surged Friday, extending gains after making their debut on the Nasdaq Thursday.The cybersecurity firm sold 47.8 million shares at $19 each in its initial public offering, at the top end of its expected range.CEO Sanjay Beri said he expects going public could help Netskope boost its credibility and customer awareness.
Shares of Netskope (NTSK) surged Friday, extending gains after making their debut on the Nasdaq Thursday.
The stock was up close to 7% around $24 in recent trading, after finishing Thursday's session 18% above their initial public offering (IPO) price of $19 per share.
The IPO price was at the high end of the company’s expectations, and the 47.8 million shares sold helped Netskope raise $908.2 million.
CEO Sanjay Beri told Yahoo! Finance in a televised interview that he expects going public could help boost the company's credibility and customer awareness.
Netskope, which counts companies like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Zscaler (ZS) as competitors, reported a 31% year-over-year jump in revenue to $328 million for the six months ended in July, according to a regulatory filing. It's $170 million net loss over that period narrowed from $207 million a year ago.
This has been a strong year so far for a number of cybersecurity stocks, amid expectations the sector could get a boost from strong demand trends as AI-driven threats grow. Zscaler shares have added over 60% of their value in 2025, while CrowdStrike (CRWD) has climbed close to 50%. Palo Alto Networks shares have added about 13%, roughly in line with the S&P 500's rise over the same period.
