Key Takeaways
Google’s Waymo plans to launch its robotaxi service in Nashville in a partnership with Lyft starting next year, the two companies said Wednesday.The news sent Lyft's stock soaring Wednesday, while shares of rival Uber slumped.With Wednesday's rise, Lyft shares have gained more than three-quarters of their value in 2025.
Lyft (LYFT) shares soared Wednesday after the ridesharing firm and Google’s Waymo announced a partnership to launch a robotaxi service in Nashville starting next year.
Shares of Lyft jumped over 13%, while rival Uber (UBER) dropped 5%. Google parent Alphabet's (GOOGL) stock slipped less than 1%.
Waymo said it will use Lyft’s fleet-management services, including “vehicle maintenance, infrastructure and depot operations.” Lyft will build an AV fleet management facility with charging and vehicle service capabilities as part of the deal. The robotaxis will be first available on the Waymo app, then on the Lyft app later next year, the companies said.
Waymo has struck deals with Uber in the past as well, launching robotaxi services in Atlanta and Austin this year. The robotaxi space has also become more crowded, with Tesla (TSLA) launching its autonomous driving service in Austin in June.
With Wednesday's rise, Lyft shares have gained over three-quarters of their value in 2025, while Uber shares have climbed more than 50%. Alphabet's shares have added close to a third of their value over the same period.
