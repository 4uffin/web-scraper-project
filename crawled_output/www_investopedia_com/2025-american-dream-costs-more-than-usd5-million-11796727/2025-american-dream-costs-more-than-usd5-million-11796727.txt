Some 85% percent of respondents to Investopedia's survey indicated that homeownership is part of their dream.

Living the American Dream now costs just over $5 million dollars. That’s the lifetime household price tag Investopedia calculated for eight pillars of classic American middle-class aspiration, from homeownership and retirement, to weddings, kids, and brand new cars.
Key Takeaways
It costs $5 million over a lifetime to pay for a home, retirement, kids, a wedding, new cars, healthcare, and owning pets.To achieve the full lifetime cost associated with all eight components of the American Dream, you'd at least need to be part of a college-educated dual-income household.Every person's dream is unique to their situation. Still, Investopedia’s most recent survey finds the milestones most people deem important align with the eight categories we used to assess the cost.
Each person’s dream may differ, but Investopedia’s latest survey reveals that most people value these eight components.
Investopedia
The “American Dream” concept was first coined in 1931 by the writer James Truslow Adams in his book, Epic of America, describing the potential for all U.S. citizens to live an increasingly abundant life. As Adams wrote, “...that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement."
While millions have embraced and pursued the American Dream over the past century, the economic reality of paying for it today has become increasingly difficult for many.
The average American with a Bachelor’s degree will earn approximately $2.2M less over their lifetime than the cost of the American Dream, requiring at least a college-educated dual-income household to make it possible.
To put today’s price tag on the components of the American Dream, Investopedia’s data journalism team used the most recent data available from sources including the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Economic Policy Institute, and industry research organizations, and applied them to each of the following categories:
RetirementHealthcareOwning a homeRaising two children and paying for collegePurchasing new carsAn annual vacationOwning petsPaying for a wedding
While everyone's specific version of living "the American Dream" varies in price and components, Investopedia’s most recent survey of American adults finds that the milestones a majority of respondents deem important align with the eight categories selected for the analysis.
Retirement: (2025): $1,636,881 vs. (2024): $1,599,995
What is the right amount of money needed to retire comfortably today? The answer depends on how much it will cost to be the "you" that you want to be when you stop earning a regular income. But to afford the average annual expenditure of $63,609 for adults aged 65 and older for 20 years of retirement, you’ll need more than $1.6 million in retirement savings. That accounts for a 2.5% annual increase in inflation over a two-decade span.
Healthcare: (2025): $414,208 (not included in 2024 report)
According to our survey, access to quality healthcare proved to be among the most important components of the American Dream, with 86% of respondents selecting it as part of their dream. The $414,208 needed for access to quality healthcare is the sum of the average estimated amount one person would need on an annual basis for their entire adult life, from ages 22 to 85.
Healthcare costs rose at a 5 to 6% annual level over the past two decades, outpacing most other consumer expenditures as the cost of everything from health insurance to hospital care and medicine continues to rise. In fact, the average cost of long-term care, like a nursing home, now tops $100,000 per year, far more than most Americans could hope to afford for themselves, let alone loved ones.
Homeownership: (2025): $957,594 vs. (2024): $929,955
A steady rise in home prices alongside high mortgage rates has made the dream of homeownership costlier than ever. With the median price for a single-family home now at approximately $415,000 in 2025. Even with a 20% down payment, a 30-year fixed mortgage at 6.69% would ultimately cost the homebuyer nearly double the purchase price to pay off the home, and that’s without HOA fees and maintenance costs.
However, those statistics have yet to dissuade many Americans from wanting to own their own home.  Some 85% percent of respondents to our survey indicated that homeownership is part of their dream.

Having a wedding (2025): $38,200 vs. (2024): $44,300
More than half, or 55% of survey respondents, say having a wedding is part of their American Dream, whether they’re paying for their own, or a family member's. Interestingly, this is one category that actually saw a drop in average spending since last year. The $38,200 price tag includes the average cost of a wedding ceremony, reception, and ring.
Raising Two Children + College: (2025) $876,092 vs. (2024) $832,172
Using data from the Economic Policy Institute, Investopedia calculated the total cost of childcare for two children throughout their childhoods, including infant and toddler care, preschool through high school, transportation, and meals. If having a family and raising up to two children is a part of your dream, as it is for 78% of our survey respondents, you’ll need close to $650,000 just to cover these necessities. Costs were averaged nationally using population-weighted data from state and county sources. All figures were adjusted to June 2025 dollars using the Consumer Price Index for all items.
The cost of college is yet another component of the American Dream that has outpaced inflation, rising nearly 5% annually over the past twenty years for both in-state and out-of-state schools. While roughly 20% of students take loans or receive financial aid, the overall cost for sending two kids to college today exceeds $230,000, up nearly $10,000 since last year alone.
Buying New Cars: (2025): $900,346 vs. (2024): $811,440
Nearly three-quarters of survey respondents (72%) indicated that having the financial flexibility to purchase new cars throughout their life is a key component of their American Dream. A lifetime of buying and financing two new cars every 10 years at today’s prices comes out to $900,346. The total includes all fixed expenses for a two-car household, including monthly payments, insurance, and maintenance costs. It does not include what you might recoup by selling your car and applying those proceeds to purchasing a new vehicle. That’s nearly $90,000 more than our 2024 calculations, with inflation, pricier insurance, and higher financing costs driving the increase.
Owning Pets (2025): $39,381 vs. (2024): $36,626
Two-thirds of U.S. households own pets, and two-thirds of respondents to our survey say it’s a non-negotiable.But any pet owner will tell you there’s nothing cheap about raising animals—owning just one dog and one cat over a lifetime costs nearly $40,000. That's $3,400 more than last year due to the rising cost of veterinary care, insurance, pet food, and boarding. The total price tag assumes the dog has an average lifespan of 13 years, and the cat an average lifespan of 11 years.
Taking a Yearly Vacation (2025): $180,621 vs. (2024): $179,109
The annual family getaway is the ultimate discretionary expense, but for 71% of survey respondents, it's non-negotiable for living the dream. It’s also not cheap and is getting costlier every year. Investopedia calculated the cost of the average annual household vacation at $2,867 based on data from Allianz, and assumes one vacation per year from ages 22 to 85.
The Bottom Line
Achieving the American Dream comes with a hefty price tag—an estimated $5 million over a lifetime when accounting for key milestones such as homeownership, retirement, and raising children. While each person’s dream may differ based on their circumstances, Investopedia’s latest survey reveals that most people value these eight components as essential.
Our Methodology
The 2025 ‘Cost of the American Dream’ estimates the lifetime costs of eight major life categories commonly associated with achieving the traditional American Dream and reflects the price of a discretionary, aspirational lifestyle in the United States. These estimates do not assume that a person must—or even should—pursue all elements of the American Dream. Instead, they provide a cumulative cost framework for imagining what that dream might total. All figures are adjusted to reflect 2025 dollars using the Consumer Price Index from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics as of June 2025.
Limitations
This model estimates lifetime spending, but doesn’t evaluate whether or how individuals can afford it.  Many of the included expenses—such as annual vacations, new cars, and pet ownership—are discretionary and not accessible to many Americans.Further, lifetime estimates assume consistent patterns over multiple decades (e.g., vacationing annually from age 22 to 84), which may not reflect reality. Costs may rise or fall, and individuals may pause or skip certain life events entirely. The “dream” costs presented here are based on national averages, but costs for homes, weddings, education, and even healthcare can vary significantly by region, race, income level, and family structure.
