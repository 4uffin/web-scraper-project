The best 6-month CD rate right now is 5.50% APY, a special 9-month offer from Nuvision Credit Union on deposits from $1,000 to $5,000. The offer is good through Sept. 27, 2025. Other top nationwide 6-month CD rates range from 4.35% to 4.60% on terms of 5 to 9 months. All of Investopedia’s 6-month CD rates in this article were verified by a staff editor and are available to open as of Sept. 19, 2025.
Certificates of deposit (CDs) are great savings products if you’re looking for a guaranteed return. Once you open a CD and deposit your money, you’re locking in that interest rate—so you will know exactly how much you’ll earn by the end of the term. The more you deposit, the more you can earn. The only thing to be careful about is the early withdrawal penalty, which is typically a few months’ worth of interest. (You won’t lose your initial deposit.) But as long as you don’t withdraw your funds early, you can cash out the CD at the end of the term with virtually no risk.
In the News
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at its Sept. 17 meeting. This is the first rate cut since December 2024 and lowers the federal funds rate to a range of 4.00%–4.25%. Committee members are projecting two more quarter-point reductions before the end of the year. CD rates closely follow the fed funds rate, which means CD rates are expected to decline as the Fed lowers rates.
Below are the top CD and annuity rates available from our partners, followed by the best CD rates that we've found from our research that are available to U.S. customers everywhere:

To be included in Investopedia’s ranking of the best 6-month CD rates, the CD must have a term of 5-9 months. When different banks or credit unions offer the same annual percentage yield (APY), we rank the shortest CD term first, then the CD with the smaller minimum deposit. If there’s still a tie, we rank the institutions alphabetically by name.

Fast Fact
When asked in March where they would be most likely to put an extra $10,000, 10% of Investopedia readers said they would choose CDs, above high-yield savings accounts and paying down debt, but trailing individual stocks, ETFs, and money market funds.
How We Find the Best 6-Month CD Rates
Every weekday for over four years, Investopedia’s team of full-time staff editors, research analysts, and compliance managers use tools to collect data on more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs. We have a designated editor check all rates in articles once per day and double-check rates weekly. We also regularly add institutions as they expand their availability or we learn of new nationwide CD offerings.
All CDs in our database must be available nationwide to qualify for our rankings. We collect, track, and verify CD rates for terms ranging from 3 months to 10 years. All banks and credit unions in our articles must also be federally insured by the FDIC or NCUA. A CD’s minimum deposit must not be more than $25,000, and the maximum deposit can’t be less than $5,000.
Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify for our best CD rates articles. Credit unions may require you to donate or join a nonprofit or association in order to become a member if you don’t meet its other membership requirements (like living in the state or working in an industry). A credit union that charges $40 or more for its donation or membership requirement is excluded from our article.
