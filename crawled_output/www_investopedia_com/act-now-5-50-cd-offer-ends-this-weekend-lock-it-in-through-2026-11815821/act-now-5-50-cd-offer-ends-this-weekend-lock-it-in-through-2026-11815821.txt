Key Takeaways
Right now you can lock in a standout 5.50% APY on a 9-month CD from Nuvision Credit Union—if your application is approved by Friday.
The credit union previously listed a Sept. 27 expiration date, but then shortened the deadline to Sept. 26.
The 90th anniversary promo CD guarantees its 5.50% rate until June 2026, regardless of future Fed rate cuts.
The CD is limited to smaller balances, however, up to a maximum $5,000 deposit.
Want a longer term or a larger deposit? Our ranking of the best nationwide CDs includes rates of 4.15% or higher in every CD term.
The full article continues below these offers from our partners.
Lock In 5.50% Before This Offer Ends Friday
Until recently, our daily research into the best CD rates nationwide hadn’t turned up anything higher than 4.60% APY. But right now, Nuvision Credit Union’s 90th anniversary CD is topping the charts with a limited-time offer that pays 5.50% APY.
The CD guarantees its 5.50% return for 9 months, meaning your rate is locked until June 2026. But you can only get it if your application for the CD is completed and approved no later than Friday, Sept. 26, 2025. You'll also need to set up funding for the CD when completing your application. Note that the credit union tightened this deadline today, shortening it from the Saturday expiration date we previously reported.
Also note that there are some restrictions on this CD. Nuvision stipulates a maximum deposit of $5,000, and each person can open only one anniversary CD. But joining the nationwide credit union is free and easy.
Questions About Beating the Cutoff?
Worried about locking in the 5.50% rate before the deadline? Nuvision’s customer service line is staffed by live reps until 9 p.m. Eastern to answer questions about applications and funding.

5% Checking, $300 Cash, and One of the Top CD Rates—All From One Place
What a $5,000 Deposit Could Grow to by June 2026
A $5,000 deposit—the maximum allowed—would turn into about $5,205 by June 2026, thanks to monthly compounding at 5.50% APY. That’s more than $200 in interest in just nine months.
For a balance this size, no other CDs come close. The next-best nationwide offer is 4.60% APY, nearly a full percentage point lower than Nuvision’s deal. But if you’re hoping to deposit more than $5,000 or want to secure a longer term, our ranking of the best nationwide CDs highlights dozens of competitive options you can open alongside, or instead of, this deal.
With Rates Falling, Today’s Top CDs Look Even Better
The Federal Reserve last week made its first interest-rate cut of 2025, reducing its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point. Further rate cuts are also likely in October and December—and possibly well into 2026. If that happens, the interest you’ll earn on savings accounts and CDs in the future will almost certainly be lower than what’s available today.
That’s why timing matters. Whether you take advantage of Nuvision’s 5.50% CD, choose a longer-term certificate, or open one that accepts larger deposits, the key is acting before today’s elevated APYs disappear. With top rates already slipping, locking in now ensures you’ll keep earning today's stellar returns well into the future.
CDs + Savings: A Winning Combo Today
Thinking of sticking with a high-yield savings account instead of a CD? Savings give you flexibility, but rates are likely to keep dropping as the Fed cuts. A CD locks in your APY for the full term, which is why many savers keep some cash liquid in savings while putting extra funds into a top-paying CD.

Important
Note that the "top rates" quoted here are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is much different from the national average, which includes all banks offering a CD with that term, including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, the national averages are always quite low, while the top rates you can unearth by shopping around are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher.
How We Find the Best Savings and CD Rates
Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify a maximum deposit amount that's below $5,000.
Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. For more about how we choose the best rates, read our full methodology.
Article Sources
Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work. These include white papers, government data, original reporting, and interviews with industry experts. We also reference original research from other reputable publishers where appropriate. You can learn more about the standards we follow in producing accurate, unbiased content in our
