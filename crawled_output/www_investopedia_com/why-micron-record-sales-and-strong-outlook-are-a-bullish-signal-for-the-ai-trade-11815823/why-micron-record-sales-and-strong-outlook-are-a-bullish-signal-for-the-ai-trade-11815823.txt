Key Takeaways
Micron Technology posted record quarterly sales as the memory chip maker's data center business grew.Its outlook for the current quarter also topped estimates, offering another strong signal of AI demand.
Micron Technology (MU) shares climbed in extended trading Tuesday after the memory chip maker posted record quarterly sales, boosted by surging demand for AI hardware.
The Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) partner's shares were up over 2% in after-hours trading. They've nearly doubled in value in 2025 through Tuesday's close.
The memory chip maker reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.03 on revenue that jumped 46% year-over-year to a record $11.32 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter. Both figures topped analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha as Micron's data center business grew.
Why Micron's Results Are Significant
As a memory supplier for leading artificial intelligence chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, Micron stands to benefit from the same trends and its results can be taken as a positive sign for the AI trade.
“In fiscal 2025, we achieved all-time highs across our data center business and are entering fiscal 2026 with strong momentum and our most competitive portfolio to date. As the only U.S.-based memory manufacturer, Micron is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the AI opportunity ahead," said CEO Sanjay Mehrotra.
Looking ahead, Micron said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.41 to $3.71 on revenue of $12.20 billion to $12.80 billion in the fiscal first quarter, ahead of consensus projections.
