Key Takeaways
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week commented on elevated stock prices, remarks that reminded some market watchers of events leading up to the bursting of the Dotcom Bubble in 2000, including former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan's reference to "irrational exuberance."The current rally has repeatedly been compared to the Dotcom Bubble, when speculative fervor drove up tech stocks despite their shaky finances.Some experts note that the AI infrastructure buildout driving the stock market higher today is fundamentally different than telecommunications spending in the late 90s.
The present AI frenzy is often compared with the Dotcom Bubble of the 1990s, a parallel that some investors think was invoked, intentionally or not, by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday.
“Equity prices are fairly highly valued,” said Powell when asked during an appearance in Rhode Island about the Fed’s risk tolerance. Nonetheless, “it’s not a time of elevated financial stability risk,” Powell said.
Powell’s comment spoke to a lingering fear on Wall Street that the big tech stocks powering equity indexes to record highs are trading at unsustainable valuations. And some market watchers, including Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, heard in Powell’s comments echoes of a previous Fed chair’s ominous assessment of stock prices.
Why This Matters To You
Investors are increasingly antsy that the AI rally—about to enter its fourth year—is becoming a bubble, fueled more by speculation than by business fundamentals. Asset bubbles have contributed to past economic crises, including the 2001 recession and the Great Recession in 2008.
Powell “triggered our contrary instincts with that last statement,” wrote Yardeni in a note on Tuesday, according to CNBC. “Financial crises tend to be Black Swans, i.e., events that occur unexpectedly, especially when irrational exuberance is widespread and intensifying,” he added.
The term “irrational exuberance” harkens back to 1996, when Fed Chair Alan Greenspan asked, “How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions?”
Greenspan’s question was a nod to the Dotcom Bubble of the late 1990s, when speculative fervor sent tech stocks soaring despite slim or non-existent profits. The bubble grew for years after Greenspan's comments, and ultimately popped in early 2000 after Greenspan's Fed raised interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating.
Is This Time Different?
The AI bubble debate has cropped up repeatedly in the past couple of years. Some investors have expressed concern that tech stocks are trading at historically high valuations while companies spend hand over fist on a technology that has yet to prove beneficial for most businesses.
Some experts note that tech valuations may be higher than their historical average, but they’re well below levels that historically signal peak bubble. According to Christopher Gannatti, Head of Research at WisdomTree, the tech sector’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 30 “is not in the same zip code as the late-1990s mania,” when that ratio went as high as 55.

There may also be structural reasons for today’s tech stocks to trade at a higher multiple. “Importantly, today's valuations are supported by massive revenue bases, proven business models and enormous free cash flow generation,” says Gannatti. “Earnings power is not hypothetical; it is visible in quarterly reports and guidance across the board.”
Higher stock valuations may also be supported by the use of AI, which analysts expect to increase corporate efficiency and widen profit margins. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that AI efficiency gains and new revenue streams could generate a net economic benefit of $920 billion annually.
