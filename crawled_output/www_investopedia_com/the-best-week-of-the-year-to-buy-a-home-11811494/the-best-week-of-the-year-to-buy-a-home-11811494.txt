Key Takeaways
A Realtor.com report found that home buying conditions in 2025 are likely to hit their peak during the week of Oct. 12-18.That’s when prices are expected to ebb, listings should reach a peak and buyers are expected to face less marketplace competition.Some locations could see prime buying conditions at different times, with New York City peaking earlier, while the best buying conditions in Miami aren’t expected until early December.
The housing market has been frozen for quite some time, but the best time of year to buy is coming.
While the spring selling season has historically been the best for home sales, a new report from Realtor.com showed that this year the fall could produce some of the best buying conditions. A combination of higher inventory levels, lower housing prices and fewer buyers are expected to make Oct. 12-18 the best week this year to buy a home, the report said.
“In a year that’s been the most buyer-friendly in nearly a decade, it’s the best window of opportunity for homebuyers all year,” said Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale. “This represents a significant shift after a period of historically tight supply and intense competition that left many home shoppers priced out.”
Buyers Should See Lower Prices, More Listings
During that time, home prices are expected to come off recent seasonal peaks and drop by as much 3.4%. That could amount to a savings of $15,000 on the typical home priced at $439,450. Additionally, potential homebuyers should see up to a third more listings available on the market, while buyer demand is expected to be as much as 30% lower than at the season peak.
“Homes are taking longer to sell, with the U.S. median time on market surpassing pre-pandemic norms this summer,” the report said. “In October, homes typically spend two weeks longer on the market compared to peak season, meaning sellers may be more open to negotiation.”
Home affordability has been challenged by high prices and elevated mortgage rates, pushing sales to some of their lowest levels in decades.
Best Time to Buy Depends on Where You Live
While the third week in October will the best for buyers nationally, the sweet spot can vary in different local markets.
For example, the New York City area housing market is currently experiencing its best conditions from Sept. 14-Sept. 20, while Milwaukee, Wisc. and Philadelphia homebuyers had their best conditions earlier in September.
Other areas are expected to reach peak conditions later in the year. Indianapolis, Ind. and Jacksonville, Fla. buyers are expected to experience the best conditions at the end of October, while Miami homebuying conditions aren’t expected to peak until early December.
