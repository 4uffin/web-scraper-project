What is an ICO?
Investors looking to add new cryptocurrencies to their portfolios often look for an initial coin offering (ICO), the crypto variation on an initial public offering (IPO). Like an IPO, a company seeking to raise money can create a new coin or service to launch an ICO as a way to raise funds. Investors in turn can buy the initial coin offering to own the new token, but should be aware of potential fraud within the industry, which is monitored by the SEC for potential abuse.

Cryptocurrency ETF
A cryptocurrency exchange traded fund is an ETF that tracks a single cryptocurrency or a basket of different digital currencies, and has similar benefits to a traditional ETF—including lower cost of ownership and greater diversification. The first cryptocurrency ETF, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, started trading in October 2021.
Learn More
Blockchain
A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared and verified via a computer network. That database makes up the underlying infrastructure of cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, for a decentralized record of transactions.
Learn More
Bitcoin mining
Bitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoin by using computers with specialized chips to solve complicated mathematical puzzles. The first so-called miner to solve the puzzle can earn bitcoin rewards by running such programs using systems that use massive amounts of electricity to mine the cryptocurrencies—a process that has come under criticism because the mining process is not considered environmentally friendly.
Learn More
Digital currency
Digital currency is a form of currency that is also popularly known as digital money, electronic money, electronic currency, or cybercash, because they only exist in electronic form, versus a physical form such as paper cash or metal coins.
Learn More
Altcoins
Altcoins generally speaking are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. They share characteristics with Bitcoin but are also different in terms of how they are created and verified. According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin and Ether alone accounted for nearly two thirds of the total cryptocurrency market, with altcoins making up the rest.
Learn More
Hot wallet
A hot wallet is a cryptocurrency storage application that is always connected to your computer and cryptocurrency network, and as such they tend to be more vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches and theft than so-called cold storage methods. Hot wallets are used to send and receive cryptocurrency, and manage tokens you possess. Hot wallets are linked with public and private keys that serve as security measures.
Learn More
Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
Decentralized finance, also known as DeFi, uses new technology to remove third parties such as banks and other traditional financial institutions in financial transactions. By removing centralized control by banks and other institutions over money, financial products, and financial services, the new financial applications may lower related maintenance costs and fees charged by banks—and also increase the speed of such services.
Learn More
Virtual currency
A virtual currency is a digital representation of value only available in electronic form, and is also known as digital currency. Such cryptocurrencies can be issued by private organizations or companies and its benefits over hard currencies include fast transaction speeds and ease of use.
