[$] Canceling asynchronous Rust
[Development] Posted Sep 24, 2025 15:15 UTC (Wed) by daroc
Asynchronous Rust code has what Rain Paharia calls a "universal cancellation
protocol", meaning that any asynchronous code can be interrupted in the same
way. They claim
that this is both a useful feature when used deliberately, and a source of
errors when done by accident. They presented
about this problem at
RustConf 2025, offering a handful of techniques to avoid introducing bugs into
asynchronous Rust code.

[$] CHERI with a Linux on top
[Security] Posted Sep 24, 2025 14:09 UTC (Wed) by jake
The Capability
Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions (CHERI) project is a rethinking of
computer architecture in order to improve system security.
Carl Shaw gave
a presentation at
Linux
Security Summit Europe (LSS EU) about CHERI and the efforts to get
Linux running on it.
He introduced capabilities,
which are a mechanism for access control, and outlined their
history, which goes back many decades at this point, then looked more
specifically at the CHERI project and what it will take to apply the
security constraints of capabilities to an operating system like Linux.

[$] An unstable Debian stable update
[Distributions] Posted Sep 23, 2025 15:14 UTC (Tue) by jzb
A bug in a recent release of systemd's network manager caused
headaches for people managing systems that have a virtual LAN (VLAN)
interface on a bridge; something one might want to do, for example,
when configuring network interfaces for virtual machines. The bug
affected several Debian users when upgrading the systemd package
from v257.7-1 to v257.8-1. The updated package is part of the Debian 13.1
release, and the bug has snared enough users to cause a minor
stir—due in no small part to the maintainer's response as much
as the bug itself.

[$] Revocable references for transient devices
[Kernel] Posted Sep 22, 2025 14:05 UTC (Mon) by corbet
Computers were once relatively static devices; if a peripheral was present
at boot, it was unlikely to disappear while the system was operating.
Those days are far behind us, though; devices can come and go at any time,
often with no notice.
That impermanence can create challenges for kernel
code, which may not be expecting resources it is managing to make an abrupt
exit.
The revocable
resource management patch set from Tzung-Bi Shih is meant to help with
the creation of more robust — and more secure — kernel subsystems in a
dynamic world.

[$] Multiple kernels on a single system
[Kernel] Posted Sep 19, 2025 19:14 UTC (Fri) by corbet
The Linux kernel generally wants to be in charge of the system as a whole;
it runs on all of the available CPUs and controls access to them globally.
Cong Wang has just come forward with a different
approach: allowing each CPU to run its own kernel.
The patch set is in
an early form, but it gives a hint for what might be possible.

[$] Blender 4.5 brings big changes
[Development] Posted Sep 19, 2025 13:55 UTC (Fri) by rolandixor
Blender 4.5 LTS was released
on July 15, 2025, and will be supported through 2027. This is the last
feature release of the 3D graphics-creation suite's 4.x series; it
includes quality-of-life improvements, including work to bring the Vulkan backend up to
par with the default OpenGL backend. With 4.5 released, Blender
developers are turning their attention toward Blender 5.0, planned for
release later this year. It will introduce substantial changes,
particularly in the Geometry
Nodes system, a central feature of Blender's procedural
workflows.

[$] Extending the time-slice-extension discussion
[Kernel] Posted Sep 18, 2025 15:30 UTC (Thu) by corbet
Time-slice extension is a proposed scheduler feature that would allow a
user-space process to request to not be preempted for a short period while
it executes a critical section.
It is an idea that has been circulating
for years, but efforts to implement it became
more serious in February of this year.
The latest developer to make an
attempt at time-slice extension is Thomas Gleixner, who has posted a new patch set
with a reworked API.
Chances are good that this implementation is close to
what will actually be adopted by the kernel.

[$] Typst: a possible LaTeX replacement
[Development] Posted Sep 17, 2025 14:30 UTC (Wed) by leephillips
Typst is a program for document
typesetting. It is especially well-suited to technical material
incorporating elements such as mathematics, tables, and floating
figures. It produces high-quality results, comparable to the gold standard,
LaTeX, with a simpler markup
system and easier customization, all while compiling documents
more quickly. Typst is free software, Apache-2.0 licensed, and is written in Rust.

[$] Providing support for Windows 10 refugees
[Distributions] Posted Sep 17, 2025 13:41 UTC (Wed) by jzb
In October, consumer versions of Windows 10 will
stop receiving security updates. Many users who would ordinarily move
to the next version are blocked by Windows 11's hardware
requirements unless they are willing to buy a newer PC. The "End of 10" campaign is an effort to
convince those users to switch to Linux rather than sticking with an
end-of-life operating system or buying a new Windows system. At
Akademy 2025, Dr. Joseph De Veaugh-Geiss,
Bettina Louis,
Carolina Silva Rodé, and Nicole Teale discussed their
work on the campaign, its progress so far, and what's next.

Open Infrastructure is Not Free: A Joint Statement on Sustainable Stewardship
[Development] Posted Sep 23, 2025 15:25 UTC (Tue) by jake
The Open Source Security Foundation
(OpenSSF) has put together a joint statement from many of the public
package repositories for various languages about the need for assistance in
maintaining these commons.
Services such as PyPI for Python, crates.io for Rust, and many others are
working together to try to find ways to sustain these services in the face
of challenges from "automated CI systems, large-scale dependency
scanners, and ephemeral container builds" all downloading enormous
amounts of package data, coupled with the rise of generative and agentic AI
"driving a further explosion of machine-driven, often wasteful automated
usage, compounding the existing challenges".
It is not a crisis, yet,
they say, but it is headed in that direction.
Despite serving billions (perhaps even trillions) of downloads each month (largely driven by commercial-scale consumption), many of these services are funded by a small group of benefactors. Sometimes they are supported by commercial vendors, such as Sonatype (Maven Central), GitHub (npm) or Microsoft (NuGet). At other times, they are supported by nonprofit foundations that rely on grants, donations, and sponsorships to cover their maintenance, operation, and staffing.
Regardless of the operating model, the pattern remains the same: a small number of organizations absorb the majority of infrastructure costs, while the overwhelming majority of large-scale users, including commercial entities that generate demand and extract economic value, consume these services without contributing to their sustainability.
