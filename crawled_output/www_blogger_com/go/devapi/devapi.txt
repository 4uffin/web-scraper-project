Introduction
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
The Blogger API v3 allows client applications to view and update Blogger
content. Your client application can use Blogger API v3 to create new
blog posts, edit or delete existing posts, and query for posts that match
particular criteria.
Here are some of the things you can do with the Blogger API v3:
Add a running list of blog posts, pages and comments to a non-Blogger
hosted site.
Create browser based applications and mobile apps that enable people
to create and manage their posts from where ever they are.
Create a desktop application or plugin that allows users to create and
edit posts from the desktop.
