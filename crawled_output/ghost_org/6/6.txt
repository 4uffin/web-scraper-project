For a long time, centralized publishing platforms have had one major advantage: An integrated network that allows people to find & follow one another for greater discoverability and growth for everyone on the platform.Now Ghost has one too, but, rather than another closed network where you can only follow people who use the same platform as you – we’ve connected Ghost to the open social web.That means millions of people can discover, follow, like and reply to your posts from any supported social web client - including Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads, Flipboard, Ghost, WordPress, Surf, WriteFreely, and many more.Just as people can visit your Ghost website in any browser, subscribe with any feed reader, or receive newsletters in any email client, they can now follow your Ghost publication from any social web client.Unlike closed platforms with restrictive algorithms, open web protocols create a direct connection between you and your subscribers which you have full control over.No opaque algorithms. No suppression of links. No unhinged mechabots.If you've been around on the web for while... you might even call it the return of the blogosphere.The open network effectPublish once.Distribute everywhere.No algorithms.No nonsense.←

When we announced Ghost 5.0 a few years ago, we were proud to share that Ghost's revenue had hit $4M – while publisher earnings had surpassed $10M. It felt great to have such a clear sign that our goal to create a sustainable business model for independent creators was succeeding.Today, Ghost's annual revenue is over $8.5M while total publisher earnings on Ghost have now surpassed $100M.While the dominant narrative in the media industry today is one of layoffs and cutbacks in a market saturated with clickbait and AI — Ghost publishers, whose revenue has grown dramatically in the past 3 years, are telling a different story.These successful media businesses follow a simple model that's been around for a long time: They make money by directly serving readers, rather than advertisers.After more than a decade of clickbait undermining media credibility, subscription-based publishers are discovering a simple truth: Producing high quality content that readers genuinely value is a far better business than chasing low quality page views for diminishing ad revenue.Continue reading our 6.0 update →Launch your big ideaLast week, 11,173 brand newpublications got started with Ghost.Today, it's your turn.Start publishing now →
