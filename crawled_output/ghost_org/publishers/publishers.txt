You own the software and you own the billing account, so there's no middleman between you and your customers. Stripe takes a ~2.9% processing fee, and all other revenue is yours to keep.Building a subscription business is challenging in lots of ways. Our focus is on making the billing side as easy as possible - so you can keep your focus on your customers.Launch your big ideaLast week, 11,173 brand newpublications got started with Ghost.Today, it's your turn.Start publishing now →
