If you’re sick of wading through menus and navigating complex options that you never use, we’ve got news for you: So were we.Let’s be real here: WordPress is a popular tool, used by many people to achieve a vast number of things. But if you’re a serious publisher and you care about the experience you and your team has every day at work, you can probably do better!So what does Ghost do better?Let’s start by talking about what Ghost does the same. One of the most loved features of WordPress is that it’s open source and flexible, and Ghost has the exact same setup. The main difference is that Ghost is explicitly focused on doing one thing really well: Publishing.Everything revolves around your content!Our rich editor is designed solely around providing the best possible writing experience. It makes formatting posts a lot more flexible.You can accomplish more with dynamic cards that allow you to work with image galleries, embeds, Markdown, HTML and more – without distractions.Ghost comes with all the tools you need to develop direct relationships with your audience and even generate predictable revenue from your work.Registration forms, member management, payments, subscriptions and email newsletters are built-in: without any additional plugins or fees!"I wrote my first post on Ghost this weekend and it was a real joy. I love the markdown editor, it is exactly what I need and perfect for how I write my posts. Excited about where this will lead, Ghost feels like a great platform."Joel Gascoigne,
BufferSwitched from Tumblr to GhostGhost is more affordableWe’ve built the best hosted service in the business, called Ghost(Pro). It’s comparable to running WordPress on a fully-managed hosting service with a dedicated Content Delivery Network.You get the same incredible infrastructure and fantastic support, whether you currently receive a few thousand views or you’re already up to tens of millions. But, you get all of it at a rather more affordable price-point:With Ghost, the fee structure is simplified into a single monthly cost based on the scale of your publication. Since the software has most (or all) of the features you need to run a modern publication, you won’t need to pay for additional premium plugins like you would using WordPress."We're using Ghost's Pro service to host the blog for us. Works really well. Great writing experience compared to WordPress. WordPress is an incredibly powerful framework but because it supports the needs of so many websites and demands, it has grown into a sizable and cluttered tool."Lee Munroe,
MailgunSwitched from WordPress to GhostGhost has SEO & social built-inWhat’s the point in publishing if nobody reads your content?Ghost has the best support for search engine optimisation and social sharing features of any blogging platform in the world. You don’t need any extra plugins or extensions, and you don’t need to write any extra code. It just works.There are built-in XML sitemaps, canonical tags, optimised URLs, microformats, Facebook Open Graph tags, support for Twitter cards and clean semantic markup. All of this is done for you automatically, with no plugins needed.Thousands of businesses choose Ghost to run their websites:Ghost is fasterBecause Ghost is powered by a modern technology stack using Node.js – it’s fast. Really, really, really, ridiculously fast.Independent tests have found Ghost to be up to 1,900% faster than WordPress. What does that mean? In the amount of time it takes WordPress to respond to 1 request, Ghost will have already responded to 19 of them. The speed of your blog impacts everything, from search engine rankings to mobile user engagement.Automated publication setup with GhostGetting up and running with WordPress, for the uninitiated, can be a long process. You have to download the software, find a hosting company, sign up for a new account, and then get all your files uploaded over FTP and setup a new MySQL database before you actually get to the install process.Because Ghost offers an official hosted service, you can have a new blog up and running in the space of about 3 clicks – with exactly the same level of control as if it were hosted anywhere else. Powerful automation simply saves you a lot of time.Full-featured subscription commerceTransform anonymous viewers into members, and your most valued members into paying subscribers with Ghost. Our native memberships and subscriptions features unlock potential new revenue streams and give your more ways than ever to develop meaningful relationships with your audience.Best of all, there’s no extra downloads or fees and we don’t take any transaction fees — so all of your revenue is entirely yours to keep.$8/ monthstandard

Price per month$your annual recurring revenueHow does this work?Unlike other membership systems which typically take 10-30% of your revenue, Ghost takes no fee at all and instead connects directly to your own Stripe account, so you receive the money - not us. You own the software and you own the billing account, so there's no middleman between you and your customers. Stripe takes a ~2.9% processing fee, and all other revenue is yours to keep.Building a subscription business is challenging in lots of ways. Our focus is on making the billing side as easy as possible - so you can keep your focus on your customers.Doing more than the basicsIf you’re a developer or a business trying to build more than just a basic blog, and integrate your content and publication with other tools and workflows — Ghost has the tools you need.At its core, Ghost is a fully baked RESTful JSON API with a flexible architecture and carefully considered client applications and services to go along with it. This means it can be extended, modified and customised for your needs in an unlimited number of ways.Want to bring your favourite tools along? That’s no problem. In fact, Ghost integrates with just about anything, without the need for bloated plugins slowing down your site. It’s worth checking out our extensive directory of integrations as well as beautiful themes and the official Ghost migration plugin to get you started.tl;dr: The skinnyCut to the chase?
