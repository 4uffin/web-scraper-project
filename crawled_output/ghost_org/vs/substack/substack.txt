Price per month$your annual recurring revenueHow does this work?Unlike other membership systems which typically take 10-30% of your revenue, Ghost takes no fee at all and instead connects directly to your own Stripe account, so you receive the money - not us. You own the software and you own the billing account, so there's no middleman between you and your customers. Stripe takes a ~2.9% processing fee, and all other revenue is yours to keep.Building a subscription business is challenging in lots of ways. Our focus is on making the billing side as easy as possible - so you can keep your focus on your customers.A more powerful publishing experienceIf you‚Äôre just getting started and you‚Äôre looking for a simple platform to start with, Substack is great! But if your plan is to build a serious subscription business with real revenue, Ghost is the more advanced option with better economics for publishers.Using Ghost, you‚Äôll have access to a publishing experience that allows you to do more with your content. Enjoy powerful formatting tools and sensible content management, unlocking everything from adding images directly from Unsplash, to customising your emails by dynamically inserting subscriber names.Writing a newsletter issue in Ghost is familiar and clutter free, supporting beautiful image galleries, forms, videos, podcasts, bookmarks, Markdown and HTML.Publishers switch to Ghost because it provides a better writing experience, and they stick around because they gain ultimate control over their content and brand.The native members features within Ghost allow you to transform anonymous views into registered members, with both free and paid-only member tiers.Everything you need to get started is built-in: member management, native payments with recurring subscriptions and email newsletters. All without any additional fees!"Have been building paid membership newsletters with Ghost for two months now and ridiculously happy with the experience. It's the combination of amazing design with endless customisability if you want to have your own style. The writing interface is just SO nice ‚Äî it feels like stepping inside a high-end minimalist house, you just want to live up to the beauty of it."Uri Bram,
The BrowserSwitched from Substack to GhostBuild your brand + control your contentWhile Substack is a closed platform that you have little control over, Ghost is open source and extremely flexible. A Ghost publication can be completely customised to suit the needs of all kinds of publishers and authors.On Substack, you‚Äôre locked into a single design with some basic settings and no ability to create your own website or landing pages to promote your growing newsletter business.With Ghost you always own your content, subscriber lists and even the code because it‚Äôs completely open source. This means if Ghost the company disappears, you can continue to run your membership business in perpetuity.It‚Äôs possible to build a completely custom newsletter, like Publisher Weekly:Choose your domain, pick your own design and add your own branding. Each Ghost site is unique, and reflects the personality of its creator. Some examples:Growing an audienceThe most important aspect of any publication is understanding and growing a core readership base. Getting traffic to an independent website can be challenging, of course. But the rewards are that you physically own the content and you‚Äôre benefitting your own brand and business.Email newsletters are one of the most popular ways to build a trusted relationship with an audience. Ghost does everything you can do with Substack: Run a premium newsletter and send new posts directly to segments of your subscribers in a couple of clicks.Beyond this, Ghost does so much more to help you build a business. Everything you need to run a custom publication is baked in. SEO and social is taken care of with built-in XML sitemaps, canonical tags, optimised URLs, support for Twitter cards and clean semantic markup. All of this is done for you automatically ‚Äì leaving you more time to focus on writing!"Three months in, I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my decision to switch from Substack. Ghost is a great tool for publishing newsletters, and the community of supportive fellow writers is invaluable!"David Bauer,
Weekly FiletSwitched from Substack to GhostDoing more than the basicsAll new Ghost sites are installed with a beautiful default theme that you can get started with right away, but it‚Äôs worth having a look at the marketplace of free and premium themes, and our extensive directory of integrations.

You can easily import an existing audience to Ghost from anywhere.One last thing you should knowGhost is an independent non-profit organisation. We build publishing tools for modern journalism & publishing because we believe freedom of speech is important.

We‚Äôre in this for the long haul."For those of you on Substack: why not use Ghost instead? Is the payment you get from Substack greater than the freedom Ghost would provide?"Jack Dorsey,
