But we can help →Migrating from BeeHiiv to Ghost is easyAll content, subscribers, subscriptions and payments can be seamlessly migrated from BeeHiiv to Ghost without any disruption to your customers.Learn more about the Concierge service.Get serious with GhostBeeHiiv is a great platform for running a fast, cheap newsletter, when you’re not worried about the details. They ship lots of new features every week to try out new things, but a lot of them are expermental and (as a result) they have a tendency to break pretty often.Ghost is a more robust, stable system for independent publishers who are building an independent media company, not just running a newsletter. We ship features carefully and methodically, because publishers depend on Ghost to power their business.While BeeHiiv works well if you only really care about emails and trying out new things, Ghost is a more comprehensive product with a more refined approach to running a website, publication, blog, newsletter and/or podcast. Publishers typically move from BeeHiiv to Ghost when their business matures, they care about quality of product and support, and they want more control over their publishing system.$8/ monthstandard

Price per month$your annual recurring revenueHow does this work?Unlike other membership systems which typically take 10-30% of your revenue, Ghost takes no fee at all and instead connects directly to your own Stripe account, so you receive the money - not us. You own the software and you own the billing account, so there's no middleman between you and your customers. Stripe takes a ~2.9% processing fee, and all other revenue is yours to keep.Building a subscription business is challenging in lots of ways. Our focus is on making the billing side as easy as possible - so you can keep your focus on your customers.A more powerful publishing experienceIf you’re just taking your first few steps in the newsletter world, BeeHiiv can work well! But if your plan is to build a serious subscription business with real revenue, Ghost is the higher quality option with better service for publishers.Using Ghost, you’ll have access to a publishing experience that allows you to do more with your content. Enjoy powerful formatting tools and sensible content management, unlocking everything from adding images directly from Unsplash, to customising your emails by dynamically inserting subscriber names.Writing a newsletter issue in Ghost is familiar and clutter free, supporting beautiful image galleries, forms, videos, podcasts, bookmarks, Markdown and HTML.Publishers switch to Ghost because it provides a better writing experience, and they stick around because they gain ultimate control over their content and brand.The native members features within Ghost allow you to transform anonymous views into registered members, with both free and paid-only member tiers.Everything you need to get started is built-in: member management, native payments with recurring subscriptions and email newsletters. All without any additional fees!"Have been building paid membership newsletters with Ghost for two months now and ridiculously happy with the experience. It's the combination of amazing design with endless customisability if you want to have your own style. The writing interface is just SO nice — it feels like stepping inside a high-end minimalist house, you just want to live up to the beauty of it."Uri Bram,
The BrowserSwitched from Substack to GhostBuild your brand + control your contentBeeHiiv is a proprietary platform made for growing a fast, cheap newsletter business. Ghost is designed for professional publications, and for people who are serious about building an independent media company.On BeeHiiv, you’re locked into a basic website customizer which is limited in what it can do, no matter how much AI you throw at it. Once you hit the limits, you’re stuck. Ghost has beautiful themes and design settings built in, but if you hit the limits of those then you can always hire a developer and go a step further, because the product is open source.Being open source means that you also get to keep Ghost’s technology forever. Unlike BeeHiiv, we’re an independent non-profit org making open software that’s available to everyone. No venture capital playbook, no breathless hype. Just a long history of making careful choices and reinvesting in our users and our community.Choose your domain, pick your own design and add your own branding. Each Ghost site is unique, and reflects the personality of its creator. Some examples:Growing an audienceThe most important aspect of any publication is understanding and growing a core readership base. Getting traffic to an independent website can be challenging, of course. But the rewards are that you physically own the content and you’re benefitting your own brand and business.Email newsletters are one of the most popular ways to build a trusted relationship with an audience. Ghost does everything you can do with BeeHiiv: Run a premium newsletter and send new posts directly to segments of your subscribers in a couple of clicks.Beyond this, Ghost does so much more to help you build a business. Everything you need to run a custom publication is baked in. SEO and social is taken care of with built-in XML sitemaps, canonical tags, optimised URLs, support for Twitter cards and clean semantic markup. All of this is done for you automatically – leaving you more time to focus on writing!"Three months in, I couldn’t be happier with my decision to switch from BeeHiiv. Ghost is a great tool for publishing newsletters, and the community of supportive fellow writers is invaluable!"David Bauer,
Weekly FiletSwitched from BeeHiiv to GhostDoing more than the basicsAll new Ghost sites are installed with a beautiful default theme that you can get started with right away, but it’s worth having a look at the marketplace of free and premium themes, and our extensive directory of integrations. There’s so much that’s possible.If you’re already using BeeHiiv and thinking about switching to Ghost, check out how to get started with the Members features for subscription businesses. You can easily import an existing audience to Ghost from anywhere.One last thing you should knowGhost is an independent non-profit organisation. We build publishing tools for modern journalism & publishing because we believe freedom of speech is important. Our software is released under a free open source license, our business model is completely transparent, and our legal structure means that 100% of the money we make is reinvested into making Ghost better.We’re building a socially responsible, sustainable business which empowers people to share important stories and ideas. We’re in this for the long haul."For those of you on Substack: why not use Ghost instead? Is the payment you get from Substack greater than the freedom Ghost would provide?"Jack Dorsey,
