Type / or click + on a new line to open the card and select Unsplash:Then select an image from the enormous Unsplash catalog to use in your post. You can search to refine the results further depending on your post and exactly what image you’re looking for.Unsplash in Ghost settingsIn addition to the editor, you’ll also find Unsplash integrated into areas of Ghost settings where images are typically uploaded - such as feature images and cover images.
