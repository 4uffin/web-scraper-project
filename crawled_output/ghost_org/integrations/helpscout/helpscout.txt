CommunityKeep your customer support inboxes in sync and integrate Ghost with Help Scout – embed contact forms and live chat widgets directlyIf you’re using Help Scout to manage customer support emails and enquiries, you’ll probably want to integrate your support inbox with your Ghost publication to keep everything aligned and provide reliable ways for your customers to get in touch!Using Help Scout’s Beacons feature, you can add a contact form or live chat widget to your Ghost publication via sensible code injection. Follow this guide to find out how!Create a new Beacon in Help ScoutUsers with the correct permissions in Help Scout have access to a variety of features including Beacons:Create a new Beacon, give it a name, select a colour to match your site design and select the correct mailbox from the drop down menu:Customise your BeaconHelp Scout walks you through all of the customisation options for your Beacon and provides a handy preview of what it will look like:Once you are happy with your settings, it’s time to integrate your Beacon with your Ghost publication.Paste the HTML Code into GhostLocate the HTML embed code and copy it to your clipboard:If you would like your Beacon to appear across your entire site, you can use the site-wide code injection feature inside Ghost Admin to implement this.Hit save and you’re done - head to your site to test your new contact form or chat widget!Embed your Help Scout Beacon across multiple pagesOn the other hand, you can also insert the HTML into the appropriate template files within your theme. This is useful if you want more fine-grained control of where your contact form or live chat appears.Locate the template file where you want to insert the beacon code. It’s usually post.hbs - right after the content. In Ghost’s official themes, add the code after the line that reads {{content}}.Add custom content to a Ghost themeAfter editing, save the file, upload a fresh copy of your theme, and (if you’re self-hosting) restart Ghost. The beacon’s now visible on every post!Do more with Zapier automationConnect Help Scout to many more of your favourite tools and align all of your processes using Zapier.
