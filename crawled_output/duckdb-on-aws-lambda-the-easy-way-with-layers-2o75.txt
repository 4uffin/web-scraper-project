DuckDB on AWS Lambda: The Easy Way with Layers
#duckdb
#aws
#lambda
A few weeks ago, I faced a recurring task: every week, a batch of TSV files (which is just like a CSV, Comma-Separated Values file, but it uses tabs instead of commas to separate the values) needed to be ingested and loaded into an RDS database. Maintaining a full database for this simple weekly operation felt overkill, and the process itself was time-consuming.
It seemed like the perfect opportunity to explore DuckDB, an in-process analytical database known for its efficiency and simplicity
💡 The idea was to process the TSV files directly in a serverless environment, transform them with SQL queries, and store the results without running a persistent database.
🦆 What is DuckDB
DuckDB is an open-source, in-process analytical database often described as “the SQLite of analytics”. It is optimized specifically for analytical queries and can scan large datasets efficiently.
One of its standout features is the ability to read columnar storage formats like Parquet directly from local files, S3 buckets, or HTTP endpoints. DuckDB scans and aggregates data on the fly without loading entire datasets into memory, which is particularly useful in serverless environments where memory and compute usage directly impact cost.
Now combine that with AWS Lambda : instead of Athena queries, RDS instances, or complex ETL pipelines, DuckDB allows you to run analytical workloads on-demand in a Lambda function, paying only for what you actually use. Existing AWS services like Athena or RDS can address similar needs, but they come with different scaling models and pricing strategies. Athena, for example, charges per scanned byte and introduces query latency, while RDS requires you to maintain an always-on database.
🤯 The Challenge with DuckDB on Lambda
To configure my Lambda, I rely on Terraform to manage the infrastructure. However, I quickly ran into a major issue: DuckDB is a compiled library.
This means you can’t just pip install duckdb locally and upload it through Terraform. If the binary hasn’t been compiled for the Lambda runtime environment, the function will fail to import it. Simply zipping the code is usually not enough, due to ABI incompatibilities and OS differences.
To get around this, I had to set up a Docker container, build DuckDB inside it, copy the resulting files back to my machine, zip them, and then upload everything to Lambda.
This approach works, but it’s far from ideal for small projects or when you just need to get a Lambda running quickly. You're forced to deal with problems like installing Docker and setting up a container build process, which adds significant complexity.
✅ Solution
That’s why I decided to create prebuilt Lambda layers for each architecture, Python version, and DuckDB version, then make them public.
A Lambda layer is a convenient way to package and share dependencies across multiple Lambda functions, without having to include them in every single deployment package. This completely eliminates the need for a local build, so anyone can use DuckDB without repeating the same tedious setup.
These layers are
✅ Pre-compiled for every Lambda-supported Python runtime (3.8 → 3.13).
✅ Supports both architectures (x86_64 and arm64).
✅ Available in all AWS regions.
✅ Easy to attach to your Lambda without increasing your deployment package size.
Adding DuckDB to a Lambda function is as simple as attaching a Lambda layer with its ARN:
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
--function-name your-function-name \
--layers LAYER_ARN
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Then inside your handler:
import duckdb
def lambda_handler(event, context):
conn = duckdb.connect(":memory:")
result = conn.execute("SELECT 'Hello from DuckDB!' AS msg").fetchall()
return {"statusCode": 200, "body": result[0][0]}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Once the layer is attached, DuckDB is immediately available in your Lambda function, eliminating the need to build it from source or worry about architecture mismatches.
These layers make serverless analytics accessible: tasks that previously required RDS, Athena, or complex ETL pipelines can now be handled entirely within Lambda.
💙 The project is open-source. You can find all layer ARNs and usage instructions on GitHub.
👉🏼 Back to the Initial Problem
The original problem I wanted to solve was quite simple: every week I had to fetch a set of TSV files and import them into a MySQL database hosted on RDS.
With DuckDB, this workflow became surprisingly straightforward. Once the files are downloaded and available locally in the Lambda /tmp directory, DuckDB can both read them directly and push the data into MySQL using its extension system.
Here’s the core of what it looks like:
import duckdb
def handler(event, context):
# Connect to DuckDB in memory
con = duckdb.connect(database=':memory:')
# Install and load the MySQL extension
con.install_extension("mysql")
con.load_extension("mysql")
# Attach to the target MySQL database
con.execute("""
ATTACH 'host=... user=... password=... port=... database=...' AS mysql (TYPE mysql);
""")
con.execute("USE mysql;")
# Write directly the TSV into a table
con.execute("""
CREATE TABLE users AS
SELECT * FROM read_csv('/tmp/users.txt', header=true, delim='\\t');
""")
# Example query
result = con.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users").fetchone()[0]
return {
"statusCode": 200,
"body": f"Users imported: {result}"
}
Enter fullscreen mode
Exit fullscreen mode
Conclusion
Working with DuckDB inside AWS Lambda can feel tricky at first because of the binary and platform compatibility issues. But with prebuilt layers, the whole process becomes much simpler: you can focus on writing your Lambda logic instead of worrying about how to build and package DuckDB.
For my use case, this meant going from a manual Docker build and zip dance to a simple Terraform deployment with a ready-to-use layer. Hopefully, by making these layers public, others can save the same time and frustration.
This project also exists for NodeJS, thanks to a great initiative by tobilg, you can find it here.
