Great value for what was paid.2.0PoorLisa, Apr 2023GROSS!!! We were here with several couples so we able see many rooms to know that ours was not just a fluke. The rooms were run down, not well maintained, not clean. Broken table, tp holder, faucet. hair in shower. Will never stay here again!! For staff, had a very poor experience with the first person we spoke to at check in, but the second person was much better.4.0MediocreVeronica, Apr 2023Free parking was removed in the middle of our trip with no grace period. So we had to pay additional fees for that. Cold water went out in our floor and front desk clerk Fernando was rude and condescending when we inquired about when it might be resolved or if we would need to change rooms. His response? “ I don’t know anything about that and I can’t change your room for that”. The entire conversa...Read more2.0PoorAnonymous, Mar 2023The room looked like it was out of the 80's. The tub had mold along the walls, the TV was probably a decade old, it had an old window AC unit and a lamp hanging by a chain over the table. The very worst part was there was construction going on in what I assume was the room above me and it was so loud I couldn't even talk on the phone. It was an absolute nightmare. Luckily for me I wasn't sleeping ...Read more6.0OkayJason, Mar 2022The room was ok. There was mold in the shower along the corners. The bed sunk in which was disappointing. The view was terrible. The remote had to be aimed just so to work. The virtual assistant was unresponsive for the most part. I kept getting hounded by people wanting me to purchase a time share every time I walked by. It’s in a bad neighborhood. And the drinks were twice as much as you would e...Read more4.0MediocreKatie, Feb 2022We had to wait over 2 hours to check in. We arrived around 1am and didn’t get a room until 3:30am. They used to have self check in kiosks and I have no idea why they got rid of them4.0MediocrePiti, Nov 2021The hotel was absolutely filthy. I could smell cigarette smoke in my room through the vents, the tub was dirty, the floor was filthy. It was definitely not with the money spent. However, the staff was so helpful at check in and assisted us with the process. If not for them, this place would’ve been a nightmare.2.0PoorAnonymous, Nov 2021Walls are thin, could hear neighbors talkings and having sex very clearly. Restroom and room smelled like mildew. Pillows too thick. Cafe food was nasty.3.9PoorAnonymous, Aug 2021When I asked to have my bathroom curtain replaced cuz I had another persons blood on it, they didn’t do it. Rooms are a bit dated and standing in like for 45 minutes to get my reserved room didn’t help. Called the front desk for towels and had to call multiple times before I actually got anyone. Would just sit on hold.2.0PoorJoan, May 2021Pros (+) The food was goodCons (-) Cleanliness of the rooms and the hotel as a whole.
