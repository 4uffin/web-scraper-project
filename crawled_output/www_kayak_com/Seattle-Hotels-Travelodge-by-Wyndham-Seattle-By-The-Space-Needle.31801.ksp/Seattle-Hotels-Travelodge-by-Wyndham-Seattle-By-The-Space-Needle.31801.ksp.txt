They were also friendly and when my key card didn't work, they fixed it immediately with no problem.Cons (-) Not a huge issue, but the motel looked like it was last renovated in the late '90s. I wish that it was more up to date and that the place didn't look so old.3.1PoorAnonymous, Mar 2017Pros (+) Location is close to the space needle is the only thing this hotel has going for itselfCons (-) The hotel was old and smelled bad. I didn't even want to bring food back to the hotel since the odor was so foul. I tried asking for a refund but since I booked through a 3rd party. The staff named Zac said I couldn't get a refund if I left early. But his supervisor could probably do it he said. But yet he did not ask her to do it. I booked tues-Sunday. But left Thursday Instead with no refund. Ju...Read more8.0Very goodAnonymous, Mar 2017Pros (+) Small and simple. Had a great hot tub open all year round outside. I had one night left and wanted one with a hot tub, so that's what I went searching for and found the Travellodge at the Space Needle. Nice stay for my last night in Seattle. Also had a great continental breakfast, another thing on my wish list.Cons (-) The hallways seemed a bit dingey so it made you unsure at first, but overall was a nice stay. Good enough where I needed it to be.6.5OkayAnonymous, Oct 2016Pros (+) We loved the breakfast, l think it was very complete: waffles, eggs, sausage, cereals, breads, fruit, juices, cheese, yogurt, pastries, etc. They also have complementary coffee and tea 24hr at reception, the rooms are clean, they have a keurig with k cups which is great, small fridge. Location is great.Cons (-) It was a bit outdated, needs renovations, the ceiling noises were horrible, l could hear people walking, not so much for the walls, the windows are also thin, the bathroom has a shower not a tub, wall paper is old and gross, But it was the cheapest and l think it was worth it.6.2OkayAnonymous, Sep 2016Pros (+) Close to a lot of attractions. Price good for Seattle. Breakfast was pretty good.Cons (-) Bed wasn't great. Not the nicest hotel. Basically a place to sleep.9.4WonderfulAnonymous, Jun 2016Pros (+) The quality of the TV was excellent! Also, the selection of cable channels were excellent!Cons (-) Extremely disappointed that it was not until I arrived that I found out I would be charged over $16 a night to park my rental car in the lot. I thought I should have been told about this additional charge when I booked the room.5.7FairAnonymous, Apr 2016Pros (+) It was good location. Employees were chill. Good service overall.Cons (-) Don't charge for parkingShowing 1-10 of 3830 reviews12345...383Location200 6th Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109What's nearbySpace Needle388 ydSeattle Center0.3 miUW Medicine at South Lake Union0.3 miSeattle Children's Theatre0.4 miKey Arena0.5 miSeattle Repertory Theatre0.5 miOlympic Sculpture Park0.6 miPike Place Market0.7 miWashington State Convention Center0.8 miSeattle Aquarium0.9 mi5th Avenue Theatre0.9 miSeattle Art Museum0.9 miPoliciesCheck-in/Check-outCheck in anytime after 3:00 PM, check out anytime before 11:00 AMCancellation/prepaymentCancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.Essential information about Travelodge by Wyndham Seattle By The Space NeedleLow seasonHigh seasonAverage price (weeknight)Average price (weekend night)JanuaryJune$169$224Cheapest month to stay with an average 56% drop in price.Most expensive month to stay with an average 132% rise in price.Average Sun - Thu price over the last 2 weeks.Average Fri & Sat price over the last 2 weeks.When to book a room at Travelodge by Wyndham Seattle By The Space NeedlePrice per night.
