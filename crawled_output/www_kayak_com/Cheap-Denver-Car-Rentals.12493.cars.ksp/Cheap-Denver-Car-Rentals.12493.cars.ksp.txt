Cyclists on the road have the same rights as people in cars, so it is important to take care and be respectful when driving cheap car rentals in Denver alongside a cyclist.Aggressive driving is frowned upon in Denver, and drivers can be charged for aggressive driving or if their actions endanger another driver or pedestrian. You can make a left turn on red in Denver as long as you’re turning from a one-way street onto another. However, look out for any traffic signs that may indicate otherwise. Drinking and driving is an offense in Denver—the blood alcohol limit is 0.05% to under 0.08%, lower than in most states, and DWAI/DUI offenses incur heavy fines as well as jail time for up to 180 days in some cases. Nonetheless, remember to check with the Colorado DMV in case of any traffic law changes before getting behind the wheel of a cheap car rental in Denver.As with many bigger cities, Denver becomes congested during rush hours and navigating a car through the intersections and narrow streets may take some patience and extra concentration. Denver has a reputation for rather aggressive drivers who don’t always follow the road regulations, but if you allow extra time for each trip and double-check before taking a turn then driving should not be a problem. Be careful at big intersections on Colorado Boulevard, as they can be confusing and some drivers may not follow the right of way rules.Although aggressive driving, such as speeding and tailgating, is strictly punished, it remains relatively common on highways.

Very displeased. I rented a mid sized suv and paid in full when reserved. When I showed up they said I only paid for a compact suv. No, it was very clear what I rented. I had to pay more than double again to get what I wanted when I picked it up. I paid over 300 dollars when I reserved my car, when I picked it up it was almost another 500 dollars extra. I will never rent from this company again. I will never recommend this company. I will talk bad about this company to anyone looking torrent from fox rentals. Do not use them for anything. You've Been warned.4.0 MediocreNeil, Apr 2024Full-size SUVFirst, they said that the reservation I made had been cancelled due that I needed to pick up the car at noon. Even do I showed them the reservation where it showed clearly that I had to pick it up at 630pm. Second, because of what I explained earlier the person at the counter gave me a much higher rate than the one I reserved online. When I complained they told me they had no more cars at the rate I had reserved initially. It seems this company is not what you expect and for some reason, they want to charge a different rate than what the client gets online. The person at the counter next to me had the same issue and was upset. Therefore, I would NOT recommend renting from this company.Back1 out of 310NextAlamo8.5Very goodRead 88 reviewsCleanliness8.3Comfort8.6Pick-up/Drop-off8.6Value for money8.2One location in DenverShow locationsAlamo reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Denver24530 E 78th Ave+1 833 828 5714Monday04:00 - 23:45Tuesday04:00 - 23:45Wednesday04:00 - 23:45Thursday04:00 - 23:45Friday04:00 - 23:45Saturday04:00 - 23:45Sunday04:00 - 23:45FiltersWonderful (49)Very good (14)Good (5)Okay (3)Fair (5)Mediocre (2)Poor (10)Show reviews that mentionget the carstaff was friendlycar availablecar was cleanpick up and dropgreat experiencecustomer servicegreat servicegreat priceShow moreReviews2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jan 2025Intermediate SUVThe car was malfunctioning and we brought it to Alamo rental at the airport but they didn’t help at all.

I had to call customer service (again terrible experience) and learned that I was charged to fill up the tank and for insurance. Of note, I filled up the tank right before returning the car, and had explicitly told the rental agent on checkout that I declined the insurance. I had to be extremely assertive and go through their various antics before the customer service agent ultimately agreed to refund me for the gas and insurance add ons (I had to send proof of gas purchase which I did).

They are not located with the main rental car companies at the complex. Instead they are about a 1/4 mile away in another area. The moment you get there, it’s about the upsell. At checkout, mind you this was pre-paid, he tacked on gas and tolls. I never said I wanted either. So, then there was that.

However, renters are led to believe that the total cost is that which is posted on the website. There is NO mention of the additional taxes and fees before booking. The wait time at pick up was excessive (2 hours); the car’s driver-side view mirror was inoperable; the rear seats were wet as the car had been washed with the windows down a bit; the rear right wheel made a loud squealing sound when making turns; the car was not well cleaned at pick up. This is apparently the norm for Routes as we heard several other renters stating like experiences on the shuttle back to the airport. This company really needs to up its game!2.0 PoorJoseph, Sep 2025IntermediateThey had horrible customer service and refused to rent me a car for being a local Colorado resident even though nothing was mentioned in the rental car details online except in the smallest of fine print. They did not make it clear and then they said they would only rent to me if I paid an exorbitant fee for insurance. Very cold and frustrating experience. I walked down the road to NU car rental and they had no problems.8.0 Very goodJohn, Aug 2025Supplier choiceOverall very good. Pickup from airport was smooth. Ride to the place is a little longer than ideal but not bad. Customer service line was a little longer than I hoped but customer service was very kind and professional. Return was easy. Excellent value for money. I will definitely rent from Routes again.2.0 PoorMicah, Jul 2025IntermediateThe line to get my vehicle was very long (over 30 minutes). They pressured me into extra fees which later my insurance company confirmed I did not need. They schnookered me into a more expensive car than I originally booked. And then the car itself had over 50,000 miles and handled poorly on the freeway, enough so that I was nervous to drive at high speeds and ended up driving smaller highways instead (increasing my travel time). I will NEVER use this company again.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jul 2025IntermediateI tried to cancel because we had selected the wrong pick up location and we couldn’t access and customer support and then were charged a $35 fee, even though it said there would be no cancellation fee.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jul 2025MinivanThe wait in line to pick up my rental car was longer than my flight across the country. They had staffed two people despite knowing that over 100 people were coming to rent vehicles. In addition, they were very pushy with their own insurance, forcing people to call their insurance companies and asking employees to read through the declarations pages, so the wait was even longer. They don't answer their phone (there's not even an option to get to a person by phone, the line disconnects faster than any company I've called), and the cherry on top is that they don't do after hours dropoff for early or late flights, despite being an airport rental, and their employees saying it would not be a problem to drop off when they weren't there. The gate to their parking lot was blocked and there was no on street parking. To give you an idea, the other three car rental places on the same street all run 24 hour operations with an airport shuttle. This is one of the few places in my life I will never return to.E-Z Rent-A-Car10.0WonderfulRead 1 reviewCleanliness10.0Comfort10.0Pick-up/Drop-off10.0Value for money10.0One location in DenverE-Z Rent-A-Car reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Denver23790 E 78th Ave+1 303 375 0222Monday00:00 - 02:00Tuesday00:00 - 02:00Wednesday00:00 - 02:00Thursday00:00 - 02:00Friday00:00 - 02:00Saturday00:00 - 02:00Sunday00:00 - 02:00FiltersReviews10.0 WonderfulAdrian, Jan 2022Good price easy pickup good car easy drop off couldn’t have gone any betterGREEN MOTION 10.0WonderfulRead 1 reviewCleanliness10.0Comfort9.3Pick-up/Drop-off9.3Value for money10.0One location in DenverGREEN MOTION reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in DenverParkDIA, 25200 E 68th Ave, , Aurora+1 720 727 1369Monday09:00 - 17:00Tuesday09:00 - 17:00Wednesday09:00 - 17:00Thursday09:00 - 17:00Friday09:00 - 17:00Saturday09:00 - 17:00Sunday09:00 - 17:00FiltersReviews10.0 WonderfulTodd, Nov 2024Standard SUVFrequent shuttle pickups and friendly employee.Economy Rent a Car9.0WonderfulRead 3 reviewsCleanliness9.5Comfort9.5Pick-up/Drop-off8.0Value for money10.0One location in Denverfrom$33/dayEconomy Rent a Car reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in DenverDenver International Airport 17901 East 81st AvenueOpening times not availableFiltersReviews10.0 WonderfulJim, Aug 2025Compact SUVThe customer counter and support are superb.
