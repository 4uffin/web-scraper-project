It is too expensive for what they offer.Cons (-) NOTHING.6.5OkayAnonymous, Jun 2016Cons (-) The smell in one particular area on the way to pool three. It looked the sewage system needed to be looked at. Pool 3 side walls were not clean. The location and price were very good and I as decided not to use the facilities as much I turned a blind eye on most of the services.2.0PoorAnonymous, Jan 2016Cons (-) While I was boarding my flight to the Dominican Republic I got a call telling me my reservation was cancelled because the hotel was over booked. I was homeless in a foreign country and it was terrifying. I did eventually get alternate accomadations but it was basically the worst hotel ever.Showing 1-10 of 2483 reviews12345...249The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What are the dining options available at whala!bávaro?whala!bávaro offers buffets for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as snacks throughout the day for guests.
