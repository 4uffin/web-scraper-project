Everyday life can feel like a vacation, so it’s no wonder travelers flock there in droves to soak up the laid-back vibe. While SoCal surf culture and family-friendly attractions like the San Diego Zoo are big reasons to visit, the city has many layers. The rich history and deeply rooted Mexican American and Chicano culture make it an endlessly intriguing place with exciting art and cuisine.
The best hotels in San Diego are often places in-the-know locals like to hang out at just as much as visitors and are located throughout geographically diverse San Diego County. I've spent many a night at the bars and rooftop terraces of these top-rated hotels that include everything from a regal downtown hotel to a North County surfers' hideaway. Here’s where to stay if you want to be surrounded by nature, enjoy a more sophisticated urban vacation, or lounge at the beach and play in the surf.The US Grant, a Luxury Collection Hotel, San DiegoRank #1$218-$5,730/night326 BroadwayOne of San Diego’s most historic hotels, the US Grant opened as the city’s premier luxury property in 1910.

Grant Jr. – a successful businessman who moved to San Diego in 1893 – spearheaded the project in honor of his late father Civil War general and President of the United States Ulysses S. Grant. Harrison Albright designed the building, and it had all the hallmarks of a grand city hotel, like a palm court, an atrium with palm trees that has since been turned into a ballroom, and an elaborate dining room.The US Grant, on the National Register of Historic Places, has been updated many times over the last century and still feels current with 270 guest rooms sporting an elegant blue, gold, and white color scheme and abstract artworks.The hotel is in the Gaslamp Quarter, San Diego’s hub for dining and nightlife. Sights like Balboa Park, the San Diego Zoo, and Petco Park are all within easy reach.Check pricesCheck pricesFairmont Grand Del MarRank #2$293-$2,285/night5300 Grand Del Mar CourtThere are many fine luxury hotels in San Diego, but Tony Del Mar, just north of the city, is known for having some...Learn moreThere are many fine luxury hotels in San Diego, but Tony Del Mar, just north of the city, is known for having some of the poshest – including the Fairmont Grand Del Mar. At the Mediterranean villa-inspired resort, travelers looking to splurge will find plenty of luxurious amenities, from the Tom Fazio-designed golf course to the indulgent spa. And while it is inland and surrounded by canyons rather than a coastline, guests stay cool by dipping into the hotel’s multiple palm tree-fringed swimming pools. Families and couples can be as active as they like.The hotel has hiking trails and pickleball. Del Mar is a dream destination for equine enthusiasts with its racetrack and polo grounds and even horseback riding. And after all the activities, recommendation is to dine at the hotel’s three Michelin-starred Addison. It’s one of San Diego’s most refined restaurants.Check pricesCheck pricesEstancia La Jolla Hotel & SpaRank #3$212-$1,540/night9700 North Torrey Pines RoadEstancia La Jolla in upscale La Jolla stands out among the many hacienda-style havens in San Diego, offering a truly...Learn moreEstancia La Jolla in upscale La Jolla stands out among the many hacienda-style havens in San Diego, offering a truly serene and romantic experience. Set amidst stunning garden-like grounds adorned with tranquil water features, this hotel has an understated elegance that captivates twosomes. Duos can indulge in a massage side by side in the couple’s bungalow and eat Spanish octopus with charred lemon by the outdoor fireplaces at Mustangs and Burros, the hotel’s excellent Baja-med restaurant.La Jolla has some of San Diego’s best beaches. I recommend guests explore La Jolla Cove, a beautiful beach with abundant marine life, and Windandsea. The beach with a thatched roof palapa is rockier than the typical stretch of San Diego sand but has pounding surf and rugged beauty as a result.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Lodge at Torrey PinesRank #4$432-$1,840/night11480 North Torrey Pines RoadOne of the best hotels in San Diego, the Lodge at Torrey Pines entices golfers, foodies, and architecture lovers...Learn moreOne of the best hotels in San Diego, the Lodge at Torrey Pines entices golfers, foodies, and architecture lovers equally. The city of San Diego-owned Torrey Pines Golf Course, which has two 18-hole courses that have hosted several U.S. Open Championships, stretches out along the coastal bluffs of La Jolla right in front of the hotel. Hotel guests get priority tee times.The Lodge’s A.R. Valentien restaurant celebrates California cuisine, and dishes might include crispy quail from Debruin Farms and Marcona almond-crusted swordfish. The indoor–outdoor dining rooms look out on the 18th hole.The hotel’s craftsman architecture, including stained glass lanterns and wood-framed windows, feels like it has been around for a century but was all actually built about 20 years ago.The Lodge at Torrey Pines is within walking distance of Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve. Its rare tree species only grow in two locations in the U.S.Check pricesCheck pricesAlila Marea Beach Resort EncinitasRank #5$266-$1,682/night2100 North Coast Highway 101The Alila Marea Beach Resort is the sleek beach retreat San Diego had been missing.

One of the most authentic surf towns left in SoCal, Encinitas is where you might see a world-renowned surfer sipping coffee on Main Street before heading off to catch the point break at Swami’s.Part of Hyatt’s Alila brand, the property is upscale – it has an oceanfront swimming pool and chic guest rooms with outdoor spaces and furniture made with natural materials, but it is rooted in the community.San Diego native and celebrity chef Claudette Zepeda runs the restaurant VAGA, which has a Latin-influenced menu and sweeping ocean views. The Rob Machado Foundation of Encinitas has installed water bottle refilling stations around the resort, and the hotel’s coffee shop serves coffee from the Encinitas roaster Lofty Coffee Co.Check pricesCheck pricesLoews Coronado Bay ResortRank #6$188-$1,454/night4000 Coronado Bay RoadFamilies who go to San Diego to see attractions like the San Diego Zoo, SeaWorld, and Legoland have many hotel...Learn moreFamilies who go to San Diego to see attractions like the San Diego Zoo, SeaWorld, and Legoland have many hotel options, but Loews Coronado Bay Resort has something for every family member. The resort is on a peninsula and activities revolve around water. There’s direct access to Silver Strand State Beach, three tennis courts, and a private 81-slip marina. It’s also a short drive to Coronado Island with its coastal cottages, family-run restaurants and ice cream shops, and shimmering gold sands.The Pacific Ocean and bay views have inspired the 439 guest rooms with a calming color palette of sand, sea green, and pale gray, while the views of yachts in the marina make for a great backdrop. Staff members go out of their way to accommodate families by providing complementary cribs and sharing activity ideas. Loews Coronado Bay is also pet-friendly.Check pricesCheck pricesPendry San DiegoRank #7$239-$4,044/night550 J StreetFood lovers are spoiled for choice at Pendry San Diego in the Gaslamp Quarter.

Guests can start the day with chilaquiles and rich Vittoria Coffee espressos in the Art Deco-inspired Provisional Kitchen, Café & Mercantile, and cap off the night with a vodka, yuzu, and shiso cocktail at sultry cocktail bar Fifth & Rose.In addition to six bars and restaurants, Pendry San Diego’s many perks include a greenery-adorned spa, light-filled fitness center, and a rooftop pool with comfy daybeds and teal and white umbrellas. The 317 guest rooms have big windows framing views of downtown and the bay. The guest room décor is contemporary and preppy with whimsical blue and cream wallpaper and striped chairs.The hotel’s Oxford Social Club feels more like a lux lounge than a nightclub, but it gets some amazing artists and DJs.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Pearl HotelRank #8$143-$446/night1410 Rosecrans StreetOne of the best boutique hotels in San Diego, the Pearl Hotel in Point Loma offers a contemporary take on...Learn moreOne of the best boutique hotels in San Diego, the Pearl Hotel in Point Loma offers a contemporary take on mid-century style. The hotel’s original kidney-shaped pool is the heart of the property – but the 23 guest rooms feel classic rather than kitschy by blending natural materials and statement pieces, such as vintage art.The hotel’s jewel-toned lobby and its custom leather sectional anchors the space with glass pendant lights and marble bistro tables. Locals love congregating at the green quartzite bar top for perfectly balanced martinis. The Pearl’s restaurant, Charles + Dinorah – named for the original owners – features a fun mix of internationally influenced dishes, but there are plenty of other great places to dine nearby.The Pearl has fun events like “Dive-In” Movie Nights, where films are projected on a wall by the pool. I recommend reserving a table so you don’t miss out.Check pricesCheck pricesTower 23 HotelRank #9$276-$869/night723 Felspar StreetPacific Beach has become known more for parties than its scenic coastal beauty, even though it has accessible...Learn morePacific Beach has become known more for parties than its scenic coastal beauty, even though it has accessible beaches and a historic wooden pier. Tower23, a boutique hotel on the boardwalk, is far more sophisticated than the bars lining Garnet. The hotel has clean lines and cool colors, and guest rooms have ocean and pier views.Tower23’s excellent restaurant, JRDN, serves fine seafood, sushi, and small bites like ahi poke nachos. While the hotel doesn’t have a pool, guests can lounge on the Tower Deck with panoramic views, fire pits, and lounge chairs. While it doesn’t have a swimming pool, the ocean is just down a flight of stairs, making Tower23 an excellent choice for travelers looking for SoCal beach culture immersion. I’ve visited the JRDN terrace at Tower 23 for over a decade, and the chili mango margarita is a must-order while watching the sunset over the Pacific.Check pricesCheck pricesIntercontinental San DiegoRank #10$159-$2,106/night901 Bayfront CourtThere are good locations, and then there are great locations.

InterContinental San Diego’s perch on the San Diego Bay is difficult to beat. It’s close to the San Diego Convention Center, making it a top choice for business travelers. It’s also in the middle of the reinvigorated Waterfront. And it’s near the Rady Shell at Jacobs Park, an open-air music venue operated by the San Diego Symphony, which has hosted artists including Jennifer Hudson.Guest rooms have spectacular views of the boats bobbing in the bay. Club Lounge access, which guests can add to their room booking for a fee, offers additional perks like complimentary food and drinks throughout the day, a personal concierge, and a discreet place for business.
