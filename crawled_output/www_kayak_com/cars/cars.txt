such as Thrifty, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, Payless and more to find you the best deal.How do I find the best car rental deals on KAYAK?A simple rental car search at https://www.kayak.com/cars scans for prices on hundreds of travel sites in seconds. We gather car rental deals from across the web and put them in one place. Then on the search results page you can use various filters to compare your options for your preferred rental car type and easily choose the best car rental deal from all of the deals coming straight from the travel sites to your screen, with no extra fee from KAYAK.What is special about comparing rental car deals on KAYAK?Looking for the lowest price? We can make that happen. Our car rental price sort gives you quick access to the cheapest and/or the most expensive deals—it’s your trip, so it’s up to you. Sometimes, the same rental car deal will be available on several provider sites. All of these providers are made visible for you to choose from, but we highlight one main car rental provider based on things like customer popularity or ratings.What kind of cars can I rent on KAYAK?On KAYAK you can find deals on all types of rental cars including small, medium, large, SUV, van, luxury, pickup truck, convertible and commercial vehicles.What do I need to know before booking a car rental?Renting a car can be overwhelming, especially if it’s your first time or you’re renting in a new country. Finding the right price, understanding the add-ons and staying up to date with policy changes can be a challenge. That’s why KAYAK has produced the ultimate guide to renting a car to help you cut though the jargon and make the right choice for your rental car. Find tips and insights for how to book your rental, what car rental insurance you’ll need, how to deal with a car rental agency and what extra fees to expect (and avoid!).What is the minimum age to rent a car?The minimum legal age to rent a car depends on the country where you’re renting. In the USA and Canada, drivers must typically be at least 21. However, some states and provinces allow drivers as young as 18 years old to rent a car. In Europe and Asia, the minimum age varies between 18 to 21 years old but some agencies might require drivers to be at least 25. Keep in mind that most agencies add daily fees for renters below 25 years old.Can I return a rental car to a different location?You want to pick up a car rental in one city and drop it off in another location? We can arrange that for you. When performing a car rental search on KAYAK, simply select the option "Different drop-off". You'll then be able to enter both your desired pick-up and drop-off locations. Most car rental agencies call this option a "one-way rental" and charge a return fee.Can new drivers rent a car?New driver policies vary for each car rental agency. While some require renters to hold a driver’s license for a minimum of 1 year, others only ask for a valid driver’s license for the duration of the rental period. We recommend new drivers to confirm the requirements directly with the rental agency.Can I rent a car without a credit card?Renting a car without a credit card is less common but not impossible. Many agencies allow debit card car rentals from airport locations as long as you provide proof of return travel. Be aware that the agency might run a credit check on you and will most likely place an authorized hold on your account as a security deposit. If you plan on paying with a debit card, it’s always a good idea to check the conditions with the rental agency before booking.Can I drive cross country in a rental car?In the USA, it's typically not an issue to drive across state lines or to cross the border to Canada. However, you'll most likely pay an extra insurance fee if you want to travel to Mexico. Similar rules apply to Europe, as you'll need to cover a cross-border fee if you want to cross from one country to another. Failing to do so will most likely invalidate your car rental insurance. Crossing borders in Africa and Asia is generally more difficult and additional border documentation is necessary. We recommend always informing the rental agency about your planned itinerary.Is it cheaper to rent a car at the airport or off-site?You will generally find the best deals if you select an off-site airport location. Airport car rental agencies offer a very convenient option for renters who want to pick up a car directly on-site. However, as demand is often higher, prices also tend to get slightly more expensive. Some off-site rental agencies offer shuttle service from the airport.Search cheap rental cars with KAYAK.
