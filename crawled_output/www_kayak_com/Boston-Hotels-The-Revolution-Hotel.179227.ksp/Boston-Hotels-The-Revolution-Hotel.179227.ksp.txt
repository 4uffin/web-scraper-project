The bunk beds were great! Our room was perfect! The location was good, very close to the common and seaport. The hotel staff were especially helpful, went out of their way to help us with anything we needed at any time and made our stay even better. Joe Cornejo was especially helpful, it didn't matter what query or wish we had, he always took the time to listen and try to understand our needs, and thanks to him all the restaurants we went to were absolutely amazing, also our experiences in Boston really great. The knowledge, recommendations and advice from Joe's absolutely spot on.What are the cons of staying at The Revolution Hotel?Floor shared Bathrooms occasionally dirty. The room I stayed in was filthy! The king size room is wonky. Room view… so so badly. No parking is that really unbelievable- u have to walk 10 mn from the Hotel to go to a pay parking place $30 every 24hrs- cold weather /Rain u have to get yourself out of your need to go somewhere. The rooms were so small, it was impossible to move in the room or relax at all. No private bathrooms in the room, just a public one in the hallway. The doors were heavy and you could hear anyone in the hallway entering or exiting their room. Noise traveled through the walls, making it hard to rest. The room size was truly not standard to fit 3 adults, as promised by the website. There were no refrigerators, closets, or safe boxes. Deeply regret choosing this hotel. Never coming back! The walls were too thin, and I could hear a lot of noises from the guests next door. The room wasn’t 100% clean. The duvet had hair on it, which made us remove it from the bed and use just the extra blanket they had in the closet. Also, one of the corners in the bathroom was really full of old dust and dirt. The window didn't have blinds, so too much light came in in the morning. The walls are thin and my room opened up to the main lobby so it was noisy. The noise. Constant noise from the traffic. The rooms are not noise proof one bit so you will hear the traffic and also anything that happens in the corridor - cleaning staff conversation at night and every time someone opens or closes a door. It’s a very noisy hotel. The wifi was super slow. Separate bathrooms are not ideal, but I also understand why! Dirty, cold, old towels. Too expensive. We stayed in a king w/shared bathrooms, and in the mornings I had to go to different floors to search a free stall.What are the amenities offered at The Revolution Hotel?Daily housekeeping, Contactless check-in/check-out, Face masks for guests available, Physical distancing in dining areas, Physical distancing rules, First-aid kit, CCTV in common areas, Enhanced cleaning, CCTV outside property, Hand sanitizer in guest accommodation and key areas, Screens or physical barriers placed between staff and guests in appropriate areas, Use of cleaning chemicals that are effective against coronavirus, 24-hour security, Guest accommodation is disinfected between stays, All plates, cutlery, glasses and other tableware have been sanitized, Guests can opt-out of accommodation cleaning, Staff follow all safety protocols as directed by local authorities, Disinfection of high-touch surfaces, ATM on-site, Business center, Safety deposit box, Meeting/Banquet facilities, Express check-out, 24hr front desk, Pets allowed on request.
