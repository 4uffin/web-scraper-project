As its popularity has skyrocketed, new hotels have shot up across Music City, giving Nashville America’s most intriguing collection of hotels. With so many alluring options, finding the right place to stay can feel overwhelming, especially if you’re looking for spots near Broadway.
Nashville is a city full of personality and its hotels reflect that. Whether you’re looking for a historic luxury property, a boutique hotel carved from an old brick church, or a seriously quirky rooftop pool addition, the best hotels in Nashville have it all. I find myself in Nashville often, whether visiting friends or getting away to see the best live music in America. Here’s a look at my top picks and the unique, character-driven amenities that make them so special.W NashvilleRank #1$238-$1,191/night300 12th Avenue SouthThe W Nashville leans hard into the city’s music heritage.

Here you’ll find speakers lining the trademark Living Room lounge and murals with cartoonish depictions of the industry above the beds. The W is playful and fun, with games on the pool deck and a killer rooftop bar, Proof, lined with rare photos of rock legends.It’s got all the usual hallmarks of the W’s modern elegance, with clean-lined rooms and a summer pool scene that’s very much “the place” for beautiful people. The W is one of the best hotels in Nashville for getting a real sense of place.I love heading up to Proof around sunset, grabbing a drink, and sitting on the balcony to immerse myself in the Nashville skyline. I also like to grab a morning brew at the Barista Parlor, for my money the best cup of hotel coffee in Nashville.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Dive Motel & Swim ClubRank #2$127-$304/night1414 Dickerson PikeSet out along Dickerson Pike in East Nashville, what the Dive lacks in central location it more than makes up for in...Learn moreSet out along Dickerson Pike in East Nashville, what the Dive lacks in central location it more than makes up for in vintage cool. This rehabbed motel has designed each of its rooms around detailed themes, whether it’s the ‘70s shag carpet in the Honeymoon Suite or the wood-clad Cabin King.One of the best hotels in Nashville for unique design, rooms come with disco balls and curated playlists, so if you’re not up for the pool party outside you can throw your own fun shindig. Still, if you’re staying during the weekend, set aside some time to enjoy the pool scene.The “Swim Club” opens to the public with around $25 day passes, creating an eclectic summer pool party. At night, I like to grab an end-of-the-evening Montucky at the lobby bar, where the wood-lined walls and ‘80s cigarette ads make me feel like I’ve stepped into a Cohen Brothers road trip movie.Check pricesCheck prices1 Hotel NashvilleRank #3$284-$11,711/night710 Demonbreun StreetNobody does rooftops quite like the 1 Hotels, and Harriet’s – 1 Hotel Nashville’s rooftop bar and restaurant – is a...Learn moreNobody does rooftops quite like the 1 Hotels, and Harriet’s – 1 Hotel Nashville’s rooftop bar and restaurant – is a big reason why this is one of the best hotels in Nashville. The 1’s rooftop restaurant continues the hotel’s tradition of elevated elegance, and its firepits and fine food have become a destination for locals as much as visitors.Even if I’m not staying here, I like to stop in for at least one drink and to enjoy some of the best views in the city. That said, sometimes Nashville trips aren’t all about drinking and dining, and if you’re aiming for a healthier Music City weekend, the 1 is your best option.Here you can utilize one of the Anatomy Fitness Center’s personal trainers, or take a group exercise class. After, reward yourself with some pampering in the expansive spa, or splurge and book a night in the exclusive wellness suite.Check pricesCheck pricesGraduate by Hilton NashvilleRank #4$177-$1,159/night101 20th Avenue NorthAttention, Dolly Parton fans: if you’re in town to pay tribute to the country music legend, this is one of the best...Learn moreAttention, Dolly Parton fans: if you’re in town to pay tribute to the country music legend, this is one of the best hotels in Nashville. White Limozeen, the hotel’s indoor-outdoor rooftop bar, is a photo-op pilgrimage for Parton-lovers, with its giant Dolly bust sitting right next to the pool.The pink pinstriped rooftop is a trip, offering a scene without being too ‘sceney’ and a laid-back spot to kick back with a cocktail and enjoy the sunset. The lobby is packed with the Graduate’s usual collection of detailed art and tributes to nearby Vanderbilt University.I find it an inspiring place to work, as the open spaces, outlets at the tables, and oversized artwork fuel creativity. Also fueling creativity: coffee from Poindexter, conveniently located just a few feet from all the coworking spaces.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Germantown InnRank #5$243-$398/night1218 6th Avenue NorthFor something a little more romantic and low-key than the usual Nashvegas rager, look just off the main drag at this...Learn moreFor something a little more romantic and low-key than the usual Nashvegas rager, look just off the main drag at this fantastic 10-room bed and breakfast. Set in an 1865 home, the Germantown Inn gives each room a unique design inspired by presidents and historical figures.It’s not your typical staid, historic inn though. Here, walls are adorned with pop-art paintings of James Buchanan and John Adams, letting you know right away this is no stuffy New England B&B.The downstairs William Taft bathroom is a must, which you can visit whilst enjoying the nightly charcuterie happy hour in the main living room. And while chatting with your fellow guests is fun, my advice is to get out and explore Germantown, one of Nashville’s hotter neighborhoods for locals.The nearby Germantown Pub is an under-the-radar gem, with chicken tenders that are a spicy-sweet departure from the traditional Nashville Hot.Check pricesCheck pricesHutton HotelRank #6$100-$775/night1808 West End AvenueJust so we’re clear, I’m not an aspiring musician moving to Nashville to pursue my dreams. But if I were, I’d...Learn moreJust so we’re clear, I’m not an aspiring musician moving to Nashville to pursue my dreams. But if I were, I’d probably stay at the Hutton Hotel, one of the best hotels in Nashville just a few blocks off Broadway. Aside from its proximity to Honky Tonk Row and its on-site music venue Analog, it’s also got a special writer's studios designed by Dirks Bentley and One Republic’s Ryan Tedder.The rooms come with guitars (either Gibson or Martin) and separate rooms for laying down guitars and vocals. Even if you’re not trying to cut a record, the Hutton Hotel is still one of the best hotels in Nashville since there are usually a ton of musicians staying here, so the creative vibe is strong.You can even borrow a Fender and take it to your room if the abundance of bands gets you inspired.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Hermitage HotelRank #7$359-$2,996/night231 6th Avenue NorthThe undisputed granddaddy of luxury hotels in Nashville is The Hermitage, which has been among the best hotels in...Learn moreThe undisputed granddaddy of luxury hotels in Nashville is The Hermitage, which has been among the best hotels in Nashville since 1910. The Beaux Arts building is a designated landmark and it just got a huge renovation to keep it feeling fresh and modern. Though make no mistake, the Hermitage is still full of Gilded Age grandeur, where ornate ceilings and white marble dominate the lobby with old-world brilliance.While I’m not one to say you’ve got to eat at a hotel to truly experience it, I make an exception at The Hermitage. The restaurant and coffee shop come from renowned chef Jean-George Vongerichten, his first venture into the American Southeast. Book at least one meal at Drusie & Darr and see what the Michelin-starred master can do with Tennessee cuisine.Check pricesCheck pricesVirgin Hotels NashvilleRank #8$156-$1,236/night1 Music Square WestVirgin always does things a little differently, and its hotel less than a mile from Vanderbilt is no exception. The...Learn moreVirgin always does things a little differently, and its hotel less than a mile from Vanderbilt is no exception. The innovative “chamber” room design lets you turn a standard hotel room into a two-room suite by moving a pocket door. So, for example, if I have to work in the morning and my guest likes to sleep in, I can set up a separate workspace without disturbing them.Of course, this is the Virgin Hotel, so it’s unlikely you’ve come to work anyway. At least, that seems to be the overriding spirit, as everywhere from the lively Commons Club to the red-striped rooftop pool makes you feel like you’re remiss without a cocktail in hand.There’s usually live music or a DJ playing somewhere, and while I wouldn’t necessarily stay here for a peaceful break, the Virgin is undeniably fun and certainly one of the best hotels in Nashville.Check pricesCheck pricesThe RussellRank #9$159-$478/night819 Russell StreetSleeping in church was highly frowned upon as a child.

But that’s all part of the charm at The Russell, one of the best hotels in Nashville. This East Nashville treasure is one of America’s great testaments to upcycling, where you’ll find headboards made from old church pews and stained-glass windows throughout.All of the 23 rooms are different, so you can stay here on multiple occasions and never have the same experience. The old brick church is bursting with color, filled with furniture in bright golds, blues, and reds. Families should opt for a bunk bed suite to maximize value.I’m particularly partial to the skylight rooms, carved out of the old church attic with views up into the sky. Another reason this is one of the best hotels in Nashville: the owners donate part of their proceeds to help the homeless.Check pricesCheck pricesThompson NashvilleRank #10$171-$1,695/night401 11th Avenue SouthThe Gulch has seen a glut of new hotels open up in the past few years.

Not surprising, since the Broadway-adjacent neighborhood is the best place in Nashville to stay when you want to be close to the action, but not disturbed by it.The Thompson is one of the area’s best new hotels, and I like to stop into Marsh House for the oyster happy hour, where you can snag shellfish for around $1.50 each (and make a meal out of it if you’re enterprising).On the roof, L.A. Jackson will surprise you with smaller live music acts as good as the stuff you’ll find on Broadway – only the show here comes with a panoramic view.If you must hit Music Row, you’ll be there in under 15 minutes by foot, which means it’s easy to leave that chaos behind when you want a good night’s sleep.Check pricesCheck pricesBooking InsightsKAYAK’s insights for hotels in NashvilleDiscover seasonal trends, ideal booking windows, and other data-driven tips to plan your stay in Nashville with confidence.How much does a hotel cost in Nashville?The average price of a double room in Nashville is $234 per night.
