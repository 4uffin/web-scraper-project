But the fact that we didn't have to go elsewhere made all the difference and the guy at the desk was super nice!10.0 WonderfulAnonymous, Feb 2025Intermediate SUVThe price I was quoted was exactly what I paid. There weren't a lot of minivan options, but the one I rented got me across the whole U.S. Easy pick up and drop off.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Oct 2024EconomyI waited for 1.5 hours at the rental office. I was seen fairly quickly but the paperwork process took forever. When I finally got my vehicle, there was a low tire pressure warning. I mentioned this to the attendant at the rental office but she said they couldn't fix it. So I went to a nearby gas station to get more air. But as I was driving off the warning light came back on and I could hear a hissing coming out of the tire. There was clearly a tear in the tire. They offered me another vehicle but that then took more time to process that paperwork. The car was clean but overall a bad experience.10.0 WonderfulChanaka, Sep 2024Supplier choiceThere was a very long line at the counter but was able to go directly to the car since I have Avis Preferred. If not, it would likely have e taken an extra hour to get the car.4.0 MediocreAnonymous, Sep 2024Supplier choiceI had to wait in a line that took longer than an hour to get to the front desk. Then they didn’t have the car I reserved and they gave me a Tesla. I feel like it should have come with a quick tutorial video, you know in case the windshield fogs up while driving over the bridge and THERE’S NO FREAKING CONTROLS! Everything is on a screen.

There was an option to pay $30 to skip the line but that resulted in an error message. I eventually cancelled the reservation and walked right up to a different counter2.0 PoorCharles, May 2025Pickup truckVery poor overall. After booking with you we noticed immediately the pick up and drop off times were way off.

Couldn't figure out if I had rented with thrifty, Hertz, kayak, or Expedia. Failure to provide me a working confirmation number. Vehicle was different from what I specifically rented. Telephone operator non existent at either San Diego international and Portland international. Customer service non existent. Can't login and make changes online because confirmation number didn't work (this is a recurring issue since I can remember, every time I reant through a third party). I paid for prepaid gas when I picked up the vehicle then when I returned it, the tech had showed me that they never added it or charged my card for it. I'm not even done with my list but this is taking too much time. Good luck.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Aug 2024Full-sizeI booked through Expedia. Not clear it was no cancel or no change. Had to change dates. Not allowed. Expedia customer service didn’t help, and Thrifty was greedy and short sighted. So I never picked up the car in Portland BECAUSE I WASN’T THERE because I moved my trip by three days to 8/24-26. So I’ll never rent from Thrifty ever again and never through Expedia either. Kayak also suspect. Lost like $290 and had the pleasure of getting all the helpful reminders over the last several days about the car I was not picking up nor returning but I was paying for. Terrible experience. So stupid as I rent a lot of cars and you or thrifty will not be beneficiaries of that. Haven’t been this irritated about travel in decades. Such a short sighted decision. I’ll enjoy my Sixt rental tomorrow and every other time I rent from now on.Back1 out of 30NextHertz5.7FairRead 149 reviewsCleanliness6.6Comfort6.6Pick-up/Drop-off5.7Value for money5.95 locations in PortlandShow locationsHertz reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Portland12136 Se Stark Street+1 503 772 4750Monday08:00 - 13:00Tuesday08:00 - 13:00Wednesday08:00 - 13:00Thursday08:00 - 13:00Friday08:00 - 13:001441 N.e. 2nd Avenue+1 503 282 2644Monday08:00 - 13:00Tuesday08:00 - 13:00Wednesday08:00 - 13:00Thursday08:00 - 13:00Friday08:00 - 13:00Saturday09:00 - 12:00330 S.w.

Someone else confirmed there was no vehicle waiting anywhere. She booked me with another vehicle.
