This means that if you have a few hundred dollars and want to live like you’re in a music video for a few hours, Miami can make that dream come true. The city boasts plenty of exotic car rental agencies, many located right near the airport or in South Beach. Miami also has all the usual car rental companies right at the airport, who offer everything from compact economy cars to luxury sedans and SUVs. Your best bet is to poke around on KAYAK and see who has the car you’re looking for.Where to get a car rental at Miami International AirportMiami International Airport’s rental car center is...Learn moreMiami International Airport’s rental car center is conveniently located in the Miami Intermodal Center, accessible via the MIA Mover from the main terminal. Follow the pink signs in baggage claim and take an elevator to the third floor, cross a small sky bridge, and listen to the sound of chirping birds. This is the soundtrack of the MIA Mover’s airport station, where trains arrive every minute or so. Take the train over to the Intermodal Center, and most rental car companies are just a few steps from the train. Some offsite exotic and discount car rental agencies run shuttles from the Intermodal Center to their lots.Is it possible to rent a car in Miami and drive elsewhere?Of course, it is.

The tolls are payable via a SunPass, which rental car companies will rent you for varying...Learn moreMiami, and most of Florida, is filled with toll roads. The tolls are payable via a SunPass, which rental car companies will rent you for varying fees. Some will charge you a flat rate per day for all the tolls you can rack up. Some will charge you a fee per toll, plus the toll charge itself. If you don’t agree to rent their SunPass, you’ll be charged via toll-by-plate, which incurs a hefty administrative charge from the rental car company for every toll you go through.
If you’re planning to drive much around South Florida, renting a SunPass from the rental car company is probably a good idea. Even the expressways from the airport to South Beach and Downtown have tolls, so you’ll be paying one way or another.What you should know about driving in MiamiDriving in Miami can be challenging, especially if you are not used to the local conditions.

The hot climate and diverse mix of drivers from various places can make the roads seem chaotic at times. However, with a bit of caution and awareness, you can navigate the roads safely.
It’s worth noting that turn signals are not always used, so it’s important to be vigilant and anticipate sudden lane changes. Some drivers may also merge into traffic without warning, so it’s essential to keep a safe following distance. Occasionally, traffic may be delayed due to accidents or incidents on the road, but this is not uncommon in any city.Parking your car in MiamiMiami, and Miami Beach especially is filled with areas deemed residential parking only.

Read signs word for word and think long and hard about whether parking there is legal. If it’s not, you will be towed almost immediately, and end up paying anywhere from $250-$500, in cash, to get your car back.
Beyond that, most parking spaces are payable through the PayByPhone, ParkMobile and ParkME apps, which you can download via a posted QR code.

This is because, with a car from one of the reliable and cheap car rental companies in Miami, you’ll be able to move from one destination to another faster than if relying on public transport. Fairchild Tropical Botanical Garden and The Bass are among the most popular destinations in Miami. If you choose to cover the 9 miles that separate these destinations aboard connecting passenger buses, it'll take 30 to 45 minutes to complete your journey. However, with a rental car, you’ll only take 15 minutes.Miami is one of the most populous cities in the USA. So, it’s no surprise that it normally has heavy rush-hour traffic from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. throughout the week. If you get caught in traffic during either of these periods, you may not be able to visit all the destinations you’d like to. Therefore, it’s advisable that you travel to the destinations you’d like to visit before or after the stated rush hours. If you have to drive your rental car during rush hour, try to avoid the Palmetto Expressway, I-95, Florida’s Turnpike, and the US-1, as these highways experience the worst rush hour traffic in the city.The State of Florida has many highways with tolls including the Airport Expressway (State Road 112). These toll roads require prepayment on what is called a SunPass and can add unexpected extra costs to your travel if you don’t research in advance. To avoid these expenses, look closely over the conditions of your car rental and choose the company with the policy that best suits your needs.Be careful when planning your driving routes through downtown Miami, as rush hour can cause significant traffic congestion along major roads. Major expressways such as the I-95, US-1, and 836 (Dolphin Expressway) will be clogged up between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. - 7:30 p.m. Your driving experience around downtown will be much quicker and enjoyable if you avoid Biscayne Boulevard, Collins Avenue, and Ocean Drive during the peak periods of traffic.Car rental in Miami is a must if you want to fit into the glitz and extravagance known as the Magic City. Don Johnson and Philip Thomas were never seen driving a suburban car, much less catching public transport, and neither should you!

It was a very last minute booking as Enterprise majestically f**ked up by not having any vehicles whereas we had a reservation .... (literally just like a Seinfeld episode). So we booked a car with Easirent, and not only it was fairly priced, but they also were super friendly and effective at the location, but the car was quite decent, and there were no hidden fees. Of course, if you don't have insurance coverage already, that's an extra, as well as the daily toll fee thing (but that's the case for ANY rental car these days). But we really only paid what we booked for ($42 for one day), plus the $14 daily toll fee (unlimited tolls, was worth it for our itinerary). Returning the car was equally as easy and quick as picking it up, and everyone was efficient and nice. Well done Easirent. One note on the location: while this did not matter to us, the location in a run-down industrial sketchy neighborhood in the "burbs" of the airport may be a little shocking or dissuading for some people, and especially tourists. But it's actually very close to the airport (10min walk to the airport train station), and we never felt unsafe while walking. It's just not a fancy neighborhood.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Oct 2024IntermediateFirst of all I booked a convertible, but when I was there it turned out there was no any. So I had a rebook a new car, which was usual.

Take this as a good reminder to always read the fine print because we were totally surprised by it which sucked! BUT it was worse that the attendant chose not to mention that we had the choice to use our own insurance but it just came with a higher deposit which we totally would have done had we been given the option Smh. They also have a Ridiculous policy regarding tolls, which was also clearly designed to take people’s money and scare them into giving their money up. These surprises alone made us uncomfortable using the car the entire time we had it, feeling like the company was shady and not knowing what to expect from them when we returned it, but then the car also had an unpleasant smell that we were concerned would seep into our skin and clothes. There was also a stain on the seat. We actually ended up returning the car early just so that we didn’t have to deal with it or any other tricks the company may have had up their sleeves. The stress and discomfort from the beginning made it not worth the slightly lower cost to rent and brought down the overall value for the price for us.

And tolls? they wanted to charge us 25 dollars (plus the cost of the actual tolls, obviously) for every time we would take a toll road... that's crazy! basically we were forced to purchase "unlimited tolls" for 200 dollars, something never heard of. Besides the extortion, we had to wait well over 1 hour at the car pickup before victorycar empoyee picked us up. And they knew we had been standing there since second 1, because they immediately replied to out whatsapp messages. The car was fine, but the overall experience was bad.Irent Car Rental2.0PoorCleanliness6.0Comfort8.0Pick-up/Drop-off2.0Value for money2.03 locations in MiamiCar rental locationsLocations in Miami1717 N bay-shore Dr+1 305 608 8691Opening times not availableMiami AirportOpening times not availableSouth Royal Poniciana Blvd 1111, Miami
