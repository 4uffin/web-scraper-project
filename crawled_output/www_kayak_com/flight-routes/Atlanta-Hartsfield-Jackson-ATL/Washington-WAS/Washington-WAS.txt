The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!10.0 ExcellentG, Sep 2025LAS - ATLRead more Southwest reviewsI wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.Cramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightCrew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delayed due to thunderstorms and no in-flight service due to rough weather — both of which are out of Delta’s control. Flight was good overall.There was supposed to be a meal served, but there wasn’t and the major toilet was out of orderAlways good but we must do something about people in rows ahead of you that don't put their seats back up when they are suppose to. And It's rough to not be able to even lean over to get something out of my purse.Did not know my son and I had different seating arrangements. He was fine, but it was disappointing.Overall, it was okay. Seat was a little cramped. Would’ve liked more substantial snacks or opportunity to buy some.I was with one of the last zones to board. It was kind of annoying to finally get called to board and my whole section was already on the plane. Clearly they boarded with previous zones. So by the time I got on board, there were no spaces for my luggage above my head. I had to put my luggage 4+ rows behind me, which meant that I had to wait even longer to get off the plane, since I had to wait for those rows to clear the aisle before I could retrieve my luggage and exit the plane. This also held up the plane cleaners, as they couldn't service my row until I cleared it, so they were all standing there waiting for me, while I'm standing there waiting for the other passengers to clear the aisle. Anyways, I wasn't in a rush this time, so I just waited, but I could see that being a problem in the future. Now, I could have checked my luggage, of course, but coincidentally, a friend of mine on the same flight got their luggage damaged (wheel completely knocked off) and was told by the Baggage Attendant in the airport that Delta doesn't "cover wheel damage" on luggage. This was disappointing to hear. I'm glad I didn't check mine through. If it were my luggage, I'd be highly frustrated to hear that. It makes me not want to check my luggage in the future.Great flight. On-time, comfortable, clean aircraft, and offered snacks pre-flight to plan for a potentially turbulent route. I wish there was Wi-Fi an all Delta Aircrafts but for a short flight this is not much of a problem.Delayed in taking off because no flight crew. The in seat entertainment was working properly.Flight was delayed for 5 hours because crew didn’t have enough time to rest - this seems like it could have been avoided with better scheduling. Food was not good.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.Overall, it was good. I was seating next to a wonderful lady and did not notice how time flew. ThanksThis is the best united airlines flight that I took. The crew was very friendly and the food was tasty!It is clear that someone knew, and competent, is in charge of food at United Airlines at least for the international flights. I was flying in coach, but the choices of the dinner were excellent. Tasty, and appropriate size. I had the beef, which was a little bit like a shepherds pie, and it was good. Nothing comparable has been served on a United flight in years. It will not be confused with three star food, but it is very good for airline food. Even better was the breakfast choice between a cinnamon roll and a breakfast sandwich. I chose the breakfast sandwich which was absolutely delicious and which I would happily order again at my local Starbucks or Panera. It is clear that someone knew indifferent is in charge of the food and it’s about time.Had one staff that was not pleasant. Seems they are stressed with too many people to care for.I would have liked an opportunity to move to a different seat ( even would have checked in my hand luggage)as I had health issues where I didn't have to clamber over the passenger next to me to for toilet use/ movement [ She was a highly unpleasant neighbor to sit next to]. In addition, I found that my European phone plan had run out of data and so I was not receiving emails from yourselves on airport wifi to be able to check in online and verifications difficult as did not accept the ticket number I had. I asked for an extra blanket but was told there was none. Then I saw other passengers receiving them. I couldn't eat the food and asked for snacks : Stewardess said " on the way" but they did not bring. The best bit was the check in process in Lisbon. Very efficient. However, I did not understand why we had to collect our bags at Washington then go through customs again. It was not explained. I also with my leg and health issue had approximately mile walk to the gate ( which then changed) . There appeared to be no moving walkways or help provided.The attendant were friendly. I suggest you have a medical attendant on board every flight so that in case someone is sick , he/she will help them.We had a very long diversion and our food voucher didn’t work because the restaurants were closedCramped seat even in economy plus seat 10A. Over booked flight, no space for the bagsFlight was canceled without warning, gave credit that is hard to access. Awful airline.Flight was cancelled without warning close to flight date. Stuck witha credit has to buy a new ticket from another airline in either to get to location. Email cancelling was lost in mail.Don't board the plane and have us sit for 2 hours and go nowhere!Flight was good and on time. Everyone was nice. Seats aren't very comfortableDidn’t like that we weren’t even offered a water. And really didn’t like the male flight attendant, he had major attitude. The flight however was good, pilots got us there in time safely.The seats are too small the plane makes weird noise when landing 🛬I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm.

Very unhappy and very poor service.Spirit rescheduled a 4:30 PM flight to 8:52 AM. That's ridiculous and borderline fraud.Everything was fine. I'm average height and I pack light. I'm ready for my Spirit flight.Frontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone.
