Staff was outstanding!!10.0 ExcellentG, Sep 2025LAS - ATLRead more Southwest reviewsI wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.The quality of Southwest Airlines continues to degrade each time I fly with them. If it were not for the free luggage, I would probably choose another airline. Their prices are a little bit competitive, but way too high for the quality of the service. Southwest is not unique in this way. Domestic flight in the United States of America has continued to be a lower and lower quality product. Very sad when you compare the quality of domestic airlines to that of many international airlines around the world.I'm not a fan of Southwest's model. I don't like the herding style of boarding.It is southwest seat was ok. Not the most comfortable seatPlz don't take away free bags and free seatingCramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightCrew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delayed due to thunderstorms and no in-flight service due to rough weather — both of which are out of Delta’s control. Flight was good overall.There was supposed to be a meal served, but there wasn’t and the major toilet was out of orderAlways good but we must do something about people in rows ahead of you that don't put their seats back up when they are suppose to. And It's rough to not be able to even lean over to get something out of my purse.Did not know my son and I had different seating arrangements. He was fine, but it was disappointing.Overall, it was okay. Seat was a little cramped. Would’ve liked more substantial snacks or opportunity to buy some.I was with one of the last zones to board. It was kind of annoying to finally get called to board and my whole section was already on the plane. Clearly they boarded with previous zones. So by the time I got on board, there were no spaces for my luggage above my head. I had to put my luggage 4+ rows behind me, which meant that I had to wait even longer to get off the plane, since I had to wait for those rows to clear the aisle before I could retrieve my luggage and exit the plane. This also held up the plane cleaners, as they couldn't service my row until I cleared it, so they were all standing there waiting for me, while I'm standing there waiting for the other passengers to clear the aisle. Anyways, I wasn't in a rush this time, so I just waited, but I could see that being a problem in the future. Now, I could have checked my luggage, of course, but coincidentally, a friend of mine on the same flight got their luggage damaged (wheel completely knocked off) and was told by the Baggage Attendant in the airport that Delta doesn't "cover wheel damage" on luggage. This was disappointing to hear. I'm glad I didn't check mine through. If it were my luggage, I'd be highly frustrated to hear that. It makes me not want to check my luggage in the future.Great flight. On-time, comfortable, clean aircraft, and offered snacks pre-flight to plan for a potentially turbulent route. I wish there was Wi-Fi an all Delta Aircrafts but for a short flight this is not much of a problem.Delayed in taking off because no flight crew. The in seat entertainment was working properly.Wish they had the seat-back video screens for watching movies or playing games.Very good but wish they had the seat-back video screens for movies & gamesFlight was delayed not sure why no explanation given and no apologies either. Otherwise the flight was fineWhile waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.Flight delays numerous times. Everytime we would get close to boarding it would be delayed again. Strung along the entire time.Initial flight was cancelled at the time of arrival to the airport, flight alternative requires switching from direct to flight with a layover, and the plane felt like it would split apart, it was so rattle-y.This flight never occurred because AA couldn’t get their act together.During service there was a garbage/beverage spill near our seats that never was cleaned up. On a relatively short flight when we’re fortunate enough to actually have in flight movies available, the flight attendants pitching the AADVANTAGE credit card shouldn’t talk for the last 10 minutes of the flight so that we miss the end of the movie.Everything was great except British airways lost our luggage that was gate checked all the way through to Italy. No one knows currently where one is and the other one may be in route to Amsterdam to meet us but not sure. If you can Hale’s it would be awesome. The website is not helpful.Waited on the runway for takeoff for 2.5 hours. Air traffic rerouted us. The plane didn't have enough fuel, so had to go back to the gate. Had to wait for a new pilot. Should have landed at 5:22. Didn't land until 9:10. Trash flight.My initial flight got overbooked whilst waiting at the gate, and they rebooked me on a later INDIRECT flight!. No offer of a refundDon't board the plane and have us sit for 2 hours and go nowhere!The seats are too small the plane makes weird noise when landing 🛬I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance.

Very unhappy and very poor service.Everything was fine. I'm average height and I pack light. I'm ready for my Spirit flight.Wow truly top notch airline Efficient nice snacks courteous staff Fast boarding !My experience with Spirit was good, but the experience with Kayak was not. Based on the Spirit agent Kayak added an additional charge after purchasing the tickets. When I buy the tickets I paid the total amount and I only pay once. This time they added an additional charge because based on Spirit they partially charge the tickets and I still needed to pay a second time. This is not good at all and UnprofessionalSpirit gets such a bad rap. I have never had a bad experience with them and the crew is always friendly and funny. This trip I had knee replacement surgery surgery 10 weeks ago. It is still a little rough to get get from point a to point b. And Spirit was on top of it. When there was a seat available the stewardess asked me if I wanted to move to an open seat so I could elevate my leg on the empty seat? 5 stars all around. They helped me on and helped me off the plane. I can’t say enough about the crew!!This gate agents are always so rude! I stopped flirting with spirit years ago for that reason I thought it would change by now. It’s so tacky they try to treat you like a school child i hate itFrontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.My first flight was delayed 5 hours. The 2nd flight was canceled til the next day and the never even tried to compensate for it. Worse I was delayed again on the flight the rebooked me on.I was 2 hr arrive in the airport and 45 min in the line . After take to my turn . The agent tell me I’m later . I can not board . So my vacation was going to the floor . Just for their bad customer service agent in the airlineMy flight was canceled I was promised a reginf still not received.2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.They canceled flight. Hard to believe there was even a plane incoming for us to get onSince you have to pay for overhead bags then they shouldn't be running out of space and asking individuals who paid to remove stuff from the overheadBook with frontier airlines with the mentality that they'll cancel your flight, kick you off and lose your luggage. Anything besides that is a win. Compare prices with other airlines (to include luggage) and if frontier is still worth it, book it but know all of their policies.You get what you pay for nothing essentially but a hard uncomfortable seat that doesn’t recline and kids screaming all around you and chaotic boarding and limited check bag weight allowance when compared to other airlinesSouthwest8.0Delta7.9American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Atlanta to FloridaAirportsCabin classComplete your tripFlights to other citiesOriginsPopular routesReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsAtlanta (ATL)Cabin class types available on flights to FloridaCabin classes available on flights to Florida.
