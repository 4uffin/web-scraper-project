Luckily it wasn’t a long flight6.0 GoodAnonymous, Sep 2025ATL - MDWRead more Delta reviewsCramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The airport was reasonably clean. The boarding process reasonably efficient. The cabin crew was efficient, polite but not that friendly. The food quality was unremarkable and the choices were awful . There was either a so so chicken dish or a “ vegetarian “ option which was really cheap carbohydrates drowned in cheese. Signing onto i flight wifi was not straightforward. Overall it was a very average experienceThe staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Avelo provided exactly what I expected. They are a low-cost option with no frills but the experience was comfortable and the staff was great! I will be using them in the future for trips when cost is a priority for me.Expect nothing and you will be fine. Seats are crammed.Terrible landing. Uncomfortable seats. Great cabin crew-helpful and pleasant!Tight fit in middle seat but OK for short flight. Crew was more interested in talking to each other than helping passengers - strickingly dissappointing. DAB is a great airport. New Haven sucks! Excellent value for the .Avelo is definitely a budget airline and you get what you pay for. The plane was packed and the seats were not particularly comfortable. Staff was very nice and both of our flights were on time. The one thing I wish I had known was that the staff does not show up at the airport desk to check your bags until two hours before the flight. We had a 4:30 flight and had to check out of our hotel at noon. Since we have lounge passes we planned to check our bag, go through security and hang out at the lounge until we had to board. But because we could not check our bag until 2:30, when the staff showed up, we could not go through security and access the lounge. Passengers with boarding passes and carry on luggage would not have this issue. I might fly Avelo again but would only do carry on or plan to get to the airport no sooner than two hours before check in. And I would not recommend a long flight on Avelo since there is no food or entertainment and the seats are not comfortable.No food or entertainment, but flight very comfortable and on time.Baggage claim was barbaric at Wilmington. I realize that this is a startup airline but if they hope to grow or even survive they need to upgrade this airport. There is no automated luggage carousel and at times you are not only fighting your fellow passengers to get to your bags but also passengers coming in from other flights who cross right in front of youNo frills, i.e., no drinks or snacks. One is charged for everything. The cost really adds up. The crew and flight attendants were excellent and very pleasant.I always walk by a pallet of Avelo branded mini bottles of water on the tarmac, but I’ve never seen them in flight. Yup, not even water offered on a 3 hour flight. No wi-fi onboard. We just watch the flight crew on their phone for 3 hours every flight. At least a mid-flight trash pickup would be great. Better than my last flight, but they only could have gone up from there. Don’t use for business or ticketed vacation like Disney… too unreliable.You get what you pay for. The plane was dirty and the seats were awful.Terrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..We had to deboard 2 times due to maintenance issues. They changed the plane, and then we got deviated to LAX due to maibtenance issues on the other plane, had to sleep at LAX and los a full day.Everything was good, except the seats in economy were so close together, you could barely get out when the seat in front of your was reclined. If the airlines keep jamming in more and more seats, it will become intolerable. I will look for another airline that considers customer comfort and does not keep adding more rows of seats for more profit.The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Flight was good and crew was super polite. However, there were around 5 kids screaming the WHOLE 2 hours. I understand kids have to come but parents need to do something to control their children. They make the experience terrible, especially after finishing 16 hour shifts at the hospital I needed some sleep, which I did not get.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.Great service on board. Boarding a bit slow due to process. Food was pretty average.Tastless food and too obvious lack of enthusiasm for service in the economy vesus business classAll of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.I had no checked baggage but was required to hand over carry on baggage at the door of the plane. There was a lot of overboard space in the plane and I was one of the last ones. I ran to get my carry on but it was gone. I was given back at the plane door in Toronto, so the wait was not as long as it would have been at the carousel.Flight from Dallas to OKC was good, but my trip was interrupted due to a delayed flight from Austin to DFW, which happens all the time. I frequently miss my connection from DFW and American can never seem to make this work!Because the plane was 90 degrees F, they would not let us board. I wish they had, because it meant we were delayed. It's Texas, of course it's hot. We would have survived.Wish they had the seat-back video screens for watching movies or playing games.Full flight so overhead bin space ran out & bags had to be checked. When you’re in the last boarding group, you might as well expect that. Don’t pay to check bags though because when they run out of space for carry-ons, they check your bag to your destination for free. When traveling with children, no need to pay extra for seats, they will assign seats & have to sit your children with you.The seats in economy were appeared to be quite thin and lack sufficient cushioning to be comfortable. Perhaps it was my seating position but the plane seemed notably load.Very good but wish they had the seat-back video screens for movies & gamesMost things were ok but the main problem was the cabin staff; they were very abrupt and not very friendly. They were busy and often rushed, snatching drinks off people before finished and bossing them about.Airport in MXP is crazy. Get there at least 2 hours before flight.American almost always Delays flights from Austin to Dallas and back. I cannot believe they have such poor service on this route. I was about to switch to American from Delta, but they gave me enough reasons not to.Lost luggage stuck no clothes and no word after 2 days leaving on cruise no stuff or clothesEverything was great. I liked the text updates so that I never miss a gate change & I have all the latest info.I don’t usually fly budget airlines or airlines in the United States. It was as good as any other airline. The seats are comfortable and the airline attendants are not rude & surly. Very nice flight (s).No internet on a flight over three hours in this age is criminal. Staff inattentive and dismissiveThey have the most inexperienced / rude flight staff I’ve encounteredvery difficult boarding process - aggressive passengers not the friendliest crewWiFi was not eorkig (again) And the plane was from 1990 with the screens which were.not touch and most didn’t even work and if lucky could tune in tvI paid extra for a seat closer to the front. The TV didn’t work at all for the entire flight. Would have been nice to know before I purchased an “upgraded “ seatIt was great. I had never flown on JetBlue before, but would be very happy to fly with them in the future.Worst flight experience ever flights canceled. JetBlue told us just did not even bother standing in line to come back in one and a half hours then without any information we had to go pick up all of our luggage and spend over $2000 in accommodation just to get home. JetBlue said that the next flight available for us to get home would be three days later. Absolutely absurd hasn’t offered to give us any compensation do not fly JetBlue horrible company. They said it was based on the weather and the weather is great in all locations that we would’ve been flying to total hoax. I think it’s a conspiracy theory.The captain gave good announcements and the flight attendants were friendly. The WiFi was pretty good. The plane itself looked very old inside and the seats were very uncomfortable. The screens in the seat backs were the smallest I’ve ever seen. There were so many loud and obnoxious kids on this flight and the parents didn’t do much to try to quiet them down. Some had videos and games on tablets with higher than necessary volume going the whole time.Delta7.9Avelo Airlines7.5United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2JetBlue7.2Everything you need to know for your flight from Hartford to Punta CanaAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsHartford (BDL)Punta Cana (PUJ)Cabin class types available on flights from Hartford to Punta CanaCabin classes available on flights from Hartford to Punta Cana.
