There lie flat seats made it easier to sleep on a 12 hour flight. Food was great and service was excellent.The crew was very nice and polite. They made sure everybody got their meal and drinks. Even the economy class had a very adequate leg room for someone that is over 6 foot tall.Overall it was good. Making changes to the reservation on ANA’s website was little challenging. Would like to see those features improved in the future.The flight crew was outstanding. Very cheerful and always respectful. I wish the same could be said about United. The AC wasn't the best on the plane.The seats are uncomfortable. The flight attendants are not pleasant. They do their job, but not with a ray of sunshine and warmth. The food was awful, not what I would expect from an Asian airline. All of the other Asian airlines I have flown have far better food. The food was on par with United airlines food, which is really bad. Maybe ANA should get out of the alliance with United.During booking, I selected the seats so that my wife and I would sit next to each other. However, the airline changed our seats at boarding so that we were seated apart. Very disappointing.Every leg of the flight was late causing us to miss our flight to Okinawa and have to take the next flight out.Cramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The airport was reasonably clean. The boarding process reasonably efficient. The cabin crew was efficient, polite but not that friendly. The food quality was unremarkable and the choices were awful . There was either a so so chicken dish or a “ vegetarian “ option which was really cheap carbohydrates drowned in cheese. Signing onto i flight wifi was not straightforward. Overall it was a very average experienceThe staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Love you guys are so friendly and kind and wonderfulOk but why they need to sell the ear buds?Our flight was delayed, which I know things can happen. The bathrooms were dirty and a mess. It took over an hour to get our bags after the plane landed. Every flight was on the same 2 baggage claims. You would thing if we spent over 5 hours on a flight we would get more then a tiny bag of pretzels. The movie and tv choices were mid.Pillows and blankets were nice since it was an overnight flight, but the seats should be larger and there should be more space between rows so we have more leg room.The crew was great! It was nice to have a pillow and blanket... It gets cold on those flights. I paid extra money to sit where I thought was extra comfort seating, but it wasn't,... So, I was mad a bit about that. I'm hoping our flight home will be better.I loved flying Hawaiian Air! We didn’t pay to sit together, but we were able to anyway. They had usb charging ports and even outlets in some seats. They served a hot sandwich that was not very good, but we were still pleasantly surprised. The staff was very nice. The seats really made my booty hurt but maybe I’m just not used to sitting so long. Also, the AC was really cold even though I was wearing pants, a hoodie, and a light blanket.A second drink service on a 6 hour flight would have been helpful.You did not have any vegetarians options for the free meal! I do not eat any meat of any kind! I asked the flight attendant and was met with kind of a rude statement like vegetarian? No we don’t have that kind of thing! Did not make me happy but made me feel like why would I want a vegetarian meal! Otherwise a good experience!It’s great, I’ve always fly & ride with Hawaiian Airlines going Inter island or to the mainland.Good except that I couldn’t change seat and made me wait untill I checked inEasy to board and fly, no frills. Yummy ramen on board.It was for the most part a 10/10 they said they had entertainment options but all they had was old movies for streaming from the mid 2010’s so like 10 years agoall good for a very budget flight - well priced and excellent service. Will fly againCouple of the crew members were really nice and the rest are really rude and didn't help when we needed help, food was not worth it at all and most importantly there's no even entertainment system other than a very interruptive and slow internet and some movies.I appreciate the economy price of the tickets. The long flight made the comfort level on the lower average side. Wi-Fi connection was not consistent but working. Overall, I would fly again with zip air but next time get the flat, premium seats with the amount of money I would save otherwise.Comfortable seats and lucky no one was in middle seat. No water on the plane. Plane was on time and staff was fast.You get what you pay for and nothing more. Wanted a cheap flight and that’s exactly what I got, though it’s human nature to wanting to feel like you got a good deal as well. There was none of that here. I was cheap and they were too. Got to my destination safely and that’s all that really matters.Nice service. I wish it could provide hot water on the flight.internet didn't work. No offer of drinks or snacks.Flight was seamless. Free wifi helped pass the time. Food was okay, just make sure you pre order or pick something up from the airportTerrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..We had to deboard 2 times due to maintenance issues. They changed the plane, and then we got deviated to LAX due to maibtenance issues on the other plane, had to sleep at LAX and los a full day.Everything was good, except the seats in economy were so close together, you could barely get out when the seat in front of your was reclined. If the airlines keep jamming in more and more seats, it will become intolerable. I will look for another airline that considers customer comfort and does not keep adding more rows of seats for more profit.The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Flight was good and crew was super polite. However, there were around 5 kids screaming the WHOLE 2 hours. I understand kids have to come but parents need to do something to control their children. They make the experience terrible, especially after finishing 16 hour shifts at the hospital I needed some sleep, which I did not get.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.Great service on board. Boarding a bit slow due to process. Food was pretty average.Tastless food and too obvious lack of enthusiasm for service in the economy vesus business classAll of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.I had no checked baggage but was required to hand over carry on baggage at the door of the plane. There was a lot of overboard space in the plane and I was one of the last ones. I ran to get my carry on but it was gone. I was given back at the plane door in Toronto, so the wait was not as long as it would have been at the carousel.ANA8.4Delta7.9Hawaiian Airlines7.8ZIPAIR7.6United Airlines7.4Everything you need to know for your flight from Honolulu to TokyoAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Honolulu to TokyoFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Honolulu to Tokyo according to KAYAK users.
