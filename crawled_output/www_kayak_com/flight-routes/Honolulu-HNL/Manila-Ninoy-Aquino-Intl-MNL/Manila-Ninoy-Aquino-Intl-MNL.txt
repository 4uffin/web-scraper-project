Movies: better choices to include Chinese movies options or some of the older winners of flim festivalAlmost 6 hours of delay with over 12 gate changes. Flight was supposed to depart around 6 and instead depart after 12am. No accommodations were offered than some snacks closer to midnight when the crew was planning to throw away some snacks.The crew was very nice and polite. They made sure everybody got their meal and drinks. Even the economy class had a very adequate leg room for someone that is over 6 foot tall.Purchased WiFi was slow to non functional. Staff was not personable or friendly. Seats were cramped. Boarding took long but I expected that.Luckily I just tried to sleep. But the entertainment system was awkward to operate. I hate all this stuff with apps and adding it to your phone and all. It is a nuisance. I would prefer a good magazine or newspaper in the pocket in front of me or available.Every leg of the flight was late causing us to miss our flight to Okinawa and have to take the next flight out.One of the best 14 hour flights I've ever had. Crew was friendly throughout which can be difficult on longer flights. The crew being kind and respectful is very important for me. Plane felt clean and I was able to get some well needed uninterrupted sleep. I put them slightly above Cathay Pacific as far as cleanliness the only down side was a lack of entertainment selections, but hey I am an American taking a trip on a Japanese airline so I cannot complain. Thank you ANA and the Tokyo airport all very friendly. Will see you soonPoor. We weren’t able to check in online (for several hours until we gave up) for no apparent reasons although our passports were loaded successfully. When we were at the airport check-in, a rep helped us at the kiosk but she disregarded the KTN provided to her so we had to come back for it after being questioned by the TSA person…ANA gave me an amazing experience. They are very good with customer service.Everything was good may improve some alcohol drinks and amenities during flyThey were trying to get people to check luggage because the over head compartments were full but when we boarded there were lots of empty places that people could have put the luggage.There could have been better spacing of the passengers, it was crowded in some parts of the plane then other while rows were emptyIt was good, I liked the self-serve snacks but it was a little difficult to get the alcohol, which is understandable since I wouldn't want kids sneaking it.Friendly flight attendants and gate agents. Very clean plane and food was good!I was unable to select decent seats, and so I was stuck in the middle seat because it was selected for meThere was a lot of partial tv shows but not enough to last the flight. The food was incredible! The crew were so helpful and patient. Lots more space than what I usually get on an international flight. Very comfortable!Stingy on the drinks - 15 hour direct flight and could barely get attention for some waterNot many people, so you can lay down on two seatsThey did an excellent job helping me with a wheelchair. I couldn’t have asked for any better help.The delay in Korea was a pain and set us back a day. I have to give big props to Korean Air for setting up a hotel with dinner and transportation to and from the hotel. I also needed assistance with a wheelchair and they did an outstanding job.highly recommend for trip to japan only reason why i gave good not excellent is because their selection of movies and tv shows in English is more limited .I avoid American Airlines for a reason. Our flight was delayed at LAX. The situation at the gate was chaotic. The woman making announcements wasn't being clear or transparent regarding why there were delays. There was a lot of confusion regarding flight and gate status. Other passengers were pretty rude. I was elbowed in the eye by someone who was in a hurry to get their bags from the overhead bin immediately after the flight landed. Ultimately, I will avoid AA as much as possible in the future.Overall a great experience. One complain was the vegetarian food that my wife had which was mostly boiled vegetables with not much flavor.We booked business class round trip from Delhi to San Diego and back. On our last leg from Bangalore to Delhi we were down graded to economy class which was big disappointment other than that everything was great.Had an incident with a stewardess who insisted that I take a seat. I informed her that I came to use the restroom and to have some water. After using the restroom, I wanted to stretch my legs out a little cuz my knees were aching from sitting. I understood her concern for my concern and the potential turbulence (she said she knows this route and the turbulence and safety is not to be taken lightly) but I felt that her mood, tone, demeanor, and a lack of compassion for the pain in my knees were not the proper way to address a customer or anyone for that matter. This left a bitter taste in my mouth. It was her lack of professionalism that surprised me.It was good but need mor amenities for toiletries and entertainmentThis portion of the trip from HCMC to Dallas was operated by American Airline. Unfortunately they are 2 steps below JAL in overall quality. Regardless, AAStill got me where I needed to go on time.First experience with JAL so was okay to pretty good. 10 hour flight in premium select seat. . Seats in that category should be better than pretty good. Seat pan a little short for tall people but plenty of leg room; I think JAL in process of new planes? Also, — they could have offered a bit more water throughout flight and meals not the greatest. That said, certainly 200 percent better than a very recent AK Air International flight in similar cabin class in comfort and meals.We ordered for non vegetarian Hindu meal but instead they served us vegetarian Hindu meal. That was also not good. It was very annoying and aggravating. Hope our return from Tokyo to jfk on March 27 same is not repeated. Caterar should understand difference between non vegetarian Hindu meal and vegetarian Hindu meal.Food was great, Entertainment was bad, movies were not current and just did not have good variety. Granted I was tired so cranky might have played into my evaluation. Overall based on cost I definitely would fly them again. I am a million mile flyer on another airline, the service on JAL really beats all airlines.Better screens, it would have been nice to have more comfortable seats.2nd major delay due to maintenance issues. 1st delay missed my connecting flight.The aircraft was massive (A-380) and became crowded with 400+ passengers on board.The plane hasnt left im stuck in seatle still my flight has been grounded for almost 5 hoursMy luggage didn’t arrive with my flight. Flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours while we sat on the plane and I almost missed my connecting flight and subsequently missed the last train from the airport so it took me another 2 hours to get to my destination after arriving, Crew skipped me several times when offering beverages, and I couldn’t get their attention at times because they wouldn’t even make eye contact with me. They didn’t give me a form for disembarking so I had to go to the back of the line after waiting an eternity for immigration. Paid for on flight wi- fi that didn’t work for most of the flight.Love flying Asiana. Been using it for over a decade now.I had a bad experience coming from America to Thailand. On my connecting flight my check in suitcase was not put on the departing aircraft, I received my suitcase 24 hours after arriving in Bangkok and when I open my luggage my hand swelled up. The next morning when I put on an outfit from my suitcase my face swelled up and became numb. My entire vacation was ruined it seems that some kind of chemical was sprayed into suitcase and ruined my clothes and got me sick. The staff at my hotel called the airline and spoke to someone and they told me to file a complaint and gave my a website to do so. I did not file a complaint I felt like it would have fell on death ears. I had to throw away my brand new vacation clothes and suitcase and I had the worst vacation ever due to this happening to me.The beefsteak on the lunch menu was excellent! I usually do not eat airplane food. I loved it.Flight was too cold. I wore a regular cotton tee and it wasn’t enough. It was a night time flight so I would have thought a blanket would be provided to passengers. A 4 hour flight and no options for a meal? I flew Asiana the next day from Seoul to Manilla. Same duration, 4 hours. They give everyone a pillow and blanket and serve a meal. Why is United so cheap and holding back meals and amenities? Also, they promote too much gay stuff and DEI in their advertisements. Please be mindful of other beliefs and don’t shove your gay ideology down my throat.Staff always with a smile and very helpful with my mom who has mobility issues.It’s sad how legacy airlines feel like budget airlines now. Cramped space Non reclining seats No inflight entertainment (need to connect via your own device) Saving grace is the crew. Truly nice and sincere service.Short flight with limited entertainment wasn't that bad. Staff was friendly and plane was clean. Meal was good.It was great! The flight was on time and had a smoother flightCrew excellent calling me by name ! Only downside was no inflight WiFiI was glad that the plane was not totally full.Boarding and flying on time is the most important need of passengers they did thatEverything was very good but seats are small for a big man!Well, I needed to make a change to my flight and I called the airline and they said yes no problem $700 and we can do that and I agreed to it so they canceled my tickets and went to rebook and came back after being on hold for an hour and a half and said I’m sorry, sir. There was an error. It is $2800 Now and I said never mind. I will just use those flights and she proceeded to tell me that they already canceled them because I said I was interested in doing the change. I told her yes for $700. I was fine with doing a change but not $2800 so give me my tickets back and she proceeded to tell me that she could not do that and I had to pay the $2800 to get my tickets back that I already spent $2800 on. So I had to book tickets on another airline to get home And that cost a lot of money too. I’m a little pissed off at Philippine airline right now because of what they did to me and I’m not sure I ever wanna fly with them again. I’ve flown with them plenty in the past, but this just really put a bad taste in my mouth.. Not to mention on my way there leaving Seattle going to Vancouver. I got to the airport three hours in advance and they had booked me through Alaska Airlines to do that little trip. My connecting flight would leave about six hours after I got to Vancouver BC. I stood in Alaska Airlines lying for a little over two hours and then they proceeded to tell me that they couldn’t check me in because I wasn’t there an hour in advance. I kept telling the lady at the beginning of the line that I was afraid they were not gonna let me in because it was taking so long and she said oh don’t worry about it. You’re fine you’ve got time. Well I ended up spending $600 to get to Canada that night just to make my connecting flight because Alaska air wouldn’t do anything and Filipino Air told me it was Alaska air problem but Alaska air said since you booked through Philippine air, we can’t fix it. I had about 50 minutes to make my flight, but they refused to check me in because I wasn’t there an hour in advance yet. I’ve been standing in their line for about two hours and 15 minutes.reach the standard, crew tried to fix up issues fast.Overall the flight was a good experience. It is different from American Airlines because they board the back of the plane first rather than the front first. Food was decent. They gave out pillows ,blankets , and face masks. I did find this airline had faster flights back home than others. Less travel and layover time.ANA8.4Korean Air8.4Japan Airlines8.3Asiana Airlines8.2Philippine Airlines7.3Everything you need to know for your flight from Honolulu to ManilaAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Honolulu to ManilaFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Honolulu to Manila according to KAYAK users.
