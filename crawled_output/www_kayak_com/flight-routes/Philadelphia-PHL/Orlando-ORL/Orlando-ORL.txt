The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!10.0 ExcellentG, Sep 2025LAS - ATLRead more Southwest reviewsI wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.Flight was delayed not sure why no explanation given and no apologies either. Otherwise the flight was fineDid not get the seat I selected and paid for.Plane was delayed for 6 hours, at first by weather, which is understandable, but was further delayed with NO given reason for 2 1/2 hours more. We had no clue when we were going to depart actually until they opened the ramp. VERY POOR to ZERO COMMUNICATION!!!Flight was delayed and after being in the airport for like seven hours, it was canceled.Flight delays numerous times. Everytime we would get close to boarding it would be delayed again. Strung along the entire time.Overall very good, only complaint I have is the crew from CLT to SAT could have collected trash sooner.Above and beyond effort from this crew in a tough situation. So helpful and understanding. Thank you!We started with trouble checking in 24 hours early. Then my husband did not get his TSA precheck. Finally flight delayed due to no crew. I know things happenMost miserable flight ever. We waited almost 2 hours on the runway because the flight was oversold. American offered $1200 credit. Then there was some nonsense about weight distribution. Ridiculous. No food for 8 plus hours on the flight. I will be writing a letter.Honestly, I haven’t flown American in years, probably due to the pandemic and my being unable to travel for certain periods in the last two years, but it was a good experience to dig out or obtain a new American Airlines account after many years of traveling for business with American in the past.Crew was great. No entertainment and food and beverage was for purchase only, even waterIt was canceled. The flight wasn’t rescheduled, everyone had to figure out their own new arrangements. They said we would get refunded our original fare and receive an additional $150. We received links for $100 only and they expired before we could activate them.The plane had originated in Las Vegas at 6:30 in the morning and flew to Moline where we boarded. The flight left around 12:30 PM and there were no boxed snacks available and many of the alcoholic beverages were unavailable. I would find it hard to believe that that many of the passengers coming from Las Vegas at 6:30 in the morning, drank and ate that much of the items. I can only come to the conclusion that someone failed to stock the plane for the round-trip. This is a huge revenue failure for the airline and disappointment for the passengers. The flight crew did not seem happy to be there and did not engage with passengers. Allegiant you can do better.They did not let my husband on the plane with our service animal at the last minute. Do NOT fly this airline with a service animal!Tight! Seats are not designed for those of us who wear extra-large clothes.The non-stop flight from Grand Rapids was excellent. I neither expected or needed a budget flight and Allegiant made the trip easy and for an affordable price, Arriving at the Mesa Airport (AZA) is a delight compared to the international airport. For our return flight, we were able to arrive 75 minutes before the flight, return the rental car, check our bag and make it to the gate in plenty of time. That would never happen at most airports.Easiest flights I’ve ever taken. Plane was comfortable without overly crowded seating.Terrible. Still have not received the refund from them. They sent it to some account that I don't even know. Spoke with costumer service and they are unable to help.I didn’t like it at all. I miss my second flight because of the delay on Allegiant Air now I m stuck in MCO.Good, but a bit late on take off after loading. Don't like charging for carry ons!I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.My experience with Spirit was good, but the experience with Kayak was not. Based on the Spirit agent Kayak added an additional charge after purchasing the tickets. When I buy the tickets I paid the total amount and I only pay once. This time they added an additional charge because based on Spirit they partially charge the tickets and I still needed to pay a second time. This is not good at all and UnprofessionalSpirit gets such a bad rap. I have never had a bad experience with them and the crew is always friendly and funny. This trip I had knee replacement surgery surgery 10 weeks ago. It is still a little rough to get get from point a to point b. And Spirit was on top of it. When there was a seat available the stewardess asked me if I wanted to move to an open seat so I could elevate my leg on the empty seat? 5 stars all around. They helped me on and helped me off the plane. I can’t say enough about the crew!!The spirit flight was on time. The airplane itself was surprisingly very nice. We had great seats. Seems like there's more room. Only complaint is that I didn't get a full refund for my mistakenly buying the baggage twice.Prepaid for 1 bag but my prior airline did not provide it to me in time to check it with Spirit and I could not get my $75 refunded.Plane delayed which seems to be the norm with spirt. Everything is an up charge. I had to pay an additional fee because I was late getting back to my car. Will never fly spirit againIt was horrible. We were not allowed on the flight by spirit staff at the gate during boarding because I had a guitar. The same guitar I had at check in which I paid for and they said I can take it on the plane. We missed our flight, lost our luggage, and had to pay another $900 to rebook flights. Worst travel experience ever and spirit staff are the worst staff ever.The flight attendant spilled ice all down my leg and all over my suede boots and didn’t even apologize or anything. They just gave me a look like “what?!” Incredibly rude and dismissive. I saw them roll their eyes at other guests and even once yell at a lady with a baby.Seats were comfortable but dont recline at all. Checkin online was easy but didnt provide a gate until last minute. Flight attendants were very unkind, not friendly and didnt go over safety procedures in case of a crash. No free snacks or beverages, not even water.The booking was cancelled the next day. Spirit Airlines refunded Kayak cheapflay the full amount, but I was only refunded half. Costumer service is disgusting. Be careful. You can lose your money.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.I was 2 hr arrive in the airport and 45 min in the line . After take to my turn . The agent tell me I’m later . I can not board . So my vacation was going to the floor . Just for their bad customer service agent in the airline2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.Since you have to pay for overhead bags then they shouldn't be running out of space and asking individuals who paid to remove stuff from the overheadBook with frontier airlines with the mentality that they'll cancel your flight, kick you off and lose your luggage. Anything besides that is a win. Compare prices with other airlines (to include luggage) and if frontier is still worth it, book it but know all of their policies.You get what you pay for nothing essentially but a hard uncomfortable seat that doesn’t recline and kids screaming all around you and chaotic boarding and limited check bag weight allowance when compared to other airlinesNot very good. Paid in excess of $400 for assigned seating for my family and that was not provided. I want that money back.I chose the seats when booked the flight and paid for them. However after checking in I found we were assigned different seats!It was a no frills flight. Would have liked to be able to charge my deviceSeats were extremely uncomfortable and it was very hot on the plane.Southwest8.0American Airlines7.2Allegiant Air7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Philadelphia to OrlandoAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsPhiladelphia (PHL)Cabin class types available on flights from Philadelphia to OrlandoCabin classes available on flights from Philadelphia to Orlando.
