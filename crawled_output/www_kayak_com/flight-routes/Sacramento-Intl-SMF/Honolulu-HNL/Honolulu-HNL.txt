What a light touch. And I’m an avid traveler!10.0 ExcellentElizabeth, Sep 2025PDX - HNLRead more Alaska Airlines reviewsThe pilot performed the smoothest landing I’ve ever experienced. What a light touch. And I’m an avid traveler!Terrible. Would never fly again. Took them several hours to prepare the plane and and reached my destination 4 hours late.Our boarding was delayed due to two flat tires, but I appreciate the focus on safety. I also appreciated the additional offerings for drinks which never happened before except on Hawaiian Airlines. The hospitality is fantastic! Glad I upgraded to premium seats for the extra leg room as I was getting frustrated when the person in front of me was very restless and kept shifting. Otherwise, it was a fantastic experience.Could not check in online - had to get boarding passes at the ticket counter and our daughter got bumped off our connecting flight. NOT OK!I needed more space to sleep on an overnight flight.Our flight time was drastically changed which caused us to lose a day of vacationWonderful respectful staff for a short flight late at night...lots of considerations all met!Very bad, terrible food and late by 2 hours. Then no to open aircraft doorsFlying on Hawaiian Airlines was good. But, getting a boarding pass was a hassle. I booked what I thought was an Alaska Airlines flight that was actually a Hawaiian Airlines flight. I couldn't check in online. I had to wait for the Hawaiian Airlines counter to open so I could get my boarding pass which was a requirement for me to get in The Club or the Centurion Lounge. (I had no check in luggage so I didn't expect to have to physically check in.) The Alaska Airlines staff blamed the FAA for the problem.Everything was really good except it was really cold in the plane,As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Delayed flight. Nicest crew member was a SW pilot flying seated next to me who kindly move to seat the final passenger. Flight extra delayed. My cup of refreshment of ginger ale was so packed with ice it was literally 2 sips.No trays in our seats, we sat in first row, purchased a business class fare. Had to hold our drinks and snack in our hands. No plugs for our cell phones. Had to pay for it a drink cocktail each. Seats so uncomfortable.Flight wasn’t even full, but too many carry-ons caused us to run out of bin space. New bag fee has folks who would usually check their bags carrying on. Watching Southwest morph into Spirit/Frontier is so sad to watchSouthwest is Southwest. No frills. If you're luck enough to get a happy crew (we did), then it makes for a nicer flight.It was a perfect flight in all aspects! Both legs!Great flight, 47 passengers on a 180 seat plane. Stewardess was pleasant and cheerful.I liked the crew member who gave flight instructions on "in case of a problem:. The seats are so small that only a young teenager could sit in middle seat.Very accommodating on flight changes when something came up. Definitely felt a notch above other airlines.They we able to seat my companion and I next to each other. Plane’s temperature was very cool. Willl be more prepared on return trip.What an amazing flight. I haven’t experienced this level of service in a flight in years. This will be the only way to fly to Hawaii for me in the future.Hawaiian airlines has awful customer service. Told me to keep a flight I wasn’t boarding, instead of rebooking me under two separate reservations, which caused my whole reservation to be canceled. Major issues with leadership and management. The staff at Hilo was reluctant to give me a refund, so I had to by a first class ticket in order to get on a flight the same time as my partner. The blame was pointed at me without sincere apology until the supervisor came out, who also apparently had no authority to refund me. Still waiting on correspondence from the airline days later.The flight was great! The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. I would definitely fly Hawaiian Aurlines again!You have to buy the ear buds and they only offers little cup of water twice.Flight was on time, crew was friendly and prompt with the service. The only thing that could be improved is the seat space, but that's wishful thinkingThe worst flight experience I've ever had. Our flight was delayed 14 whole hours because the flight crew never showed up. We had to wait in a two hour line to get our new boarding passes, we were told we had no other option but to fly at 10pm (we didn't depart until 11:45pm). Everyone had to contact their hotels and car rental places, workplaces, etc. since we lost an entire day's worth of travel. The crew showed up at 10:15, which was past the time we were supposed to board. They were laughing and being completely smug when they boarded, and they took another hour to board us onto our flight. The flight crew never came to check in on us, we were quickly given one drink and sandwich and they turned off the lights and were negligent the rest of the trip. My mom asked three attendants for a seat belt extender, they never brought one. I was dehydrated and never received another drink. They were very rude and unfriendly, we had been up since 4am the morning of our flight and didn't land in our destination until 2am the next day (5am local time). This was unacceptable service and treatment, these flights are not cheap and we were inconvenienced out of an entire day of travel. This was 100% avoidable and was the fault of Hawaiian Airlines, and their crews inability to show up to work on time.Loved the leg room, usb charging, outlet, food, staff. The seats were very uncomfortable for some reason and made my buttocks ache and would have liked to be seated together from the time of purchasing tickets without having to pay extra.Overall it was a good flight, but the food should be looked at. No options. The seat was also uncomfortable and very tight.I understand stuff happens, but plane failures are likely due to lack of maintenance. Additionally, air conditioning wasn't working, no snack/drink service, no WiFi. Fortunately, the crew was communicative and light-hearted. United grabbed another plane and we were able to get to our destination.Stuck on tarmac for two hours plus a 5.5 hour flight. Rude flight attendant. And no meals, not even for purchase!I learned that seating towards the end of plane that a line forms for the restroom and people use your chair as a hand railing, bumping your seat consistently. I was seated in the aisle. I think that next time if I am towards the back row I would want to sit in the middle or window seat.United sent me a mileage plus number last year but that number is invalid so I can’t use it to check into flights or collect mileage. There is human to speak about the problem, only computers who keep asking me if I am using the correct email. It’s so frustrating and I cannot resolve it.Not a great experience. We paid for the upgrade for premium economy seats and seated ourselves in very comfortable seats. Someone came along with the same seat on their boarding pass. The aircraft had been changed and as a result we were booted out and sent further back to small uncomfortable seats. After complaining we were moved to emergency row seats, which gave us more leg room but the seats don’t recline. For people in our 70’s we found having to sit upright from California to NJ very uncomfortable. Not sure why they chose to move senior citizens instead of the two people that were allowed to take the more comfortable seats. Not happy.Everything was great. Only thing that could’ve made it better was buy on board options for hot food, but the snacks were decent. The flight attendants were great. I had no complaints. I was able to make it to my destination safelyBoarded plane and then delayed 1.5 hours while on the planeHorrific. They missed my connecting flight to San Diego. I didn’t get there until Monday at 9am when I had a mandatory court settlement conference scheduled at 6am since we had parties on the east coast. This caused many issues. All because United apparently forgot to hold the doors open until my flight landed that only had a 10 minute delay. This was the last flight to Southern California. So I couldn’t even rent a car to finish the trip. United cannot be trusted when traveling on specific days and times since weather didn’t have anything to do with the delays.Really good 😊 the woman at the gate entrance was a little rude checking in our carry-on but i dont think she worked for the airline, she worked for the airport at sacramento, other than that amazing.it was so bad. I tried to board my flight from vancouver to saskatoon. And to my surprise they did not board me cause the flight was changed and no email was send to me. and on my boarding pass which i got from seattle says different flight. I did not knew anyone from Vancouver, air canada crew was rude, i asked for today flight but they were rude and i had early morning dental appointment in saskatoon. I was so much in pain and my whole day is wasted today. and i suffered alot. They did provide me hotel but they did not provide me any food. I am really really disappointed first time had so bad experience with air canada. I may think twice to book it again. If i can get any reply or any composition that would be great. ThanksThe seats in economy were appeared to be quite thin and lack sufficient cushioning to be comfortable. Perhaps it was my seating position but the plane seemed notably load.The entertainment package was vast and the selections were very current. Keep updating it was great.The seat was so hard my tailbone was aching The crew was kind of a b**** because I made a joke that I didn't care if they close the door I total c*** when she was trying to f****** act like she was mad at me because I said that The flight was bumpy. Sure you didnt have control over that.4 hours late, including over +1 hour waiting in plane to take off. Baggage left behind too.While waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.Was not able to watch most shows on the entertainment site. They would not loadOur flight was 1.5 hours delayed. There was no weather for the inbound flight, so I don't understand why. This meant a VERY late arrival and only a quick nap before my morning flight.Delayed flight, so I switched fights to SFO to Phoenix , Phoenix to DSM. Excellent service through American AirlinesAA re-routed flight from HNL to LAX due to delay. My group of 3 with reserved seats in row 9 was broken up, with one assigned to a middle seat, another in the last row of the plane. Not happy. No explanation to the delay. No apologies. No compensation. Would have been nice to be offered an Admiral Club admission or a voucher for the extra 3 hours of layover in LAX. Could not hear the boarding gate announcements in LAX. Adjacent gate was boarding at the same time. Loud speakers were competing against each other. Barely made my boarding group.Almost a 6 hour flight and the only food option is a cheese plate… and chips. Also how is it there are no options for texting on American. I’ll be going back to delta and united.Alaska Airlines8.0Southwest8.0Hawaiian Airlines7.8United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Everything you need to know for your flight from Sacramento to HonoluluAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsSacramento (SMF)Honolulu (HNL)Cabin class types available on flights from Sacramento to HonoluluCabin classes available on flights from Sacramento to Honolulu.
