Your airplanes are always so cold though.8.0 ExcellentAnonymous, Sep 2025BOI - SANRead more Alaska Airlines reviewsEverything was great, your crew is always very pleasant. Your airplanes are always so cold though.They cancelled like the flight at midnight, seven hours before the departure. Terrible.The vibe and energy of the Alaska staff on ground in Redmond is some of the best we’ve seen!All flights were on time. No crowded and had empty seats. All flight attendents were great.Awesome. Great flight. Super nice people and I like the extra spaceSeattle airport is a mess. New bag tag system has potential, but you need more signage to guide passengers through the process as to where to go next. Told to go in one direction and then met with a very rude agent when we did. He blamed his attitude on all the folks flying over labor day that were paying his salary. Gate area for D3 is a mess compared to the North terminal. Overall Alaska is number 1 in my book.This time it is good, no delay and right on timeAgent boarding us in San Diego lectured me on showing up on time for the flight, and said that if I had been three minutes later, he would have denied myself and my wife boarding. Our trusted traveler numbers were not in the system, even though I entered them when I bought the tickets. Our food orders were not in the system, even though I entered them prior to the flight. My wife requires a wheelchair, and that was delayed on both flights.Staff at Gate desk were helpful. My connecting flight from the first part of my trip Kona to Seattle was late. I had to run through SeaTac Seattle to catch my flight to San Jose. They made an exception to let me board. On my return trip San Jose to San Diego and San Diego to Honolulu the same thing happened. One flight arrived late and I had to run through the terminal to catch my connection. There are no Gluten-free & Vegan options meals and snacks to purchase.Very pleasant , a flight attendant Jo did a great job mixing me up a beverage and just brightened the trip .Very smooth checking in our luggage with a super pleasant SW agent. I enjoyed a fun entertaining movie.First time traveling on Southwest since bag fees were implemented. Usual good service. Just more expensive now.Southwest is Southwest. No frills. If you're luck enough to get a happy crew (we did), then it makes for a nicer flight.It was a perfect flight in all aspects! Both legs!Boarding process, crew were good. But the seats were so uncomfortable that was all I could focus on. I literally had to sit forward so that all 3 of us could fit in row. I will try to avoid Southwest in the future for any flights over 60 minutes.Great flight, 47 passengers on a 180 seat plane. Stewardess was pleasant and cheerful.I liked the crew member who gave flight instructions on "in case of a problem:. The seats are so small that only a young teenager could sit in middle seat.Great experience flying Southwest. The crew was really kind and helpful, and very friendly with our toddler.Great flight staff. Ease of boarding. Overall, very uneventful and easy trip.Plane late from DC to Austin 30 minutes. Crew made up much of the time enroute to San Diego.Had a hard time checking into my flight on my phone because they gave me the wrong confirmation number. Otherwise everything else went well.First class ticket. They ran out of food and I sat hungry watching the others eatEverything was great except having to check in at Alaska. That was a surprise and took extra time and effort. Should have been explained somewhere maybe on the HA electronic ticket.I accidentally made this purchase and they wouldn’t refund me even though I called immediately to cancel it.You. Changed my AIRLINE, CONFIRMATION CODE, TERMINAL. AND GATE COMM N CATION. WAS POOR AND SUBOPTITMUM AND RIDICULOUS MY AIRLINE WAS HAWAIIN. ,THEN SUDDENLY. YOU SAY IT WAS ALASKA Give me a break,,Black is not White I could not check in over the phone...all I received was Error. And info from Hawaiian air agent saying tooooo many people were trying to check in causing the problem On the other hand I am aliveI like that you have eliminated plastic cups, bottles and straws. The crew was conscientious about separating the used paper cups from the trash. This change to paper is a great move and makes me want to choose Alaska when I fly.Attendants seemed un-engaged and indifferent when asked for assistance.Overall it was a good flight. The thing I most appreciated was that you eliminated plastic cups and water bottles and stir sticks and had paper cups, wood stir sticks and cans. Plus, I saw that the airline staff were actually keeping the used paper cups separate and unfolding the used cardboard meal boxes and keeping those items separate from the trash. Good for them! This makes me want to support Alaska Airlines and fly Alaska again. Thank for taking this step in working to reduce single use plastics! Kudos!Ok but why they need to sell the ear buds?Alaskan has always been great. Unfortunately, going TO Cabo, on Hawaiian, was a nightmare. But Alaskan has always been great.Cancelled my flight last minute and did not help me rebook. It was a horrible experience.Late departure by 1:45min. No explanation why. During boarding inconsistent policing of their baggage rules. Before takeoff and lamdimg strange obsession with window shade and armrest positions. Don't know why they care. 15 min tarmac delay on arrival, they blamed airport congestion but we were the o lh flight waiting, it was clear it was due to poor staff planning (only one ground crew to receive airplanes and multiple arrivals) Got there but was rrally lame the whole trip.Boarding was a breeze, however, two of the flights that I boarded with Spirit did not have Wi-Fi available.Very good. Nothing more or less than expected. No complaints.My experience with the spirit as a first time it was OK, but the seats need a little cushion, the problem I had the most impacted me was when checking in the scales were so off and wrong. It will tell that you would have more weight, which was not true. The scale was say that it had Thirty Eight Pounds, when get in the labels when we send the luggage into the band. It says that it was overweight. I really really dislike that because the scales are not accurate. If I use Spirit and I have that issue again. That will be my last time flying with the spirit, even though I like so much to service the planes, and everything elsehahaha we are delayed for one hour plus.. but thx we arrived San Diego safeWorst airline ever! The guy weighing my bag had his foot on the metal plate and when I called him out on it, I got this stupid little smirk. La is a scam and so is Spirit Airlines. All the flight attendants looked like they hated our flight just as much as we did.Unclear pricing; ended up being charged an extra $52 just to get onboardSpirit is awful. Too expensive for what you get. Stop nickel and diming.would be great to get basic water, soda at least and stop charging for carry onsI think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.Decent clean onboard experience. Okay discount airline experience. Unfortunately, any customer service interactions are difficult and unhelpful. There is no service. Also, a premium seat only gets you premium boarding if you line up first. Once they start general boarding you must go to the back of the line. Not very premiumThe crew was mostly okay. The flight attendant who answered our questions was curt and unhelpful unfortunately. He seemed upset and I understand having off days.Very bad! No good service delayed my second connection flightThey canceled flight. Hard to believe there was even a plane incoming for us to get onCancelled flight after I arrived at airport after 75 min drive and parking. Next flight was 4 days in the future. Had to scramble and buy a much more expensive flight on another carrier.I liked the turn-style feature at gate 209B at LAX. Very efficient process. The gate staff also made several, clearly directed announcements so I felt very informed.Plane was down graded and I lost my uncharged exit row with more leg room. No mention or offer of refund from podium. Flight attendant was nice to explain this happens often and that I could request a refund via online form submission. I did this and have heard nothing back.Alaska Airlines8.0Southwest8.0Hawaiian Airlines7.8Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Sacramento to San DiegoAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Sacramento to San DiegoFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Sacramento to San Diego according to KAYAK users.
