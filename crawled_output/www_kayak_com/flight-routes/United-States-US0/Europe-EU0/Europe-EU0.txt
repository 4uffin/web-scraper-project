Luckily it wasn’t a long flight6.0 GoodAnonymous, Sep 2025ATL - MDWRead more Delta reviewsCramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The airport was reasonably clean. The boarding process reasonably efficient. The cabin crew was efficient, polite but not that friendly. The food quality was unremarkable and the choices were awful . There was either a so so chicken dish or a “ vegetarian “ option which was really cheap carbohydrates drowned in cheese. Signing onto i flight wifi was not straightforward. Overall it was a very average experienceThe staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Check in was quick and easy during early hours. Flight was on time, and customer services was a plus.Terrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..We had to deboard 2 times due to maintenance issues. They changed the plane, and then we got deviated to LAX due to maibtenance issues on the other plane, had to sleep at LAX and los a full day.Everything was good, except the seats in economy were so close together, you could barely get out when the seat in front of your was reclined. If the airlines keep jamming in more and more seats, it will become intolerable. I will look for another airline that considers customer comfort and does not keep adding more rows of seats for more profit.The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Flight was good and crew was super polite. However, there were around 5 kids screaming the WHOLE 2 hours. I understand kids have to come but parents need to do something to control their children. They make the experience terrible, especially after finishing 16 hour shifts at the hospital I needed some sleep, which I did not get.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.Great service on board. Boarding a bit slow due to process. Food was pretty average.Tastless food and too obvious lack of enthusiasm for service in the economy vesus business classAll of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.Excellent - explanations were clear staff was nice and flight was comfortableThe flight was fine. This survey is not. There is no option for N/A so items which don’t apply to my experience still must be rated. In those instances I give a “3” rating which ultimately skews the results.The actual trip was fine, however, the changes made to our flights and the layovers were had to endure were awful.They only offered water for Group 6. Awful announcements from the Crew. Couldn't understand a single word. Barely came by for the trash afterwards. Man, I love water for a premium flight. Wow. Water in a cup.Flight from Dallas to OKC was good, but my trip was interrupted due to a delayed flight from Austin to DFW, which happens all the time. I frequently miss my connection from DFW and American can never seem to make this work!Because the plane was 90 degrees F, they would not let us board. I wish they had, because it meant we were delayed. It's Texas, of course it's hot. We would have survived.Wish they had the seat-back video screens for watching movies or playing games.Full flight so overhead bin space ran out & bags had to be checked. When you’re in the last boarding group, you might as well expect that. Don’t pay to check bags though because when they run out of space for carry-ons, they check your bag to your destination for free. When traveling with children, no need to pay extra for seats, they will assign seats & have to sit your children with you.The seats in economy were appeared to be quite thin and lack sufficient cushioning to be comfortable. Perhaps it was my seating position but the plane seemed notably load.Very good but wish they had the seat-back video screens for movies & gamesWe were moved twice on flights to the point we weren’t even on Lufthansa anymore. We had to fly united. Lost paid extra leg room twice. To top it all off we’re forced to pay $375 and $275, respectively for you luggage that was considered sports luggage. We were told it would be Lufthansa fares l, from the united desk, AND WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A LUFTHANSA FLIGHT! I’ll be calling once my trip is over on October 7th to all airlines and Kayak. This was ridiculous!Everything went smoothly and the staff was very kind. I’m glad I purchased the extra leg room for my long flight; it was totally worth it. We were served 2 meals for a 9 hour flight which I was not expecting and they were very tasty. I appreciated them being vegetarian. Customs line in Munich was long; I had a choice to have a 1 hr 40 min layover or 2 hr 40 min layover; I took the longer layover which I was thankful for because my flight was delayed 30 minutes and there’s a good chance I would have missed my connecting flight. This was my very first international flight and I would fly Discover again without hesitation. Thank you for taking good care of me!I liked everything BUT the temperature. It was freezing and now I am sick.I liked Quiet people around me. Crew could have helped people with overhead luggage so they aren't moving other peoples bags around and causing problems for people that had there bags there firstThe flight and crew were good. The customer experience on the ground could have been better. We had to reschedule our flight because of a delay on the previous flight. The attendants working the desk in Washington DC were not helpful. They told us to scan a QR code and that would get us rebooked. Why couldn't two people standing at their computers do this? We had to chat with someone to get everything figured out. It was extremely confusing.The plane was delayed by two hours in Chicago which led to us missing the next flight. Lufthansa rebooked the flight and booked us a hotel for the night in Frankfurt. The level of customer service and getting us taken care of was superb. The flight crew and the service on the ground was superb.It was a short flight, everything was good with it.Flight was delayed over one hour and I had to pay to select my seat, even though my booking supposedly had free selection (I paid extra for this at time of booking)Stop charging for alcohol overseas flights and start taking cash again not everyone wants to pay with card if the person is bigger give him seat on the outside seats not the middle in between the people is common sense and mainly if you fly for Lufthansa provides the sam service and experience...good entertainment package but rather small seats for business classNeed to offer Better food from LAX to London Service from London to Delhi very delayed after take off.Connection at Hethrow was horrible..We couldn't get out of the plane for an hour as they were buying people to the airport and there were not enough busses. We had 2 and half hf between flights so it was very tight. After departing plane we had to go thru security again. People with less time in between connections missed their flightsPoor all around experience. Sat at gate in Grand Rapids to Chicago for 2.5 hours. No food or water offered and no allowances to use restroom. Missed connecting flight to London and not offered any compensation including food or lodging. Not happy with AA, claims delay was weather related but no weather issues seen on radar. Take ownership for real reason behind delay which was actually the IT outage. Very disappointing and will not be recommending AA for domestic or international flights if this is the way that customers are treated.Horrible… I was downgraded without notice, had to sit in economy and given my back injury was in pain most of the journey. I expect to be reimbursed for this inconvenience and after my return flight home, I never plan to fly with British Airways again.Great crew and food and beverage. Seating tight but not the airline's fault. Will definitely fly BA in future!Flight cancelled, lost luggage, crappy meal voucher. Nothing was good. Still dont have my luggage.The seating has become ridiculous… like a contest to see how narrow and short they can be made- forcing anyone over 5’1 to pay more to not be twisting oneself into a pretzel. Really insane- would have thought BA was better than this. Frankly- it cancels out a lot of the positive aspects.flight was delayed from BWI to London - missed my connecting flight & then connecting flight (also British Air) was delayed - food is awful, TV & movie selection is greatThree major things that led to my low rating, 1. Internet wasn't available for the whole time, and 2. TV became available way into flight, after numerous system reboots, and 3. Food is not good at all.Super tight economy class. My knees were hitting the back of seat in front of me (I'm only 5'6"). My small backpack (sized according to their required dimensions) would not fit under the seat in front of me because there is a box (is that the life jacket?) in the way. Over all, extremely uncomfortable. I forgive the tasteless food, but the tight seating was tortureDelta7.9United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Lufthansa6.8British Airways6.7Everything you need to know for your flight to EuropeCabin classComplete your tripFlights to other citiesOriginsPopular routesReturn flight dealsCabin class types available on flights to EuropeCabin classes available on flights to Europe.
