Other airlines should learn from them when it comes to boarding and departing from the airplane. They also display efficiency in serving meals. They don't keep the aisles blocked for hours like some other airlines. The food is poor. Generally the food was unrecognizable and poorly prepared. The only thing that made it better than US flag carriers is that there was a fresh fruit bowl with each meal.8.0 ExcellentDavid, Sep 2025SEA - TPERead more EVA Air reviewsThe crews are very efficient.

Cabin and restrooms were kept cleanVery good service and food. Crew was professional and considerate. Cabin and restrooms were kept cleanFlight Attendants could have been nicer and food portions could be bigger.Great experience, comfort and food is delicious. Always great service and one timeThe food from Los Angeles to Taipei made me throw up. The flight is also not comfort. But the staffs are very friendly and nice.Aircraft was late getting to the gate - probably due to weather. We left the gate one hour late and had to wait another hour since we lost our slot in the takeoff queue. Our box was very wet and was falling apart when we got to Clark. It appears that luggage was exposed to weather in TPE while waiting to be loaded. Crew, however, handled the delay well and was able to provide planned service.I appreciate the email reminders for online check-in which made my entry to the lines less stressful. The flight was on schedule and on time. The baording staff were proactively helpful and approachable. The airplane inflight food, entertainment and comfies as well as provisions are excellent even in the economy seating. The airline transfer was smooth and easy! Luggage safe and intact! Thank you EVA airline for making my trip a reliable safe and comfortable experience.I was sleep when they brought the food. They had put a note on my seat. There was no food when I asked for food later. There was just one main meal served in this 14 hours flight. They offered me sandwich with ham which I don’t eat since I am pescatarian. Long story short I had to wait to get to TPE to get something to eat. I am extremely disappointed from the service. I have been flying EVA since I was 1 year old. Perhaps no more EVA for me. Seems EVA glorious day is long gonebasic and only minimum of service, they offer nothing specialThey were trying to get people to check luggage because the over head compartments were full but when we boarded there were lots of empty places that people could have put the luggage.There could have been better spacing of the passengers, it was crowded in some parts of the plane then other while rows were emptyIt was good, I liked the self-serve snacks but it was a little difficult to get the alcohol, which is understandable since I wouldn't want kids sneaking it.Friendly flight attendants and gate agents. Very clean plane and food was good!I was unable to select decent seats, and so I was stuck in the middle seat because it was selected for meThere was a lot of partial tv shows but not enough to last the flight. The food was incredible! The crew were so helpful and patient. Lots more space than what I usually get on an international flight. Very comfortable!Stingy on the drinks - 15 hour direct flight and could barely get attention for some waterNot many people, so you can lay down on two seatsThe delay in Korea was a pain and set us back a day. I have to give big props to Korean Air for setting up a hotel with dinner and transportation to and from the hotel. I also needed assistance with a wheelchair and they did an outstanding job.Great except for the delay in Korea. Korean Air did a great job setting up a hotel for the night. I also needed assistance with a wheelchair and they were outstanding.I am Vegetarian also has Gluten free food. However they gave me chicken and fish which is gluten free, but i am a vegetrain and i requested crew Hindu meal vegetarian, they said they will come back. .but they never showed up even i asked 2nd time. They could have compensate. I also request airline industry to have another option Gluten Free for Vegetarin people as well. Because Vegetarin people will have gluen issue...I was only given 2 meals, and my screen showed that there were 3 meals. Second meal was 1-2 hours late according to the screen.The economy seats are incredibly tight. A large percent of the traveling public will not fit. I will not fly Cathay again because of this. You are literally squeezing passengers for profit. The CEO should fly some economy flights.Paid a premium a have a shorter transit time in Hong Kong, but Cathay pacific rebooked me and ended up waiting for 10 hrs in Hong Hong airport.Great. Efficient boarding process with the face recognition. Plenty of cabin space for luggage.Cabin crew is very helpful and nice, it is another level of service compared to Air CanadaThe only problem I had was not being able to download my boarding passes prior to arriving at the airport. Everything else was perfect.If I had blood clots, that window seat would've killed me for certain.Special request meals are really below average. Vegetarian options are very limited if you didn't prebook.I've stomach problems after 2 hours of flight, Iris, the flight purser not only did her best to make me feel comfortable, she went above and beyond providing pain relievers medicines and ointment. She look and found a doctor passenger on the flight to provide advise. She even report on ground staffs about my condition and provide wheelchair upon arrival. Kudos to her and Cathay Pacific!Terrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..We had to deboard 2 times due to maintenance issues. They changed the plane, and then we got deviated to LAX due to maibtenance issues on the other plane, had to sleep at LAX and los a full day.Everything was good, except the seats in economy were so close together, you could barely get out when the seat in front of your was reclined. If the airlines keep jamming in more and more seats, it will become intolerable. I will look for another airline that considers customer comfort and does not keep adding more rows of seats for more profit.The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Flight was good and crew was super polite. However, there were around 5 kids screaming the WHOLE 2 hours. I understand kids have to come but parents need to do something to control their children. They make the experience terrible, especially after finishing 16 hour shifts at the hospital I needed some sleep, which I did not get.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.Great service on board. Boarding a bit slow due to process. Food was pretty average.Tastless food and too obvious lack of enthusiasm for service in the economy vesus business classAll of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.I had no checked baggage but was required to hand over carry on baggage at the door of the plane. There was a lot of overboard space in the plane and I was one of the last ones. I ran to get my carry on but it was gone. I was given back at the plane door in Toronto, so the wait was not as long as it would have been at the carousel.It’s sad how legacy airlines feel like budget airlines now. Cramped space Non reclining seats No inflight entertainment (need to connect via your own device) Saving grace is the crew. Truly nice and sincere service.Short flight with limited entertainment wasn't that bad. Staff was friendly and plane was clean. Meal was good.It was great! The flight was on time and had a smoother flightCrew excellent calling me by name ! Only downside was no inflight WiFiI was glad that the plane was not totally full.Boarding and flying on time is the most important need of passengers they did thatEverything was very good but seats are small for a big man!Well, I needed to make a change to my flight and I called the airline and they said yes no problem $700 and we can do that and I agreed to it so they canceled my tickets and went to rebook and came back after being on hold for an hour and a half and said I’m sorry, sir. There was an error. It is $2800 Now and I said never mind. I will just use those flights and she proceeded to tell me that they already canceled them because I said I was interested in doing the change. I told her yes for $700. I was fine with doing a change but not $2800 so give me my tickets back and she proceeded to tell me that she could not do that and I had to pay the $2800 to get my tickets back that I already spent $2800 on. So I had to book tickets on another airline to get home And that cost a lot of money too. I’m a little pissed off at Philippine airline right now because of what they did to me and I’m not sure I ever wanna fly with them again. I’ve flown with them plenty in the past, but this just really put a bad taste in my mouth.. Not to mention on my way there leaving Seattle going to Vancouver. I got to the airport three hours in advance and they had booked me through Alaska Airlines to do that little trip. My connecting flight would leave about six hours after I got to Vancouver BC. I stood in Alaska Airlines lying for a little over two hours and then they proceeded to tell me that they couldn’t check me in because I wasn’t there an hour in advance. I kept telling the lady at the beginning of the line that I was afraid they were not gonna let me in because it was taking so long and she said oh don’t worry about it. You’re fine you’ve got time. Well I ended up spending $600 to get to Canada that night just to make my connecting flight because Alaska air wouldn’t do anything and Filipino Air told me it was Alaska air problem but Alaska air said since you booked through Philippine air, we can’t fix it. I had about 50 minutes to make my flight, but they refused to check me in because I wasn’t there an hour in advance yet. I’ve been standing in their line for about two hours and 15 minutes.reach the standard, crew tried to fix up issues fast.Overall the flight was a good experience. It is different from American Airlines because they board the back of the plane first rather than the front first. Food was decent. They gave out pillows ,blankets , and face masks. I did find this airline had faster flights back home than others.
