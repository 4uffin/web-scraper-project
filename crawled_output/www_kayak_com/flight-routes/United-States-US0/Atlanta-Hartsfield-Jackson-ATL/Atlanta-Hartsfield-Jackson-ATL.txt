The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!10.0 ExcellentG, Sep 2025LAS - ATLRead more Southwest reviewsI wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Three seats in first class were broken and while they were able to still acommodate us it was looking very touch and go and they had others they could not acommodateThey made us board and then deboard due to mechanical issue which delayed the departure by almost 2 hours and we barely made our connecting flight. These quality checks should've been done before boarding not after.I liked the friendliness of the staff. The cleanliness of all 3 planes.Flight was delayed, 30+ bags had to be gate checked. Crew were very friendly!Everything was good until we were boarding our connection flight in Atlanta, we were told to gate check our carry-on, but when we got inside the plane, there was plenty of room in the overhead.Very late arrival at PWM. Late jet getting to ATL. Equipment problem with aircraft - could not get enough water onto plane., Another delay getting FAA approval for flight with bottled H2O. Not the crew’s problem.After all the weather issues at least they got me to my destination the next dayFrom Atlanta to Savannah - flight connection was way to short (we weren't even late landing ) and flight was already boarding when we landed - we were told we were the last on board and so we had to gate check our bags. Once we got on the plane, there were at least seven open bag spots so that was unnecessary delay. There should be better communication between the gate agent and the crew.Crew was excellent. Comfort seats not as nice as other kinds of planes.American almost always Delays flights from Austin to Dallas and back. I cannot believe they have such poor service on this route. I was about to switch to American from Delta, but they gave me enough reasons not to.Lost bag and 2 days no word leaving for cruise no clothes or stuffGiven it’s a red-eye into Charolotte, we didn’t get any food. The survey does not include “N/A” so the rating will be skewed.Great. Quick and quiet and east. The breakfast choices were a welcome surprise!American airlines suck they delay the flights all the time made me sleep in an airport because my flight was delayed and I miss my connecting flightThere's nothing I liked about it. For first off I scheduled this trip two weeks in advance then they delayed my flight which messed up my whole trip. So I scheduled it for the following weekend thinking there won't be a delay and guess what as soon as I got to the airport we said in the airplane on the tarmac for an hour and a half. Not only was it delayed I missed my connecting flight meaning I had to stay the night at Dallas-Fort Worth airport sleeping on the floor. I will tell you this I will never fly American airlines ever again I have had nothing but horrible experience with them and I just throw money at themThe stewardess hit me with the food kart twice on the head and didn't say I'm sorry once. The same stewardess gave me a warm Apple Juice with No ice. The Flight was delayed for Departure 6 times, starting from 2:36pm, finally taking off 7:50pm. I was late picking up my child from the sitter by 3 hours.Having to reschedule flights a day later, they loaded by luggage on the wrong plane from Little rock now I have to HOPE they deliver it to where im staying like they said would. International flight crew was very disgruntled and not very friendly.We will be writing a long, detailed letter to corporate about our awful experience with American airlines.It took way too long to diagnose and solve the problem of a broken crew member cabin seat. Though compensation for the volunteer who left the flight was very kind.Didn’t like that we weren’t even offered a water. And really didn’t like the male flight attendant, he had major attitude. The flight however was good, pilots got us there in time safely.The seats are too small the plane makes weird noise when landing 🛬I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm.

Very unhappy and very poor service.Spirit rescheduled a 4:30 PM flight to 8:52 AM. That's ridiculous and borderline fraud.Everything was fine. I'm average height and I pack light. I'm ready for my Spirit flight.Changing the flight time to 6:15 am on the return flight is extremely inconvenient. The flight was okay. It was on time. The crew was friendly. The seats were uncomfortable. All the upsells are annoying, and I would prefer paying a single higher fee and not have to purchase so much extra.Spirit Airlines was ok but TRAVELHELPDESK, the 3rd party travel agent IS A JOKE! VERY RUDE CUSTOMER AGENTS ont he phone. NO HELP AT ALL. But the airlines was ok.Cancelled my flight last minute and did not help me rebook. It was a horrible experience.No frills - because you get what you pay for. The crew was amazing!! I had plenty of room to spread out because the flight was half full. Which made it easy to sleep.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Southwest8.0Delta7.9American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Traveling to a place near Atlanta?Book flights to Atlanta if you plan to visit one of these locationsAthensCollege ParkLa GrangeConyersStockbridgeBraseltonSmyrnaCantonRoswellOxfordLithoniaCommercePine MountainLocust GroveSuwaneeForsythSnellvilleUnion CityPeachtree CornersForest ParkEverything you need to know for your flight to AtlantaAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsPopular routesReturn flight dealsFlights with popular airlines flying to AtlantaFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from the United States to Atlanta according to KAYAK users.
