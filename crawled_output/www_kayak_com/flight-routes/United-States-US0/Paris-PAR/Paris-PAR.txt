There was either a so so chicken dish or a “ vegetarian “ option which was really cheap carbohydrates drowned in cheese. Signing onto i flight wifi was not straightforward. Overall it was a very average experienceThe staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.I bought business class tickets but the seats are exactly like economy with no comfort seats nor an empty seat next to me provided. Very poor, low quality airline.I don't understand the concept of paying to get your personal luggage onboard and then asked to check it in.... either sell the space or don't, its a hassle to carry those all through the airport just to make a check in at the last minute.The food was great and the service and attitude was amazing!!It was a great experience. The only thing I would have changed was that the bathrooms were never cleaned and they got very dirty.Old airplanes small seats expensive tickets, not as expected overall and not comfortable according to the priceIt was an OK flight with below mediocre service by their flight attendantsWasted a lot of time trying to find the CDG lounge - it was not next to the connecting flight gate like the Air France staff said.My experience was good overall, the quality of the food really decreased! There used to be a choice between meat and fish now it’s between chicken and pasta! In the choices of entertainment meditation has been added which is very good. Soft chair workout to improve blood circulation and avoid phlebitis should be added.The only reason the overall rating wasn't "excellent" was due to problems in claiming luggage. The bags are delivered to the main area (Cinta 35) for domestic passengers, but to a DIFFERENT ROOM for international arrivees. After waiting 30 minutes, someone (who didn't appear to be from Air France or the airport) told us to go to another area. There we found our bags, which appeared to have been awaiting us for a while. We had to go through a bag check before leaving the airport. If we had been alerted to this possibility, or better yet, been to go directly to Cinta 34, we could have eliminated quite a bit of waiting.Much better than the major US Carriers especially in Biz Class.Terrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..We had to deboard 2 times due to maintenance issues. They changed the plane, and then we got deviated to LAX due to maibtenance issues on the other plane, had to sleep at LAX and los a full day.Everything was good, except the seats in economy were so close together, you could barely get out when the seat in front of your was reclined. If the airlines keep jamming in more and more seats, it will become intolerable. I will look for another airline that considers customer comfort and does not keep adding more rows of seats for more profit.The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Flight was good and crew was super polite. However, there were around 5 kids screaming the WHOLE 2 hours. I understand kids have to come but parents need to do something to control their children. They make the experience terrible, especially after finishing 16 hour shifts at the hospital I needed some sleep, which I did not get.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.Great service on board. Boarding a bit slow due to process. Food was pretty average.Tastless food and too obvious lack of enthusiasm for service in the economy vesus business classAll of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.I had no checked baggage but was required to hand over carry on baggage at the door of the plane. There was a lot of overboard space in the plane and I was one of the last ones. I ran to get my carry on but it was gone. I was given back at the plane door in Toronto, so the wait was not as long as it would have been at the carousel.The overpriced dinner was pasta, bread and an awfully sweet dessert…. a feast of inexpensive carbs. She was the exception, but one flight attendant was incredibly rude. Cheap ticket though.Terminal experiences, including departure and deplaning were the weak points of our trip. Appreciated that premium passengers boarded and deplaned in group 1, but experience with buses did not feel premium. Terminals used at CDG and JFK had old, limited facilities and no good lounges. In flight experience was good and crew worked hard.It was very uncomfortable. I would never book any flights with Norse anymore .The flight attendants were extremely rude. I hate the culture of Norse air. Their is nothing really economical about it, the flights are slightly less expensive than average but it doesn’t justify no food, no blankets or pillows - my god you have to pay extra just to make your already over crowded no leg room flight just comfortable enough to be enjoyable. As if travel isn’t hard enough already. You have to pay extra to pick a seat so if you really are on a tight budget you’ll be left with the most uncomfortable, saddest flight of your life while the flight attendants treats you like the steerage on the HMS Titanic."I felt uncomfortable. It's well known that Norway is a racist country. As soon as they detected my accent, they were very rude."Norse is one of those airlines that sells the luggage and the good seats if you want them but otherwise the prices are great. It was very comfortable, the crew was great, and the food was actually good. I will take it again.Everything was good during the flight. But it's the only flight that I have experienced where food is not included not even drinks or even water unless you pay for it. For such a long trip to not offer even a glass of water I think it's very extreme!There should be an app so I can check in before I get to the airport and get a mobile ticket. There should also be wifi on the plane.When you book economy it says you can have a carry on bag, but when you check in all of a sudden the economy becomes 4 different types and you get charged extra, that’s not fare. Also there’s no option to check in online. Wouldn’t recommendNo online check in, so you and three hundred others are queuing at JFK at 5 check in counters. The employees are well organized and keep it moving, doing the best they can with an inefficient system. No blankets or pillows on the seven hour overnight flight and they kept the lights on for 2 hours for a flight that took off at 1am. Seemingly didn’t even have beverage service, and of course you have to pay for food (expected). The worst $1200 I’ve spent.The French bee web site kept telling me my luggage was free when trying to attempt to buy it 48 hours in advance. When i check in the price is now double and the site said because I didn’t pay for the luggage. Very disappointing when explaining that to their customer service and showing screen shots where there site said it was free therefore not allowing me to pre purchase. Seems scammy and I was surprised after showing them the screen shots they did not reimburse me for the double charge. I would have gladly paid $70 but 140 was insane seeing how I did everything I was supposed to and their site was at fault.Excellent-boarding was quick and efficient, plenty of room in board. Friendly crewBest price around. The food has gotten worse,,,might actually be better to board with one's own food... On time, professional staff at airport and on board.I received an email and text message from French Bee less than 24 hours prior to my flight that there was a flight change. That flight change indicated that my flight had already left yet the message went out just under an hour before the new departure time. When calling French Bee staff (located in Texas so open at central time) they only said “sorry for the inconvenience “ and never offered or supplied information about a rebooking or what took place even when asked. They had a very blasé attitude about the entire situation. I had to buy a ticket on another airline because I was not told what was going on! A ticket to fly internationally on the same day!!!$$$$$$ so disappointingThe seating on my French Bee flight was exceedingly uncomfortable, resulting in significant discomfort. I experienced considerable pain in both my back and feet throughout the journey. food I would rate it below 0. Crew are professional. And most importantly we arrived safe.Check in was in time. No free food. Not even water. Was asked to pay for water. Disgusting!I know this is a stripped down airline but I didn’t expect it to be so difficult to avoid the “up charges.” I was naive when planning and checking in for my flight to Paris from Newark and they got me on the outrageous $90 in cabin carry on bag charge at the gate. But on my return flight I did everything possible to pay in advance (you have a short window to do this 48 hours before the flight departure) for that same in cabin bag so the charge would be $45 instead. It was not to be. In spite of a confirmation email that they had “added a service “ and the $45 carry on bag was accounted for, my boarding pass did not reflect that and I was charged the full amount at the gate. It adds insult to injury that the French Bee staff is gleeful when they are successfully working this nefarious up charging scam. They couldn’t care less about their customers. Very disappointed with this airline and will not be flying French Bee anytime in the future. Do NOT recommend.Economy seats are too tight for a long haul flight. The meal was surprisingly good, though it was surprising to learn that even coffee and tea were extra pay. They also don’t distribute water regularly.Overall impression - very bad. There is not even free water on the plane and the seats are so uncomfortable that after 7.5 hours of flight my back was just falling apart. Never pay extra for "Private" seats. It's just that part of the regular cabin is separated by curtains. This does not give any effect. Money for nothing.Expensive long flight from SFO to PPT. Even at basic fare its very expensive given what you get and you get absolutely nothing... they even charge for the water...and if you are not french the crew will treat you like a intruder...very bad experience during my worlwide travel experience...Delta7.9Air France7.4United Airlines7.4Norse Atlantic Airways7.0French Bee6.0Traveling to a place near Paris?Book flights to Paris if you plan to visit one of these locationsRoissy-en-FranceChessyTremblay-en-FranceVersaillesMagny-le-HongreCourbevoieSerrisSaint-DenisVanvesIssy-les-MoulineauxFontainebleauOrléansNeuilly-sur-SeineBeauvaisNanterreLevallois-PerretSaint-OuenSaint-QuentinTroyesVincennesEverything you need to know for your flight to ParisAirlinesCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsPopular routesReturn flight dealsFlights with popular airlines flying to ParisFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from the United States to Paris according to KAYAK users.
