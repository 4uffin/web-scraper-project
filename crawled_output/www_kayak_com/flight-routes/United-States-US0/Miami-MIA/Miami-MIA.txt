Luckily it wasn’t a long flight6.0 GoodAnonymous, Sep 2025ATL - MDWRead more Delta reviewsCramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneAlways good but we must do something about people in rows ahead of you that don't put their seats back up when they are suppose to. And It's rough to not be able to even lean over to get something out of my purse.Check in was quick and easy during early hours. Flight was on time, and customer services was a plus.Terrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Flight was good and crew was super polite. However, there were around 5 kids screaming the WHOLE 2 hours. I understand kids have to come but parents need to do something to control their children. They make the experience terrible, especially after finishing 16 hour shifts at the hospital I needed some sleep, which I did not get.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.All of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.Armrest controller on my seat 35D and nextbooennseat 35E did not work right. Hard to press buttons to recognize and 35D had constantnpressure either upmost down somit was nearly impossible to make selections. .I flew with my dog and had already purchased my dog’s ticket. Even that morning I had called costumer service to insure that my husband and I had seats together since the website was giving me an error when choosing our seats and the representative mentioned our dog. I showed up early to the airport and when I got to the gate and we started boarding I was help back and told that I was supposed to have a yellow tag and that I should have checked in at the counter for them to give me that tag. I was not aware of this, the representative on the phone did not say anything. Nor did I see it anywhere in the checking process online, so if you travel with a pet and are not checking in luggage, just know that you still have to go to the check in counter when arriving at the airport unless you want to be the last one to board and not have room for your carry on in the overhead bins. Other than that, I had a great experience.Once we got in the air the pilot made up some of the time of the delay. So that was really nice.I understand stuff happens, but plane failures are likely due to lack of maintenance. Additionally, air conditioning wasn't working, no snack/drink service, no WiFi. Fortunately, the crew was communicative and light-hearted. United grabbed another plane and we were able to get to our destination.While waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.This flight never occurred because AA couldn’t get their act together.During service there was a garbage/beverage spill near our seats that never was cleaned up. On a relatively short flight when we’re fortunate enough to actually have in flight movies available, the flight attendants pitching the AADVANTAGE credit card shouldn’t talk for the last 10 minutes of the flight so that we miss the end of the movie.The boarding was pretty easy. However, the first class seats are not lay flat as other airlines (like JetBlue) has and therefore sleeping was a challenge.Would have thought that they would gas up plane before everyone got on boardThe flights were terribly delayed and then cancelled which forced us booking another night at the hotel. Very poor management from American AirlinesCrew was late. Baggage was late. 2hs inside the plane waiting fro de-icing and traffic. A 3:30hs flight ended up being almost 6hs inside the airplane.Checking in at the counter was very disappointing. The lady had a very bad attitude and smart at me. She had no smile, did not greet me by name, or acknowledge me as a valued customer. Poor reflection of the airline.Miami lounges were overcrowded and we were unable to get in. We only had a short time. But the banks are too tight in all American hubsBoarded over an hour late, no communication, the sign just changed, no attendant to answer questions - she disappeared forever (hiding). Small plane and couldn’t hear the overhead nor understand.My initial flight got overbooked whilst waiting at the gate, and they rebooked me on a later INDIRECT flight!. No offer of a refundDon't board the plane and have us sit for 2 hours and go nowhere!I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm.

Very unhappy and very poor service.Everything was fine. I'm average height and I pack light. I'm ready for my Spirit flight.Wow truly top notch airline Efficient nice snacks courteous staff Fast boarding !My experience with Spirit was good, but the experience with Kayak was not. Based on the Spirit agent Kayak added an additional charge after purchasing the tickets. When I buy the tickets I paid the total amount and I only pay once. This time they added an additional charge because based on Spirit they partially charge the tickets and I still needed to pay a second time. This is not good at all and UnprofessionalSpirit gets such a bad rap. I have never had a bad experience with them and the crew is always friendly and funny. This trip I had knee replacement surgery surgery 10 weeks ago. It is still a little rough to get get from point a to point b. And Spirit was on top of it. When there was a seat available the stewardess asked me if I wanted to move to an open seat so I could elevate my leg on the empty seat? 5 stars all around. They helped me on and helped me off the plane. I can’t say enough about the crew!!This gate agents are always so rude! I stopped flirting with spirit years ago for that reason I thought it would change by now. It’s so tacky they try to treat you like a school child i hate itThe staff was very sarcastic, the flight was delayed. There was no wi-fi o any type of entertainment. The plane was dirty and we have to wait a long time for the luggage to come out.Frontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.I was 2 hr arrive in the airport and 45 min in the line . After take to my turn . The agent tell me I’m later . I can not board . So my vacation was going to the floor . Just for their bad customer service agent in the airline2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.Since you have to pay for overhead bags then they shouldn't be running out of space and asking individuals who paid to remove stuff from the overheadBook with frontier airlines with the mentality that they'll cancel your flight, kick you off and lose your luggage. Anything besides that is a win. Compare prices with other airlines (to include luggage) and if frontier is still worth it, book it but know all of their policies.You get what you pay for nothing essentially but a hard uncomfortable seat that doesn’t recline and kids screaming all around you and chaotic boarding and limited check bag weight allowance when compared to other airlinesNot very good. Paid in excess of $400 for assigned seating for my family and that was not provided. I want that money back.I chose the seats when booked the flight and paid for them. However after checking in I found we were assigned different seats!Delta7.9United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Traveling to a place near Miami?Book flights to Miami if you plan to visit one of these locationsPalm BeachDoralDania BeachMiami SpringsSurfsideLauderdale-by-the-SeaPlantationMiramarBay Harbor IslandsPembroke PinesMiami GardensKey BiscayneKendallRiviera BeachHialeahLantanaHighland BeachWilton ManorsCoconut CreekKey Colony BeachEverything you need to know for your flight to MiamiAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsPopular routesReturn flight dealsFlights with popular airlines flying to MiamiFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from the United States to Miami according to KAYAK users.
