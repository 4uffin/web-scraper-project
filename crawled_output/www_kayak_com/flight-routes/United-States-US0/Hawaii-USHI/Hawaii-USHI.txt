What a light touch. And I’m an avid traveler!10.0 ExcellentElizabeth, Sep 2025PDX - HNLRead more Alaska Airlines reviewsThe pilot performed the smoothest landing I’ve ever experienced. What a light touch. And I’m an avid traveler!Terrible. Would never fly again. Took them several hours to prepare the plane and and reached my destination 4 hours late.Our boarding was delayed due to two flat tires, but I appreciate the focus on safety. I also appreciated the additional offerings for drinks which never happened before except on Hawaiian Airlines. The hospitality is fantastic! Glad I upgraded to premium seats for the extra leg room as I was getting frustrated when the person in front of me was very restless and kept shifting. Otherwise, it was a fantastic experience.Had to sit and wait to get off the plane for closeto a hour. My son also flying to a different destination that day also had like a 2.5 hr delayTickets we booked together in January became two different connecting flights. VERY PISSED a about this and a terrible start to our bucket list vacationCould not check in online - had to get boarding passes at the ticket counter and our daughter got bumped off our connecting flight. NOT OK!I needed more space to sleep on an overnight flight.Our flight time was drastically changed which caused us to lose a day of vacationWonderful respectful staff for a short flight late at night...lots of considerations all met!Flight was delayed which led to missed connection, but rebooked on a more direct flight at the last minute and arrived in Juneau on time with all our luggage. Little stressful and our family seating got split, but it all worked out in the end.Cramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneThree seats in first class were broken and while they were able to still acommodate us it was looking very touch and go and they had others they could not acommodateVery accommodating on flight changes when something came up. Definitely felt a notch above other airlines.They we able to seat my companion and I next to each other. Plane’s temperature was very cool. Willl be more prepared on return trip.What an amazing flight. I haven’t experienced this level of service in a flight in years. This will be the only way to fly to Hawaii for me in the future.Love you guys are so friendly and kind and wonderfulHawaiian airlines has awful customer service. Told me to keep a flight I wasn’t boarding, instead of rebooking me under two separate reservations, which caused my whole reservation to be canceled. Major issues with leadership and management. The staff at Hilo was reluctant to give me a refund, so I had to by a first class ticket in order to get on a flight the same time as my partner. The blame was pointed at me without sincere apology until the supervisor came out, who also apparently had no authority to refund me. Still waiting on correspondence from the airline days later.I could not believe that on a 5 hour plus flight we were not given a complimentary meal . That should be illegal. Or it would be nice to be informed beforehand that a complimentary meal would not be provided. The wording in the email I got about pre ordering food was phrased in a way that made the food seem like it would be free. Very misleading! Also during boarding we were informed there would be empty seats we could move to if we wanted, all we had to do was wait for an announcement, however an announcement was never made. Then when we tried to change seats ourselves we were singled out over the loud speaker and told we could not move without asking. Then the flight was about to take off , so we didn’t have time to ask . Then we were told we could not move to the exit row because you had to pay for those seats, but we were not told where we could move. Also no one was in the exit rows so , if something happened no one would be there to assist the passengers. Also people should be allowed to move there if the airline wasn’t able to sell them. One passenger asked if he could pay for the upgrade and the flight attendant said she did not have the capability to charge for the seat on her mobile device, so the airline ended up losing possible income anyways . So why not let people move there during flight if you have no way to charge them? Then the landing was bumpy and awful and many passengers complained out loud when we landed .The flight was great! The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. I would definitely fly Hawaiian Aurlines again!You have to buy the ear buds and they only offers little cup of water twice.Flight was on time, crew was friendly and prompt with the service. The only thing that could be improved is the seat space, but that's wishful thinkingCons: Rode a newer Airbus - had the same rattle in the panels above my seat (plastics not secure b/t lighting and panels) as the last Airbus I rode. Cabin was quite warm, borderline hot. Asked to pay for headphones. And the reason I am writing this - when we arrived it took over 20 minutes to get our door open due to nobody on the ground ready for arrival. Likes: Staff was friendly, helpful, and professional. Sandwich was quite good.Check in was quick and easy during early hours. Flight was on time, and customer services was a plus.Terrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Flight was good and crew was super polite. However, there were around 5 kids screaming the WHOLE 2 hours. I understand kids have to come but parents need to do something to control their children. They make the experience terrible, especially after finishing 16 hour shifts at the hospital I needed some sleep, which I did not get.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.All of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.Armrest controller on my seat 35D and nextbooennseat 35E did not work right. Hard to press buttons to recognize and 35D had constantnpressure either upmost down somit was nearly impossible to make selections. .I flew with my dog and had already purchased my dog’s ticket. Even that morning I had called costumer service to insure that my husband and I had seats together since the website was giving me an error when choosing our seats and the representative mentioned our dog. I showed up early to the airport and when I got to the gate and we started boarding I was help back and told that I was supposed to have a yellow tag and that I should have checked in at the counter for them to give me that tag. I was not aware of this, the representative on the phone did not say anything. Nor did I see it anywhere in the checking process online, so if you travel with a pet and are not checking in luggage, just know that you still have to go to the check in counter when arriving at the airport unless you want to be the last one to board and not have room for your carry on in the overhead bins. Other than that, I had a great experience.Once we got in the air the pilot made up some of the time of the delay. So that was really nice.I understand stuff happens, but plane failures are likely due to lack of maintenance. Additionally, air conditioning wasn't working, no snack/drink service, no WiFi. Fortunately, the crew was communicative and light-hearted. United grabbed another plane and we were able to get to our destination.Excellent - explanations were clear staff was nice and flight was comfortableThe flight was fine. This survey is not. There is no option for N/A so items which don’t apply to my experience still must be rated. In those instances I give a “3” rating which ultimately skews the results.The actual trip was fine, however, the changes made to our flights and the layovers were had to endure were awful.They only offered water for Group 6. Awful announcements from the Crew. Couldn't understand a single word. Barely came by for the trash afterwards. Man, I love water for a premium flight. Wow. Water in a cup.Flight from Dallas to OKC was good, but my trip was interrupted due to a delayed flight from Austin to DFW, which happens all the time. I frequently miss my connection from DFW and American can never seem to make this work!Because the plane was 90 degrees F, they would not let us board. I wish they had, because it meant we were delayed. It's Texas, of course it's hot. We would have survived.Wish they had the seat-back video screens for watching movies or playing games.Full flight so overhead bin space ran out & bags had to be checked. When you’re in the last boarding group, you might as well expect that. Don’t pay to check bags though because when they run out of space for carry-ons, they check your bag to your destination for free. When traveling with children, no need to pay extra for seats, they will assign seats & have to sit your children with you.The seats in economy were appeared to be quite thin and lack sufficient cushioning to be comfortable. Perhaps it was my seating position but the plane seemed notably load.Very good but wish they had the seat-back video screens for movies & gamesAlaska Airlines8.0Delta7.9Hawaiian Airlines7.8United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Everything you need to know for your flight to HawaiiCabin classComplete your tripFlights to other citiesOriginsPopular routesReturn flight dealsCabin class types available on flights to HawaiiCabin classes available on flights to Hawaii.
