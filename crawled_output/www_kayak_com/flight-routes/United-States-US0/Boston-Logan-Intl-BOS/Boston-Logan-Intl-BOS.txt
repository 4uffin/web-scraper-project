Luckily it wasn’t a long flight6.0 GoodAnonymous, Sep 2025ATL - MDWRead more Delta reviewsCramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneThree seats in first class were broken and while they were able to still acommodate us it was looking very touch and go and they had others they could not acommodateTerrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Flight was good and crew was super polite. However, there were around 5 kids screaming the WHOLE 2 hours. I understand kids have to come but parents need to do something to control their children. They make the experience terrible, especially after finishing 16 hour shifts at the hospital I needed some sleep, which I did not get.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.All of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.Armrest controller on my seat 35D and nextbooennseat 35E did not work right. Hard to press buttons to recognize and 35D had constantnpressure either upmost down somit was nearly impossible to make selections. .I flew with my dog and had already purchased my dog’s ticket. Even that morning I had called costumer service to insure that my husband and I had seats together since the website was giving me an error when choosing our seats and the representative mentioned our dog. I showed up early to the airport and when I got to the gate and we started boarding I was help back and told that I was supposed to have a yellow tag and that I should have checked in at the counter for them to give me that tag. I was not aware of this, the representative on the phone did not say anything. Nor did I see it anywhere in the checking process online, so if you travel with a pet and are not checking in luggage, just know that you still have to go to the check in counter when arriving at the airport unless you want to be the last one to board and not have room for your carry on in the overhead bins. Other than that, I had a great experience.Once we got in the air the pilot made up some of the time of the delay. So that was really nice.I understand stuff happens, but plane failures are likely due to lack of maintenance. Additionally, air conditioning wasn't working, no snack/drink service, no WiFi. Fortunately, the crew was communicative and light-hearted. United grabbed another plane and we were able to get to our destination.There was no food available for this red eye... one little waffle cookie for a 6+ hour flight... thank God I was able to sleep someThey only offered water for Group 6. Awful announcements from the Crew. Couldn't understand a single word. Barely came by for the trash afterwards. Man, I love water for a premium flight. Wow. Water in a cup.Flight from Dallas to OKC was good, but my trip was interrupted due to a delayed flight from Austin to DFW, which happens all the time. I frequently miss my connection from DFW and American can never seem to make this work!Because the plane was 90 degrees F, they would not let us board. I wish they had, because it meant we were delayed. It's Texas, of course it's hot. We would have survived.Wish they had the seat-back video screens for watching movies or playing games.Full flight so overhead bin space ran out & bags had to be checked. When you’re in the last boarding group, you might as well expect that. Don’t pay to check bags though because when they run out of space for carry-ons, they check your bag to your destination for free. When traveling with children, no need to pay extra for seats, they will assign seats & have to sit your children with you.The seats in economy were appeared to be quite thin and lack sufficient cushioning to be comfortable. Perhaps it was my seating position but the plane seemed notably load.Very good but wish they had the seat-back video screens for movies & gamesMost things were ok but the main problem was the cabin staff; they were very abrupt and not very friendly. They were busy and often rushed, snatching drinks off people before finished and bossing them about.American almost always Delays flights from Austin to Dallas and back. I cannot believe they have such poor service on this route. I was about to switch to American from Delta, but they gave me enough reasons not to.Lost bag and 2 days no word leaving for cruise no clothes or stuffEverything was great. I liked the text updates so that I never miss a gate change & I have all the latest info.I don’t usually fly budget airlines or airlines in the United States. It was as good as any other airline. The seats are comfortable and the airline attendants are not rude & surly. Very nice flight (s).They have the most inexperienced / rude flight staff I’ve encounteredvery difficult boarding process - aggressive passengers not the friendliest crewWiFi was not eorkig (again) And the plane was from 1990 with the screens which were.not touch and most didn’t even work and if lucky could tune in tvI paid extra for a seat closer to the front. The TV didn’t work at all for the entire flight. Would have been nice to know before I purchased an “upgraded “ seatIt was great. I had never flown on JetBlue before, but would be very happy to fly with them in the future.Worst flight experience ever flights canceled. JetBlue told us just did not even bother standing in line to come back in one and a half hours then without any information we had to go pick up all of our luggage and spend over $2000 in accommodation just to get home. JetBlue said that the next flight available for us to get home would be three days later. Absolutely absurd hasn’t offered to give us any compensation do not fly JetBlue horrible company. They said it was based on the weather and the weather is great in all locations that we would’ve been flying to total hoax. I think it’s a conspiracy theory.The captain gave good announcements and the flight attendants were friendly. The WiFi was pretty good. The plane itself looked very old inside and the seats were very uncomfortable. The screens in the seat backs were the smallest I’ve ever seen. There were so many loud and obnoxious kids on this flight and the parents didn’t do much to try to quiet them down. Some had videos and games on tablets with higher than necessary volume going the whole time.Too many long delays with JetBlue. Worst major airline that serves JFK but unfortunately I keep going back because of the prices.Flight was canceled without warning, gave credit that is hard to access. Awful airline.Flight was cancelled without warning close to flight date. Stuck witha credit has to buy a new ticket from another airline in either to get to location. Email cancelling was lost in mail.Don't board the plane and have us sit for 2 hours and go nowhere!Flight was good and on time. Everyone was nice. Seats aren't very comfortableDidn’t like that we weren’t even offered a water. And really didn’t like the male flight attendant, he had major attitude. The flight however was good, pilots got us there in time safely.The seats are too small the plane makes weird noise when landing 🛬I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm.
