No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Check in was quick and easy during early hours. Flight was on time, and customer services was a plus.Terrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..We had to deboard 2 times due to maintenance issues. They changed the plane, and then we got deviated to LAX due to maibtenance issues on the other plane, had to sleep at LAX and los a full day.Everything was good, except the seats in economy were so close together, you could barely get out when the seat in front of your was reclined. If the airlines keep jamming in more and more seats, it will become intolerable. I will look for another airline that considers customer comfort and does not keep adding more rows of seats for more profit.The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Flight was good and crew was super polite. However, there were around 5 kids screaming the WHOLE 2 hours. I understand kids have to come but parents need to do something to control their children. They make the experience terrible, especially after finishing 16 hour shifts at the hospital I needed some sleep, which I did not get.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.Great service on board. Boarding a bit slow due to process. Food was pretty average.Tastless food and too obvious lack of enthusiasm for service in the economy vesus business classAll of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.The overpriced dinner was pasta, bread and an awfully sweet dessert…. a feast of inexpensive carbs. She was the exception, but one flight attendant was incredibly rude. Cheap ticket though.Terminal experiences, including departure and deplaning were the weak points of our trip. Appreciated that premium passengers boarded and deplaned in group 1, but experience with buses did not feel premium. Terminals used at CDG and JFK had old, limited facilities and no good lounges. In flight experience was good and crew worked hard.It was very uncomfortable. I would never book any flights with Norse anymore .The flight attendants were extremely rude. I hate the culture of Norse air. Their is nothing really economical about it, the flights are slightly less expensive than average but it doesn’t justify no food, no blankets or pillows - my god you have to pay extra just to make your already over crowded no leg room flight just comfortable enough to be enjoyable. As if travel isn’t hard enough already. You have to pay extra to pick a seat so if you really are on a tight budget you’ll be left with the most uncomfortable, saddest flight of your life while the flight attendants treats you like the steerage on the HMS Titanic."I felt uncomfortable. It's well known that Norway is a racist country. As soon as they detected my accent, they were very rude."Norse is one of those airlines that sells the luggage and the good seats if you want them but otherwise the prices are great. It was very comfortable, the crew was great, and the food was actually good. I will take it again.Everything was good during the flight. But it's the only flight that I have experienced where food is not included not even drinks or even water unless you pay for it. For such a long trip to not offer even a glass of water I think it's very extreme!There should be an app so I can check in before I get to the airport and get a mobile ticket. There should also be wifi on the plane.When you book economy it says you can have a carry on bag, but when you check in all of a sudden the economy becomes 4 different types and you get charged extra, that’s not fare. Also there’s no option to check in online. Wouldn’t recommendNo online check in, so you and three hundred others are queuing at JFK at 5 check in counters. The employees are well organized and keep it moving, doing the best they can with an inefficient system. No blankets or pillows on the seven hour overnight flight and they kept the lights on for 2 hours for a flight that took off at 1am. Seemingly didn’t even have beverage service, and of course you have to pay for food (expected). The worst $1200 I’ve spent.Staff were nice, we left on time and arrived early, food was good. Unfortunately, they lost one of our bags and have been unable to find it. So we are in Italy for a week for my husband‘s birthday and he does not have any of his clothing.They gave us sandwiches as a meal twice. Snacks mid flight with cookies and a tuna panini. Then just the same tuna panini for dinner. That was it.Top notch re cleanliness, comfort, operational. Attendants attentive, cheerful, courteous and professional. An unusually high-grade experience all around.The staff was very good, the only thing was the air conditioning wasn't working during the boarding process so it was very hot inside the plane until we got airborne. The food wasn't great, the chicken was dry and hard to cut, the ravioli was ok and the little pizza pocket thing was pretty bad. Other than that is was a good flight all aroundBetter consideration for families traveling with a disabled person. They insisted each person hold their own boarding pass on their own devices and gave us a hard time accepting eight boarding passes on a single device.Two of my four flights had issues with toilets either NOT fully operational or completely out of order. Boarding was a joke because they have NOT established who is running the show. In the end, she did a terrible job. The seats 💺 were loose goose and the drinks and snacks were limiting in choices. Also, following Alitalia as an inspiration was strange since they went out of business.We had a 3 hour delay and then a long taxi to take off. It would have been helpful for the pilot to have communicated more about what was going on. There was no A/C during the wait, and the cabin must have been more than 85 to 90 degrees. The crew gave water to the people in the front but by the time they go to the back of the plane they stopped giving out water. Eventually I went back and asked for some in the rear of the plane (for a second time). The food was close to inedible. I thought on an Italian flight that the pasta would be better than the chick, but honestly, a Swanson's TV dinner would have been better. I had a bite or two to keep my blood sugar up, but basically I couldn't eat it.Boarding was chaotic. Service was poor. Attendant was slow and rude. In business class, I was not offered a drink until 1.5 hrs,after takeoff. Food was inedible.Terrible. They canceled 2 flights and then sent everyone by BUS from Rome. They should make amends by offering some sort of compensation.We ordered a gluten free meal and never got it!Need to offer Better food from LAX to London Service from London to Delhi very delayed after take off.Connection at Hethrow was horrible..We couldn't get out of the plane for an hour as they were buying people to the airport and there were not enough busses. We had 2 and half hf between flights so it was very tight. After departing plane we had to go thru security again. People with less time in between connections missed their flightsPoor all around experience. Sat at gate in Grand Rapids to Chicago for 2.5 hours. No food or water offered and no allowances to use restroom. Missed connecting flight to London and not offered any compensation including food or lodging. Not happy with AA, claims delay was weather related but no weather issues seen on radar. Take ownership for real reason behind delay which was actually the IT outage. Very disappointing and will not be recommending AA for domestic or international flights if this is the way that customers are treated.Horrible… I was downgraded without notice, had to sit in economy and given my back injury was in pain most of the journey. I expect to be reimbursed for this inconvenience and after my return flight home, I never plan to fly with British Airways again.Great crew and food and beverage. Seating tight but not the airline's fault. Will definitely fly BA in future!Flight cancelled, lost luggage, crappy meal voucher. Nothing was good. Still dont have my luggage.The seating has become ridiculous… like a contest to see how narrow and short they can be made- forcing anyone over 5’1 to pay more to not be twisting oneself into a pretzel. Really insane- would have thought BA was better than this. Frankly- it cancels out a lot of the positive aspects.flight was delayed from BWI to London - missed my connecting flight & then connecting flight (also British Air) was delayed - food is awful, TV & movie selection is greatThree major things that led to my low rating, 1. Internet wasn't available for the whole time, and 2. TV became available way into flight, after numerous system reboots, and 3. Food is not good at all.Super tight economy class. My knees were hitting the back of seat in front of me (I'm only 5'6"). My small backpack (sized according to their required dimensions) would not fit under the seat in front of me because there is a box (is that the life jacket?) in the way. Over all, extremely uncomfortable. I forgive the tasteless food, but the tight seating was tortureDelta7.9United Airlines7.4Norse Atlantic Airways7.0ITA Airways6.7British Airways6.7Traveling to a place near Rome?Book flights to Rome if you plan to visit one of these locationsFiumicinoMontepulcianoOrvietoCortonaPienzaGaetaTivoliSperlongaPorto ErcoleSaturniaGrossetoFrascatiCassinoCiampinoLadispoliTerracinaSulmonaSan Felice CirceoSabaudiaAscoli PicenoEverything you need to know for your flight to RomeAirlinesCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsPopular routesReturn flight dealsFlights with popular airlines flying to RomeFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from the United States to Rome according to KAYAK users.
