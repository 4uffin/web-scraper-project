Comfortable seats. Served great Indian food and Masala Chai!Except for the uncleaned tray, and the delay in serving food for our section (which may have been due to the location of our row) everything else was good. The crew were very professional and responded to our requests promptly throughout the flight. We as a family were not disappointed by Emirates.It was great, a little more leg room would have been better particularly since we were in premium economyThe boarding process was smooth and the stewardesses were nice. Some delays with drinks at the end of the flight, but no issues.Thay crew was so nice.Air hostess il ham was so nice.my mom was little scray with airplan turbulence she help us alot.Seat 💺 was all the way on last row. Food was okay .Charged for internet that never really worked. The food selection was just ok.Boarding, seats, entertainment and service were all great. The food was great except for the fact that there were too many sweet items.Boarding, seats, entertainment and service were all great. Food was great except for the fact that there were too many sweet items.Lounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The airport was reasonably clean. The boarding process reasonably efficient. The cabin crew was efficient, polite but not that friendly. The food quality was unremarkable and the choices were awful . There was either a so so chicken dish or a “ vegetarian “ option which was really cheap carbohydrates drowned in cheese. Signing onto i flight wifi was not straightforward. Overall it was a very average experienceThe staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodWrong numbers on the seats, side rows had different numbers than middle row caused lot of confusion.Passengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.My entire row did not have power for the full duration of a 14.5 hour flight. Could not charge any devices such as laptop or phones for the entirety of the long flight. The flight attendants tried to remedy the issue by resetting the power, but were not successful. The only other solution provided was to move me to another seat on the plane which was in the middle row. I had paid for a “preferred” seat that was a window seat. This was a downgrade being offered due to the power issue.Nothing to complain. The staff and flight was good especially the seats which was better compared than the cloth ones on Qatar airwaysEconomy travel is really hard with no room to move especially when the person sitting beside you is an XL or XXL size person who if moving could hit your faceI was travelling 3.5 years after. Agree Economy is no business class but the food was mediocre. Ordered a Hindu meal, the salads were bitter . The food was really below quality and had no tast from what I had in the past. Indian Railways probably have a better quality food when compared. However the kids meal was really nice and really appreciate how they were taken care of. The restrooms were dirty .My flight was with American Airlines 120. The flight was delayed 3 hours and I missed my connection. When I arrived in Doha, the AA staff told me to call an 800 number to rebook a different flight, which was unacceptable. Eventually a Qatar Air staff member helped rebook me on a flight to Manila, that was 12 hours later. They offered me a hotel and meal voucher which I declined, because I didn’t want to leave the airport. Long story short, I spent 12 hours in the Doha airport waiting for my next flight.Overall the experience was neat with crew being nice and caring especially to parent with kids. The free snacks option was okay. The kiosk at Philly airport didn’t work.Reason for travelling Tampa to Orlando is to fly Qatar Airline. we end up with American Airline. This was the miserable experience I ever had in my entire travel history. Flight attendants were rude. They hit my knee with the food cart and I was holding ice pack for 2 hours. I still have the pain after a week. WE boarded the flight twice because of the temperature inside the plan.First keep the airline as you promise. Reason for travelling from Orlando to Tampa is to go with Qatar Airline. We end up with American Airline. As expected the service was horrible.Not sure how we end up with American Airlines instead of Qatar Airways. From Philadelphia to Qatar they boarded us then they asked us to unload. After 30 minutes later they board us again. The inside the plane it was burning hot and we were sweating like crazy. Crew members are absolute rude. The way they served the passengers were horrible. One of the crew members hit my knee with food cart and kept going. I was holding an ice pack for almost 2 hours. I am still with the pain.I felt that when I was rerouted it should have been to business class.Old plane, old entertainment system. It wasn't working throughout the entire flight. I was offered to connect to their system via Wifi to watch on my phone. Crew wasn't very helpful except one lady who turned the experience around.It was worst flight ever of 26h. Poor service and seating. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Islamabad service and seating was worst ever. No tv extra.The check-in has been the very best so far I didn't get to use my priority access which made me feel like a paid a higher price with no benefit for that I loved the food Very tasty and hot The staff friendliness, empathy could be better as it was not linear amongst the whole crew Otherwise, no complaints. I'd still fly again via Etihad Great prices despite the long 6h of waiting timeIt was OK as the seat which we paid for doesn’t have any window. We paid $120 for 3 seats but it’s for nothing. Crew could not help. None of the ports worked so all our phones went dryI had a terrible experience checking in at the airport for my flight. I booked my ticket initially through Kayak while it was promoted as a ticket that offers a carry on and 2 suit cases. (I have a screen shot as a proof of it) I selected it to buy three tickets and paid online. Couple of minutes later airfare assist which is the OTA offering the ticket called me saying My card declined. So I used a different card that went through. I was surprised that they increased the price ticket by a $167. They said the ticket no longer exists and because my card declined I had to buy a new one. So I did. The day my family and I were traveling I could not check in and when I went to the airport I was shocked to be told my ticket had no bags allowed and must pay $200 per bag for three people 6 bags mean I have to pay $1200. I called the travel agency as I feel I was scammed the confirmation didn’t say anything about the bags and they never told me the new ticket doesn’t not include any bag so they changed it after I selected it on your app without informing me. Very sneaky. The travel agency said they will reimburse me only for one bag person. Which means I still paid $600 I still feel very disappointed to pay such an expense. I have always used Kayak to buy my flight tickets and telling everyone how good your rates and app are however after this I feel I was mislead and paid more for something I should not have to. You allowing such an agency on your platform will surely hurt your reputation and level of integrity. I have all the proofs from the screen shot to the confirmation email from them, the or email offering to reimburse o e bag per person and the $1200 bag fees receipts that I paid on the desk. I must be refund the full amount and I look forward to your response.The food could be better. Toilets were smelly all alongHorrible. After paying for seats, I was cramped, my daughters legs kept hitting the seat in front, I had no overhead bin space and no help from stewards on board, the food was served cold, when asked for snacks was told to wait and never received any, the flight was cold with no temperature controls. Entertainment was outdated. I booked this through partnership with American Airlines but will avoid in the future.Should have had business class line in immigration. Food quality suboptimalThis flight was a dreamliner so I think the space was ok for the legs, but the option for food was again limited and the crew was same.Boarding was efficient, had to check in cabin luggage. Seats were narrow, food was more in quantity, received cabin luggage on the luggage belt which was fine.Never can get flight and nof light for three days .finally travel by bus. Very bad experience.Food not of any international or even Indian standard. We have many cuisine available but only paneer & sundry items. Improve & provide some good indian items. Entertainment website or channel out of order.First and the foremost I was shocked to see airindia standards have come down so low . The food was horrible . They served us 3 meals for vegetarian and all the was paneer . The orange juice was not at all cold it was smelly . After you take this heavy price air India should learn from other air lines . I at one point felt like throwing up . After all this when we landed we were not given landing slip . We had to wait for 45 min at the immigration just because no one was given landing slip . To top it all we were 3 passengers and had checked in 4 check in luggage . Out of which 3 have not yet arrived . Basically status says the loaded it in our flight ( this was a direct fight ) and it never reached . We are still waiting . There is nothing great to tell about our flight . The he only good thing was the crew were very helpful .Lay out shows 1st row and second row given after taking payment. It's a fraudThe seats were extremely uncomfortable. Air India seats used to be very comfortable . with sufficient legroom. In this aircraft there was no legroom. It is a shame that for your profit margins you are trying to pack people like cattle on these long haul flights. The food was terrible. The bread was hard like a rock. Mr CEO of Air India, why don’t you take a flight in economy from India to USA and experience the hardships first hand. It is utter disgraceAbsolutely nothing. Cold and unpleasant airline staff, and to top it all, the entertainment system was broken. Really harrowing experience.BAD experience. Entertainment system was not working and most of the passengers had this issue. Staff was not helpful. Meal was yuck. Bad old flights.Communication was terrible. Flight was delayed for 4-5 hours in DC (on the front end, and also after we boarded, we had to get off - some issue with fueling the old plane correctly). There was little to no information on timing or what was happening. Once we reach Delhi airspace, apparently there was weather that caused us not to land - we were actually near the ground, saw the run way, and lifted back up to the sky after being sooo close. Then we circled for about 30 minutes, and they decided to go to Jaipur to land until the weather cleared and to refuel. Again, once we landed in Jaipur (wrong city), there was little to no information on timing or what was happening. Then we heard that the crew was reaching their 24 hours. We sat on the place, on the tarmac for another 3 HOURS, with no food and not enough water for everyone on the flight. Then, they kicked us off the plane with no plan, in the wrong city. We went thru customs, got our bags (thank goodness), and had to ask a bunch of staff what was happening and what to do. Eventually, their soltuion was to bus people back to Delhi (like 6 hours we were told) but not everyone would fit on the bus, and unknown timing on when it would leave. At this point it was 9PM (we were scheduled to arrive in Delhi at 11AM...). My husband and I decided to risk it and take a cab that we had to pay ourselves (about $200 US dollars) to get to Delhi (about 5 hour drive). We both had terrible trips back to the US as well - almost missed connecting flight, forced to pay for carry-on luggage (a small back pack!) and duty-free goods by the Air India staff last minute. Just terrible experience all around. Never again with AI! The ONLY good thing was the air hostesses were kind and patient - example: they made sure people with food allergies got their correct.It would have been perfect if there was onboard entertainment.Food was unfit even for prisoners. larger front seats are terribly uncomfortable, which is ironic. Thorough need to upgrade aircraft on such a long route.Emirates8.1Delta7.9Qatar Airways7.4Etihad Airways7.4Air India5.5Everything you need to know for your flight to IndiaCabin classComplete your tripFlights to other citiesOriginsPopular citiesReturn flight dealsCabin class types available on flights to IndiaCabin classes available on flights to India.
