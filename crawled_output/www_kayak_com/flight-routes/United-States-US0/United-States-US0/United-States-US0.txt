On my plane one seat on each side had a seat with no seat in front of it for easier emergency exiting, giving that person a huge amount of leg room. The downside is that the seat sides are solid with tray tables in the armrest, so there’s no “overflowing” into the adjacent seat. For the tall, fit gentleman next to me it was a score.FraxysFlew with American AirlinesONT-DFWJun 2025Bring an empty refillable water bottle/container through TSA and fill it up as soon as you pass the security check. The water station is available to the left and to the right of it.JacquelineFlew with American AirlinesPWM-PHLJun 2025Get familiar with navigating the Portland airport. It’s been four years since I was there last visiting family and I believe the airport’s been refurbished and enlarged, etc. but it’s very nice.DanielleFlew with Alaska AirlinesJFK-ANCJul 2025Have personal headphones for in-flight entertainment as personal device is utilized. Also bring own supplies for sleeping during flight (blanket, pillow, ear plugs).MikeFlew with Alaska AirlinesKOA-SJCJul 2025Be prepared for your flight by purchasing a meal before departure, and by all means spend the eight bucks for inflight WiFi.RobertFlew with Hawaiian AirlinesLIH-HNLJun 2025Check in 24 hours prior and pay for luggage in advance to help expedite processJamieFlew with Spirit AirlinesBUR-LASJul 2025Pay the additional to get your seat in advance and bring a carryon.Verified travelerFlew with Alaska AirlinesSEA-STLJul 2025Give yourself extra time. Love the self check in options.TorieFlew with Spirit AirlinesBUR-LASJun 2025Be aware that you pay extra for even a carry-on suitcase, but you can bring a personal item at no extra charge (purse, computer bag, etc). There is typically turbulence going into and out of Las Vegas during the warm season.KeithFlew with Hawaiian AirlinesOGG-LAXJul 2025Check your seating assignment thoroughly when you check in to ensure it's the seat you paid for. Flights number, planes, seat assignment, departure times can change at moment's notice, so make sure your confirmed flight assignment in 100% correct!!!Verified travelerFlew with FrontierPDX-DENJun 2025Make sure your carry on bag meets the size limit as bin space on plane is limited. Check any bags online in advance to avoid extra charges for using agent at the airport.KimberlyFlew with DeltaSEA-FLLJul 2025Ask for headphones to watch screen movies as all of mine are bluetooth and that will not work. Bring own food and wait until plane moves before hooking up to Deltawifi.DouglasFlew with American AirlinesHSV-ORDJun 2025Check your app for delay notices.

LAX is very confusing. Our gate was adjacent to another that was boarding at the same time. We could not hear our boarding announcements. Almost missed our boarding group. Terminal 4 has multiple floors, the signs were okay, but a 3-D map is needed to fully comprehend your path. Very limited food options and super expensive restaurants with mediocre food (CrownLAX). Avoid LAX if your want a pleasant layover/transfer process.Verified travelerFlew with FrontierSEA-PHXJun 2025Wish I had known the seats were so uncomfortable. Wish I had known checked bags and carry on bags were 75 each. Wish I didn't have to wait so long in line with only one clerk working. Wish I had known we were going to have to take a bus from the gate to our airplane. Wish I had known the seat space is smaller than any other airline I have flown. I do not recommend Frontier.Verified travelerFlew with FrontierGRR-DENJun 2025Don't purchase vouchers with connections on the cheaper flights (such as frontier or Spirit), you're bound to have a delay. middle or more expensive airlines are more reliable, comfortable, and have consistent pleasant staff working.RogerFlew with Japan AirlinesORD-PITJun 2025Make sure when you go from one airline to another that your bag is marked properly so they can get it on the right damn airplane. I did that and it still didn’t make it.Verified travelerFlew with Alaska AirlinesSEA-DENMar 2025Alaska Air is very efficient & on-time so allow enough time to get luggage, go thru Customs & Immigration, & long security lines. Terminals in SEA are readily accessible by trains but more signage is needed. Fortunately, Information booths are everywhere & are manned by very helpful staff.PFlew with Spirit AirlinesFLL-MCIMar 2025MCI in Kansas City, MO, is easy to navigate, and staff is friendly and ready to assist, if needed. I suggest that people arrive early and watch for updates. Having the app made it easy to keep up with gate changes.KimFlew with American AirlinesBOS-PHXMay 2025Bring something to eat especially if you are connecting flights. Biscuits do not cut it, if you get restless make sure you have something to help such as an essential oils that help calm muscles or restless legs.Verified travelerFlew with Spirit AirlinesMCO-EWRMar 2025For budget travelers, this is a good airline.

Also, the airline should do like some did in the old days, board in this order: 1)first class and special attention, 2) then board from the BACK OF THE PLANE TO THE FRONT OF BUSINESS/COACH. Why is this not a thing? Used to be soooo much more efficient, no one in anyone else's way.FredrickFlew with DeltaGSO-DTWApr 2025Wear comfy shoes. You'll be walking a lot (from the jetway to the rental car bus was about a mile total including luggage and the up and down stairs required) when you get to Detroit. And note that the B terminal restrooms appear to be eternally under construction. Had to walk to C term to find one open. At 9a.m on a Saturday.AllieFlew with Alaska AirlinesBOI-PDXMay 2025It is a ten minute walk from tarmac to baggage claim. If you have mobility issues, it is best to ask for a wheelchair.

Signage can be improved at SFO.Verified travelerFlew with American AirlinesPHX-LAXJan 2025Southwest seems to board and unload about as smooth as any airline - carry on items seem to work as smooth as any airline I have used. Southwest also does not charge to check bags which seems to encourage people to check bags instead of bring an enormous carry on item that does not fit well in the cabin.MatthewFlew with American AirlinesGSP-DFWDec 2024Be ready for delays and study the airport map. The Sky Link is a little different if it is your first time using it. Thankfully, I had someone there the first time I flew through DFW that knew the system.KateFlew with FrontierLAX-PHXDec 2024Pack a snack food and airport is very expensive.

You deplane, then you go through immigration first. After that, you pick up your bags from the carousel, then you stand in a long line to go through customs. After customs, you have to drop off your bags, then stand in line to go through security. All this before you see the terminal and gates to connecting flights. Many travelers missed their connecting flights because several flights from International destinations arrived at the same time at MSP airport, and there was only one line from the baggage pickup carousel area through security. Give yourself plenty of time; a layover with less than 60 minutes is risky.Verified travelerFlew with Alaska AirlinesEWR-SANFeb 2025My flight was not delayed, but my family had a flight earlier in the week that was, by 5 hours.

Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.Cramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneThree seats in first class were broken and while they were able to still acommodate us it was looking very touch and go and they had others they could not acommodateCheck in was quick and easy during early hours. Flight was on time, and customer services was a plus.Terrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Flight was good and crew was super polite. However, there were around 5 kids screaming the WHOLE 2 hours. I understand kids have to come but parents need to do something to control their children. They make the experience terrible, especially after finishing 16 hour shifts at the hospital I needed some sleep, which I did not get.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.All of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.Armrest controller on my seat 35D and nextbooennseat 35E did not work right. Hard to press buttons to recognize and 35D had constantnpressure either upmost down somit was nearly impossible to make selections. .I flew with my dog and had already purchased my dog’s ticket. Even that morning I had called costumer service to insure that my husband and I had seats together since the website was giving me an error when choosing our seats and the representative mentioned our dog. I showed up early to the airport and when I got to the gate and we started boarding I was help back and told that I was supposed to have a yellow tag and that I should have checked in at the counter for them to give me that tag. I was not aware of this, the representative on the phone did not say anything. Nor did I see it anywhere in the checking process online, so if you travel with a pet and are not checking in luggage, just know that you still have to go to the check in counter when arriving at the airport unless you want to be the last one to board and not have room for your carry on in the overhead bins. Other than that, I had a great experience.Once we got in the air the pilot made up some of the time of the delay. So that was really nice.I understand stuff happens, but plane failures are likely due to lack of maintenance. Additionally, air conditioning wasn't working, no snack/drink service, no WiFi. Fortunately, the crew was communicative and light-hearted. United grabbed another plane and we were able to get to our destination.Excellent - explanations were clear staff was nice and flight was comfortableThe flight was fine. This survey is not. There is no option for N/A so items which don’t apply to my experience still must be rated. In those instances I give a “3” rating which ultimately skews the results.The actual trip was fine, however, the changes made to our flights and the layovers were had to endure were awful.They only offered water for Group 6. Awful announcements from the Crew. Couldn't understand a single word. Barely came by for the trash afterwards. Man, I love water for a premium flight. Wow. Water in a cup.Flight from Dallas to OKC was good, but my trip was interrupted due to a delayed flight from Austin to DFW, which happens all the time. I frequently miss my connection from DFW and American can never seem to make this work!Because the plane was 90 degrees F, they would not let us board. I wish they had, because it meant we were delayed. It's Texas, of course it's hot. We would have survived.Wish they had the seat-back video screens for watching movies or playing games.Full flight so overhead bin space ran out & bags had to be checked. When you’re in the last boarding group, you might as well expect that. Don’t pay to check bags though because when they run out of space for carry-ons, they check your bag to your destination for free. When traveling with children, no need to pay extra for seats, they will assign seats & have to sit your children with you.The seats in economy were appeared to be quite thin and lack sufficient cushioning to be comfortable. Perhaps it was my seating position but the plane seemed notably load.Very good but wish they had the seat-back video screens for movies & gamesFrontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead.
