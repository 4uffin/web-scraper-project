The crew was fantastic.10.0 ExcellentDonna, Sep 2025CVG - LGARead more Delta reviewsDelta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.On this flight I felt the food offering was not as complete as on previous flights. The tomato salad was a bit off and there was nothing additional such a bread or butter. The breakfast was only one option, so you either ate what they had or ate nothing. The crew was efficient, but most seemed frustrated throughout the flight. The flight arrived early and was obstacle-free, so I’m overall quite happy, but the shine in the rest of the experience just wasn’t there.Great flight with Delta! Boarding was quick and easy, the amenities were solid, and the plane was in great shape. The flight attendants had a fun, lively energy while staying professional. All in all, a smooth trip — even managed to catch up on some rest. Thanks, Delta!De planning was an absolute mess. We were never told that we weren’t at the gate and that we had to go down unstable stairs and then hop on a bus. People were falling, we couldn’t tell who was in charge. Overall terrible communication that ended up leaving a bad impression at the very end of the experience.For a 69 year old with health problems I had the worse experience, no wheelchair when I entered a lady told me to sit and wait while a gentleman told me I had to walk to the Delta station, which I did. I had a carry on and a bag, and I was traveling with my service dog, which was on his carrier and the lady charged me for my carry on luggage, beside all the waiting cause of the delay, I had to walk to get my luggage cause no wheelchair showed up, I am so disappointed. I will get in touch with the company. I got home at 3:00 am, not good for my health situation.The crew was amazing; Von, Vera and Guadalupe were very friendly and attentive throughout the entire flight. They were friendly and welcoming to everyone. A solid and dedicated team for sure!Terrible. I was bumped off of my original flight and spent the next six days fighting to get back on it. I lost hours of my vacation trying to get this situation corrected.Our flight was canceled after several delays. No hotel vouchers offered, minimal help for resolution leave me ultimately to cancel and book on an other airline. Then waited to get bags for more than 3 hours This whole experience has been awful!!!My flight was canceled after being rescheduled for four days canceling my trip. Kayak and everyone affiliated with it I.e the airlines, and just fly have been excruciating to deal with. My trip to visit family had to be canceled as there was no way to make it. I am furious at all of you.They delayed our flight because of bad weather in NY which was completely understandable. Then they cancelled our flight and a later flight that evening. The earliest we could fly was the next morning. We ended up buying last minute tickets on another airline and made it home slightly delayed but safely that evening. Delta kept saying it was weather related but if that was the case how did we make it back on another airline? The weather in NY was cloudy but not bad.All of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.There was no food available for this red eye... one little waffle cookie for a 6+ hour flight... thank God I was able to sleep someTerrible. Delayed 7 hours, and cancelled the flight, leaving me stranded and out of pocket $500 for an alternative last minute flightNot a great experience. We paid for the upgrade for premium economy seats and seated ourselves in very comfortable seats. Someone came along with the same seat on their boarding pass. The aircraft had been changed and as a result we were booted out and sent further back to small uncomfortable seats. After complaining we were moved to emergency row seats, which gave us more leg room but the seats don’t recline. For people in our 70’s we found having to sit upright from California to NJ very uncomfortable. Not sure why they chose to move senior citizens instead of the two people that were allowed to take the more comfortable seats. Not happy.Cramped seat even in economy plus seat 10A. Over booked flight, no space for the bagsVery comfortable (upgraded to business class). The audio on my screen didn’t work, but I managed to play the audio through my phone while watching the screen.get E+, a must for 5 hours flight if you are tallMultiple delays and not straight answer from the United teamI just got back from a trip with 3 flights each way. The flights were good and we were happy with out experience. There was one steward on our first flight that was harsh and grump with passengers. It did not leave a good impression. All of the other flight crews were great on the other five flights.Food and flight attendents with positive dispositions and friendly behavior, more professional attitudesThere was no TV's on the plane? I tried to activated the WiFi multiple times before the plane took off but it wasn't work well.Air Marco’s fleet of airplanes are old and pathetic. The seats are torn and stained. The monitors don’t work properly. If this wasn’t a business trip and I had control of booking the flight, I would not travel on this carrier.Good service, friendly staff. Food was average for airlines and the seats were small.Pathetic check in experience once again. Not enough staff scheduled at bag drop or for special assistance at LHR. Really need to rethink the whole self check in procedure. The crew was good. A very decent selection of special meals in this leg as compared to the JFK-LHR leg.Flight was cancelled 3 hrs AFTER etd. Thetefore Missed connection from JFK to New Zealand . No accommodation provided… This cost ne aporox 1000 USD in extra expenses and turned whst should have been a 24 hr trip ftom Boston - New Zealand into a VERY expensive , late 70+ hr nightmare … Complete nonsense!!!Overall fine, but the delay was annoying and the reasons for the delay were not communicated. The crew on board were phenomenal!A cookie and a soda, packed like sardines, will never be a positive experience. Also, boarded a 5:30 flight at 7:45pmWhenever a passenger purchase a ticket his advantage number should automatically to his information. It's not everyone remember the number. You request for your number and American airline agent say they will email it....and they never email anything and you loose your mileage just because you don't remember your number. It should automatically go your information and associate with your email account at all timesThe flight was two hours late to take off. The captain kept making announcements in English, but the volume on the speakers was low and we could not hear him. The flight attendant’s French translation was loud and clear, but we couldn’t understand French. The crew was nowhere to be found to relay what the captain was announcing. Very frustrating experience. American has to do better.Paid $35 and not able to access the internet at all.I don’t usually fly budget airlines or airlines in the United States. It was as good as any other airline. The seats are comfortable and the airline attendants are not rude & surly. Very nice flight (s).They have the most inexperienced / rude flight staff I’ve encounteredI paid extra for a seat closer to the front. The TV didn’t work at all for the entire flight. Would have been nice to know before I purchased an “upgraded “ seatToo many long delays with JetBlue. Worst major airline that serves JFK but unfortunately I keep going back because of the prices.flight cancelled after 2 delays. left us sitting in JFK at 1am. no customer service to assist rebooking.To not have food or proper snacks on a 5 hour flight was the worst.Spend hours delayed with no food, water anything sitting on the aieplane with no ability to eat or use the restroom. My entire experience was the absolute worst. I will never fly jet Blue again.It would have been nice if they had offered more than one set of snacksGround crew gave me interference about carrying a laptop and a small shoulder bag, even though I told them I traveled with them all the time. I then placed my laptop bag in my carryon and took out a medical device, and ground crew still tried to give interference. I had to remind them that medical devices don't count towards luggage limits. It was quite annoying and unneThe gate and ground staff were excellent, friendly, went out of their way to acknowledge my Mosaic status. The plane was an older Airbus, so the seats were a little worn. The in flight attendant was not very nice, and seemed to be annoyed to be at work or be on this flight. Flight was fast and we landed early and pilots kept us informed.The terminal crew is so rude cabin crew is extremely rude flight is very goodSpirit is low fare air line. Food also cost you. No free food.The flight was delayed twice with minimal explanation. The terminal and airplane were filthy. The food voucher didn’t even cover a tiny pizza from a kiosk in the terminal. All in all, a pretty miserable experience for a flight to attend a funeralEveryone was kind for the most part. I did travel with children and paid for seats and even then it was not as suitable. I tried calling their customer service prior to check in and I was told they couldn't help me because I didn't purchase my tickets with them.The incoming plane ✈️ was delayed 5 hours en route to Raleigh. My flight was delayed for 5 hours 😢. Finally boarded and then de boarded due to an AC problem. A very tough and long night.The flight was 3.5 hrs delayed. I was not notified prior to arriving to the airport via spirit app. or via boarding pass that I already had loaded on my phone. The agent that i saw at the counter didn’t mention anything about the delay either. I only saw the update after logging in to my email account.Unfortunately, spirits crew had us boarding and parking the plane often, would wait long periods of time before allowing the people attending the flight on the plane to know what was going on this caused for my plane to not only get diverted but then canceled at an airport 2 hours away and basically stranded with charter buses MAYBE being hired. I was left with no choice but to stay overnight and use a comp room in Altantic City to then arrive home the next day. This trip was the first time seeing my partner since he joined the Air Force and this stressful ride caused unwarranted tears on what was supposed to be an east flight home. I understand weather is unpredictable but to have passengers deboard to then reboard an hour later to taxi on the runway for another hour to then basically leave an entire fight stranded. I waited almost 30 minutes at the airport and not one employee could tell me about a charter bus so I had to leave and make accommodations to stay overnight and get a ride home.This was the first time I use Spirit Airlines and was pleasantly surprised. It was a last-minute booking and I was happy to see there was availability on your airline for a price that was affordable. The staff was friendly. The only things I thought were missing, were the ability to recline the seats, although I don’t use that very often, and it would’ve been nice to have power access at the seats to plug in my devices.The flight times got delayed multiple times due to weather which is understandable, but later the time got prepared 30min. Made to the flight barely but got stressed too much.Onboarding was an easy process. Staff waa friendly and courteous. Should have a complimentary snack and drink. We paid $900 round trip for two to myrtle from New York, which is an expensive fare. Going to the seats were not in good shape but our return home, the air plane seemed to be new with comfortable seating with slightly more space. If traveling again, we will still consider flying SpIrit.Delta7.9United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2JetBlue7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Traveling to a place near New York?Book flights to New York if you plan to visit one of these locationsMahwahLong BranchDanburyMount LaurelParsippanyBeach HavenElizabethNorth BergenAbseconGarden CityWayneFort LeeToms RiverLanghorneSomersetWeehawkenWoodbridgeEast BrunswickNanuetLakevilleEverything you need to know for your flight to New YorkAirlinesCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsPopular routesReturn flight dealsFlights with popular airlines flying to New YorkFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from the United States to New York according to KAYAK users.
