Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.Flight attendant in first class gave poor service (like he didn't want to be there) and food was awful. We sat waiting for gate upon arrival over 45 mins.Weather delay in Chicago?. No sense of urgency to make connection in Chicago for our connecting flight that wasn't delayed. Connection was missed.Overall it was good. I missed my connection but I was put on another flight.Overall a very poor experience - booked premium economy tickets but due to last minute flight delays , all my itinery went for a toss and had to fly economy class with no access to lounge or any compensation by united airlines to make up for the flight delays . i had expected better experience than that from united.It was fine, definitely older planes with no charging or anything. There’s no entertainment set up on board, but it is nice that they allow you to access the in flight entertainment from your phone without having to pay for the Wi-Fi and they do offer free texting.I liked that the flight was nonstop from ORD to CIU for $200 round trip.While the staff was pleasant and helpful, the following observations are for your awareness. There was some delay on the tarmac on take off and landing. The paid lunch/food offerings were limited. Entertainment was only available on WiFi at a cost.The first flight was better in terms of the aircraft.Smooth flight. Boarding was chaotic. Could not hear the gate agent over the intercom. People were lined up in the wrong lines. Groups one and two were told to board through line one and group 3 through line 2. All very confusing. Once in the air, the flight was smooth. There was no entertainment option on this aircraft, even though it was a larger aircraft.Overall poor for me I paid extra for seats with leg room and my regional flights exit row seats have less leg room then the others that's money that could have been saved and on my final flight home the flights air was not operating it was unbearably hot in the cabin I will be contacting United and filing a DOT complaintLost bag and 2 days no word leaving for cruise no clothes or stuffAny flight to ORD after about 2pm this summer has been challenging. Flight was delayed getting in (coming from ORD) and that led to it not leaving before a ground stop due to lightening before they could fuel the plane, and so forth. They made up some time but we were still late in arriving at ORD, and that led to missed connections.Food was ok, but not as good as I have had before on AA.Pretty good. The food was just mediocre, the boarding and crew were good.My flight got switched and my prepaid bag didnt transfer over properly so I paid to check ANOTHER BAG. I was placed in a middle seat and it was just miserable. At least it was a bulkhead row so I had legroom. The flight just never seem3d to endWas not able to watch most shows on the entertainment site. They would not loadOn Wednesday, July 30 we were in mid flight from Manchester to Charlotte and we turned around because the right engine was malfunctioning. That was the last flight out of Manchester that night. I was rebooked for Thursday, which became a weather event Friday. There were no seats left on the flight from Manchester to Charlotte. Consequently I didn’t leave Manchester until Saturday morning and we flew to Chicago so to say the least my scheduled flight and return to Iowa was three days off and it messed with my business schedule. Consequently cash flow. I would like some sort of acknowledgment of this event.Dreadful experience. Our flight was delayed more than 8 hours due to a maintenance issue and the assistance from rebooking was poor. I was travelling with a bad knee and needed assistance waited in one place more than 3 hours before someone came with a wheelchair. The woman next to me was a 91 year old great grandmother who had waited more than 4 hours. There were moments of support from the staff but it appeared as they were going against the direction of management. It was apathy, lack of ownership and dismissive responses with small moments of kindness and understanding typically from grey haired, female, veteran staff..Couldn’t get the door on the plane to close leading to a nearly 2 hour delay. But, hey at least they didn’t cancel the flight.The flight was fine and the crew awesome. The problem is ORD and AA. Computers went down, ORD fell apart and a 40 min flight turned into a 3 hour trip. Guess the answer is to not try and fly to ORD after noon. But, as I said, crew was awesome and did everything they could to lesson the flight time.Flight was canceled without warning, gave credit that is hard to access. Awful airline.Flight was cancelled without warning close to flight date. Stuck witha credit has to buy a new ticket from another airline in either to get to location. Email cancelling was lost in mail.Don't board the plane and have us sit for 2 hours and go nowhere!Flight was good and on time. Everyone was nice. Seats aren't very comfortableDidn’t like that we weren’t even offered a water. And really didn’t like the male flight attendant, he had major attitude. The flight however was good, pilots got us there in time safely.Just total easy flight experience!! What could you do better..? Hmmm..? There was nothing I can remember. Spirit was a far more comfortable and easy process than American, United & Delta. I'll always look for Spirit and I've told a few people about, since flying this past trip!! I'm a SPIRIT FAN!! Thank You, SPIRIT AIRLINES!! Very, VERY well done, 100%!! See you...SOON!! -Best, Linda R.Spirit is a very uncomfortable travel experience. It’s cheap but you are squeezed into the seats like canned meat.The seat belt was lengthy enough that I did not need an extender. Courteous and helpful flight attendants.As expected. Nothing jumps out at me as bad or wrong, but the flight was fine. No complaints with pilot or crew. The flight left on time and arrived earlier than stated. Overall, I will continue to plan on flying with Spirit.Horrible considering I didn’t go and I bought travel insurance and I didn’t receive a refund.I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.Southwest8.0United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Traveling to a place near Chicago?Book flights to Chicago if you plan to visit one of these locationsMerrillvilleSaint JosephHammondPortageLansingValparaisoMunsterChestertonScherervillePorterMonticelloSaint JohnGriffithEverything you need to know for your flight to ChicagoAirlinesCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsPopular routesReturn flight dealsFlights with popular airlines flying to ChicagoFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from the United States to Chicago according to KAYAK users.
