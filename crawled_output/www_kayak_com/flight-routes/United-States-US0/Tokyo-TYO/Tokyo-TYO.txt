Only the fish entree in the Japanese meal was overcooked and quite dry but everything else was greatGreat first time experience on this airline. Very professional staff and great service.Warm the bread. Movies: better choices to include Chinese movies options or some of the older winners of flim festivalBusiness class on ANA was awesome. There lie flat seats made it easier to sleep on a 12 hour flight. Food was great and service was excellent.The crew was very nice and polite. They made sure everybody got their meal and drinks. Even the economy class had a very adequate leg room for someone that is over 6 foot tall.Overall it was good. Making changes to the reservation on ANA’s website was little challenging. Would like to see those features improved in the future.The flight crew was outstanding. Very cheerful and always respectful. I wish the same could be said about United. The AC wasn't the best on the plane.The seats are uncomfortable. The flight attendants are not pleasant. They do their job, but not with a ray of sunshine and warmth. The food was awful, not what I would expect from an Asian airline. All of the other Asian airlines I have flown have far better food. The food was on par with United airlines food, which is really bad. Maybe ANA should get out of the alliance with United.During booking, I selected the seats so that my wife and I would sit next to each other. However, the airline changed our seats at boarding so that we were seated apart. Very disappointing.Every leg of the flight was late causing us to miss our flight to Okinawa and have to take the next flight out.highly recommend for trip to japan only reason why i gave good not excellent is because their selection of movies and tv shows in English is more limited .We asked for Hindu vegetarian meal in advance and the quality of the food was horrendous. Never flying JAL again!Overall a great experience. One complain was the vegetarian food that my wife had which was mostly boiled vegetables with not much flavor.Very accommodating and kind airline crews. The plane is also big which makes the passengers more comfortable and relaxI actually didn’t make it onto the flight. I spent quite a few hours trying to rebook the flight just to get screwed out of $5000. Fun!We booked business class round trip from Delhi to San Diego and back. On our last leg from Bangalore to Delhi we were down graded to economy class which was big disappointment other than that everything was great.Had an incident with a stewardess who insisted that I take a seat. I informed her that I came to use the restroom and to have some water. After using the restroom, I wanted to stretch my legs out a little cuz my knees were aching from sitting. I understood her concern for my concern and the potential turbulence (she said she knows this route and the turbulence and safety is not to be taken lightly) but I felt that her mood, tone, demeanor, and a lack of compassion for the pain in my knees were not the proper way to address a customer or anyone for that matter. This left a bitter taste in my mouth. It was her lack of professionalism that surprised me.we have requested for hindu veg. meal during booking. but served meal was of very poor qualty and taste. they can get such meal from 5 star Indian restaurant at Vancouver/ tokyo/ Bangalore.pure hindu veg meal and no AVMLIt was good but need mor amenities for toiletries and entertainmentExtremely poor at handling baggage. I had oversized golf bag and JAL would not recheck in Boston. Had to haul by myself to Jet Blue. Both JAL and Jet Blue claimed I had overweight bag. Had to adjust baggage several times. Will avoid JAL in future and I always avoid Jet Blue when I can. QATAR always superior.Passengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneNothing special. The crew never went out of their way for anything.We had to deboard 2 times due to maintenance issues. They changed the plane, and then we got deviated to LAX due to maibtenance issues on the other plane, had to sleep at LAX and los a full day.Everything was good, except the seats in economy were so close together, you could barely get out when the seat in front of your was reclined. If the airlines keep jamming in more and more seats, it will become intolerable. I will look for another airline that considers customer comfort and does not keep adding more rows of seats for more profit.The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Flight was good and crew was super polite. However, there were around 5 kids screaming the WHOLE 2 hours. I understand kids have to come but parents need to do something to control their children. They make the experience terrible, especially after finishing 16 hour shifts at the hospital I needed some sleep, which I did not get.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.Great service on board. Boarding a bit slow due to process. Food was pretty average.Tastless food and too obvious lack of enthusiasm for service in the economy vesus business classAll of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.I had no checked baggage but was required to hand over carry on baggage at the door of the plane. There was a lot of overboard space in the plane and I was one of the last ones. I ran to get my carry on but it was gone. I was given back at the plane door in Toronto, so the wait was not as long as it would have been at the carousel.Armrest controller on my seat 35D and nextbooennseat 35E did not work right. Hard to press buttons to recognize and 35D had constantnpressure either upmost down somit was nearly impossible to make selections. .For the price, it was a really good experience. There was no entertainment on board, so I couldn't really rate this, and I didn't order a meal. I appreciated that there was a free glass of wine.Short flight. Everything was fine except the flight was delayed twice for a total of an hour.My flight from New York to Canada and Canada to Brisbane was canceled, so I had to take united airlines instead flight from New York to Dubai then layover in Dubai 8 hours then from Dubai to Brisbane it was extremely difficult for me , it was a nightmare flying with Canadian airlines unfortunately.I found the boarding easy and my seat was very comfortable as I had a lot of leg room. I am not too happy that I no longer have lounge access even though I used to get it with my TD credit card.Flight cancelled. Major disruption to our travel. Do not use Air Canada from KC. To few flights.Real smooth and easy, Real good leg room in coach!There labor disputes cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before my boarding time but there customer service/website was easy enough to navigate and they rebooked me for no upcharge.Re luggage I carried a backpack only. I did not check any bags in. However there were other passengers with carry on luggage going in the plane. My question is why are others allowed to have a carry on luggage inside the plane? Shouldn’t they have dropped it off at the gate? I’m asking because I could have brought the same thing instead of a backpack only. Please clarify for future reference. Thank you.Like the service. Very hard to communicate or contact when have problemsVery bad, flight was cancelled due to strike and staff was unable to rebook usANA8.4Japan Airlines8.3Delta7.9United Airlines7.4Air Canada7.1Traveling to a place near Tokyo?Book flights to Tokyo if you plan to visit one of these locationsKusatsuYamanouchiIzuOdawaraYamanashiSagamiharaMinakamiKawagoeTsukubaFuefukiNumazuEverything you need to know for your flight to TokyoAirlinesCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsPopular routesReturn flight dealsFlights with popular airlines flying to TokyoFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from the United States to Tokyo according to KAYAK users.
