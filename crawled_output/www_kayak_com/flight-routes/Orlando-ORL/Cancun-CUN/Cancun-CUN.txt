Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.6.0 GoodDavid, Aug 2025MCO - DENRead more Southwest reviewsNear 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.If we are going to have to pay for luggage, make it easier to do. Put something on the app during check-in so I don't need to do it at the kiosk. I've done it twice recently and I ended up having to pay at the desk because something went wrong at the kiosk in Tampa.Everything was on time. I was disappointed by the front section female, African American flight attendant. I did not see her name tag or would have identified by name not race. As passengers moved to the bathroom early in flight, she would say with a disdainful tone “I have to say the seat belt light is on” then go back to her book. Better trained flight attendants say something like be careful the seat belt light is on.The price of the tickets isn't matching the flight experience. No matter how long the flight is, you're only getting pretzels. The flight attendants looked unkept and over it.WiFi on the flight was not working. Thus, entertainment options were limited.Flight was awfully bumpy and landing was a bit jolting. I was in the restroom when snacks and drinks were served and was not asked if i wanted any. I had to ask for water finally.Crew was great flight was great baggage claim was a failure. It took over 1 hour for bags to arrive. Poor communication poor effort when I spoke to the supervisor about the delayPlanes are aged. The wifi is unreliable and on many fights, no-existent. The flight attendants were very good.I had a wonderful flight, but the only thing that annoyed me was how crowded TSA was. I still believe airports and all planes work together to bunch everyone together to drive up cost.Lost bag and 2 days no word leaving for cruise no clothes or stuffWe will be writing a long, detailed letter to corporate about our awful experience with American airlines.Internet was a bit expensive and did not work ask that week otherwise a good flightFood was ok, but not as good as I have had before on AA.Pretty good. The food was just mediocre, the boarding and crew were good.It was very difficult to stretch my knee out and I am very short. I also had a torn tendon in my knee which made it extra uncomfortable anyways. My husband is 6'2" and I can't imagine him flying in that plane.The plane was broken so we had to change planes.Flight was delayed again and again ultimately almost three hours getting us to our location at close to midnight by the time we got in and out of airport to destination. I had taken time off work to enjoy an evening at destination and that was now wastedFood was terrible, all served at once, poor quality . Wine and bread offered only once.It was one of my worst flight ever. First they were changing the gate for at least 4 times, changing from gate D7 to D12 to D44. Considering the size of the Miami Airport, we are talking about long distance and the train at the airport was not working. Then the flight was delayed around one hour. Then finally we boarded into the plane and when everybody was seated, there was an announcement that there is an issue with one of the tire of the plane, so we all had to get out of the plane with our belongings, to replace the tire. So we had around 2.5-hour delayvery difficult boarding process - aggressive passengers not the friendliest crewWiFi was not eorkig (again) And the plane was from 1990 with the screens which were.not touch and most didn’t even work and if lucky could tune in tvIt was great. I had never flown on JetBlue before, but would be very happy to fly with them in the future.The captain gave good announcements and the flight attendants were friendly. The WiFi was pretty good. The plane itself looked very old inside and the seats were very uncomfortable. The screens in the seat backs were the smallest I’ve ever seen. There were so many loud and obnoxious kids on this flight and the parents didn’t do much to try to quiet them down. Some had videos and games on tablets with higher than necessary volume going the whole time.Spend hours delayed with no food, water anything sitting on the aieplane with no ability to eat or use the restroom. My entire experience was the absolute worst. I will never fly jet Blue again.It would have been nice if they had offered more than one set of snacksFlight was delayed several 3 hours - no reason was given and no communication what so ever.No overhead baggage room even though I was seated in row 2. Consequently had to check in my carry on bag. Baggage carousel was jammed. Took 45 min to get my bag.Cancelled flight with no specific instructions to get a boarding pass for another flight. The whole flight of people were in line for an hour because there was only 1 person to help at the desk. This was unusual for JetBlue.Except for the 28 minute delay leaving and the earlier reschedule to a later takeoff time the flight was good.Again, when I use Kayak I expect to pay the total amount and that´s it. Someone added an additional charge few days later after purchasing the tickets.I didn’t mind being delayed due to weather, but continuing to post (and not update) that we would be delayed until after the flight was already supposed to have taken off was a bit much. In the future, please announce the delay even if the time is still unknown.Spirit is a very uncomfortable travel experience. It’s cheap but you are squeezed into the seats like canned meat.Friendly employees, good seat, on time, Great flight. Pilot and attendants greeted passengers as we deplaned. However, I could not ever understand what the flight attendant was saying on the mic. It was too fast, and too loud.The flight was canceled and was bounced around time wise with my elderly parents. That being said the gentleman in custody service was amazingly helpfulEasy boarding and good flight. Need to work on the beverage and snack situationWhile on the flight we had a delay and had to sit on the plane while maintenance fixed it. It’s ended up taking an hour and a half longer to leave than expected. I had an unruly passenger sitting behind me that vaped during the flight and was rude and loud for the majority of the flight.Not great. Overpriced and charge you for everything. All but breathing was an extra charge. Never again! Oh if you didn’t check a carry on, you couldn’t use the overhead bins. Crew said those spaces were not available. Personal items MUST go on floor. Yet, there was only 50% capacity at best! So ridiculous.It was fine, Can’t blame you about airport issues.The flight was fine however what started as a reasonable priced ticket could have become an overpriced ticket with additional charge for carry on as well as checked bag $79 per bag per person each way. Additional charge for choosing one’s seat, additional charge for beverage and snack, we were on what was described as a new plane yet there were no audio/visual on the jet. A bare bones service but not at a bare bones price. Will think twice before flying Spirit again. 😕The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Boarding in Orlando was not good. Giant mob at the gate, should have been lines.My flight was delayed by two hours which made it so that I would miss my layover flight. I stood in line for customer service for over an hour and when I reached the agent she told me to scan a QR code and it'll give me options. I wasn't offered any help, guidance or compensation, only told that I have options but that I had to figure it all out myself. I was refunded part of the trip and had to buy an expensive same day ticket from another airline in order to get home. I will never fly Frontier again.The confirmation # CK8GNW and my name was not recognized/in Frontier system. I was able to check in on Frintier app so i went to the Frontier ticket agent, at time they told me that my name/ confirmation did not show up as a purchased ticket. I had to purchase a new ticket that cost $289.00 one way.Although an hour and a half early was told by staff at check in they had overbooked and could not check us in for the flight.The crew was delayed because they came on another flight that was delayed due to weather 10pm flight left at 1.30 am The airline made no effort to align alternate crewWorst airline experience. They were rude and kept changing our seats and/or giving our seats away so our family didn’t get to sit with each other. Almost everyone we dealt with at both airports with this airline was rude. The app kept giving us wrong information making things take longer. Dealing with them before TSA can take close to an hour…longer than I’ve ever had to deal with before. Never using this airline again.Seats are uncomfortable but price is good. Guess I can put up with misery for four hours.Southwest8.0American Airlines7.2JetBlue7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Orlando to CancúnAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsCancún (CUN)Cabin class types available on flights from Orlando to CancúnCabin classes available on flights from Orlando to Cancún.
