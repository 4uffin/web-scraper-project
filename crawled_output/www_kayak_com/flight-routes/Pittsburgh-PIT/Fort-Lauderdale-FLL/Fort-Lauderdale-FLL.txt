The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!10.0 ExcellentG, Sep 2025LAS - ATLRead more Southwest reviewsI wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.Lounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.Always good but we must do something about people in rows ahead of you that don't put their seats back up when they are suppose to. And It's rough to not be able to even lean over to get something out of my purse.this crew didn't care much. bumping carts into seats more times than i care to rememberEverything was fine except the entertainment was not working for half of the flight.Very good but wish they had the seat-back video screens for movies & gamesFlight was delayed not sure why no explanation given and no apologies either. Otherwise the flight was fineWhile waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.Flight delays numerous times. Everytime we would get close to boarding it would be delayed again. Strung along the entire time.This flight never occurred because AA couldn’t get their act together.During service there was a garbage/beverage spill near our seats that never was cleaned up. On a relatively short flight when we’re fortunate enough to actually have in flight movies available, the flight attendants pitching the AADVANTAGE credit card shouldn’t talk for the last 10 minutes of the flight so that we miss the end of the movie.Waited on the runway for takeoff for 2.5 hours. Air traffic rerouted us. The plane didn't have enough fuel, so had to go back to the gate. Had to wait for a new pilot. Should have landed at 5:22. Didn't land until 9:10. Trash flight.The boarding was pretty easy. However, the first class seats are not lay flat as other airlines (like JetBlue) has and therefore sleeping was a challenge.Everything about the flight was lovely…We left early, arrived early, cabin crew were efficient and helpful. Flight was easy and most pleasant.Would have thought that they would gas up plane before everyone got on boardEverything was great. I liked the text updates so that I never miss a gate change & I have all the latest info.I don’t usually fly budget airlines or airlines in the United States. It was as good as any other airline. The seats are comfortable and the airline attendants are not rude & surly. Very nice flight (s).They have the most inexperienced / rude flight staff I’ve encounteredvery difficult boarding process - aggressive passengers not the friendliest crewWiFi was not eorkig (again) And the plane was from 1990 with the screens which were.not touch and most didn’t even work and if lucky could tune in tvMy JetBlue experience was nice. The flights ran on time, the aircraft was clean and comfortable, and the flight attendants were attentive. My only issue, which is isolated to the low-cost (budget) option at JetBlue, is that the check in process makes the user feel that they have to buy their seats. The seats offered for purchase are upgrades from the budget seats you get (which are essentially the last seats remaining). The interface should not make it feel like you must purchase a seat.I especially liked the lead crew officer. His boarding and safety announcements were made with a bit of novelty and humor. The flight also left the gate 10 minutes early and we landed about 20 minutes early… It was a delightful flight…Communication since no reason or explanation was given for 3 hrs delayExcellent. Although they used to greet me as a mosaic member and provide a free drink, early boarding helps me to keep coming back to JetBlue.The inflight system with their wifi is a hot mess and doesn't work. Separately they do, but when you try to do theoretically simple things like pair a device for control it all falls apartI never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.Everything was fine. I'm average height and I pack light. I'm ready for my Spirit flight.Wow truly top notch airline Efficient nice snacks courteous staff Fast boarding !The staff was very sarcastic, the flight was delayed. There was no wi-fi o any type of entertainment. The plane was dirty and we have to wait a long time for the luggage to come out.Booked through kayak, everything seemed normal but when it came time to go, my flight ticket didn’t exist, so I had to purchase another set of tickets at the airport the day of the flight, for about double. When I reached kayaks customer service, they claimed no responsibility, and pushed me onto another 3rd party booking service, airfare assist, where I have had no luck getting any kind of help or refund. I’ve used kayak many times, but I’ll never again after I’ve been burned by this.The air fares are good, Charging me for every single thing 😩I am very happy with my experience with Spirit Airlines. Both flights were on time. Boarding was very pleasant. Crew was very nice. Flights were amazing and we even arrived earlier than the schedule time. I am hoping Spirits keeps on having non stop flight from Ft Lauderdale to Hartford for many years to come.Didn't like size of seats. Found charges for checked luggage and carry on too highMy experience with spirit was terrible. Customer service was terrible. Flight got canceled abruptly with no accommodations made for the inconvenience or any sort of help. I was unable to rebook a new flight.My experience was okay. The flight did not offer even water without a fee. Also had to pay extra for my carry on, as I was told I had to check my bag, even though it said I had the option to carry on a bag when booking. This costed me an extra $100. Would likely not fly with Spirit again.Southwest8.0Delta7.9American Airlines7.2JetBlue7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Everything you need to know for your flight from Pittsburgh to Fort LauderdaleAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsPittsburgh (PIT)Fort Lauderdale (FLL)Cabin class types available on flights from Pittsburgh to Fort LauderdaleCabin classes available on flights from Pittsburgh to Fort Lauderdale.
