The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!10.0 ExcellentG, Sep 2025LAS - ATLRead more Southwest reviewsI wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.southwest just starting charging for luggage. hadnt realized it until it was too late. now out $70 when i couldve bought a carry on if i wouldve known. free bags was one of the only reasons i chose southwest over another airline (the other being no assigned seats, which is apparently also being changed). stupid business decision. wont be flying southwest anymore.Flight crew and cabin crew were great. I had to rearrange flights because my original flight was 3hrs delayed for weather, the rub is the flight I moved to boarded on time then we sat at the gate for 2 hours because scheduling stole our first officer for another flight, TWICE. Then our actual FO was an hour delayed. To make it worse my original flight went from a 3 hour delay to departing 15min EARLY. Just poor scheduling operations all around.Bring back peanuts Take our drink orders when were all seated, especially after you switch to assigned seating.The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Plane was crowded and even when we hit altitude, the plane was hot, not enough air flow.Staff was rude. Didn’t give water for 2 hours. Worst serviceFlight was delayed and missed my connection Lufthansa didn’t respond.the delay for 3 hours was understandable due to weather conditions but the flight should’ve provided some on flight compensations or at least provide more food.United could have one single once of customer service. No human United employee would help me with the invalid mileage plus number, they said I had to speak with the computer.Overall it was good. I missed my connection but I was put on another flight.Although the flight was delayed the crew and the flight itself were very good. Couldn't fault anything and after the disappointment of being abandoned in the US by BA it was a welcome relief to travel with UnitedBoarding experience was smooth. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful. Entertainment system on the Houston-Edmonton flight did not function for passengers on the left side of the aisle. On the bird's eye flight from Quito to Houston, they should not serve a meal. No one needs to eat after midnight and it is disturbing for those passengers trying to sleep.Smooth flight. Boarding was chaotic. Could not hear the gate agent over the intercom. People were lined up in the wrong lines. Groups one and two were told to board through line one and group 3 through line 2. All very confusing. Once in the air, the flight was smooth. There was no entertainment option on this aircraft, even though it was a larger aircraft.The bad thing is they didnt send me the deatils about how much alowed bagage ehight 1 carryon or cheacking bag Also they just send in spanishlanfuage i couldnt understand emailsThe boarding process was ridiculous. The boarded groups into a walkway just before the aerobridge (about 20 mins late), whilst we watch the crew stroll casually onto the plane, running late. And then they made us line up on then aerobridge with no aircon for 10 minutes before we boarded. Staff are just as ghetto as the customers. Wouldn’t fly againThey closed the gate over 25 minutes before departure and I didn’t get to board.No empathy for my situation, arriving at the check-in counter 5 minutes after the deadline to deposit baggage due to a very delayed incoming intercontinental flight. The attendant simply stared past my shoulder and picked up the microphone to announce a "reminder that all passengers must arrive at least one hour before the flight" before speaking to the passenger behind me. I understand that there are rules above deadlines but at least show some damn empathy. It was Christmas morning and I'd been travelling for 20 hours for goodness sake!They no longer offer anything free to eat or drink, everything is sold, not even a bottle of water is offered for free.I paid for Viva play and most of the time didn’t work and also I order some drinks and the price was to expensive.The terminal and gate was never the right one announced in the Viva App, neither in screens, moved from one terminal to anotherThe smart/express line to check in was a mess, employees not doing the process smooth and quick, using their mobile phones, talking to their coworkersMy flight was changed 4 tienes , delaying my arrival lore than 5 hoursEverything was okay, but boarding begins late and when I was returning there was a gate change. The app never showed the change.Spirit is low fare air line. Food also cost you. No free food.Everyone was kind for the most part. I did travel with children and paid for seats and even then it was not as suitable. I tried calling their customer service prior to check in and I was told they couldn't help me because I didn't purchase my tickets with them.I think the staff was nice. They took time to explain safety protocols. Boarding was great. They started early and our flight left a little early which was convenient. Having free games to play would have been betterJust total easy flight experience!! What could you do better..? Hmmm..? There was nothing I can remember. Spirit was a far more comfortable and easy process than American, United & Delta. I'll always look for Spirit and I've told a few people about, since flying this past trip!! I'm a SPIRIT FAN!! Thank You, SPIRIT AIRLINES!! Very, VERY well done, 100%!! See you...SOON!! -Best, Linda R.The flight was 3.5 hrs delayed. I was not notified prior to arriving to the airport via spirit app. or via boarding pass that I already had loaded on my phone. The agent that i saw at the counter didn’t mention anything about the delay either. I only saw the update after logging in to my email account.Better than my las vagas experience, but still dissapointed with the airline support service.Unfortunately, spirits crew had us boarding and parking the plane often, would wait long periods of time before allowing the people attending the flight on the plane to know what was going on this caused for my plane to not only get diverted but then canceled at an airport 2 hours away and basically stranded with charter buses MAYBE being hired. I was left with no choice but to stay overnight and use a comp room in Altantic City to then arrive home the next day. This trip was the first time seeing my partner since he joined the Air Force and this stressful ride caused unwarranted tears on what was supposed to be an east flight home. I understand weather is unpredictable but to have passengers deboard to then reboard an hour later to taxi on the runway for another hour to then basically leave an entire fight stranded. I waited almost 30 minutes at the airport and not one employee could tell me about a charter bus so I had to leave and make accommodations to stay overnight and get a ride home.Great! We boarded on time! Everything went so smoothly! The flight was so smoothSeats uncomfortable, hard to check luggage, etc. It was like the last flight out of HanoiI will never fly with Spirit again. I was late getting through TSA after dealing with traffic and getting on the wrong shuttle. I got to the gate 2 minutes before the ticket said the gate closes and they agents were gone and doors were closed. They rescheduled my flight for 12 hours later and the agent had the nerve to tell me, “Be on time next time”. I was already upset from nothing going right for me that morning. I booked another flight through Alaska Airlines and they were very accommodating, nerer again Spirit Airlines!!!!Everyone seemed to be in zone 1 for boarding. Maybe break it up a little. Otherwise, smooth flight.Frontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.Southwest8.0United Airlines7.4Viva7.0Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Hobby to CancúnAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsHouston Hobby Airport (HOU)Cancún (CUN)Cabin class types available on flights to CancúnCabin classes available on flights to Cancún.
