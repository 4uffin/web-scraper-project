This matter will be taken to the social media to shame the employees involved.my experience was great with Turkish airlines . the problem i encountered was with kayak booking. When I booked . it showed that im allowed a bag . and when I got to the airport, i had to pay $165 for one bag.Not up to Business Class standards. Two of the three toilets were out of order. The hostesses were aware and didn’t show any responsible act to do something. Food quality was not what we expect from Turkish hospitality. Overall we were not impressed and disappointed.During mid flight, try to get a flight attendant to help I couldn’t find one Otherwise, everything was perfectI was not given basinett seat.The connecting flight was missed due to airline fault i was not accomodated for hotel.Drinks were normt served frewuently.Never travelling again on tirkish airlines.I always travel wiyh family by turkish airline but no more.zero starsThe crew were very hospitable and pleasant. The food was pretty good. Unfortunately, there was a flight delay of more than 2 hours. We're not sure why but it appeared to be outside the control of Turkish Airlines.Bough tickets with luggage, but made me pay at Airport as wellThe economy seat was so uncomfortable, had not enough leg room for 13 hours flight, front seat basket was broken and couldn’t hold anything, food quality was horrible( we got food poisoned ) we charged for logged which used to be free. We paid too much for this flight and very disappointed. Turkish air line better to make satisfy and respect people instead of find different way to scam people.This is really the rating of two flights. JFK to IST then IST to NQZ. New York to Istanbul was good. Good crew and all positives. The flight to Astana was so bad that brought it all down. Crew was nonexistent above the minimum, seats were cramped, and it was hot on the plane. Turkish Airlines seems to be slipping down to US based carriers level.The 2 agents on the check in counter were super nice , helpful and very polite. Boarding was like a 1 2 3, I would recommend Turkish airlines for your next trip.Baggage fees are deceptive! When I booked this flight, I purchased two tickets and had indicated that I wanted one checked bag. That increased the ticket price by about $100 PER TICKET!. When we went to check in, I was told that I could only check ONE bag, even though I had purchased TWO tickets. I had to pay an additional $50 each way for my wife’s bag. In my opinion, I paid twice for her bag.Too hot. Asked for an extra glass of water and was ignored. Asked to sit in empty seats that were open because it was so hot and crowded and was denied and the seats were empty the entire flightTerrible leg room - I’m 5’3” and my knees were touching the seat in front of me. When the person sitting in front of me leaned back, there was about 15 inches of space between my head and the TV screen which made it awkward to view movies. Last year they had decent food, but this year the only tasty item on the trip was dessert.The flight was delayed leaving Philadelphia due to “catering” and consequently arrived in Dublin some 75 minutes later than scheduled. Consequently this caused me to miss my connecting flight to Glasgow and I had to spend the night in Dublin.The flight from Cincinnati to Philadelphia was satisfactory and uneventful.Horrible. I had to wait in Dublin for 4 hours for the next connecting flight which took my to London and than i had to wait 3 hours for the flight to DusseldorfIt was truly a horrible flight. We were delayed almost 2 hours. The seats were so tiny, my legs were hurting the entire flight. When i finally made it to Ireland i missed my connecting flight because we left Newark late. I will most likely never fly Aer Lingus againTerrible. The test of an airline is how they deal with problems. There is very little to differentiate between airlines. Aer Lingus failed absolutely. They lost one of my bags even though we had more than a 2 hour connection in Dublin. Trying to get it back has been awful. In checking on line I can see that the bag is in Edinburgh and it was supposed to be delivered today. It wasn't. The number we have in the UK doesn't answer. I had to pay for an international call to speak to somebody. All the woman at the call centre could say was be patient wait. I can tell you when it will be delivered nor can I tell you who the courier is.Not JetBlue's fault but Aer Lingus never explained how to transfer to JetBlue.Overall it was good experience and it was my first trip with Aer Lingus. One thing I was embarrassed was that someone occupied my seat so I was asked to use another seat. Due to this unhappy happening I almost missed the connecting flight because the random seat was far from the flight door. Food was fine, I liked the macaroni and cheese with fresh bread.Handling our luggage was the biggest issue - they lost it and we got it almost 3 days later. Really threw off the beginning of our trip and we really had to change our itinerary accordingly.Seat was hard and uncomfortable and the temperature too warm and uncomfortable.No meals included on this long international flight. Most airlines will offer you a meal when flying internationally. Not Icelandair. Your included choices are water and coffee. Poor customer service. The airport was also very confusing.I flew Icelandair with my partner from Prague to the US. Overall flight time was around 12 hours, with a connecting flight in Iceland. I have flown internationally for years and with multiple airlines. Every airline serves you a meal when traveling internationally. Icelandair not only did not offer an inclusive meal, but they did not even offer a snack. The only things they served over our long flight was water and coffee. Ridiculous! Never again will I fly with Icelandair.Best smelling onboard bathrooms ever. Even after use the whole flight. Biggest overhead bins. Most legroom in economy class. Great Icelandiic music. Really nice staff. Icelandair is awesome! (Don’t fly Air Canada! During the strike they lied about no flights available (I booked this flight myself) and hid the process to get money back on their website by obscuring menu titles, then made it difficult and time consuming to fill out. I’m Canadian. Don’t trust Air Canada!It was good. The air plane is clean and staff were friendly.Worst airline I’ve ever flown. Delayed 5.5 hrs, missed connecting flight, and missed an entire day of vacation. Zero customer serviceEverything sucked. No food, one small glass of water, a tiny coffee, 5.5 hour delay with no customer service. Would never recommend flying them.The crew was wonderful at check in, the gate and on board. Felt the luggage had more room than the passengers. The seats were smaller than most domestic U.S. airlines. I'm only 5'2" and I had little legroom. There were only 2 bathrooms in coach. Needed more. The flight was very smooth but not the most comfortable.There was no lounge at Boston for us to use. Typically flying first class overseas comes with lounge privileges. The seats did not recline even a little. My headset only worked on one side. I felt like I was flying on Ryan Air, not Icelandic Air.We were moved twice on flights to the point we weren’t even on Lufthansa anymore. We had to fly united. Lost paid extra leg room twice. To top it all off we’re forced to pay $375 and $275, respectively for you luggage that was considered sports luggage. We were told it would be Lufthansa fares l, from the united desk, AND WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A LUFTHANSA FLIGHT! I’ll be calling once my trip is over on October 7th to all airlines and Kayak. This was ridiculous!Everything went smoothly and the staff was very kind. I’m glad I purchased the extra leg room for my long flight; it was totally worth it. We were served 2 meals for a 9 hour flight which I was not expecting and they were very tasty. I appreciated them being vegetarian. Customs line in Munich was long; I had a choice to have a 1 hr 40 min layover or 2 hr 40 min layover; I took the longer layover which I was thankful for because my flight was delayed 30 minutes and there’s a good chance I would have missed my connecting flight. This was my very first international flight and I would fly Discover again without hesitation. Thank you for taking good care of me!I liked everything BUT the temperature. It was freezing and now I am sick.I liked Quiet people around me. Crew could have helped people with overhead luggage so they aren't moving other peoples bags around and causing problems for people that had there bags there firstThe flight and crew were good. The customer experience on the ground could have been better. We had to reschedule our flight because of a delay on the previous flight. The attendants working the desk in Washington DC were not helpful. They told us to scan a QR code and that would get us rebooked. Why couldn't two people standing at their computers do this? We had to chat with someone to get everything figured out. It was extremely confusing.The plane was delayed by two hours in Chicago which led to us missing the next flight. Lufthansa rebooked the flight and booked us a hotel for the night in Frankfurt. The level of customer service and getting us taken care of was superb. The flight crew and the service on the ground was superb.It was a short flight, everything was good with it.Flight was delayed over one hour and I had to pay to select my seat, even though my booking supposedly had free selection (I paid extra for this at time of booking)Stop charging for alcohol overseas flights and start taking cash again not everyone wants to pay with card if the person is bigger give him seat on the outside seats not the middle in between the people is common sense and mainly if you fly for Lufthansa provides the sam service and experience...good entertainment package but rather small seats for business classThe crew was great. Good etc was unacceptable for an overseas flight. Wine with a meal should be complimentary. Seat comfort /space horrible and I am 5‘3“ with heels on. Short haul probably ok but not on long haul flightsIt was extremely difficult to upgrade my partners flight over the Internet from economy to economy, plus. Then it said clearly the checked luggage can be 32 kg. At the check-in counter in Hamburg, we had to pay 100 Euros ( $122.17) for the only 31kg peace checked luggage. We were told because the change was made less than 24 hours before the flight , the luggage weight would not be upgraded. Then they offered me that for €90 I can upgrade at the counter from economy to economy, plus so we can sit together on the flight from Frankfurt to San Francisco. I happily agreed and was charged. €99.($120.95), which I noticed too late. Especially about the Euro 100 up charge I feel upset and it’s a unfair way of doing business!Take off was not good, too hot inside the plane and seats are beyond uncomfortable.The company said that it was Condor's responsibility to issue my train ticket, and that I should contact them. But when I did, condor said I have to contact the train company and show them my booking number. I went to the station to board my train and they said where is my bar code ticket. It was a disaster and the people at the train station said how messed up this is and that condor is the worst for putting people through this. I boarded the train with NO ticket cause no one can issue me one even though I paid and it is in my booking confirmation.Helpful crew in a comfortable and well designed aircraft. My kids also loved the striped design of the airplane.The return flight, the food was better. Didn't like that even at checkin we still had to pay when only 5 seats were available. Had to pay or would be stuck in the very middle between two others. I had to pay for an aisle and a middle seat. Both were considered prime seats but the two other middle ones were not.There was one flight attendant who was exceptionally rude about the fact that they didn’t have any meatless options left when I told her I was a vegetarian. The boarding process was a bit disorganized and unclear but everything else was very good.Seats are not comfortable. Some of the food was good and some not so good.Really, nothing. I flew economy, and received a very good economy experience.Flight attendants were polite but not attentive. They did not clean cabin throughout trip, and the airplane upon disembarking looked disastrous! Garbage everywhere ! The state of the cabin did NOT leave passenger with a ‘cared-for’ feeling. It looked a total mess. They also closed themselves off in the back of the plane and passengers felt like they needed to knock to get a glass of water. Very dissppointing.Turkish Airlines7.3Aer Lingus7.2Icelandair7.0Lufthansa6.8Condor6.3Everything you need to know for your flight from Seattle to RomeAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsSeattle (SEA)Cabin class types available on flights from Seattle to RomeCabin classes available on flights from Seattle to Rome.
