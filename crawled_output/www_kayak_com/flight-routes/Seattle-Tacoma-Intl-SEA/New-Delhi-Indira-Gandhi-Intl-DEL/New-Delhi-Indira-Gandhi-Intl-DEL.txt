Comfortable seats. Served great Indian food and Masala Chai!Except for the uncleaned tray, and the delay in serving food for our section (which may have been due to the location of our row) everything else was good. The crew were very professional and responded to our requests promptly throughout the flight. We as a family were not disappointed by Emirates.It was great, a little more leg room would have been better particularly since we were in premium economyThe boarding process was smooth and the stewardesses were nice. Some delays with drinks at the end of the flight, but no issues.Thay crew was so nice.Air hostess il ham was so nice.my mom was little scray with airplan turbulence she help us alot.Seat 💺 was all the way on last row. Food was okay .Charged for internet that never really worked. The food selection was just ok.Boarding, seats, entertainment and service were all great. The food was great except for the fact that there were too many sweet items.Boarding, seats, entertainment and service were all great. Food was great except for the fact that there were too many sweet items.Cramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The airport was reasonably clean. The boarding process reasonably efficient. The cabin crew was efficient, polite but not that friendly. The food quality was unremarkable and the choices were awful . There was either a so so chicken dish or a “ vegetarian “ option which was really cheap carbohydrates drowned in cheese. Signing onto i flight wifi was not straightforward. Overall it was a very average experienceThe staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodWrong numbers on the seats, side rows had different numbers than middle row caused lot of confusion.Passengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.My entire row did not have power for the full duration of a 14.5 hour flight. Could not charge any devices such as laptop or phones for the entirety of the long flight. The flight attendants tried to remedy the issue by resetting the power, but were not successful. The only other solution provided was to move me to another seat on the plane which was in the middle row. I had paid for a “preferred” seat that was a window seat. This was a downgrade being offered due to the power issue.Nothing to complain. The staff and flight was good especially the seats which was better compared than the cloth ones on Qatar airwaysEconomy travel is really hard with no room to move especially when the person sitting beside you is an XL or XXL size person who if moving could hit your faceI was travelling 3.5 years after. Agree Economy is no business class but the food was mediocre. Ordered a Hindu meal, the salads were bitter . The food was really below quality and had no tast from what I had in the past. Indian Railways probably have a better quality food when compared. However the kids meal was really nice and really appreciate how they were taken care of. The restrooms were dirty .My flight was with American Airlines 120. The flight was delayed 3 hours and I missed my connection. When I arrived in Doha, the AA staff told me to call an 800 number to rebook a different flight, which was unacceptable. Eventually a Qatar Air staff member helped rebook me on a flight to Manila, that was 12 hours later. They offered me a hotel and meal voucher which I declined, because I didn’t want to leave the airport. Long story short, I spent 12 hours in the Doha airport waiting for my next flight.Overall the experience was neat with crew being nice and caring especially to parent with kids. The free snacks option was okay. The kiosk at Philly airport didn’t work.Reason for travelling Tampa to Orlando is to fly Qatar Airline. we end up with American Airline. This was the miserable experience I ever had in my entire travel history. Flight attendants were rude. They hit my knee with the food cart and I was holding ice pack for 2 hours. I still have the pain after a week. WE boarded the flight twice because of the temperature inside the plan.First keep the airline as you promise. Reason for travelling from Orlando to Tampa is to go with Qatar Airline. We end up with American Airline. As expected the service was horrible.Not sure how we end up with American Airlines instead of Qatar Airways. From Philadelphia to Qatar they boarded us then they asked us to unload. After 30 minutes later they board us again. The inside the plane it was burning hot and we were sweating like crazy. Crew members are absolute rude. The way they served the passengers were horrible. One of the crew members hit my knee with food cart and kept going. I was holding an ice pack for almost 2 hours. I am still with the pain.I felt that when I was rerouted it should have been to business class.Rude staff. I would avoid using the word racist but definitely partially or discriminatory. My 72 yrs old mother who is also disabled was traveling on this flight. She was the second passenger boarded to the plane. The First elderly couple ahead of my mother were allowed to use the airplane bathroom but my mother was denied entry stating it was for safety reasons. My mother objected the the couple in front of her were allowed but hostess still stated that due to the flight safety reasons she can’t use it. Even my mother explained that he is using blood pressure medication that’s why she have to use the restroom frequently but the crew continued arguing her. At one point the Mae attendent even suggested that if that’s the case my mother can urinate in her seat. The level of disrespect against an elderly lady is beyond my comprehension. This matter will be taken to the social media to shame the employees involved.my experience was great with Turkish airlines . the problem i encountered was with kayak booking. When I booked . it showed that im allowed a bag . and when I got to the airport, i had to pay $165 for one bag.Not up to Business Class standards. Two of the three toilets were out of order. The hostesses were aware and didn’t show any responsible act to do something. Food quality was not what we expect from Turkish hospitality. Overall we were not impressed and disappointed.During mid flight, try to get a flight attendant to help I couldn’t find one Otherwise, everything was perfectI was not given basinett seat.The connecting flight was missed due to airline fault i was not accomodated for hotel.Drinks were normt served frewuently.Never travelling again on tirkish airlines.I always travel wiyh family by turkish airline but no more.zero starsThe crew were very hospitable and pleasant. The food was pretty good. Unfortunately, there was a flight delay of more than 2 hours. We're not sure why but it appeared to be outside the control of Turkish Airlines.Outdated business class on this aircraft, no flat bed, and even minimal recline. Couldn’t sleep at all. Laggy and outdated entertainment system. Food sub standard.Bough tickets with luggage, but made me pay at Airport as wellThe economy seat was so uncomfortable, had not enough leg room for 13 hours flight, front seat basket was broken and couldn’t hold anything, food quality was horrible( we got food poisoned ) we charged for logged which used to be free. We paid too much for this flight and very disappointed. Turkish air line better to make satisfy and respect people instead of find different way to scam people.This is really the rating of two flights. JFK to IST then IST to NQZ. New York to Istanbul was good. Good crew and all positives. The flight to Astana was so bad that brought it all down. Crew was nonexistent above the minimum, seats were cramped, and it was hot on the plane. Turkish Airlines seems to be slipping down to US based carriers level.We were moved twice on flights to the point we weren’t even on Lufthansa anymore. We had to fly united. Lost paid extra leg room twice. To top it all off we’re forced to pay $375 and $275, respectively for you luggage that was considered sports luggage. We were told it would be Lufthansa fares l, from the united desk, AND WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A LUFTHANSA FLIGHT! I’ll be calling once my trip is over on October 7th to all airlines and Kayak. This was ridiculous!Everything went smoothly and the staff was very kind. I’m glad I purchased the extra leg room for my long flight; it was totally worth it. We were served 2 meals for a 9 hour flight which I was not expecting and they were very tasty. I appreciated them being vegetarian. Customs line in Munich was long; I had a choice to have a 1 hr 40 min layover or 2 hr 40 min layover; I took the longer layover which I was thankful for because my flight was delayed 30 minutes and there’s a good chance I would have missed my connecting flight. This was my very first international flight and I would fly Discover again without hesitation. Thank you for taking good care of me!I liked everything BUT the temperature. It was freezing and now I am sick.I liked Quiet people around me. Crew could have helped people with overhead luggage so they aren't moving other peoples bags around and causing problems for people that had there bags there firstThe flight and crew were good. The customer experience on the ground could have been better. We had to reschedule our flight because of a delay on the previous flight. The attendants working the desk in Washington DC were not helpful. They told us to scan a QR code and that would get us rebooked. Why couldn't two people standing at their computers do this? We had to chat with someone to get everything figured out. It was extremely confusing.The plane was delayed by two hours in Chicago which led to us missing the next flight. Lufthansa rebooked the flight and booked us a hotel for the night in Frankfurt. The level of customer service and getting us taken care of was superb. The flight crew and the service on the ground was superb.It was a short flight, everything was good with it.Flight was delayed over one hour and I had to pay to select my seat, even though my booking supposedly had free selection (I paid extra for this at time of booking)Stop charging for alcohol overseas flights and start taking cash again not everyone wants to pay with card if the person is bigger give him seat on the outside seats not the middle in between the people is common sense and mainly if you fly for Lufthansa provides the sam service and experience...good entertainment package but rather small seats for business classEmirates8.1Delta7.9Qatar Airways7.4Turkish Airlines7.3Lufthansa6.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Seattle to New DelhiAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Seattle to New DelhiFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Seattle to New Delhi according to KAYAK users.
