The flight attendant was rude when I asked for a Diet Coke, the boarding required quite a long walk and the plane was crammed and uncomfortable.You no longer give receipts for baggage at the counter. And it is next to impossible to get it on your webpage. Spent 20 min trying and gave up... I need receipt to submit for reimbursement and don't have time to waste on your poor webpage Disappointing .....My email notifications were silenced, so I didn't get word that the departing flight had changed gates. It wasn't until I noticed that few people had gathered for the flight that I checked the airport schedule board, 20 minutes before boarding. I then told several people at the old gate of the change. If I was to receive a text I would have been notified of the change earlier, Or to hear an announcement over the airport intercom.Canceled flight. No communication of this prior. Rescheduled to next day. Our good seats we purchased months ago turned into last row middle. No apology, reason, nor compensation for time and $ spent.The setting on the loudspeaker was painful and the crew member who did the talking spoke very quickly and repetitively, with extra little jokes that were distracting and mostly unfunny. I doubt that the main messages penetrated the noise.I like the new adjustable headrest. Unfortunately 2 crying children were in front of us. But it was the first time and not holding Alaska accountable for that. Alaska always seems to have everything in order professional but comfortable.Great crew, smooth flight and landing. Wish they would offer Dr. Pepper and a choice of flavors of pretzels.Thank you still providing bags for vomit. My son had a migraine and needed a bag to vomit in and it was right there behind the seat in front of us. Thank you!Flight was great. Boarding was crazy because another flight was boarding late next to ours so everyone was standing and in the way.All good! No entertainment on this new plane yet but ok for this short flight. Great on time flight! ThanksAs always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Delayed flight. Nicest crew member was a SW pilot flying seated next to me who kindly move to seat the final passenger. Flight extra delayed. My cup of refreshment of ginger ale was so packed with ice it was literally 2 sips.No trays in our seats, we sat in first row, purchased a business class fare. Had to hold our drinks and snack in our hands. No plugs for our cell phones. Had to pay for it a drink cocktail each. Seats so uncomfortable.Flight wasn’t even full, but too many carry-ons caused us to run out of bin space. New bag fee has folks who would usually check their bags carrying on. Watching Southwest morph into Spirit/Frontier is so sad to watchSouthwest is Southwest. No frills. If you're luck enough to get a happy crew (we did), then it makes for a nicer flight.It was a perfect flight in all aspects! Both legs!Great flight, 47 passengers on a 180 seat plane. Stewardess was pleasant and cheerful.I liked the crew member who gave flight instructions on "in case of a problem:. The seats are so small that only a young teenager could sit in middle seat.Had a hard time checking into my flight on my phone because they gave me the wrong confirmation number. Otherwise everything else went well.All was good and they were able to seat my travel companion next to me. Thank you.What an amazing flight. I haven’t experienced this level of service in a flight in years. This will be the only way to fly to Hawaii for me in the future.Kayak sold me a ticket after check in time. Could not check in. Could not get on flight.Everything was great except having to check in at Alaska. That was a surprise and took extra time and effort. Should have been explained somewhere maybe on the HA electronic ticket.I accidentally made this purchase and they wouldn’t refund me even though I called immediately to cancel it.The flight was delayed and they didn’t have a pilot for the flight. Seemed very unorganized and took way longer than expected.I could not believe that on a 5 hour plus flight we were not given a complimentary meal . That should be illegal. Or it would be nice to be informed beforehand that a complimentary meal would not be provided. The wording in the email I got about pre ordering food was phrased in a way that made the food seem like it would be free. Very misleading! Also during boarding we were informed there would be empty seats we could move to if we wanted, all we had to do was wait for an announcement, however an announcement was never made. Then when we tried to change seats ourselves we were singled out over the loud speaker and told we could not move without asking. Then the flight was about to take off , so we didn’t have time to ask . Then we were told we could not move to the exit row because you had to pay for those seats, but we were not told where we could move. Also no one was in the exit rows so , if something happened no one would be there to assist the passengers. Also people should be allowed to move there if the airline wasn’t able to sell them. One passenger asked if he could pay for the upgrade and the flight attendant said she did not have the capability to charge for the seat on her mobile device, so the airline ended up losing possible income anyways . So why not let people move there during flight if you have no way to charge them? Then the landing was bumpy and awful and many passengers complained out loud when we landed .It was pretty good except there was no food, which was understandable because it was a short flight but I would have liked to at least have a snack; otherwise it was great. Staff/crew, great. Thank youThe flight was great! The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. I would definitely fly Hawaiian Aurlines again!Spirit rescheduled a 4:30 PM flight to 8:52 AM. That's ridiculous and borderline fraud.Spirit Airlines was ok but TRAVELHELPDESK, the 3rd party travel agent IS A JOKE! VERY RUDE CUSTOMER AGENTS ont he phone. NO HELP AT ALL. But the airlines was ok.No frills - because you get what you pay for. The crew was amazing!! I had plenty of room to spread out because the flight was half full. Which made it easy to sleep.The staff was very very rude in Las Vegas when boarding the flight. When presenting the boarding ticket. Las Vegas flight, it was hot and stuffy, it smelled really bad.Dear All, I have harassment and accident with the flight attendant . This is my phone to talk 8168073567, please, leave phone message . Regards Emily,Flight was on time but the amount of noise from several children and the kicking of my seat the entire flight was overwhelming.Unbelievable check in horrible. Asked to print tickets at the gate after a delaycheck in at security was a hassle being scanned. Spirit employees were helpful and professional.Had a issue with catching flight due to airline, was unable to board flightI liked how cheap it was but both my flights were delayed heavilyThis airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.The delay was ridiculous because nary a word escaped from the gate attendant regarding our flight status. It was a complete joke.Cancelled flight after I arrived at airport after 75 min drive and parking. Next flight was 4 days in the future. Had to scramble and buy a much more expensive flight on another carrier.I liked the turn-style feature at gate 209B at LAX. Very efficient process. The gate staff also made several, clearly directed announcements so I felt very informed.The seats were awful, hard plastic covered in sheet vinyl. The airline tries to scam you into paying extra to get seat together when the flight wasn’t full. They were going to separate a family with young children but my wife who had a row to herself gave up her seat so the young mom could be with her young boys. I’m never giving this airline my money again.It was a short flight so no food or entertainment….The worst flight of my life. Never will I fly frontier againFrontier had yet another flight cancellation. Have never made a complete round trip with this airline without at least one leg getting cancelled. Miserable flights - dirty, uncomfortable planes that apparently always have issues since I've had multiple delays and cancellations with them.Flight was delayed 3 times, would have been nice to have received text message instead of email notifications. Frontier app wasn’t even updated accordingly, no gate number disclosed. No agent at front desk of gate to inform of delay. Very confused and left if the darkThey changed the timing , first delayed by 4 hours then went back to 40 mins late, we had to run back to airport to not miss our flight.
