That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.8.0 ExcellentTarun, Sep 2025MCO - LHRRead more Delta reviewsPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneI believe that a four-hour trip should have a meal. Delta had none.Was charged for my luggage despite having been on one ticket from an international flight. Too tired to argue after 15 hours on flight. Was charged for rechecking it at JFK airport. Not sure why those off Kenya Airways were required to do that.Flight was canceled, and no effort was made to help with rebooking, no hotel vouchers, no car transportation and minimal food voucher and most places for food were closed by the time the voucher was given. Waited for 3 hours for bags. Simply the worst travel experience I have ever hadAt first, we were on the runway for about an hour, literally. The Captain did explain that the Control Tower just had a change shift (sounds like an unrealistic excuse) and then that we had to change a runway. A regular economy seat is made for 12 yo twiggy. I understand Delta wants to push for an upgrade, but after sitting in a Comfort seat and in First class. I would say First class is not worthy of my money. The landing was delayed because of the weather in NYC, I don't hold that against Delta, of course. The Captain did alert us to that upon takeoff in Vegas and again as we reached NY.Great. Very smooth. Plenty of information. However, wish they would give out a menu in advance of making a dinner choice like other international airlines. The flight attendant says chicken or pasta and there are details about ingredients or spices requiring the passenger to ask which requires the flight attendant to answer many times. So easy to solve this problem. PNot a "Delta" issue, but a JFK issue: We booked a connecting flight with 3 1/2 hours between to clearn immigration and customs. Our inbound flight (BCN to JFK) was on the taxiway 45 minutes which ate into our layover time. Immigtration was insanely quick with the CBP MPC app; however, clearing TSA (again, after we were ALREADY cleared in Spain on the inbound international flight) took over 95 minutes. This left us with 10 minutes before boarding the connecting flight (JFK to SAN) to walk to the far end of Terminal 4 and try to find food. We didn't find any food that could promise to serve us in under 10 minutes so we boarded the Delta flight after coming off a plance and an 8-hour flight knowing that we wouldn't be served any food on the next 5 1/2 hour flight. I feel like Delta needs to put pressure on the JFK TSA to open more screening stations (by our count, we saw only 5 scanners open and a line of - as we said - over 90 minutes. The insult is that we WERE ALREADY SCREENED through TSA, but as you come off one flight into the USA, you have to go through the whole process again. It seems like if you have a connecting flight, there should be a way to pass through immigration and customs without needing to return through TSA.Overall, aside from the baggage issue, it was as good as one expects.My flight was 6 pm 6/6. Every hour they delayed it again - air condition issues then no pilot then the crew had worked too many hours and cancelled the flight at 11 pm. Sent customers to NJ a 45 minutes uber ride to a hotel. Had to be back by 5 am for a 7 am flight and again no pilot etc with another three hours of delays.I had no checked baggage but was required to hand over carry on baggage at the door of the plane. There was a lot of overboard space in the plane and I was one of the last ones. I ran to get my carry on but it was gone. I was given back at the plane door in Toronto, so the wait was not as long as it would have been at the carousel.This flight was perfect. No complaints and only the highest regard for the crew and ground staff and how they executed perfectly. I fly a lot with United and would request predictability and transparency in their operations instead of last minute changes.The food should improve! And The flight should leave on time and not make the traveler wait.We love united ! We would like to acknowledge Aimee in the lounge near gate 130Although the flight was delayed the crew and the flight itself were very good. Couldn't fault anything and after the disappointment of being abandoned in the US by BA it was a welcome relief to travel with UnitedSurvey sent before we actually left. Delay after delay. Now a crew problem.I love flying with United. Unfortunately, I flew on an older plane with minimal upgraded technology (no Bluetooth functionality or handy charging ports). Otherwise, the flight was great and even arrived early.They changed my seats after I checked in and I was stressed from the time I saw that information until just before boarding, when the gate attendant fixed it, but it shouldn't have happened. And if it couldn't be prevented, then the people on the phone I spoke with should have done something to help, which they did not, nor did they offer me compensation, just meaningless apologies.The flight was operated by Lufthansa. You can't expect much from them anymore. They have a talent in getting something wrong.Terrible. Out flight was delayed for 21 (twenty one) hours. United is a joke.Food was the worst I’ve had on a VA flight. Normally it’s a lot betterI was my pleasure to fly virgin on my birthday for my first solo trip ever 🫶🏼These are one of the older seat arrangements facing away from the windows! Not particularly convenient sets. No storage spaces. NO COAT HANGING HOOKS. Inconvenient business class seat compared to any other airlines of similar class. Staff are excellent! Extremely professional, friendly. Food is good too.Overall, flight was excellent but check in was very slow for Premium Economy. Economy queue was shorter but we weren't allowed to use it.The staff was not very polite but the flight was very very nice and comfortable and the entertainment was greatGreat crew - old style upper class seats on the older fleet now feels datedPremium economy more comfortable than economy, but not by much. Did was awful, do not try the omelette. Flight crew were helpful. Flight was delayed by over an hour. Overall but bad, arrived safely and thank God.Food was excellent. Service was very good. Staff was very helpful to all passengers.The crew was excellent as ever on Virgin. The special meal was poor unfortunately. More significantly when we arrived at Manchester Airport there was no air bridge provided and we had to exit the plane down a rickety stair case. This is unacceptable for a transatlantic flight. Whilst I understand that this is the airport’s fault at the end of the day the airline is responsible for our transportation and needs to do something.Super friendly and helpful staff, from check-in desk to cabin crew.We did not even get on this flight as the plane never left London. I missed the email that was sent mid morning USA time, so we were not aware the flight was cancelled. There was absolutely no help from the staff at the Norse check in gates, we were told to take a picture of the board they were holding up, to try and claim our money back. We were told to book our own flights to London which ended up costing $10000 due to the last minute. And now we have to return to Miami in 2 weeks. I am not holding my breath about getting on board for that flight either.Great experience. The flight was smooth with very little turbulence. We were in premium classic, so lots of leg room.Didn’t know you had to pay for earbuds and food on flight. Sounds awesome and better way to not waste food or items. Comfort of flight is was amazing other than thatUnexpectedly was surprised with the space on flight in economy and the price.I was not expecting having to pay for headphones, water and basic food in a 9 hours flight. Price for this flight was as high as any other, still I had to pay 4 lbs for a can of sprite. On top of that flight attendance gave a bothered look when I asked her for some ice for my soda. She reluctantly when to get it, brought me literally 3 cubes and walked away without looking at me to avoid another request. I couldn’t believe it. She was soooo rude. I will never book on Norse again and I will let everyone I know about this. Unforgivable, very bad customer service.Great crew. Customer support is pretty much non existent. I had 2 tickets that were not used, the flight was overbooked. I think I should have been reimbursed for the unused tickets.The movies were super old. The crew did not offer WATER???? 5 hours os flight and did not get WATER? Norse is the worst company I ever used and never will use again.Why call us to board if we’re going to be made to stand in the tunnel for 20 minutes. Really hard for people with little children. Plus it took me ages to check in because my seat in Premium was overbooked so I didn’t actually have a seat. I did end up receiving my seat in Premium but there was a lot of stress and confusion beforehand. Hope is it possible to overbook seats? Especially in Premium!We flew one way from Gatwick, London to JFK NY For 2 people $1200 and no food offered not even water. You had to buy food. Norse advertises as a low fare transatlantic airline, they may want rethink that. Crew, flight was fine. Ironically we flew American from JFK to Heathrow for $1000 (2people) and included food and drinks.Longest check in line I have ever seen- brutal and airline personnel hustled me about the size of my bag even though I showed them that it measured exactly to the measurements posted on their site. Just super annoying- I get it - it’s a budget airline and you get what you pay for. Most of the flight were young people who seemed to have never experienced international travel. It’s worth paying for a seat otherwise you will be uncomfortable.Need to offer Better food from LAX to London Service from London to Delhi very delayed after take off.Connection at Hethrow was horrible..We couldn't get out of the plane for an hour as they were buying people to the airport and there were not enough busses. We had 2 and half hf between flights so it was very tight. After departing plane we had to go thru security again. People with less time in between connections missed their flightsHorrible… I was downgraded without notice, had to sit in economy and given my back injury was in pain most of the journey. I expect to be reimbursed for this inconvenience and after my return flight home, I never plan to fly with British Airways again.Great crew and food and beverage. Seating tight but not the airline's fault. Will definitely fly BA in future!The seating has become ridiculous… like a contest to see how narrow and short they can be made- forcing anyone over 5’1 to pay more to not be twisting oneself into a pretzel. Really insane- would have thought BA was better than this. Frankly- it cancels out a lot of the positive aspects.flight was delayed from BWI to London - missed my connecting flight & then connecting flight (also British Air) was delayed - food is awful, TV & movie selection is greatSuper tight economy class. My knees were hitting the back of seat in front of me (I'm only 5'6"). My small backpack (sized according to their required dimensions) would not fit under the seat in front of me because there is a box (is that the life jacket?) in the way. Over all, extremely uncomfortable. I forgive the tasteless food, but the tight seating was tortureDidn’t fly with them as someone had cancelled my flightOnline check-in 24 hours in advance something seems not so easy to check in to pick seats and to print a boarding passI like the crew, very welcoming. Food can be better. The seat arms don’t go up so. I could use the empty seat next to mine to relax better. 3hrs delay 😠Delta7.9United Airlines7.4Virgin Atlantic7.4Norse Atlantic UK7.1British Airways6.7Everything you need to know for your flight from New York to LondonAirlinesCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from New York to LondonFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from New York to London according to KAYAK users.
