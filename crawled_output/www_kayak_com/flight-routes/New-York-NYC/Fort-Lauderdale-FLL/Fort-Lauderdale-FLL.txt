Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome one4.0 Okaypuravi, Aug 2025LGA - STLRead more Delta reviewsThis route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneI believe that a four-hour trip should have a meal. Delta had none.Was charged for my luggage despite having been on one ticket from an international flight. Too tired to argue after 15 hours on flight. Was charged for rechecking it at JFK airport. Not sure why those off Kenya Airways were required to do that.Flight was canceled, and no effort was made to help with rebooking, no hotel vouchers, no car transportation and minimal food voucher and most places for food were closed by the time the voucher was given. Waited for 3 hours for bags. Simply the worst travel experience I have ever hadthis crew didn't care much. bumping carts into seats more times than i care to rememberEasy boarding with an extremely kind attendant. Seats were spacious and we had 3 seats for 2 people so we could stretch out. Comfortable air flow and very attentive and hospital attendants. Bathrooms and food were the only negative. Bathrooms were so small you could hardly get in and close the door. I don’t think an obese person would fit or a person with a movement disability. Food was the trending food for flights, nonexistent. We spent $40 getting sandwich and snack at airport for our 6 hour flught.At first, we were on the runway for about an hour, literally. The Captain did explain that the Control Tower just had a change shift (sounds like an unrealistic excuse) and then that we had to change a runway. A regular economy seat is made for 12 yo twiggy. I understand Delta wants to push for an upgrade, but after sitting in a Comfort seat and in First class. I would say First class is not worthy of my money. The landing was delayed because of the weather in NYC, I don't hold that against Delta, of course. The Captain did alert us to that upon takeoff in Vegas and again as we reached NY.Not a "Delta" issue, but a JFK issue: We booked a connecting flight with 3 1/2 hours between to clearn immigration and customs. Our inbound flight (BCN to JFK) was on the taxiway 45 minutes which ate into our layover time. Immigtration was insanely quick with the CBP MPC app; however, clearing TSA (again, after we were ALREADY cleared in Spain on the inbound international flight) took over 95 minutes. This left us with 10 minutes before boarding the connecting flight (JFK to SAN) to walk to the far end of Terminal 4 and try to find food. We didn't find any food that could promise to serve us in under 10 minutes so we boarded the Delta flight after coming off a plance and an 8-hour flight knowing that we wouldn't be served any food on the next 5 1/2 hour flight. I feel like Delta needs to put pressure on the JFK TSA to open more screening stations (by our count, we saw only 5 scanners open and a line of - as we said - over 90 minutes. The insult is that we WERE ALREADY SCREENED through TSA, but as you come off one flight into the USA, you have to go through the whole process again. It seems like if you have a connecting flight, there should be a way to pass through immigration and customs without needing to return through TSA.My flight was 6 pm 6/6. Every hour they delayed it again - air condition issues then no pilot then the crew had worked too many hours and cancelled the flight at 11 pm. Sent customers to NJ a 45 minutes uber ride to a hotel. Had to be back by 5 am for a 7 am flight and again no pilot etc with another three hours of delays.The entertainment and wifi mostly didn't work on this flight.This flight was perfect. No complaints and only the highest regard for the crew and ground staff and how they executed perfectly. I fly a lot with United and would request predictability and transparency in their operations instead of last minute changes.Survey sent before we actually left. Delay after delay. Now a crew problem.I love flying with United. Unfortunately, I flew on an older plane with minimal upgraded technology (no Bluetooth functionality or handy charging ports). Otherwise, the flight was great and even arrived early.They changed my seats after I checked in and I was stressed from the time I saw that information until just before boarding, when the gate attendant fixed it, but it shouldn't have happened. And if it couldn't be prevented, then the people on the phone I spoke with should have done something to help, which they did not, nor did they offer me compensation, just meaningless apologies.Smooth flight, especially take off and landing, and great crew on board. Really loved the stroopwaffles!Deplaning was delayed because of Jetbridge equipment issues in MKE, causing an issue on an otherwise great flight.Not really their fault, but a 4.5 hour delay is pretty brutalwe were delayed going into and out of Newark Airport by 3-4 hours each way. Excuses/reasons given were misleading. Weather was cited at first when there was NO weather issue. Turns out Newark had a shortage of staff and runway construction. United knew this and should have NOT scheduled flights when they know we would be delayed so long. I will avoid United and EWR airport at all cost going forward. Delta never looked so good.Stewardess spilled orange juice on my clothes/seat no help no apology just threw napkins at me to clean the mess up. Not Happy.leg space better than expected. two washrooms for one plane isn't enough.Everything was great. I liked the text updates so that I never miss a gate change & I have all the latest info.Worst flight experience ever flights canceled. JetBlue told us just did not even bother standing in line to come back in one and a half hours then without any information we had to go pick up all of our luggage and spend over $2000 in accommodation just to get home. JetBlue said that the next flight available for us to get home would be three days later. Absolutely absurd hasn’t offered to give us any compensation do not fly JetBlue horrible company. They said it was based on the weather and the weather is great in all locations that we would’ve been flying to total hoax. I think it’s a conspiracy theory.I especially liked the lead crew officer. His boarding and safety announcements were made with a bit of novelty and humor. The flight also left the gate 10 minutes early and we landed about 20 minutes early… It was a delightful flight…Excellent. Although they used to greet me as a mosaic member and provide a free drink, early boarding helps me to keep coming back to JetBlue.Communication with the customer and stay is important. Staff off with a minor inconvenience but it worked out of course. Also this was a very old Mint Class plane. They snuck this one in on us. The updated aircraft are much better.The flight itself was fine, but the boarding process was extremely frustrating. There is no one scanning boarding passes - passengers just scan themselves and enter the jetway. By the time my husband and I got on the plane and were halfway to our seats they determined there were too many bags on the plane and everything at that point needed to be checked. This created a lot of unnecessary chaos. They should have alerted people before getting on the plane that they would need to start checking bags instead of waiting until people were already on the plane.The best flight I’ve had in a while. The plane was like 25% capacity, if that. Smoothest boarding and deplaning process I’ve ever experienced. Wish all flights were this smooth.Traveling with JetBlue from NYC was convenient as accessing JFK airport was straightforward via the LIRR to the AirTrain. Maneuvering through the terminal was hassle-free, which was a pleasant start to the journey. However, the flight experience itself left much to be desired. The seating arrangement was notably uncomfortable; despite securing a window seat, space felt cramped. This was exacerbated by the middle seat passenger encroaching on my area, which made the flight less enjoyable. Additionally, while the in-flight entertainment system initially seemed like a reprieve, the sound outlet on my seat was inoperable. This issue turned what could have been a manageable three-hour flight into a rather tedious ordeal, as I was unable to use the entertainment system effectively. While JetBlue provided a smooth process in terms of airport logistics, the on-board experience highlighted areas in need of improvement, particularly in terms of comfort and entertainment system maintenance.The flight crew that we had in our section may have been tired or something. I asked the flight attendant about my son’s screen not working and she spoke down to me like I was stupid. He still had no working screen throughout his flight. The other members had no personality and seemed like they were annoyed when you asked them for something. Definitely took a hit for simple things on my JB experience.Over 2 hour delay for a 50-minute flight is unacceptable, especially in normal weather. Very poor communication via appCrew was great. No entertainment and food and beverage was for purchase only, even waterIt was canceled. The flight wasn’t rescheduled, everyone had to figure out their own new arrangements. They said we would get refunded our original fare and receive an additional $150. We received links for $100 only and they expired before we could activate them.The plane had originated in Las Vegas at 6:30 in the morning and flew to Moline where we boarded. The flight left around 12:30 PM and there were no boxed snacks available and many of the alcoholic beverages were unavailable. I would find it hard to believe that that many of the passengers coming from Las Vegas at 6:30 in the morning, drank and ate that much of the items. I can only come to the conclusion that someone failed to stock the plane for the round-trip. This is a huge revenue failure for the airline and disappointment for the passengers. The flight crew did not seem happy to be there and did not engage with passengers. Allegiant you can do better.They did not let my husband on the plane with our service animal at the last minute. Do NOT fly this airline with a service animal!Tight! Seats are not designed for those of us who wear extra-large clothes.The non-stop flight from Grand Rapids was excellent. I neither expected or needed a budget flight and Allegiant made the trip easy and for an affordable price, Arriving at the Mesa Airport (AZA) is a delight compared to the international airport. For our return flight, we were able to arrive 75 minutes before the flight, return the rental car, check our bag and make it to the gate in plenty of time. That would never happen at most airports.Easiest flights I’ve ever taken. Plane was comfortable without overly crowded seating.Terrible. Still have not received the refund from them. They sent it to some account that I don't even know. Spoke with costumer service and they are unable to help.I didn’t like it at all. I miss my second flight because of the delay on Allegiant Air now I m stuck in MCO.Good, but a bit late on take off after loading. Don't like charging for carry ons!I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.Everything was fine. I'm average height and I pack light. I'm ready for my Spirit flight.Wow truly top notch airline Efficient nice snacks courteous staff Fast boarding !The staff was very sarcastic, the flight was delayed. There was no wi-fi o any type of entertainment. The plane was dirty and we have to wait a long time for the luggage to come out.Booked through kayak, everything seemed normal but when it came time to go, my flight ticket didn’t exist, so I had to purchase another set of tickets at the airport the day of the flight, for about double. When I reached kayaks customer service, they claimed no responsibility, and pushed me onto another 3rd party booking service, airfare assist, where I have had no luck getting any kind of help or refund. I’ve used kayak many times, but I’ll never again after I’ve been burned by this.The air fares are good, Charging me for every single thing 😩I am very happy with my experience with Spirit Airlines. Both flights were on time. Boarding was very pleasant. Crew was very nice. Flights were amazing and we even arrived earlier than the schedule time. I am hoping Spirits keeps on having non stop flight from Ft Lauderdale to Hartford for many years to come.Didn't like size of seats. Found charges for checked luggage and carry on too highMy experience with spirit was terrible. Customer service was terrible. Flight got canceled abruptly with no accommodations made for the inconvenience or any sort of help. I was unable to rebook a new flight.My experience was okay. The flight did not offer even water without a fee. Also had to pay extra for my carry on, as I was told I had to check my bag, even though it said I had the option to carry on a bag when booking. This costed me an extra $100. Would likely not fly with Spirit again.Delta7.9United Airlines7.4JetBlue7.2Allegiant Air7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Everything you need to know for your flight from New York to Fort LauderdaleAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from New York to Fort LauderdaleFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from New York to Fort Lauderdale according to KAYAK users.
