The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!10.0 ExcellentG, Sep 2025LAS - ATLRead more Southwest reviewsI wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Three seats in first class were broken and while they were able to still acommodate us it was looking very touch and go and they had others they could not acommodateThey made us board and then deboard due to mechanical issue which delayed the departure by almost 2 hours and we barely made our connecting flight. These quality checks should've been done before boarding not after.I liked the friendliness of the staff. The cleanliness of all 3 planes.Flight was delayed, 30+ bags had to be gate checked. Crew were very friendly!Everything was good until we were boarding our connection flight in Atlanta, we were told to gate check our carry-on, but when we got inside the plane, there was plenty of room in the overhead.Very late arrival at PWM. Late jet getting to ATL. Equipment problem with aircraft - could not get enough water onto plane., Another delay getting FAA approval for flight with bottled H2O. Not the crew’s problem.After all the weather issues at least they got me to my destination the next dayFrom Atlanta to Savannah - flight connection was way to short (we weren't even late landing ) and flight was already boarding when we landed - we were told we were the last on board and so we had to gate check our bags. Once we got on the plane, there were at least seven open bag spots so that was unnecessary delay. There should be better communication between the gate agent and the crew.Crew was excellent. Comfort seats not as nice as other kinds of planes.Everything was great. I liked the text updates so that I never miss a gate change & I have all the latest info.No internet on a flight over three hours in this age is criminal. Staff inattentive and dismissiveWorst flight experience ever flights canceled. JetBlue told us just did not even bother standing in line to come back in one and a half hours then without any information we had to go pick up all of our luggage and spend over $2000 in accommodation just to get home. JetBlue said that the next flight available for us to get home would be three days later. Absolutely absurd hasn’t offered to give us any compensation do not fly JetBlue horrible company. They said it was based on the weather and the weather is great in all locations that we would’ve been flying to total hoax. I think it’s a conspiracy theory.flight was delayed for hours with no explanation. The plane was a very old aircraft.The flight departed more than 1 hour late. Leg room is bigger than most airlinesExcellent. Although they used to greet me as a mosaic member and provide a free drink, early boarding helps me to keep coming back to JetBlue.No music app working: no economy meal on five hour flight; hour on tarmac at the end waiting for a gate. Flight itself was smooth and easy.Communication with the customer and stay is important. Staff off with a minor inconvenience but it worked out of course. Also this was a very old Mint Class plane. They snuck this one in on us. The updated aircraft are much better.The flight itself was fine, but the boarding process was extremely frustrating. There is no one scanning boarding passes - passengers just scan themselves and enter the jetway. By the time my husband and I got on the plane and were halfway to our seats they determined there were too many bags on the plane and everything at that point needed to be checked. This created a lot of unnecessary chaos. They should have alerted people before getting on the plane that they would need to start checking bags instead of waiting until people were already on the plane.In flight on demand didn't work at our seats. Only a single beverage/snack run.Everything was fine. I'm average height and I pack light. I'm ready for my Spirit flight.The seat belt was lengthy enough that I did not need an extender. Courteous and helpful flight attendants.We sat on the tarmac for an hour waiting for a gate to deplane.I've flown Spirit many times. However, they seem to be getting worse. I don't understand how the contracts with the gates at the airport works, but Spirit never seems to have a gate ready when we land. This happened again on this flight. And once again, baggage took forever to arrive at the baggage claim belt. This time it was about 45 minutes to an hour, late at night, when the airport was not crowded. On a previous trip, they lost the luggage cart and we were all waiting for about 3 hours for our luggage. Plus, I did get a deal through Kayak on a flight that was shown sold out on Spirit's site. However, by the time I added all the luggage, and didn't even pick seats, I could have taken any direct flight I wanted through Delta. I'm about done with Spirit.I enjoyed my flight, it was pretty smooth and we landed earlier than eta.The flight was delayed four and half hours for paperwork on a maintenance issue. Very frustrating.I made it safely. The flight was delayed, though. Not upset or expect anything.Great experience overall. Early boarding, no delays. Drinks and snacks are not included in price and very expensive. Seats are not very comfortable. Not as much space or padding as other airlines. Good for a quick cheap flight.Crew from Columbus to Atlanta excellent. Flight overall was good. Flight crew from Atlanta to Newark were average probably because they had to deal with overbooked flight and obnoxious people on the flight. Ground crew in terminal needed to do a better job limiting luggage boarding the plane.The ease of booking the flight was very good. Speaking with customer service was also good. However, the crew people are unfriendly and unwelcoming which I found this as unprofessional. As far as comfort it was mediocre. This was my first time flying Spirit and I chose them because of the flight times met my needs and my budget. However, I would be reluctant to fly on Spirit again. In addition, if the crew were more friendly and at least appeared somewhat happy and welcoming personally it would probably make the experience of flying with Spirit better.Frontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.Southwest8.0Delta7.9JetBlue7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from New York to AtlantaAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from New York to AtlantaFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from New York to Atlanta according to KAYAK users.
