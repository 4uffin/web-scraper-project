Miami is a popular destination and it’s better to be at the gate early.Verified travelerFlew with Spirit AirlinesEWR-FLLJan 2025We love flying Newark to Fort Lauderdale, and the time slots of Spirit Airlines are perfect for us. We certainly hope that Spirit doesn't stop flying under Chapter 11, but that is certainly a risk we need to consider if we are buying tickets months in advance. Also, it only really pays to fly Spirit if you are flying light - check for allowable size and weight of "personal items" that are exempt from add-on fees.Verified travelerFlew with Spirit AirlinesLGA-MIAJan 2025You don't need to be there that early, an hour earlier than the departure for a local airport is fine.ScottFlew with United AirlinesEWR-MIAJan 2025Long walk / train to rental counter Newark from manhattan is faster than jfkdeepakFlew with Spirit AirlinesEWR-MIADec 2024Do not check in baggage and keep everything in carry on as much as possible.

Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome one4.0 Okaypuravi, Aug 2025LGA - STLRead more Delta reviewsThis route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneI believe that a four-hour trip should have a meal. Delta had none.Was charged for my luggage despite having been on one ticket from an international flight. Too tired to argue after 15 hours on flight. Was charged for rechecking it at JFK airport. Not sure why those off Kenya Airways were required to do that.Flight was canceled, and no effort was made to help with rebooking, no hotel vouchers, no car transportation and minimal food voucher and most places for food were closed by the time the voucher was given. Waited for 3 hours for bags. Simply the worst travel experience I have ever hadAt first, we were on the runway for about an hour, literally. The Captain did explain that the Control Tower just had a change shift (sounds like an unrealistic excuse) and then that we had to change a runway. A regular economy seat is made for 12 yo twiggy. I understand Delta wants to push for an upgrade, but after sitting in a Comfort seat and in First class. I would say First class is not worthy of my money. The landing was delayed because of the weather in NYC, I don't hold that against Delta, of course. The Captain did alert us to that upon takeoff in Vegas and again as we reached NY.Not a "Delta" issue, but a JFK issue: We booked a connecting flight with 3 1/2 hours between to clearn immigration and customs. Our inbound flight (BCN to JFK) was on the taxiway 45 minutes which ate into our layover time. Immigtration was insanely quick with the CBP MPC app; however, clearing TSA (again, after we were ALREADY cleared in Spain on the inbound international flight) took over 95 minutes. This left us with 10 minutes before boarding the connecting flight (JFK to SAN) to walk to the far end of Terminal 4 and try to find food. We didn't find any food that could promise to serve us in under 10 minutes so we boarded the Delta flight after coming off a plance and an 8-hour flight knowing that we wouldn't be served any food on the next 5 1/2 hour flight. I feel like Delta needs to put pressure on the JFK TSA to open more screening stations (by our count, we saw only 5 scanners open and a line of - as we said - over 90 minutes. The insult is that we WERE ALREADY SCREENED through TSA, but as you come off one flight into the USA, you have to go through the whole process again. It seems like if you have a connecting flight, there should be a way to pass through immigration and customs without needing to return through TSA.My flight was 6 pm 6/6. Every hour they delayed it again - air condition issues then no pilot then the crew had worked too many hours and cancelled the flight at 11 pm. Sent customers to NJ a 45 minutes uber ride to a hotel. Had to be back by 5 am for a 7 am flight and again no pilot etc with another three hours of delays.The entertainment and wifi mostly didn't work on this flight.Terrible entertainment system - kept freezing and audio kept cutting out. Snacks were mediocre at best for a 5 hour flight.I am still upset that my bag was lost on a recent trip to Rome ; we were inconvenienced and out €150 Euros ; delta has refused to reimburse usGreat. Quick and quiet and east. The breakfast choices were a welcome surprise!We arrived 4 hours early and still almost missed the flight because they weren’t able to access one of the boarding tickets. They then sent hour bags late and we were all of our without clothing and eventually had to take an expensive cab back and forth to the airport as they wouldn’t deliver the bag which arrived late at night that day and we would have to wait until noon the began day (messing up a second day of plans). Also, all the food has dairy or pork. No vegan or even vegetarian option in the flight—even for purchase.The comfort of the seats was great, the crew eased my child’s anxieties and the fact that I had full cans of my beverage choice was great.Pathetic check in experience at JFK. Everything is self check in. Not enough staff present to help with when the check in process or the kiosk gets stuck. Staff present not welcoming or pleasant at all. On the other hand the NY based flight crew was great. Courteous and friendly throughout the flight. Special meals leave a lot to be desired. Kids meals should be made available when kids are flying and same goes for special kids meals too.Waited on the runway for takeoff for 2.5 hours. Air traffic rerouted us. The plane didn't have enough fuel, so had to go back to the gate. Had to wait for a new pilot. Should have landed at 5:22. Didn't land until 9:10. Trash flight.There were five broken seats on the plane. The crew was very rude in telling people they had to get off the plane and get a flight the next day. No call for volunteers, but telling people they had to get off. One woman was flying with her elderly mother and daughter and was told she had to leave or all three had to leave. Fortunately, a volunteer offered to stay. The situation was handled poorly.Delays on all NY flights. There was no communication on why but they didn’t say it was weather. Other carriers were not delayed.Extraordinary service in business class, and very good breakfast and snacks. A really lovely flight.They cancelled our flight without warning OR a refund. Never doing business with American Airlines again! This is the second AA booked trip in a row that we've had challenges with.I got bumped due to weight restrictions even tho there were empty seats on my flight. I got put on an other flight with a stopover. My flight that originally was going to take 5-6 hours ever up being 14+ hours and my luggage arrived to my destination without me because I was made to check in my luggage on my original flight when I was deemed ok to board only to be asked to deplane. Worst flight experience.Everything was great. I liked the text updates so that I never miss a gate change & I have all the latest info.No internet on a flight over three hours in this age is criminal. Staff inattentive and dismissiveWorst flight experience ever flights canceled. JetBlue told us just did not even bother standing in line to come back in one and a half hours then without any information we had to go pick up all of our luggage and spend over $2000 in accommodation just to get home. JetBlue said that the next flight available for us to get home would be three days later. Absolutely absurd hasn’t offered to give us any compensation do not fly JetBlue horrible company. They said it was based on the weather and the weather is great in all locations that we would’ve been flying to total hoax. I think it’s a conspiracy theory.flight was delayed for hours with no explanation. The plane was a very old aircraft.The flight departed more than 1 hour late. Leg room is bigger than most airlinesExcellent. Although they used to greet me as a mosaic member and provide a free drink, early boarding helps me to keep coming back to JetBlue.No music app working: no economy meal on five hour flight; hour on tarmac at the end waiting for a gate. Flight itself was smooth and easy.Communication with the customer and stay is important. Staff off with a minor inconvenience but it worked out of course. Also this was a very old Mint Class plane. They snuck this one in on us. The updated aircraft are much better.The flight itself was fine, but the boarding process was extremely frustrating. There is no one scanning boarding passes - passengers just scan themselves and enter the jetway. By the time my husband and I got on the plane and were halfway to our seats they determined there were too many bags on the plane and everything at that point needed to be checked. This created a lot of unnecessary chaos. They should have alerted people before getting on the plane that they would need to start checking bags instead of waiting until people were already on the plane.In flight on demand didn't work at our seats. Only a single beverage/snack run.Everything was fine. I'm average height and I pack light. I'm ready for my Spirit flight.The seat belt was lengthy enough that I did not need an extender. Courteous and helpful flight attendants.you guys canceled my flight last minute and lost my luggage.Flight was delayed a bit, but that was expected (and updated), so really not bad at all for the price. Could’ve used one less email asking me to upgrade my seat; otherwise no significant complaintsMy experience was okay. The flight did not offer even water without a fee. Also had to pay extra for my carry on, as I was told I had to check my bag, even though it said I had the option to carry on a bag when booking. This costed me an extra $100. Would likely not fly with Spirit again.Seats were comfortable but dont recline at all. Checkin online was easy but didnt provide a gate until last minute. Flight attendants were very unkind, not friendly and didnt go over safety procedures in case of a crash. No free snacks or beverages, not even water.The booking was cancelled the next day. Spirit Airlines refunded Kayak cheapflay the full amount, but I was only refunded half. Costumer service is disgusting. Be careful. You can lose your money.Spirit airlines was extremely uncomfortable. The seats were hard.. the constant up selling (from lack of food or even water to $15 for wi fi ) was annoying. Not a recommended airlinesOur experience was not a good one. Our flight got cancelled and was not given any accommodations due to the inconvenience. We lost time on our vacation due to this inconvenienceThe senior flight attendant was engaging, funny and made everyone feel at ease. She is an asset to your team.The worst. They don’t follow procedure for boarding per group. Flight got delayed for no understandably reasons, they changed our destination from PR to Miami, left us inside a plane for more than 8 hours, then cancelled flight in Miami leaving us stranded. Poorly managed re-accommodation for a new flight and overnight stay so I have to spend in a new ticket and my own hotel room to been able to get to my office next day. Lost 2 days of work and as a doctor, patients loosing their appointments. to other flights and besidesI was 2 hr arrive in the airport and 45 min in the line . After take to my turn . The agent tell me I’m later . I can not board . So my vacation was going to the floor . Just for their bad customer service agent in the airline2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.Since you have to pay for overhead bags then they shouldn't be running out of space and asking individuals who paid to remove stuff from the overheadBook with frontier airlines with the mentality that they'll cancel your flight, kick you off and lose your luggage. Anything besides that is a win. Compare prices with other airlines (to include luggage) and if frontier is still worth it, book it but know all of their policies.You get what you pay for nothing essentially but a hard uncomfortable seat that doesn’t recline and kids screaming all around you and chaotic boarding and limited check bag weight allowance when compared to other airlinesNot very good. Paid in excess of $400 for assigned seating for my family and that was not provided. I want that money back.I chose the seats when booked the flight and paid for them. However after checking in I found we were assigned different seats!It was a no frills flight. Would have liked to be able to charge my deviceSeats were extremely uncomfortable and it was very hot on the plane.Delta7.9American Airlines7.2JetBlue7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from New York to FloridaCabin classComplete your tripFlights to other citiesOriginsPopular routesReturn flight dealsCabin class types available on flights to FloridaCabin classes available on flights to Florida.
