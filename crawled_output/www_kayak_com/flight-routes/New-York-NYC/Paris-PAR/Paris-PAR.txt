Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneI believe that a four-hour trip should have a meal. Delta had none.Was charged for my luggage despite having been on one ticket from an international flight. Too tired to argue after 15 hours on flight. Was charged for rechecking it at JFK airport. Not sure why those off Kenya Airways were required to do that.Flight was canceled, and no effort was made to help with rebooking, no hotel vouchers, no car transportation and minimal food voucher and most places for food were closed by the time the voucher was given. Waited for 3 hours for bags. Simply the worst travel experience I have ever hadAt first, we were on the runway for about an hour, literally. The Captain did explain that the Control Tower just had a change shift (sounds like an unrealistic excuse) and then that we had to change a runway. A regular economy seat is made for 12 yo twiggy. I understand Delta wants to push for an upgrade, but after sitting in a Comfort seat and in First class. I would say First class is not worthy of my money. The landing was delayed because of the weather in NYC, I don't hold that against Delta, of course. The Captain did alert us to that upon takeoff in Vegas and again as we reached NY.Not a "Delta" issue, but a JFK issue: We booked a connecting flight with 3 1/2 hours between to clearn immigration and customs. Our inbound flight (BCN to JFK) was on the taxiway 45 minutes which ate into our layover time. Immigtration was insanely quick with the CBP MPC app; however, clearing TSA (again, after we were ALREADY cleared in Spain on the inbound international flight) took over 95 minutes. This left us with 10 minutes before boarding the connecting flight (JFK to SAN) to walk to the far end of Terminal 4 and try to find food. We didn't find any food that could promise to serve us in under 10 minutes so we boarded the Delta flight after coming off a plance and an 8-hour flight knowing that we wouldn't be served any food on the next 5 1/2 hour flight. I feel like Delta needs to put pressure on the JFK TSA to open more screening stations (by our count, we saw only 5 scanners open and a line of - as we said - over 90 minutes. The insult is that we WERE ALREADY SCREENED through TSA, but as you come off one flight into the USA, you have to go through the whole process again. It seems like if you have a connecting flight, there should be a way to pass through immigration and customs without needing to return through TSA.Overall, aside from the baggage issue, it was as good as one expects.Great flight! Only complaint I had was that I didn’t get breakfast that morning because I don’t eat eggs for breakfast.. I ate an energy bar I bought in the airport which I had never done before. Otherwise, another great Delta flight!My flight was 6 pm 6/6. Every hour they delayed it again - air condition issues then no pilot then the crew had worked too many hours and cancelled the flight at 11 pm. Sent customers to NJ a 45 minutes uber ride to a hotel. Had to be back by 5 am for a 7 am flight and again no pilot etc with another three hours of delays.I bought business class tickets but the seats are exactly like economy with no comfort seats nor an empty seat next to me provided. Very poor, low quality airline.I don't understand the concept of paying to get your personal luggage onboard and then asked to check it in.... either sell the space or don't, its a hassle to carry those all through the airport just to make a check in at the last minute.The food was great and the service and attitude was amazing!!It was a great experience. The only thing I would have changed was that the bathrooms were never cleaned and they got very dirty.It was an OK flight with below mediocre service by their flight attendantsWasted a lot of time trying to find the CDG lounge - it was not next to the connecting flight gate like the Air France staff said.My experience was good overall, the quality of the food really decreased! There used to be a choice between meat and fish now it’s between chicken and pasta! In the choices of entertainment meditation has been added which is very good. Soft chair workout to improve blood circulation and avoid phlebitis should be added.The only reason the overall rating wasn't "excellent" was due to problems in claiming luggage. The bags are delivered to the main area (Cinta 35) for domestic passengers, but to a DIFFERENT ROOM for international arrivees. After waiting 30 minutes, someone (who didn't appear to be from Air France or the airport) told us to go to another area. There we found our bags, which appeared to have been awaiting us for a while. We had to go through a bag check before leaving the airport. If we had been alerted to this possibility, or better yet, been to go directly to Cinta 34, we could have eliminated quite a bit of waiting.Much better than the major US Carriers especially in Biz Class.I wish that the meal included a vegetable or even a salad instead of couscous! Why serve chicken with rice AND couscous? Service was good overall though a bit lacking in friendliness. Usually on air france I've been offered a glass of champagne before dinner, wine with dinner, and a digestif after dinner. We were only offered wine this time!I had no checked baggage but was required to hand over carry on baggage at the door of the plane. There was a lot of overboard space in the plane and I was one of the last ones. I ran to get my carry on but it was gone. I was given back at the plane door in Toronto, so the wait was not as long as it would have been at the carousel.This flight was perfect. No complaints and only the highest regard for the crew and ground staff and how they executed perfectly. I fly a lot with United and would request predictability and transparency in their operations instead of last minute changes.The food should improve! And The flight should leave on time and not make the traveler wait.We love united ! We would like to acknowledge Aimee in the lounge near gate 130Survey sent before we actually left. Delay after delay. Now a crew problem.I love flying with United. Unfortunately, I flew on an older plane with minimal upgraded technology (no Bluetooth functionality or handy charging ports). Otherwise, the flight was great and even arrived early.They changed my seats after I checked in and I was stressed from the time I saw that information until just before boarding, when the gate attendant fixed it, but it shouldn't have happened. And if it couldn't be prevented, then the people on the phone I spoke with should have done something to help, which they did not, nor did they offer me compensation, just meaningless apologies.The flight was operated by Lufthansa. You can't expect much from them anymore. They have a talent in getting something wrong.Terrible. Out flight was delayed for 21 (twenty one) hours. United is a joke.Smooth flight, especially take off and landing, and great crew on board. Really loved the stroopwaffles!The overpriced dinner was pasta, bread and an awfully sweet dessert…. a feast of inexpensive carbs. She was the exception, but one flight attendant was incredibly rude. Cheap ticket though.Terminal experiences, including departure and deplaning were the weak points of our trip. Appreciated that premium passengers boarded and deplaned in group 1, but experience with buses did not feel premium. Terminals used at CDG and JFK had old, limited facilities and no good lounges. In flight experience was good and crew worked hard.It was very uncomfortable. I would never book any flights with Norse anymore .The flight attendants were extremely rude. I hate the culture of Norse air. Their is nothing really economical about it, the flights are slightly less expensive than average but it doesn’t justify no food, no blankets or pillows - my god you have to pay extra just to make your already over crowded no leg room flight just comfortable enough to be enjoyable. As if travel isn’t hard enough already. You have to pay extra to pick a seat so if you really are on a tight budget you’ll be left with the most uncomfortable, saddest flight of your life while the flight attendants treats you like the steerage on the HMS Titanic."I felt uncomfortable. It's well known that Norway is a racist country. As soon as they detected my accent, they were very rude."Norse is one of those airlines that sells the luggage and the good seats if you want them but otherwise the prices are great. It was very comfortable, the crew was great, and the food was actually good. I will take it again.Everything was good during the flight. But it's the only flight that I have experienced where food is not included not even drinks or even water unless you pay for it. For such a long trip to not offer even a glass of water I think it's very extreme!There should be an app so I can check in before I get to the airport and get a mobile ticket. There should also be wifi on the plane.When you book economy it says you can have a carry on bag, but when you check in all of a sudden the economy becomes 4 different types and you get charged extra, that’s not fare. Also there’s no option to check in online. Wouldn’t recommendNo online check in, so you and three hundred others are queuing at JFK at 5 check in counters. The employees are well organized and keep it moving, doing the best they can with an inefficient system. No blankets or pillows on the seven hour overnight flight and they kept the lights on for 2 hours for a flight that took off at 1am. Seemingly didn’t even have beverage service, and of course you have to pay for food (expected). The worst $1200 I’ve spent.The French bee web site kept telling me my luggage was free when trying to attempt to buy it 48 hours in advance. When i check in the price is now double and the site said because I didn’t pay for the luggage. Very disappointing when explaining that to their customer service and showing screen shots where there site said it was free therefore not allowing me to pre purchase. Seems scammy and I was surprised after showing them the screen shots they did not reimburse me for the double charge. I would have gladly paid $70 but 140 was insane seeing how I did everything I was supposed to and their site was at fault.Excellent-boarding was quick and efficient, plenty of room in board. Friendly crewBest price around. The food has gotten worse,,,might actually be better to board with one's own food... On time, professional staff at airport and on board.I received an email and text message from French Bee less than 24 hours prior to my flight that there was a flight change. That flight change indicated that my flight had already left yet the message went out just under an hour before the new departure time. When calling French Bee staff (located in Texas so open at central time) they only said “sorry for the inconvenience “ and never offered or supplied information about a rebooking or what took place even when asked. They had a very blasé attitude about the entire situation. I had to buy a ticket on another airline because I was not told what was going on! A ticket to fly internationally on the same day!!!$$$$$$ so disappointingThe seating on my French Bee flight was exceedingly uncomfortable, resulting in significant discomfort. I experienced considerable pain in both my back and feet throughout the journey. food I would rate it below 0. Crew are professional. And most importantly we arrived safe.Check in was in time. No free food. Not even water. Was asked to pay for water. Disgusting!I know this is a stripped down airline but I didn’t expect it to be so difficult to avoid the “up charges.” I was naive when planning and checking in for my flight to Paris from Newark and they got me on the outrageous $90 in cabin carry on bag charge at the gate. But on my return flight I did everything possible to pay in advance (you have a short window to do this 48 hours before the flight departure) for that same in cabin bag so the charge would be $45 instead. It was not to be. In spite of a confirmation email that they had “added a service “ and the $45 carry on bag was accounted for, my boarding pass did not reflect that and I was charged the full amount at the gate. It adds insult to injury that the French Bee staff is gleeful when they are successfully working this nefarious up charging scam. They couldn’t care less about their customers. Very disappointed with this airline and will not be flying French Bee anytime in the future. Do NOT recommend.Economy seats are too tight for a long haul flight. The meal was surprisingly good, though it was surprising to learn that even coffee and tea were extra pay. They also don’t distribute water regularly.Overall impression - very bad. There is not even free water on the plane and the seats are so uncomfortable that after 7.5 hours of flight my back was just falling apart. Never pay extra for "Private" seats. It's just that part of the regular cabin is separated by curtains. This does not give any effect. Money for nothing.Expensive long flight from SFO to PPT. Even at basic fare its very expensive given what you get and you get absolutely nothing... they even charge for the water...and if you are not french the crew will treat you like a intruder...very bad experience during my worlwide travel experience...Delta7.9Air France7.4United Airlines7.4Norse Atlantic Airways7.0French Bee6.0Everything you need to know for your flight from New York to ParisAirlinesCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from New York to ParisFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from New York to Paris according to KAYAK users.
