Comfortable seats. Served great Indian food and Masala Chai!Except for the uncleaned tray, and the delay in serving food for our section (which may have been due to the location of our row) everything else was good. The crew were very professional and responded to our requests promptly throughout the flight. We as a family were not disappointed by Emirates.It was great, a little more leg room would have been better particularly since we were in premium economyThe boarding process was smooth and the stewardesses were nice. Some delays with drinks at the end of the flight, but no issues.Thay crew was so nice.Air hostess il ham was so nice.my mom was little scray with airplan turbulence she help us alot.Seat 💺 was all the way on last row.

The food was great except for the fact that there were too many sweet items.Boarding, seats, entertainment and service were all great. Food was great except for the fact that there were too many sweet items.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneI believe that a four-hour trip should have a meal. Delta had none.Was charged for my luggage despite having been on one ticket from an international flight. Too tired to argue after 15 hours on flight. Was charged for rechecking it at JFK airport. Not sure why those off Kenya Airways were required to do that.Flight was canceled, and no effort was made to help with rebooking, no hotel vouchers, no car transportation and minimal food voucher and most places for food were closed by the time the voucher was given. Waited for 3 hours for bags. Simply the worst travel experience I have ever hadAt first, we were on the runway for about an hour, literally. The Captain did explain that the Control Tower just had a change shift (sounds like an unrealistic excuse) and then that we had to change a runway. A regular economy seat is made for 12 yo twiggy. I understand Delta wants to push for an upgrade, but after sitting in a Comfort seat and in First class. I would say First class is not worthy of my money. The landing was delayed because of the weather in NYC, I don't hold that against Delta, of course. The Captain did alert us to that upon takeoff in Vegas and again as we reached NY.Not a "Delta" issue, but a JFK issue: We booked a connecting flight with 3 1/2 hours between to clearn immigration and customs. Our inbound flight (BCN to JFK) was on the taxiway 45 minutes which ate into our layover time. Immigtration was insanely quick with the CBP MPC app; however, clearing TSA (again, after we were ALREADY cleared in Spain on the inbound international flight) took over 95 minutes. This left us with 10 minutes before boarding the connecting flight (JFK to SAN) to walk to the far end of Terminal 4 and try to find food. We didn't find any food that could promise to serve us in under 10 minutes so we boarded the Delta flight after coming off a plance and an 8-hour flight knowing that we wouldn't be served any food on the next 5 1/2 hour flight. I feel like Delta needs to put pressure on the JFK TSA to open more screening stations (by our count, we saw only 5 scanners open and a line of - as we said - over 90 minutes. The insult is that we WERE ALREADY SCREENED through TSA, but as you come off one flight into the USA, you have to go through the whole process again. It seems like if you have a connecting flight, there should be a way to pass through immigration and customs without needing to return through TSA.Overall, aside from the baggage issue, it was as good as one expects.My flight was 6 pm 6/6. Every hour they delayed it again - air condition issues then no pilot then the crew had worked too many hours and cancelled the flight at 11 pm. Sent customers to NJ a 45 minutes uber ride to a hotel. Had to be back by 5 am for a 7 am flight and again no pilot etc with another three hours of delays.The entertainment and wifi mostly didn't work on this flight.Terrible entertainment system - kept freezing and audio kept cutting out. Snacks were mediocre at best for a 5 hour flight.It was worst flight ever of 26h. Poor service and seating. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Islamabad service and seating was worst ever. No tv extra.Surprised at the lower quality of seats on the Boeing 777 in Business Class. Seats are tight and the whole Business class section is jam packed with seats. It doesn’t feel like Business Class at all. Also the way the tray tables are placed with a huge bulky solid metal hinge at knee level makes it so uncomfortable and always anxious that one will accidentally bang their knee on it. Quality of amenities has also declined. Over priced tickets with diminished quality of the entire experience.It was OK as the seat which we paid for doesn’t have any window. We paid $120 for 3 seats but it’s for nothing. Crew could not help. None of the ports worked so all our phones went dryI had a terrible experience checking in at the airport for my flight. I booked my ticket initially through Kayak while it was promoted as a ticket that offers a carry on and 2 suit cases. (I have a screen shot as a proof of it) I selected it to buy three tickets and paid online. Couple of minutes later airfare assist which is the OTA offering the ticket called me saying My card declined. So I used a different card that went through. I was surprised that they increased the price ticket by a $167. They said the ticket no longer exists and because my card declined I had to buy a new one. So I did. The day my family and I were traveling I could not check in and when I went to the airport I was shocked to be told my ticket had no bags allowed and must pay $200 per bag for three people 6 bags mean I have to pay $1200. I called the travel agency as I feel I was scammed the confirmation didn’t say anything about the bags and they never told me the new ticket doesn’t not include any bag so they changed it after I selected it on your app without informing me. Very sneaky. The travel agency said they will reimburse me only for one bag person. Which means I still paid $600 I still feel very disappointed to pay such an expense. I have always used Kayak to buy my flight tickets and telling everyone how good your rates and app are however after this I feel I was mislead and paid more for something I should not have to. You allowing such an agency on your platform will surely hurt your reputation and level of integrity. I have all the proofs from the screen shot to the confirmation email from them, the or email offering to reimburse o e bag per person and the $1200 bag fees receipts that I paid on the desk. I must be refund the full amount and I look forward to your response.The food could be better. Toilets were smelly all alongCrew Check-In – Kolkata (CCU) The crew handling check-in in Kolkata was outstanding—efficient, courteous, and highly organized. Flight Segment – CCU to Abu Dhabi (AUH) A standard flight overall. Notably, only one in-flight meal option—a vegetarian curry—was available, which seemed unsuitable for a red-eye journey. The crew offered no alternatives, which was unexpected. Flight Segment – Abu Dhabi to Rome (AUH-FCO) Comfort improved on this leg, but service quality was average, falling short of Etihad’s premium standards. Crew attention was heavily absorbed by a difficult couple in Row 15 (port side), resulting in disproportionate focus. It was concerning that a steward had to personally return to apologize, a task better suited for supervisory staff. This highlights a development opportunity for supervisors Anna and Quashim in managing guest escalation professionally.The staff were wonderful but the seats weren't very comfortable for a bigger guy like me.This flight was a dreamliner so I think the space was ok for the legs, but the option for food was again limited and the crew was same.Boarding was efficient, had to check in cabin luggage. Seats were narrow, food was more in quantity, received cabin luggage on the luggage belt which was fine.Bad. Flight was very uncomfortable with narrow and shallow seats, very little food and water. I will not fly etihad again.Everything was good and no points to complain. Food is always a tricky concept. Sometimes you like it and sometimes you don’t. Food was redundant from Kuwait City to NY-JFK.Beautiful Flight took off on time and everything was goodNext time im going to use Kuwait air lines, hopefullyComfortable seats. Be aware there is no alcohol on this airline.Seats were comfortable. Be aware there is no alcohol on this airline.Every thing was very food except the meal. It was a sandwich of something like a beef kebab. It was really bad in terms of hardness as well as taste. We were a family of 7 persons non of us could eat it his sandwich. Cake was good.It was very nice flight only suggestions to upload recent videos and English subtitles. ThanksWheelchair service is not available right away on Kuwait AirwaysEverybody was so nice to treat me good all the workers When I came to Bangladesh there was just a little problem with the luggage but I got my luggage it took like two hours Other than that everything is goodFood quality should be upgrade. Plastic spoons looks like not good as well as food quality not up to the mark.Overall it was good. But air planes should be upgraded.only passenger seats are too much narrow. It’s not comfortable otherwise it’s good. Seats are very important because it’s main in TravelMiss my flight from delhi to amritsar due to lock the luggage door of airplane.and there was no more flight even for next days and they not refund the fare.
