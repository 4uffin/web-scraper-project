Comfortable seats. Served great Indian food and Masala Chai!Except for the uncleaned tray, and the delay in serving food for our section (which may have been due to the location of our row) everything else was good. The crew were very professional and responded to our requests promptly throughout the flight. We as a family were not disappointed by Emirates.It was great, a little more leg room would have been better particularly since we were in premium economyThe boarding process was smooth and the stewardesses were nice. Some delays with drinks at the end of the flight, but no issues.Thay crew was so nice.Air hostess il ham was so nice.my mom was little scray with airplan turbulence she help us alot.Seat 💺 was all the way on last row. Food was okay .Charged for internet that never really worked. The food selection was just ok.Boarding, seats, entertainment and service were all great. The food was great except for the fact that there were too many sweet items.Boarding, seats, entertainment and service were all great. Food was great except for the fact that there were too many sweet items.It was worst flight ever of 26h. Poor service and seating. Flight from Abu Dhabi to Islamabad service and seating was worst ever. No tv extra.It was OK as the seat which we paid for doesn’t have any window. We paid $120 for 3 seats but it’s for nothing. Crew could not help. None of the ports worked so all our phones went dryI had a terrible experience checking in at the airport for my flight. I booked my ticket initially through Kayak while it was promoted as a ticket that offers a carry on and 2 suit cases. (I have a screen shot as a proof of it) I selected it to buy three tickets and paid online. Couple of minutes later airfare assist which is the OTA offering the ticket called me saying My card declined. So I used a different card that went through. I was surprised that they increased the price ticket by a $167. They said the ticket no longer exists and because my card declined I had to buy a new one. So I did. The day my family and I were traveling I could not check in and when I went to the airport I was shocked to be told my ticket had no bags allowed and must pay $200 per bag for three people 6 bags mean I have to pay $1200. I called the travel agency as I feel I was scammed the confirmation didn’t say anything about the bags and they never told me the new ticket doesn’t not include any bag so they changed it after I selected it on your app without informing me. Very sneaky. The travel agency said they will reimburse me only for one bag person. Which means I still paid $600 I still feel very disappointed to pay such an expense. I have always used Kayak to buy my flight tickets and telling everyone how good your rates and app are however after this I feel I was mislead and paid more for something I should not have to. You allowing such an agency on your platform will surely hurt your reputation and level of integrity. I have all the proofs from the screen shot to the confirmation email from them, the or email offering to reimburse o e bag per person and the $1200 bag fees receipts that I paid on the desk. I must be refund the full amount and I look forward to your response.The food could be better. Toilets were smelly all alongThis flight was a dreamliner so I think the space was ok for the legs, but the option for food was again limited and the crew was same.Boarding was efficient, had to check in cabin luggage. Seats were narrow, food was more in quantity, received cabin luggage on the luggage belt which was fine.Bad. Flight was very uncomfortable with narrow and shallow seats, very little food and water. I will not fly etihad again.Needs better seat for business class. My seat was falling apart. Also no WiFi on that flightBoarding catastrophic let alone have to claimb the plain rather than using jetway. 5.5 hr delay leaving had to do stop in Lgw for a new crew which further compounded the delay. Connecting flight would not wait and had to pend a night in a hotel. Curiously my seat would not go full flat.Good. The food was very bad. Except for the chicken rice, rest of the dish went to trash.Everything was good and no points to complain. Food is always a tricky concept. Sometimes you like it and sometimes you don’t. Food was redundant from Kuwait City to NY-JFK.Beautiful Flight took off on time and everything was goodNext time im going to use Kuwait air lines, hopefullyComfortable seats. Be aware there is no alcohol on this airline.Seats were comfortable. Be aware there is no alcohol on this airline.Every thing was very food except the meal. It was a sandwich of something like a beef kebab. It was really bad in terms of hardness as well as taste. We were a family of 7 persons non of us could eat it his sandwich. Cake was good.It was very nice flight only suggestions to upload recent videos and English subtitles. ThanksWheelchair service is not available right away on Kuwait AirwaysEverybody was so nice to treat me good all the workers When I came to Bangladesh there was just a little problem with the luggage but I got my luggage it took like two hours Other than that everything is goodFood quality should be upgrade. Plastic spoons looks like not good as well as food quality not up to the mark.IndiGo is low cost and therefore no frills, but is always a pleasant experience. No mood lighting and fancy features but clean aircraft, professional crew and absolute value for money.Very hard seats. No food service, even though price is not competitive.Very hard seats for long flights. No food even on International flight. Won't fly Indigo again if I can help it.Terrible experience at IST airport due to mismanagement by ground and wheelchair staff.Some seats don’t recline. No USB port or power outlet, no inflight WIFI - not even for SMS/Messaging apps. Ontime performance was very good. They should have at least one crew member who speaks the local language, for flights like these.Although we took the XL seats with more width, we found that you do not have a seat in front to stow your personal item, nor can you stretch your legs. This is not the best option for a comfortable seat. Boarding was timely but disorganized without any row based entry.Not professional and didn’t know about double seat even when I paid for it and have a confirmation. Lack of comms between teams.deboarding is very poor after landing it took around 45 minutes to come out.My baggage bag got broken and only 3000 voucher was given for compensationCrew members forgot to serve sandwiches after serving the coffee. Worst was the handling of bag. One of wheel was Broken making it useless. Though a complaint was registered and assured of compensation voucher equal to part cost of the new bag.Why should I rate entertainment if I’ve not used? You don’t have NA - Not Applicable option.Never can get flight and nof light for three days .finally travel by bus. Very bad experience.I had a camera bag that exceeded the 10kg allowance for hand luggage. I am 67 years old and have been travelling will my cameras and lenses all over the world and have not paid once for the excess weight. Also, even if I wanted to check in the bag, I can’t due to lithium batteries and delicate equipment. Air India should review their policies. Or is it just a cash grab. I had to pay additional 7000 rupees.The boarding was not in sequence. All were invited altogether. I was not secured the meal I had asked for.Food not of any international or even Indian standard. We have many cuisine available but only paneer & sundry items. Improve & provide some good indian items. Entertainment website or channel out of order.First and the foremost I was shocked to see airindia standards have come down so low . The food was horrible . They served us 3 meals for vegetarian and all the was paneer . The orange juice was not at all cold it was smelly . After you take this heavy price air India should learn from other air lines . I at one point felt like throwing up . After all this when we landed we were not given landing slip . We had to wait for 45 min at the immigration just because no one was given landing slip . To top it all we were 3 passengers and had checked in 4 check in luggage . Out of which 3 have not yet arrived . Basically status says the loaded it in our flight ( this was a direct fight ) and it never reached . We are still waiting . There is nothing great to tell about our flight . The he only good thing was the crew were very helpful .Lay out shows 1st row and second row given after taking payment. It's a fraudThe seats were extremely uncomfortable. Air India seats used to be very comfortable . with sufficient legroom. In this aircraft there was no legroom. It is a shame that for your profit margins you are trying to pack people like cattle on these long haul flights. The food was terrible. The bread was hard like a rock. Mr CEO of Air India, why don’t you take a flight in economy from India to USA and experience the hardships first hand. It is utter disgraceAbsolutely nothing. Cold and unpleasant airline staff, and to top it all, the entertainment system was broken. Really harrowing experience.BAD experience. Entertainment system was not working and most of the passengers had this issue. Staff was not helpful. Meal was yuck.
