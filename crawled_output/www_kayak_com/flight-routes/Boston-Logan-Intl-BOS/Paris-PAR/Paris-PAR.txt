Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.4.0 Okaystephen, Sep 2025DJN - SATRead more Delta reviewsLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The airport was reasonably clean. The boarding process reasonably efficient. The cabin crew was efficient, polite but not that friendly. The food quality was unremarkable and the choices were awful . There was either a so so chicken dish or a “ vegetarian “ option which was really cheap carbohydrates drowned in cheese. Signing onto i flight wifi was not straightforward. Overall it was a very average experienceThe staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.I don't understand the concept of paying to get your personal luggage onboard and then asked to check it in.... either sell the space or don't, its a hassle to carry those all through the airport just to make a check in at the last minute.The food was great and the service and attitude was amazing!!It was a great experience. The only thing I would have changed was that the bathrooms were never cleaned and they got very dirty.Old airplanes small seats expensive tickets, not as expected overall and not comfortable according to the priceIt was an OK flight with below mediocre service by their flight attendantsWasted a lot of time trying to find the CDG lounge - it was not next to the connecting flight gate like the Air France staff said.My experience was good overall, the quality of the food really decreased! There used to be a choice between meat and fish now it’s between chicken and pasta! In the choices of entertainment meditation has been added which is very good. Soft chair workout to improve blood circulation and avoid phlebitis should be added.The only reason the overall rating wasn't "excellent" was due to problems in claiming luggage. The bags are delivered to the main area (Cinta 35) for domestic passengers, but to a DIFFERENT ROOM for international arrivees. After waiting 30 minutes, someone (who didn't appear to be from Air France or the airport) told us to go to another area. There we found our bags, which appeared to have been awaiting us for a while. We had to go through a bag check before leaving the airport. If we had been alerted to this possibility, or better yet, been to go directly to Cinta 34, we could have eliminated quite a bit of waiting.Much better than the major US Carriers especially in Biz Class.I wish that the meal included a vegetable or even a salad instead of couscous! Why serve chicken with rice AND couscous? Service was good overall though a bit lacking in friendliness. Usually on air france I've been offered a glass of champagne before dinner, wine with dinner, and a digestif after dinner. We were only offered wine this time!Everything was great. I liked the text updates so that I never miss a gate change & I have all the latest info.I don’t usually fly budget airlines or airlines in the United States. It was as good as any other airline. The seats are comfortable and the airline attendants are not rude & surly. Very nice flight (s).No internet on a flight over three hours in this age is criminal. Staff inattentive and dismissiveThey have the most inexperienced / rude flight staff I’ve encounteredvery difficult boarding process - aggressive passengers not the friendliest crewWiFi was not eorkig (again) And the plane was from 1990 with the screens which were.not touch and most didn’t even work and if lucky could tune in tvI paid extra for a seat closer to the front. The TV didn’t work at all for the entire flight. Would have been nice to know before I purchased an “upgraded “ seatIt was great. I had never flown on JetBlue before, but would be very happy to fly with them in the future.Worst flight experience ever flights canceled. JetBlue told us just did not even bother standing in line to come back in one and a half hours then without any information we had to go pick up all of our luggage and spend over $2000 in accommodation just to get home. JetBlue said that the next flight available for us to get home would be three days later. Absolutely absurd hasn’t offered to give us any compensation do not fly JetBlue horrible company. They said it was based on the weather and the weather is great in all locations that we would’ve been flying to total hoax. I think it’s a conspiracy theory.The captain gave good announcements and the flight attendants were friendly. The WiFi was pretty good. The plane itself looked very old inside and the seats were very uncomfortable. The screens in the seat backs were the smallest I’ve ever seen. There were so many loud and obnoxious kids on this flight and the parents didn’t do much to try to quiet them down. Some had videos and games on tablets with higher than necessary volume going the whole time.Handling our luggage was the biggest issue - they lost it and we got it almost 3 days later. Really threw off the beginning of our trip and we really had to change our itinerary accordingly.Seat was hard and uncomfortable and the temperature too warm and uncomfortable.I flew Icelandair with my partner from Prague to the US. Overall flight time was around 12 hours, with a connecting flight in Iceland. I have flown internationally for years and with multiple airlines. Every airline serves you a meal when traveling internationally. Icelandair not only did not offer an inclusive meal, but they did not even offer a snack. The only things they served over our long flight was water and coffee. Ridiculous! Never again will I fly with Icelandair.It was good. The air plane is clean and staff were friendly.Worst airline I’ve ever flown. Delayed 5.5 hrs, missed connecting flight, and missed an entire day of vacation. Zero customer serviceEverything sucked. No food, one small glass of water, a tiny coffee, 5.5 hour delay with no customer service. Would never recommend flying them.The crew was wonderful at check in, the gate and on board. Felt the luggage had more room than the passengers. The seats were smaller than most domestic U.S. airlines. I'm only 5'2" and I had little legroom. There were only 2 bathrooms in coach. Needed more. The flight was very smooth but not the most comfortable.There was no lounge at Boston for us to use. Typically flying first class overseas comes with lounge privileges. The seats did not recline even a little. My headset only worked on one side. I felt like I was flying on Ryan Air, not Icelandic Air.Boarded with no problems. Sat on the tarmac for an hour before taking off. We were the last ones on our connecting flight. Didn't think we were going to make it. Our flight to Iceland was similarly delayed. When we've flown other airlines, pilots have tried to make up time while in the air. This doesn't seem to be something that Icelandair does. We made all of our flights, but it was stressful and we didn't think it was going to happen based on the time we arrived.The flight was delayed and as a consequence we missed our connecting flight. Were stuck for another 6h in Reykyavik. Appreciated that we got a generous food voucher at least. Would have liked to see more information upon arrival including a person waiting for connecting flight travellers and informing already that we will not catch the flight and directing us to the office dealing with the matter; unfortunately that didnt happen and we hence first needed to find out whether flight had indeed left already and then locate the adequate office to help us with booking us on the next connecting flight. Also my suitcase broke and it is not clear whether it is happened on the leg with Iceland Air from DC to Reykyavik or on the leg with Lufthansa from Reykyavik to Frankfurt. Finally, understood that it is a low cost company but at least provision of earplugs for free would have been nice, instead of making them buy.Excellent experience in every way, from ground crew helpfulness, boarding experience, inflight service all the way to modern equipment. My new favorite airline. I wish I could fly with them more often.For a no frills flight this was surprising comfortable. The crew were helpful and nice. The flight was smooth and there were no delays or issues which I haven't had on a flight in a long time. I would definitely fly with them again.The flight was canceled by play less than 24 hours prior to the trip, and I was unable to re-book. Have not received a refund for the trip despite filling out the appropriate form.Was was cancelled less than 24 hours prior to my scheduled departure by PLAY. Despite my attempts to rebook my travel, I encountered significant cost increases that rendered this option unfeasible. In accordance with EC Regulation 261/2004, airlines are required to issue a full refund for cancelled flights within seven days of the scheduled departure if a refund is requested instead of rebooking on another flight.

No tv monitors tho. So long flights make it longerThe worst. No free beverages. No entertainment on an overseas flight. Not enough space. Never again.Play is affordable! Only way we fly from the states to Europe.
