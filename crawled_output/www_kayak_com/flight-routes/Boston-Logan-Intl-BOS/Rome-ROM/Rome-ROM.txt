Luckily it wasn’t a long flight6.0 GoodAnonymous, Sep 2025ATL - MDWRead more Delta reviewsCramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The airport was reasonably clean. The boarding process reasonably efficient. The cabin crew was efficient, polite but not that friendly. The food quality was unremarkable and the choices were awful . There was either a so so chicken dish or a “ vegetarian “ option which was really cheap carbohydrates drowned in cheese. Signing onto i flight wifi was not straightforward. Overall it was a very average experienceThe staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.The immigration hall in Amsterdam was understaffed, so passport checking was slower than it should be for a major airport. They need to get the automatic readers up and running for non EU passport holders. Waiting in line after a long flight feels a bit abusive.Over 1 Hr delay. No APU so no AC on ground. Plane was hot during boarding and then they closed the doors over 20 minutes before engine start so interior of plane was steamy hot and stuffy. Could have been helped by opening doors until ready to depart.First of all we couldn’t check in online, then we learn at the airport we were on stand by for KLM’s mistake of overbooking. The seats were not comfy at all. Our luggage got lost.Ad experience - been flying many years with them but they are losing out to other carriers with their service and bagage / seating policy. My 2 12-yo kids were not placed with the parent. Absurdity.Short flight so it was okay. Nice crew, all very pleasant and professional. We were near the back in row 27 so just as we got our drinks, we started our descent so had to drink very quickly!KLM remains a quality flag carrier airline which maintains its standards whilst all their competitors are lowering theirs.The baggage drop-off in Stuttgart is bad: after online check-in you cannot use the automated baggage drop off as indicated on the website. You can use the terminals but have to cue to 1 of three open and slowly working counters to drop the bags. took about 45 minutes wait time.Our first flight was delayed so we missed our connecting flight. However it was easy to book a later flight on their app.My flight was delayed by 6 hours then I missed BOTH of my connecting flights, I then had to stay in the AIRPORT at JFK because soooooo many people also suffered from missing flights and there was no hotels available. I would like to be compensated for this experience! I had to stay in the airport for over 16 hours!I appreciate that KLM was proactive in informing me of the 2 hour delay which enabled me to replan my travel. It was a bit stressful not knowing whether my connection from Montreal to Ottawa was happening. But the ground and air crew did a good job at comforting and assuring me.I bought business class tickets but the seats are exactly like economy with no comfort seats nor an empty seat next to me provided. Very poor, low quality airline.I don't understand the concept of paying to get your personal luggage onboard and then asked to check it in.... either sell the space or don't, its a hassle to carry those all through the airport just to make a check in at the last minute.The food was great and the service and attitude was amazing!!It was a great experience. The only thing I would have changed was that the bathrooms were never cleaned and they got very dirty.Old airplanes small seats expensive tickets, not as expected overall and not comfortable according to the priceIt was an OK flight with below mediocre service by their flight attendantsWasted a lot of time trying to find the CDG lounge - it was not next to the connecting flight gate like the Air France staff said.My experience was good overall, the quality of the food really decreased! There used to be a choice between meat and fish now it’s between chicken and pasta! In the choices of entertainment meditation has been added which is very good. Soft chair workout to improve blood circulation and avoid phlebitis should be added.The only reason the overall rating wasn't "excellent" was due to problems in claiming luggage. The bags are delivered to the main area (Cinta 35) for domestic passengers, but to a DIFFERENT ROOM for international arrivees. After waiting 30 minutes, someone (who didn't appear to be from Air France or the airport) told us to go to another area. There we found our bags, which appeared to have been awaiting us for a while. We had to go through a bag check before leaving the airport. If we had been alerted to this possibility, or better yet, been to go directly to Cinta 34, we could have eliminated quite a bit of waiting.Much better than the major US Carriers especially in Biz Class.The worst Terrible Late for connecting flights. Made flight without luggage! I am still waiting for my luggage to be returned! I paid premium for this flight. My luggage should have been flown to Hartford instead they keep telling me it was put on a jet blue flight and is in New York! I flew Hartford to avoid New Yofk! The flight over was also unpleasant. We were stuck in a bus at Edinburgh airport for 30 minutes then our luggage again could not be found! Very poor service. Very disappointed . I need my luggage to be returned. Shirley Baliki 42 Blaine Sreet Fairfield CTWonderful experience from start to finish. Extremely nice flight staff and much better food than other airlines I have used. Arrived right on time.Very good except for the boarding process which was more hectic than it should have beenToo hot. Asked for an extra glass of water and was ignored. Asked to sit in empty seats that were open because it was so hot and crowded and was denied and the seats were empty the entire flightTerrible leg room - I’m 5’3” and my knees were touching the seat in front of me. When the person sitting in front of me leaned back, there was about 15 inches of space between my head and the TV screen which made it awkward to view movies. Last year they had decent food, but this year the only tasty item on the trip was dessert.The flight was delayed leaving Philadelphia due to “catering” and consequently arrived in Dublin some 75 minutes later than scheduled. Consequently this caused me to miss my connecting flight to Glasgow and I had to spend the night in Dublin.The flight from Cincinnati to Philadelphia was satisfactory and uneventful.It was truly a horrible flight. We were delayed almost 2 hours. The seats were so tiny, my legs were hurting the entire flight. When i finally made it to Ireland i missed my connecting flight because we left Newark late. I will most likely never fly Aer Lingus againTerrible. The test of an airline is how they deal with problems. There is very little to differentiate between airlines. Aer Lingus failed absolutely. They lost one of my bags even though we had more than a 2 hour connection in Dublin. Trying to get it back has been awful. In checking on line I can see that the bag is in Edinburgh and it was supposed to be delivered today. It wasn't. The number we have in the UK doesn't answer. I had to pay for an international call to speak to somebody. All the woman at the call centre could say was be patient wait. I can tell you when it will be delivered nor can I tell you who the courier is.Not JetBlue's fault but Aer Lingus never explained how to transfer to JetBlue.Staff were nice, we left on time and arrived early, food was good. Unfortunately, they lost one of our bags and have been unable to find it. So we are in Italy for a week for my husband‘s birthday and he does not have any of his clothing.They gave us sandwiches as a meal twice. Snacks mid flight with cookies and a tuna panini. Then just the same tuna panini for dinner. That was it.Top notch re cleanliness, comfort, operational. Attendants attentive, cheerful, courteous and professional. An unusually high-grade experience all around.The staff was very good, the only thing was the air conditioning wasn't working during the boarding process so it was very hot inside the plane until we got airborne. The food wasn't great, the chicken was dry and hard to cut, the ravioli was ok and the little pizza pocket thing was pretty bad. Other than that is was a good flight all aroundBetter consideration for families traveling with a disabled person. They insisted each person hold their own boarding pass on their own devices and gave us a hard time accepting eight boarding passes on a single device.Two of my four flights had issues with toilets either NOT fully operational or completely out of order. Boarding was a joke because they have NOT established who is running the show. In the end, she did a terrible job. The seats 💺 were loose goose and the drinks and snacks were limiting in choices. Also, following Alitalia as an inspiration was strange since they went out of business.We had a 3 hour delay and then a long taxi to take off. It would have been helpful for the pilot to have communicated more about what was going on. There was no A/C during the wait, and the cabin must have been more than 85 to 90 degrees. The crew gave water to the people in the front but by the time they go to the back of the plane they stopped giving out water. Eventually I went back and asked for some in the rear of the plane (for a second time). The food was close to inedible. I thought on an Italian flight that the pasta would be better than the chick, but honestly, a Swanson's TV dinner would have been better. I had a bite or two to keep my blood sugar up, but basically I couldn't eat it.Boarding was chaotic. Service was poor. Attendant was slow and rude. In business class, I was not offered a drink until 1.5 hrs,after takeoff. Food was inedible.Terrible. They canceled 2 flights and then sent everyone by BUS from Rome. They should make amends by offering some sort of compensation.We ordered a gluten free meal and never got it!Delta7.9KLM7.8Air France7.4Aer Lingus7.2ITA Airways6.7Everything you need to know for your flight from Boston to RomeAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsOther airlines flying from Boston to RomeFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Boston to Rome according to KAYAK users.
