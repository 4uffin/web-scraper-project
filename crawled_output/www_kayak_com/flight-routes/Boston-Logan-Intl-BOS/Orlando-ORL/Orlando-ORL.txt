The economy fare we purchased did say there was no guarantee the three people in our party would be seated together, and we were not. At the gate, the agent told us more specifically, the fare we purchased meant we would be seated in middle seats only. This should just be made more obvious.10.0 ExcellentPeter, Jul 2025BOS - ATHRead more Delta reviewsOnly issue was with seating.

At the gate, the agent told us more specifically, the fare we purchased meant we would be seated in middle seats only. This should just be made more obvious.Always good but we must do something about people in rows ahead of you that don't put their seats back up when they are suppose to. And It's rough to not be able to even lean over to get something out of my purse.this crew didn't care much. bumping carts into seats more times than i care to rememberEverything was fine except the entertainment was not working for half of the flight.Easy boarding with an extremely kind attendant. Seats were spacious and we had 3 seats for 2 people so we could stretch out. Comfortable air flow and very attentive and hospital attendants. Bathrooms and food were the only negative. Bathrooms were so small you could hardly get in and close the door. I don’t think an obese person would fit or a person with a movement disability. Food was the trending food for flights, nonexistent. We spent $40 getting sandwich and snack at airport for our 6 hour flught.I want to single out flight attendant Mitch who was in the Premium Economy section. When my wife’s hearing aide dropped through the cushion under the seat he was able to locate it and return it to her. Food was a different matter. Dinner was fine. Breakfast was another matter. They had a yogurt dish that the ran out of and the alternative was not very good according to those we talked to.5 hours of delay that could've been much shorter if Delta had taken the 1 hour delay they imposed on the flight before boarding to run any of the plane checks required for flight to find the hydraulic issue that required nearly 3 hours to fix. $24 of meal credit buys a sandwich and a soft drink. Poor communication within the terminal about what gate we'd be re-boarding from and when we'd be re-boarding.Great flight! Only complaint I had was that I didn’t get breakfast that morning because I don’t eat eggs for breakfast.. I ate an energy bar I bought in the airport which I had never done before. Otherwise, another great Delta flight!I am very bothered by the events today. I can't believe the flight attendants allowed someone to take my seat and made me move. It was embarrassing. I was in the right. The lady just didn't want move. I can't believe delta would allow this to stand and disrespect my rights as a passenger. The lady complained about her leg and that she couldn't move. Firstly somehow she was able to make it to row 24. Not sure how much her leg could have hurt. Secondly, I'm in plenty of pain myself. I just finished chemotherapy a several weeks ago. My body is constantly sore. Yet deltas flight attendants didn't appropriately protect my rights. In the end they found me a seat on the plane but I want to understand how delta can operate this way. They in essence allowed a bully to get their way.Crew was friendly Love the entertainment in the seat head rest.Flight was delayed not sure why no explanation given and no apologies either. Otherwise the flight was fineWhile waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.Flight was cancelled 3 hrs AFTER etd. Thetefore Missed connection from JFK to New Zealand . No accommodation provided… This cost ne aporox 1000 USD in extra expenses and turned whst should have been a 24 hr trip ftom Boston - New Zealand into a VERY expensive , late 70+ hr nightmare … Complete nonsense!!!Flight delays numerous times. Everytime we would get close to boarding it would be delayed again. Strung along the entire time.This flight never occurred because AA couldn’t get their act together.Whenever a passenger purchase a ticket his advantage number should automatically to his information. It's not everyone remember the number. You request for your number and American airline agent say they will email it....and they never email anything and you loose your mileage just because you don't remember your number. It should automatically go your information and associate with your email account at all timesDuring service there was a garbage/beverage spill near our seats that never was cleaned up. On a relatively short flight when we’re fortunate enough to actually have in flight movies available, the flight attendants pitching the AADVANTAGE credit card shouldn’t talk for the last 10 minutes of the flight so that we miss the end of the movie.I miss the screens they used to have for the long flights. I use a Kendal and it doesn’t work well with there WiFi. I tried my cell and the wifi was not good for it either this is the free wifi.Waited on the runway for takeoff for 2.5 hours. Air traffic rerouted us. The plane didn't have enough fuel, so had to go back to the gate. Had to wait for a new pilot. Should have landed at 5:22. Didn't land until 9:10. Trash flight.The boarding was pretty easy. However, the first class seats are not lay flat as other airlines (like JetBlue) has and therefore sleeping was a challenge.Everything was great. I liked the text updates so that I never miss a gate change & I have all the latest info.My JetBlue experience was nice. The flights ran on time, the aircraft was clean and comfortable, and the flight attendants were attentive. My only issue, which is isolated to the low-cost (budget) option at JetBlue, is that the check in process makes the user feel that they have to buy their seats. The seats offered for purchase are upgrades from the budget seats you get (which are essentially the last seats remaining). The interface should not make it feel like you must purchase a seat.I especially liked the lead crew officer. His boarding and safety announcements were made with a bit of novelty and humor. The flight also left the gate 10 minutes early and we landed about 20 minutes early… It was a delightful flight…You get what you pay for with JetBlue. Every little thing costs more, you are nickel and dimed until the end. Entertainment doesn’t function. Flight attendants do the bare minimum.Communication since no reason or explanation was given for 3 hrs delayExcellent from start to finish. All staff members were amazing!Excellent. Although they used to greet me as a mosaic member and provide a free drink, early boarding helps me to keep coming back to JetBlue.The inflight system with their wifi is a hot mess and doesn't work. Separately they do, but when you try to do theoretically simple things like pair a device for control it all falls apartIt took 1-1/2 hours to get our luggage after we landed. That to me is unacceptableOverall was excellent. Will definitely us JetBlue in the future.My experience with Spirit was good, but the experience with Kayak was not. Based on the Spirit agent Kayak added an additional charge after purchasing the tickets. When I buy the tickets I paid the total amount and I only pay once. This time they added an additional charge because based on Spirit they partially charge the tickets and I still needed to pay a second time. This is not good at all and UnprofessionalSpirit gets such a bad rap. I have never had a bad experience with them and the crew is always friendly and funny. This trip I had knee replacement surgery surgery 10 weeks ago. It is still a little rough to get get from point a to point b. And Spirit was on top of it. When there was a seat available the stewardess asked me if I wanted to move to an open seat so I could elevate my leg on the empty seat? 5 stars all around. They helped me on and helped me off the plane. I can’t say enough about the crew!!I enjoyed my flight, it was pretty smooth and we landed earlier than eta.Seats too hard, too much lumbar. Space between rows was extremely tight, so tight hard to place item under seat in front of me. No tv screens. Zero plugs for charging phones. Too many sales pitchesPrepaid for 1 bag but my prior airline did not provide it to me in time to check it with Spirit and I could not get my $75 refunded.Plane delayed which seems to be the norm with spirt. Everything is an up charge. I had to pay an additional fee because I was late getting back to my car. Will never fly spirit againIt was horrible. We were not allowed on the flight by spirit staff at the gate during boarding because I had a guitar. The same guitar I had at check in which I paid for and they said I can take it on the plane. We missed our flight, lost our luggage, and had to pay another $900 to rebook flights. Worst travel experience ever and spirit staff are the worst staff ever.The flight attendant spilled ice all down my leg and all over my suede boots and didn’t even apologize or anything. They just gave me a look like “what?!” Incredibly rude and dismissive. I saw them roll their eyes at other guests and even once yell at a lady with a baby.Seats were comfortable but dont recline at all. Checkin online was easy but didnt provide a gate until last minute. Flight attendants were very unkind, not friendly and didnt go over safety procedures in case of a crash. No free snacks or beverages, not even water.The booking was cancelled the next day. Spirit Airlines refunded Kayak cheapflay the full amount, but I was only refunded half. Costumer service is disgusting. Be careful. You can lose your money.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.I was 2 hr arrive in the airport and 45 min in the line . After take to my turn . The agent tell me I’m later . I can not board . So my vacation was going to the floor . Just for their bad customer service agent in the airline2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.Since you have to pay for overhead bags then they shouldn't be running out of space and asking individuals who paid to remove stuff from the overheadBook with frontier airlines with the mentality that they'll cancel your flight, kick you off and lose your luggage. Anything besides that is a win. Compare prices with other airlines (to include luggage) and if frontier is still worth it, book it but know all of their policies.You get what you pay for nothing essentially but a hard uncomfortable seat that doesn’t recline and kids screaming all around you and chaotic boarding and limited check bag weight allowance when compared to other airlinesNot very good. Paid in excess of $400 for assigned seating for my family and that was not provided. I want that money back.I chose the seats when booked the flight and paid for them. However after checking in I found we were assigned different seats!Delta7.9American Airlines7.2JetBlue7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Boston to OrlandoAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Boston to OrlandoFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Boston to Orlando according to KAYAK users.
