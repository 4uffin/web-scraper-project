Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The airport was reasonably clean. The boarding process reasonably efficient. The cabin crew was efficient, polite but not that friendly. The food quality was unremarkable and the choices were awful . There was either a so so chicken dish or a “ vegetarian “ option which was really cheap carbohydrates drowned in cheese. Signing onto i flight wifi was not straightforward. Overall it was a very average experienceThe staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Will not recommend SAS for business travel. Food was so-so. Service was very good. First leg was very good. Second leg from Copenhagen to Barcelona was terrible. We paid a LOT for business class and to have seats worse than most coach seats with no entertainment and no charging available for 1/3rd of the whole trip was not acceptable. Very disappointing. I thought they were coming back in the U.S. with style, NOT YET.I do not have a problem with the airline but both my two suitcases that were supposed to go from Hawaii to Copenhagen didn’t get on the plane in Seattle. I arrive on Monday the 21st at 10:30 in the morning. I did not get my two suitcases before Friday late afternoon that is unacceptable.No choice of food. Needed to pay more even for a can of coke!!!The seats were really close together and hard to get comfortable. The food was okay. The cheese was amazing! I loved the cold towels they gave us.When my flight was changed from delays they were quick to rebook me.I really enjoyed how clean and big the aircraft was, as well as how friendly the crew was.Airline left me stranded in the U.S. gave me an unrequested refund of 40% of booking and canceled my trip back! When I asked why, the said “we don’t have to tell you why”. “But you can rebook”. Never again! Paid 2x and rebooked on Austrian. What a joke!Painful seats for a 10 hour flight. There’s a very hard flat board in the seat that goes up to half the back and after 7 hours it gets impossible to find the right position to avoid the pain.I paid for the seat with more leg room but on the day of my departure my seat was changed. I brought it to the airline costumer service and he was able to change it back. The person sitting next to me had the same exact issue.Great experience. Typically do klm to Amsterdam but may start taking this flight in future - greatxexperience.Rude staff. I would avoid using the word racist but definitely partially or discriminatory. My 72 yrs old mother who is also disabled was traveling on this flight. She was the second passenger boarded to the plane. The First elderly couple ahead of my mother were allowed to use the airplane bathroom but my mother was denied entry stating it was for safety reasons. My mother objected the the couple in front of her were allowed but hostess still stated that due to the flight safety reasons she can’t use it. Even my mother explained that he is using blood pressure medication that’s why she have to use the restroom frequently but the crew continued arguing her. At one point the Mae attendent even suggested that if that’s the case my mother can urinate in her seat. The level of disrespect against an elderly lady is beyond my comprehension. This matter will be taken to the social media to shame the employees involved.my experience was great with Turkish airlines . the problem i encountered was with kayak booking. When I booked . it showed that im allowed a bag . and when I got to the airport, i had to pay $165 for one bag.Not up to Business Class standards. Two of the three toilets were out of order. The hostesses were aware and didn’t show any responsible act to do something. Food quality was not what we expect from Turkish hospitality. Overall we were not impressed and disappointed.During mid flight, try to get a flight attendant to help I couldn’t find one Otherwise, everything was perfectI was not given basinett seat.The connecting flight was missed due to airline fault i was not accomodated for hotel.Drinks were normt served frewuently.Never travelling again on tirkish airlines.I always travel wiyh family by turkish airline but no more.zero starsThe crew were very hospitable and pleasant. The food was pretty good. Unfortunately, there was a flight delay of more than 2 hours. We're not sure why but it appeared to be outside the control of Turkish Airlines.Bough tickets with luggage, but made me pay at Airport as wellThe economy seat was so uncomfortable, had not enough leg room for 13 hours flight, front seat basket was broken and couldn’t hold anything, food quality was horrible( we got food poisoned ) we charged for logged which used to be free. We paid too much for this flight and very disappointed. Turkish air line better to make satisfy and respect people instead of find different way to scam people.This is really the rating of two flights. JFK to IST then IST to NQZ. New York to Istanbul was good. Good crew and all positives. The flight to Astana was so bad that brought it all down. Crew was nonexistent above the minimum, seats were cramped, and it was hot on the plane. Turkish Airlines seems to be slipping down to US based carriers level.The 2 agents on the check in counter were super nice , helpful and very polite. Boarding was like a 1 2 3, I would recommend Turkish airlines for your next trip.Staff were nice, we left on time and arrived early, food was good. Unfortunately, they lost one of our bags and have been unable to find it. So we are in Italy for a week for my husband‘s birthday and he does not have any of his clothing.It was bad experience . I was about to lose my flight . The airline announced the gate very late , an hour before the flight , and you need to rush to find the gate in a big airport . The flight is a long flight and the food is poor . I difintelely not taking this airplane againIt was Ok for Business class considering we paid almost $10K for two seats. Disappointing part was the $640 (RT) to reserve the seats prior to departure unlike other airlines that is complementary when buying business class seats. Would I use ITA to go to Europe on my next trip -NO.Top notch re cleanliness, comfort, operational. Attendants attentive, cheerful, courteous and professional. An unusually high-grade experience all around.Flight bumpy and aircraft old with tape over seats , it seems there is a lack of maintenance, air pipe blow off in the middle of the flight, flight attendant seemed not to be worried about it. Food got very bad over time , not only for the quality but for the quantity . Seats are very uncomfortable , entertainment not working properly.The crew were great and constantly cleaning bathrooms and taking care of passengers. Flight was on time and arrived on time. Boarding was easy and hassle free. Food could have been better but decent selection. Overall recommend and will fly again.Everything was good except the bathrooms were usually dirty and the trash bins in the bathrooms were full.At least it was a direct flight, however the boarding process was a nightmare. 2+ hours in line to check my bag. Then told it was overbooked and I have to go standby even though I bought my ticket months ago. Then sent to another line to get on standby - another long wait and finally started yelling that my flight was boarding. They sent me somewhere else. In the end I did make the flight - among the last group to board, even though I arrived 4 hours early at the airport. Worst check in process I've ever experienced in 50 years off flying.We had a 3 hour delay and then a long taxi to take off. It would have been helpful for the pilot to have communicated more about what was going on. There was no A/C during the wait, and the cabin must have been more than 85 to 90 degrees. The crew gave water to the people in the front but by the time they go to the back of the plane they stopped giving out water. Eventually I went back and asked for some in the rear of the plane (for a second time). The food was close to inedible. I thought on an Italian flight that the pasta would be better than the chick, but honestly, a Swanson's TV dinner would have been better. I had a bite or two to keep my blood sugar up, but basically I couldn't eat it.Boarding was chaotic. Service was poor. Attendant was slow and rude. In business class, I was not offered a drink until 1.5 hrs,after takeoff. Food was inedible.Horrible… I was downgraded without notice, had to sit in economy and given my back injury was in pain most of the journey. I expect to be reimbursed for this inconvenience and after my return flight home, I never plan to fly with British Airways again.Great crew and food and beverage. Seating tight but not the airline's fault. Will definitely fly BA in future!Flight cancelled, lost luggage, crappy meal voucher. Nothing was good. Still dont have my luggage.The seating has become ridiculous… like a contest to see how narrow and short they can be made- forcing anyone over 5’1 to pay more to not be twisting oneself into a pretzel. Really insane- would have thought BA was better than this. Frankly- it cancels out a lot of the positive aspects.flight was delayed from BWI to London - missed my connecting flight & then connecting flight (also British Air) was delayed - food is awful, TV & movie selection is greatThree major things that led to my low rating, 1. Internet wasn't available for the whole time, and 2. TV became available way into flight, after numerous system reboots, and 3. Food is not good at all.Super tight economy class. My knees were hitting the back of seat in front of me (I'm only 5'6"). My small backpack (sized according to their required dimensions) would not fit under the seat in front of me because there is a box (is that the life jacket?) in the way. Over all, extremely uncomfortable. I forgive the tasteless food, but the tight seating was tortureDidn’t fly with them as someone had cancelled my flightSome how my flight was canceled, neither BA or Justfly.com accepted responsibility. I only found out about this the day before when I tried to check in. I had to book another flight which due to the time ( day before) cost me $300 more. I was still receiving notifications about the flight even when I was on another flight from you. So no my flight to London was not good.Online check-in 24 hours in advance something seems not so easy to check in to pick seats and to print a boarding passDelta7.9Scandinavian Airlines7.4Turkish Airlines7.3ITA Airways6.7British Airways6.7Everything you need to know for your flight from Boston to AthensAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Boston to AthensFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Boston to Athens according to KAYAK users.
