Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.4.0 Okaystephen, Sep 2025DJN - SATRead more Delta reviewsLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The airport was reasonably clean. The boarding process reasonably efficient. The cabin crew was efficient, polite but not that friendly. The food quality was unremarkable and the choices were awful . There was either a so so chicken dish or a “ vegetarian “ option which was really cheap carbohydrates drowned in cheese. Signing onto i flight wifi was not straightforward. Overall it was a very average experienceThe staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.I bought business class tickets but the seats are exactly like economy with no comfort seats nor an empty seat next to me provided. Very poor, low quality airline.I don't understand the concept of paying to get your personal luggage onboard and then asked to check it in.... either sell the space or don't, its a hassle to carry those all through the airport just to make a check in at the last minute.The food was great and the service and attitude was amazing!!It was a great experience. The only thing I would have changed was that the bathrooms were never cleaned and they got very dirty.Old airplanes small seats expensive tickets, not as expected overall and not comfortable according to the priceIt was an OK flight with below mediocre service by their flight attendantsWasted a lot of time trying to find the CDG lounge - it was not next to the connecting flight gate like the Air France staff said.My experience was good overall, the quality of the food really decreased! There used to be a choice between meat and fish now it’s between chicken and pasta! In the choices of entertainment meditation has been added which is very good. Soft chair workout to improve blood circulation and avoid phlebitis should be added.The only reason the overall rating wasn't "excellent" was due to problems in claiming luggage. The bags are delivered to the main area (Cinta 35) for domestic passengers, but to a DIFFERENT ROOM for international arrivees. After waiting 30 minutes, someone (who didn't appear to be from Air France or the airport) told us to go to another area. There we found our bags, which appeared to have been awaiting us for a while. We had to go through a bag check before leaving the airport. If we had been alerted to this possibility, or better yet, been to go directly to Cinta 34, we could have eliminated quite a bit of waiting.I wish that the meal included a vegetable or even a salad instead of couscous! Why serve chicken with rice AND couscous? Service was good overall though a bit lacking in friendliness. Usually on air france I've been offered a glass of champagne before dinner, wine with dinner, and a digestif after dinner. We were only offered wine this time!The worst Terrible Late for connecting flights. Made flight without luggage! I am still waiting for my luggage to be returned! I paid premium for this flight. My luggage should have been flown to Hartford instead they keep telling me it was put on a jet blue flight and is in New York! I flew Hartford to avoid New Yofk! The flight over was also unpleasant. We were stuck in a bus at Edinburgh airport for 30 minutes then our luggage again could not be found! Very poor service. Very disappointed . I need my luggage to be returned. Shirley Baliki 42 Blaine Sreet Fairfield CTWonderful experience from start to finish. Extremely nice flight staff and much better food than other airlines I have used. Arrived right on time.Delays resulting in missed connecting flight. Attendant failed to arrange special assistance as promised to get us on connecting flight. Robyn was the particular attendant.Too hot. Asked for an extra glass of water and was ignored. Asked to sit in empty seats that were open because it was so hot and crowded and was denied and the seats were empty the entire flightTerrible leg room - I’m 5’3” and my knees were touching the seat in front of me. When the person sitting in front of me leaned back, there was about 15 inches of space between my head and the TV screen which made it awkward to view movies. Last year they had decent food, but this year the only tasty item on the trip was dessert.The flight was delayed leaving Philadelphia due to “catering” and consequently arrived in Dublin some 75 minutes later than scheduled. Consequently this caused me to miss my connecting flight to Glasgow and I had to spend the night in Dublin.It was truly a horrible flight. We were delayed almost 2 hours. The seats were so tiny, my legs were hurting the entire flight. When i finally made it to Ireland i missed my connecting flight because we left Newark late. I will most likely never fly Aer Lingus againComing from the EU to the USA, Aer Lingus is a very good choice. You clear U.S. border control while still at the departure airport, so when you land in the States, you don’t need to go through the entry process again — very efficient and fast. In terms of comfort, Aer Lingus is better than the usual EU carriers like KLM, Lufthansa, or Air France, and also better than United. There’s more legroom, and the crew is helpful and kind. The food is average but slightly better than most airlines. Overall, the crew is definitely better than on American Airlines, though not quite at the level of Virgin.Best travel day I've had in a long time. Everything went perfectly, no delays. 10 out of 10Seat is business could have been a lot cleaner, but space was nice and seat was comfortableEverything was great. I liked the text updates so that I never miss a gate change & I have all the latest info.I don’t usually fly budget airlines or airlines in the United States. It was as good as any other airline. The seats are comfortable and the airline attendants are not rude & surly. Very nice flight (s).No internet on a flight over three hours in this age is criminal. Staff inattentive and dismissiveThey have the most inexperienced / rude flight staff I’ve encounteredvery difficult boarding process - aggressive passengers not the friendliest crewWiFi was not eorkig (again) And the plane was from 1990 with the screens which were.not touch and most didn’t even work and if lucky could tune in tvI paid extra for a seat closer to the front. The TV didn’t work at all for the entire flight. Would have been nice to know before I purchased an “upgraded “ seatIt was great. I had never flown on JetBlue before, but would be very happy to fly with them in the future.Worst flight experience ever flights canceled. JetBlue told us just did not even bother standing in line to come back in one and a half hours then without any information we had to go pick up all of our luggage and spend over $2000 in accommodation just to get home. JetBlue said that the next flight available for us to get home would be three days later. Absolutely absurd hasn’t offered to give us any compensation do not fly JetBlue horrible company. They said it was based on the weather and the weather is great in all locations that we would’ve been flying to total hoax. I think it’s a conspiracy theory.The captain gave good announcements and the flight attendants were friendly. The WiFi was pretty good. The plane itself looked very old inside and the seats were very uncomfortable. The screens in the seat backs were the smallest I’ve ever seen. There were so many loud and obnoxious kids on this flight and the parents didn’t do much to try to quiet them down. Some had videos and games on tablets with higher than necessary volume going the whole time.Excellent experience in every way, from ground crew helpfulness, boarding experience, inflight service all the way to modern equipment. My new favorite airline. I wish I could fly with them more often.For a no frills flight this was surprising comfortable. The crew were helpful and nice. The flight was smooth and there were no delays or issues which I haven't had on a flight in a long time. I would definitely fly with them again.The flight was canceled by play less than 24 hours prior to the trip, and I was unable to re-book. Have not received a refund for the trip despite filling out the appropriate form.Was was cancelled less than 24 hours prior to my scheduled departure by PLAY. Despite my attempts to rebook my travel, I encountered significant cost increases that rendered this option unfeasible. In accordance with EC Regulation 261/2004, airlines are required to issue a full refund for cancelled flights within seven days of the scheduled departure if a refund is requested instead of rebooking on another flight.

No tv monitors tho. So long flights make it longerThe worst. No free beverages. No entertainment on an overseas flight. Not enough space. Never again.Play is affordable!
