Luckily it wasn’t a long flight6.0 GoodAnonymous, Sep 2025ATL - MDWRead more Delta reviewsCramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The airport was reasonably clean. The boarding process reasonably efficient. The cabin crew was efficient, polite but not that friendly. The food quality was unremarkable and the choices were awful . There was either a so so chicken dish or a “ vegetarian “ option which was really cheap carbohydrates drowned in cheese. Signing onto i flight wifi was not straightforward. Overall it was a very average experienceThe staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Over 1 Hr delay. No APU so no AC on ground. Plane was hot during boarding and then they closed the doors over 20 minutes before engine start so interior of plane was steamy hot and stuffy. Could have been helped by opening doors until ready to depart.First of all we couldn’t check in online, then we learn at the airport we were on stand by for KLM’s mistake of overbooking. The seats were not comfy at all. Our luggage got lost.Short flight so it was okay. Nice crew, all very pleasant and professional. We were near the back in row 27 so just as we got our drinks, we started our descent so had to drink very quickly!The baggage drop-off in Stuttgart is bad: after online check-in you cannot use the automated baggage drop off as indicated on the website. You can use the terminals but have to cue to 1 of three open and slowly working counters to drop the bags. took about 45 minutes wait time.Our first flight was delayed so we missed our connecting flight. However it was easy to book a later flight on their app.My flight was delayed by 6 hours then I missed BOTH of my connecting flights, I then had to stay in the AIRPORT at JFK because soooooo many people also suffered from missing flights and there was no hotels available. I would like to be compensated for this experience! I had to stay in the airport for over 16 hours!The service was great. However the lounge only gets passing gradeI appreciate that KLM was proactive in informing me of the 2 hour delay which enabled me to replan my travel. It was a bit stressful not knowing whether my connection from Montreal to Ottawa was happening. But the ground and air crew did a good job at comforting and assuring me.Cabin crew were excellent, very proffesional, polite and friendly, in flight snack was underwhelming, a packet of cheese biscuits, im sure KLM could run to a sandwich!Legroom not all it could be, especially when the seat in front is reclined. Otherwise it was good, food and beverage were nice.I bought business class tickets but the seats are exactly like economy with no comfort seats nor an empty seat next to me provided. Very poor, low quality airline.I don't understand the concept of paying to get your personal luggage onboard and then asked to check it in.... either sell the space or don't, its a hassle to carry those all through the airport just to make a check in at the last minute.The food was great and the service and attitude was amazing!!It was a great experience. The only thing I would have changed was that the bathrooms were never cleaned and they got very dirty.Old airplanes small seats expensive tickets, not as expected overall and not comfortable according to the priceIt was an OK flight with below mediocre service by their flight attendantsWasted a lot of time trying to find the CDG lounge - it was not next to the connecting flight gate like the Air France staff said.My experience was good overall, the quality of the food really decreased! There used to be a choice between meat and fish now it’s between chicken and pasta! In the choices of entertainment meditation has been added which is very good. Soft chair workout to improve blood circulation and avoid phlebitis should be added.The only reason the overall rating wasn't "excellent" was due to problems in claiming luggage. The bags are delivered to the main area (Cinta 35) for domestic passengers, but to a DIFFERENT ROOM for international arrivees. After waiting 30 minutes, someone (who didn't appear to be from Air France or the airport) told us to go to another area. There we found our bags, which appeared to have been awaiting us for a while. We had to go through a bag check before leaving the airport. If we had been alerted to this possibility, or better yet, been to go directly to Cinta 34, we could have eliminated quite a bit of waiting.Much better than the major US Carriers especially in Biz Class.Food was the worst I’ve had on a VA flight. Normally it’s a lot betterI was my pleasure to fly virgin on my birthday for my first solo trip ever 🫶🏼These are one of the older seat arrangements facing away from the windows! Not particularly convenient sets. No storage spaces. NO COAT HANGING HOOKS. Inconvenient business class seat compared to any other airlines of similar class. Staff are excellent! Extremely professional, friendly. Food is good too.Overall, flight was excellent but check in was very slow for Premium Economy. Economy queue was shorter but we weren't allowed to use it.The staff was not very polite but the flight was very very nice and comfortable and the entertainment was greatGreat crew - old style upper class seats on the older fleet now feels datedPremium economy more comfortable than economy, but not by much. Did was awful, do not try the omelette. Flight crew were helpful. Flight was delayed by over an hour. Overall but bad, arrived safely and thank God.Food was excellent. Service was very good. Staff was very helpful to all passengers.The crew was excellent as ever on Virgin. The special meal was poor unfortunately. More significantly when we arrived at Manchester Airport there was no air bridge provided and we had to exit the plane down a rickety stair case. This is unacceptable for a transatlantic flight. Whilst I understand that this is the airport’s fault at the end of the day the airline is responsible for our transportation and needs to do something.Super friendly and helpful staff, from check-in desk to cabin crew.Our steward Margarida who served us from Lisbon to Boston was absolutely fantastic! She deserves a raise. Conscientious and thorough as well as showing appropriate attention for every need.An old airplane with very uncomfortable seats in the Comfort “class! Small, narrow, and hard seat. Entertainment options are inferior, old movies. Boarding started at the back of the airplane, as we entered the aircraft last instead of after business class, risking the possibility that the comfort section would not have room for carry-on in the overhead bin. The food was ok. White wine was terrible. Overall, the flight felt worse than cheap airliners, and the price was as high as premium carriers.I will avoid TAP if I can, the ground experience was very poor with bad behaviour from the ground crew and it was only a bit better on the aircraft.I had a business class ticket from EWR to Madrid with a layover at LIS for 11 hours. It was obvious that I needed to pick up my luggage in Lisbon for 11 hours and check it in again when boarding the second flight to Madrid. Before buying the ticket, I called TAP customer service. Customer service assured me that I could get my luggage in Lisbon. When I arrived at Newark airport, I immediately asked to check my luggage to Lisbon. However, the TAP employee refused me, saying that I should resolve this issue upon arrival in Lisbon. She checked my luggage to Madrid. I asked the TAP employee at the gate to help me when boarding the plane, I asked the flight attendants manager on board the plane to help me. All the employees refused to help me and said that I should resolve this issue in Lisbon. It took me 4 hours to resolve this issue in Lisbon. I arrived at 11am and they didn't give me my luggage until 3pm. As a result, I was so tired after a sleepless night on the plane and 4 hours on my feet at the airport and all my plans were ruined that I couldn't fly to Madrid. It was a terrible experiance,The seats were not designed to comfortably see people in coach for more than 10 minutesA good, comfortable flight with friendly crew and good entertainment options.Very rude person at the boarding desk; flight attendant coughing 3 inches from my face three times- not even covering her mouth; boarding process very unacceptable for older people with stairs to all planes (are you all stuck in the 1960’s?). I am sure that I am not remembering all of the negative things, but I am sure you get the message!There was chaos at the Naples airport. We arrived three hours early for the flight but there was no invitation available about where to go to check bags until an hour later. Then we had to go to a different terminal to check our bags and check in and back to the first to board.We flew TAP last October from Newark to Lisbon. The meal was bad. This flight had good food. Also, this flight was delayed. There were TAP employees waiting at Lisbon to make sure we made our connecting flight. I find the TAP website and app frustrating, but the service once we reached the airport was very goodBoarding too way too long. Biggest peeve: zero in-seat power in economy! No plug sockets, no USB ports. Plane was an A330, so not old.Delta7.9KLM7.8Air France7.4Virgin Atlantic7.4TAP AIR PORTUGAL7.1Everything you need to know for your flight from Boston to LisbonAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Boston to LisbonFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Boston to Lisbon according to KAYAK users.
