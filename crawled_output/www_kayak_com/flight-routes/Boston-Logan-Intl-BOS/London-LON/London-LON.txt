Luckily it wasn’t a long flight6.0 GoodAnonymous, Sep 2025ATL - MDWRead more Delta reviewsCramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The airport was reasonably clean. The boarding process reasonably efficient. The cabin crew was efficient, polite but not that friendly. The food quality was unremarkable and the choices were awful . There was either a so so chicken dish or a “ vegetarian “ option which was really cheap carbohydrates drowned in cheese. Signing onto i flight wifi was not straightforward. Overall it was a very average experienceThe staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Food was the worst I’ve had on a VA flight. Normally it’s a lot betterI was my pleasure to fly virgin on my birthday for my first solo trip ever 🫶🏼These are one of the older seat arrangements facing away from the windows! Not particularly convenient sets. No storage spaces. NO COAT HANGING HOOKS. Inconvenient business class seat compared to any other airlines of similar class. Staff are excellent! Extremely professional, friendly. Food is good too.Overall, flight was excellent but check in was very slow for Premium Economy. Economy queue was shorter but we weren't allowed to use it.The staff was not very polite but the flight was very very nice and comfortable and the entertainment was greatGreat crew - old style upper class seats on the older fleet now feels datedPremium economy more comfortable than economy, but not by much. Did was awful, do not try the omelette. Flight crew were helpful. Flight was delayed by over an hour. Overall but bad, arrived safely and thank God.Food was excellent. Service was very good. Staff was very helpful to all passengers.The crew was excellent as ever on Virgin. The special meal was poor unfortunately. More significantly when we arrived at Manchester Airport there was no air bridge provided and we had to exit the plane down a rickety stair case. This is unacceptable for a transatlantic flight. Whilst I understand that this is the airport’s fault at the end of the day the airline is responsible for our transportation and needs to do something.Super friendly and helpful staff, from check-in desk to cabin crew.Everything was great. I liked the text updates so that I never miss a gate change & I have all the latest info.I don’t usually fly budget airlines or airlines in the United States. It was as good as any other airline. The seats are comfortable and the airline attendants are not rude & surly. Very nice flight (s).No internet on a flight over three hours in this age is criminal. Staff inattentive and dismissiveThey have the most inexperienced / rude flight staff I’ve encounteredvery difficult boarding process - aggressive passengers not the friendliest crewWiFi was not eorkig (again) And the plane was from 1990 with the screens which were.not touch and most didn’t even work and if lucky could tune in tvI paid extra for a seat closer to the front. The TV didn’t work at all for the entire flight. Would have been nice to know before I purchased an “upgraded “ seatIt was great. I had never flown on JetBlue before, but would be very happy to fly with them in the future.Worst flight experience ever flights canceled. JetBlue told us just did not even bother standing in line to come back in one and a half hours then without any information we had to go pick up all of our luggage and spend over $2000 in accommodation just to get home. JetBlue said that the next flight available for us to get home would be three days later. Absolutely absurd hasn’t offered to give us any compensation do not fly JetBlue horrible company. They said it was based on the weather and the weather is great in all locations that we would’ve been flying to total hoax. I think it’s a conspiracy theory.The captain gave good announcements and the flight attendants were friendly. The WiFi was pretty good. The plane itself looked very old inside and the seats were very uncomfortable. The screens in the seat backs were the smallest I’ve ever seen. There were so many loud and obnoxious kids on this flight and the parents didn’t do much to try to quiet them down. Some had videos and games on tablets with higher than necessary volume going the whole time.The crew were friendly and helpful. Iberia lost our luggage on arrival, Friday and we didn't get it until Sunday at 10:00 p.m. local Malaga time. I also paid $382.80 for seat assignments but two out out of the four were not together. Iberia mentioned that it was because the plane was delayed in Madrid before our flight began in LAX. They should compensate us half of my payment.It was fortunate that the flight arrived in London in accordance with schedule, and the luggage was promptly transferred to the luggage carousel. However, I find it concerning that even minor issues in economy cabins are prevalent within the industry. American Airlines, in particular, appears to have the least legroom and feels more crowded due to the proximity of neighboring passengers. Additionally, the crew’s adherence to protocol is inconsistent. While they may enforce certain rules set by the FAA on a select few individuals, they often overlook numerous violations, such as failing to reset seat recline during landing.Easy and organized getting in and out of the flightWe liked the flight but while we purchased an aisle seat, our seats had a different configuration on this flight. A fellow passenger suggested that the airplane had been changed. Too bad we were not informed and had no chance to modify our seat preferences. We were stuck in the window and middle seats with no chance to walk around and go to the bathroom without disturbing our sleeping fellow passenger.The crew were not very personable. The crew did not serve tea or coffee. The bathroom was not kept clean. Two out of the 5 toilets in the cabin weren't working.It was extremely cold in the back of the plane. The seats are uncomfortable and space very small. Crew was excellent as usual.Check in needed to be in person, not nice. Also I won’t do connections in Charlotte again because you need to go through security again and short connections become a problemIberia lost my bag, said they found it in another country, said they sent it to me, but never did. Went my whole trip without my stuff, but expecting it to show up because that’s what they said would happen. Their communication sucks, their website sucks, and to top it all off, their seats are small and uncomfortable. They’re bad at their jobs and they should feel bad about themselves. Do not even get me started on the flight home. AVOID!I described my experience in the previous window. I didn't realize that there would be another opportunity for this flight. Please look at my response in the previous window.Boarding was 2 1/2 late no explanation Captain said he did not know why, but he rested at home for an extra couple of hours. Food was edible, Nothing more.Need to offer Better food from LAX to London Service from London to Delhi very delayed after take off.Connection at Hethrow was horrible..We couldn't get out of the plane for an hour as they were buying people to the airport and there were not enough busses. We had 2 and half hf between flights so it was very tight. After departing plane we had to go thru security again. People with less time in between connections missed their flightsHorrible… I was downgraded without notice, had to sit in economy and given my back injury was in pain most of the journey. I expect to be reimbursed for this inconvenience and after my return flight home, I never plan to fly with British Airways again.Great crew and food and beverage. Seating tight but not the airline's fault. Will definitely fly BA in future!The seating has become ridiculous… like a contest to see how narrow and short they can be made- forcing anyone over 5’1 to pay more to not be twisting oneself into a pretzel. Really insane- would have thought BA was better than this. Frankly- it cancels out a lot of the positive aspects.flight was delayed from BWI to London - missed my connecting flight & then connecting flight (also British Air) was delayed - food is awful, TV & movie selection is greatSuper tight economy class. My knees were hitting the back of seat in front of me (I'm only 5'6"). My small backpack (sized according to their required dimensions) would not fit under the seat in front of me because there is a box (is that the life jacket?) in the way. Over all, extremely uncomfortable. I forgive the tasteless food, but the tight seating was tortureDidn’t fly with them as someone had cancelled my flightOnline check-in 24 hours in advance something seems not so easy to check in to pick seats and to print a boarding passI like the crew, very welcoming. Food can be better. The seat arms don’t go up so. I could use the empty seat next to mine to relax better. 3hrs delay 😠Delta7.9Virgin Atlantic7.4JetBlue7.2Iberia7.0British Airways6.7Everything you need to know for your flight from Boston to LondonAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Boston to LondonFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Boston to London according to KAYAK users.
