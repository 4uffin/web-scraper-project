We waited a very long time in the tarmac. Our flight 24 was scheduled @ 7, therefore we left my house at 330 to park our car. We were at the gate @ 530, then we were told at 6a that it will be late , we boarded at 930 but did not take off until 1015. Therefore my arranged pick up in JFK was cancelled because of no show. Before all these I got an email offers of changing my flight to a different date which I took a day earlier. I will never again take Alaska Airlines, very Inefficient and Disappointing.10.0 ExcellentGRACE, Aug 2025SAN - JFKRead more Alaska Airlines reviewsMy flight wait is 3 hours delayed due to Unknown reason.

I will never again take Alaska Airlines, very Inefficient and Disappointing.Such great crew, from checkin to the plane. So friendly and helpful, I was genuinely impressed.Seats extremely uncomfortable, no entertainment, no snacks, and when boarding, half of the passengers needed to check in the carry on luggage without any explanation.First time flying with Alaska, and it went great. Thank you for a great experience flying to PDX.The flight was jumping between being delayed and closer to schedule about 5 times. Alaska air website showed incorrect times while google had latest info. This panic was horrible to deal with.I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Alaskan Airlines allows normal leg space in the economy class cabin, offers free movies and other entertainment programs via WiFi. The staff was friendly and worked hard to make this long flight enjoyable.I always heard this was a terrible airline but I was happy to experience otherwise. The seats were more comfortable than delta. They did board late and gate was a little chaotic, which is to be expected for a budget airline. I would definitely do it again for that price.Very expensive for short flights. Can’t communicate with Alaska Air about passport issue at check-in. Also no replies to my text messages. Wanted to extend our vacation for two more days but this expensive flight ticket is called SAVER and I couldn’t make changes or cancel or get a credit even, so I paid another airline for the return trip. Extremely disappointed.They canceled my flight then changed me $155 for the same flight the next dayOur flight time was drastically changed which caused us to lose a day of vacationAs always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.The Southwest employees (all two of them) were very nice and cheerful despite the fact the line to self-check a bag (simply drop it off) was hundreds of people long. Thank God I arrived early to the airport because I stood in this line for at least an hour. Once on the flight that had been delayed by an hour, we had no Wi-Fi and thus no entertainment. Finally, I hope the investor strong arm tactics against Southwest pay off in a short-term windfall to your C-Suite because the rest of you are screwed. I have been a faithful Southwest customer for 15 years due to everything you just got rid of. I'm flying to Idaho and Washington in October, both places I used to simply book with Southwest without a second thought now with Frontier (Washington) and United (Idaho) because they offer everything the "new" Southwest does but cheaper and at better times, destinations, etc. This really makes me sad...Delayed flight. Nicest crew member was a SW pilot flying seated next to me who kindly move to seat the final passenger. Flight extra delayed. My cup of refreshment of ginger ale was so packed with ice it was literally 2 sips.No trays in our seats, we sat in first row, purchased a business class fare. Had to hold our drinks and snack in our hands. No plugs for our cell phones. Had to pay for it a drink cocktail each. Seats so uncomfortable.Flight wasn’t even full, but too many carry-ons caused us to run out of bin space. New bag fee has folks who would usually check their bags carrying on. Watching Southwest morph into Spirit/Frontier is so sad to watchFlights delayed by 4-6 hours. Boarding was a mess and unclear. Bags were not at arrival airport and had never even been put on the plane. No idea when I’ll get them. Don’t fly into Denver!Southwest is Southwest. No frills. If you're luck enough to get a happy crew (we did), then it makes for a nicer flight.I understand that both Hawaiian and Alaskan are in the process of merging but I could not get real-time flight info or access my boarding pass on either appHad a hard time checking into my flight on my phone because they gave me the wrong confirmation number. Otherwise everything else went well.All was good and they were able to seat my travel companion next to me. Thank you.What an amazing flight. I haven’t experienced this level of service in a flight in years. This will be the only way to fly to Hawaii for me in the future.Kayak sold me a ticket after check in time. Could not check in. Could not get on flight.Everything was great except having to check in at Alaska. That was a surprise and took extra time and effort. Should have been explained somewhere maybe on the HA electronic ticket.I accidentally made this purchase and they wouldn’t refund me even though I called immediately to cancel it.The flight was delayed and they didn’t have a pilot for the flight. Seemed very unorganized and took way longer than expected.I could not believe that on a 5 hour plus flight we were not given a complimentary meal . That should be illegal. Or it would be nice to be informed beforehand that a complimentary meal would not be provided. The wording in the email I got about pre ordering food was phrased in a way that made the food seem like it would be free. Very misleading! Also during boarding we were informed there would be empty seats we could move to if we wanted, all we had to do was wait for an announcement, however an announcement was never made. Then when we tried to change seats ourselves we were singled out over the loud speaker and told we could not move without asking. Then the flight was about to take off , so we didn’t have time to ask . Then we were told we could not move to the exit row because you had to pay for those seats, but we were not told where we could move. Also no one was in the exit rows so , if something happened no one would be there to assist the passengers. Also people should be allowed to move there if the airline wasn’t able to sell them. One passenger asked if he could pay for the upgrade and the flight attendant said she did not have the capability to charge for the seat on her mobile device, so the airline ended up losing possible income anyways . So why not let people move there during flight if you have no way to charge them? Then the landing was bumpy and awful and many passengers complained out loud when we landed .It was pretty good except there was no food, which was understandable because it was a short flight but I would have liked to at least have a snack; otherwise it was great. Staff/crew, great. Thank youI understand stuff happens, but plane failures are likely due to lack of maintenance. Additionally, air conditioning wasn't working, no snack/drink service, no WiFi. Fortunately, the crew was communicative and light-hearted. United grabbed another plane and we were able to get to our destination.Had to cancel first flight because Airporter Bus took over 3 hrs to get to airport which resulted in an extra $378 dollar fare . Is there anyway I can be reimbursed for initial fare since it was not my fault? Sent from my iPhone EJ LedetExcellent flight. Boarding was efficient and departure was on time. Smooth flight with on time arrival. Deplaning was also efficient.Our flight was understandably diverted to a small regional airport in Laramie, Wyoming due to weather conditions, which I fully recognize and appreciate. However, the low rating stems from the experience that followed: passengers remained on board for over an hour without the option to deplane and stretch, despite the aircraft being stationary. Although the pilot opened the cabin door, only he was permitted to exit. Meanwhile, passengers grew increasingly uncomfortable as warm summer air entered the cabin through the open door, and being in the second row meant we were impacted immediately. While the flight attendants made efforts to keep everyone at ease, I believe allowing passengers to deplane briefly, given the extended delay, would have significantly improved the overall experience.I never flew. Flight was canceled. DIA worst airport in the country. Avoid at all costs.Very rough getting into denver. my kid threw up it was so rough.Why wasn't this flight departure scheduled eith another crew so that it could leave on time? When we arrived in Denver we had so little time between flights we had run to the connecting flight. We should received some credit for the inconvenience.I was supposed to be on business class at first class from Denver back to Miami due to weather changes. I missed my connection and it’s put on a flight to Fort Lauderdale. Instead of honoring my business class/1st class ticket, they put me in coach, but there were two first class seats open. I think it’s absolutely disgusting that I paid for first class $1300 ticket and they put me in economy and they had to open seats available and I have still not been refunded the difference. I ended up having to eat a snack box instead of the meal I was supposed to get and did not get home till 2 AM so I think that’s a little pathetic that I had to live off crackers for dinner And my poor dog ate some cheese and salami. Oh yes, apparently when they switched me to the new flight they forgot to mention I had a service dogExcellent service despite turbulence during the flight. Flight attendants were remarkable!Flight attendant moved my bag without notifying me and was rude to me when I asked him about it. There was no reason to move it.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.Frontier Airlines was AWFUL. I was an hour early for my flight and the lady refused to check me in. I had to purchase a whole new ticket with a different airline.Late, terrible communication, horrible planning of passenger seating until the literal last minute. One of the worst flying experiences of my life. Y'all suckFirst of all, we never got on the connecting flight to Denver. They delayed our flight for two hours. If we would have gotten on that flight, we would have been stuck in Denver for 13 hours. So we re- routed our flight for a straight through flight to Oklahoma two days later. THEN, they delayed that flight for two hours. After that we were able to finally get on our flight and come home. Frontier Airlines - one of the worst airlines I have ever been on.Terrible communication with weather delay, lost baggage, near impossible to reach customer serviceMy tickets got canceled on me by your site and I didn't have a flight. Then you kept sending me emails on the status of q flight I didn't have tickets for.Flight was late. Missed connecting in Denver. My new flight is more than 24 hours later and I have no room, vouchers, or compensation, and might also be bumped from the one tomorrow.This was one of the first frontier airline flights this spring that wasn't delayed. It actually left on time. Some of the flight crew did not look happy, they didn't smile when the passengers were boarding or getting off the plane, and the passengers initiated greetings, not the staff. To me this was an odd experience to have with any flight/airline. I had a bad experience booking this flight. The price didn't solidify until late hours into the night. Ever time I purchased the ticket, I either received a denial email or an error because the price has changed, but it was never reflected on the flyfrontier or kayak websites until way after midnight on the date of travel. This caused me anxiety and irritation with the websites. Then I noticed a mishap with my name on my voucher as I went to check in, it was incorrect. When I proceeded to correct it, Frontier had no easy, let alone free, way to remedy it. I couldn't correct my name without a $75 charge, I couldn't cancel my voucher to repurchase it with the correct name without a $100 charge, because it was too close to departure. Then calling frontier was nearly impossible to remedy the situation with a human. It's already difficult to want to choose frontier because of all the upcharges, but you feel kinda trapped into doing so because it's the more affordable airline.Alaska Airlines8.0Southwest8.0Hawaiian Airlines7.8United Airlines7.4Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from San Diego to DenverAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsSan Diego (SAN)Denver (DEN)Cabin class types available on flights from San Diego to DenverCabin classes available on flights from San Diego to Denver.
