But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.4.0 OkayDavid, Aug 2025BWI - DTWRead more Southwest reviewsSouthwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.Other than a bit of a delay, everything was good. Again, the boarding process and picking seats is the only thing I don't enjoy.The quality of Southwest Airlines continues to degrade each time I fly with them. If it were not for the free luggage, I would probably choose another airline. Their prices are a little bit competitive, but way too high for the quality of the service. Southwest is not unique in this way. Domestic flight in the United States of America has continued to be a lower and lower quality product. Very sad when you compare the quality of domestic airlines to that of many international airlines around the world.Southwest is typically delayed, and it gets wearisome. It is no longer a discount airline and you get way less than you pay for when it comes to comfort and Ce.I'm not a fan of Southwest's model. I don't like the herding style of boarding.Staff was far less than helpful at all times. Departure and arrival times mean nothing to Southwest. Extremely disappointed, will never fly with them again, and I’ll be sure to share my experience with all.It is southwest seat was ok. Not the most comfortable seatPlz don't take away free bags and free seatingThe seats were a bit cramped and worn, but otherwise okay.Short flight with plenty of open seats. Drinks and snacks were still provided even on such a short flight. <1 hrPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneAlways good but we must do something about people in rows ahead of you that don't put their seats back up when they are suppose to. And It's rough to not be able to even lean over to get something out of my purse.this crew didn't care much. bumping carts into seats more times than i care to rememberEverything was fine except the entertainment was not working for half of the flight.Easy boarding with an extremely kind attendant. Seats were spacious and we had 3 seats for 2 people so we could stretch out. Comfortable air flow and very attentive and hospital attendants. Bathrooms and food were the only negative. Bathrooms were so small you could hardly get in and close the door. I don’t think an obese person would fit or a person with a movement disability. Food was the trending food for flights, nonexistent. We spent $40 getting sandwich and snack at airport for our 6 hour flught.While waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.This flight never occurred because AA couldn’t get their act together.During service there was a garbage/beverage spill near our seats that never was cleaned up. On a relatively short flight when we’re fortunate enough to actually have in flight movies available, the flight attendants pitching the AADVANTAGE credit card shouldn’t talk for the last 10 minutes of the flight so that we miss the end of the movie.The boarding was pretty easy. However, the first class seats are not lay flat as other airlines (like JetBlue) has and therefore sleeping was a challenge.Would have thought that they would gas up plane before everyone got on boardThe flights were terribly delayed and then cancelled which forced us booking another night at the hotel. Very poor management from American AirlinesCrew was late. Baggage was late. 2hs inside the plane waiting fro de-icing and traffic. A 3:30hs flight ended up being almost 6hs inside the airplane.Checking in at the counter was very disappointing. The lady had a very bad attitude and smart at me. She had no smile, did not greet me by name, or acknowledge me as a valued customer. Poor reflection of the airline.Miami lounges were overcrowded and we were unable to get in. We only had a short time. But the banks are too tight in all American hubsBoarded over an hour late, no communication, the sign just changed, no attendant to answer questions - she disappeared forever (hiding). Small plane and couldn’t hear the overhead nor understand.Everything was fine. I'm average height and I pack light. I'm ready for my Spirit flight.Cancelled my flight last minute and did not help me rebook. It was a horrible experience.Wow truly top notch airline Efficient nice snacks courteous staff Fast boarding !My experience with Spirit was good, but the experience with Kayak was not. Based on the Spirit agent Kayak added an additional charge after purchasing the tickets. When I buy the tickets I paid the total amount and I only pay once. This time they added an additional charge because based on Spirit they partially charge the tickets and I still needed to pay a second time. This is not good at all and UnprofessionalSpirit gets such a bad rap. I have never had a bad experience with them and the crew is always friendly and funny. This trip I had knee replacement surgery surgery 10 weeks ago. It is still a little rough to get get from point a to point b. And Spirit was on top of it. When there was a seat available the stewardess asked me if I wanted to move to an open seat so I could elevate my leg on the empty seat? 5 stars all around. They helped me on and helped me off the plane. I can’t say enough about the crew!!This gate agents are always so rude! I stopped flirting with spirit years ago for that reason I thought it would change by now. It’s so tacky they try to treat you like a school child i hate itNot great. Seats uncomfortable. Crew a little rude. Amenities like wifi and drinks way too expensive.EVERYTHING! It was so bad that I will be filing a claim for reimbursement for my seat as I could not fully sit in it due to an obese person being next to me and spilling over into my "space." And my personal item in the overhead been got crushed between two suitcases, so now my business laptop has been damaged beyond repair. Also, it was expensive! Since you pay for EVERYTHING, the cost of the trip was probably more than if you I used an airline that was not discounted. I will NEVER fly Spirit Airlines again!The staff was very sarcastic, the flight was delayed. There was no wi-fi o any type of entertainment. The plane was dirty and we have to wait a long time for the luggage to come out.It was a good an early bird pleasant and quietSeats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.I was 2 hr arrive in the airport and 45 min in the line . After take to my turn . The agent tell me I’m later . I can not board . So my vacation was going to the floor . Just for their bad customer service agent in the airline2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.Since you have to pay for overhead bags then they shouldn't be running out of space and asking individuals who paid to remove stuff from the overheadBook with frontier airlines with the mentality that they'll cancel your flight, kick you off and lose your luggage. Anything besides that is a win. Compare prices with other airlines (to include luggage) and if frontier is still worth it, book it but know all of their policies.You get what you pay for nothing essentially but a hard uncomfortable seat that doesn’t recline and kids screaming all around you and chaotic boarding and limited check bag weight allowance when compared to other airlinesNot very good. Paid in excess of $400 for assigned seating for my family and that was not provided. I want that money back.I chose the seats when booked the flight and paid for them. However after checking in I found we were assigned different seats!It was a no frills flight. Would have liked to be able to charge my deviceSeats were extremely uncomfortable and it was very hot on the plane.Southwest8.0Delta7.9American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Baltimore to MiamiAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Baltimore to MiamiFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Baltimore to Miami according to KAYAK users.
