But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.4.0 OkayDavid, Aug 2025BWI - DTWRead more Southwest reviewsSouthwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.Other than a bit of a delay, everything was good. Again, the boarding process and picking seats is the only thing I don't enjoy.The quality of Southwest Airlines continues to degrade each time I fly with them. If it were not for the free luggage, I would probably choose another airline. Their prices are a little bit competitive, but way too high for the quality of the service. Southwest is not unique in this way. Domestic flight in the United States of America has continued to be a lower and lower quality product. Very sad when you compare the quality of domestic airlines to that of many international airlines around the world.Southwest is typically delayed, and it gets wearisome. It is no longer a discount airline and you get way less than you pay for when it comes to comfort and Ce.I'm not a fan of Southwest's model. I don't like the herding style of boarding.Staff was far less than helpful at all times. Departure and arrival times mean nothing to Southwest. Extremely disappointed, will never fly with them again, and I’ll be sure to share my experience with all.It is southwest seat was ok. Not the most comfortable seatPlz don't take away free bags and free seatingThe seats were a bit cramped and worn, but otherwise okay.Short flight with plenty of open seats. Drinks and snacks were still provided even on such a short flight. <1 hrTerrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Flight was good and crew was super polite. However, there were around 5 kids screaming the WHOLE 2 hours. I understand kids have to come but parents need to do something to control their children. They make the experience terrible, especially after finishing 16 hour shifts at the hospital I needed some sleep, which I did not get.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.All of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.Armrest controller on my seat 35D and nextbooennseat 35E did not work right. Hard to press buttons to recognize and 35D had constantnpressure either upmost down somit was nearly impossible to make selections. .I flew with my dog and had already purchased my dog’s ticket. Even that morning I had called costumer service to insure that my husband and I had seats together since the website was giving me an error when choosing our seats and the representative mentioned our dog. I showed up early to the airport and when I got to the gate and we started boarding I was help back and told that I was supposed to have a yellow tag and that I should have checked in at the counter for them to give me that tag. I was not aware of this, the representative on the phone did not say anything. Nor did I see it anywhere in the checking process online, so if you travel with a pet and are not checking in luggage, just know that you still have to go to the check in counter when arriving at the airport unless you want to be the last one to board and not have room for your carry on in the overhead bins. Other than that, I had a great experience.Once we got in the air the pilot made up some of the time of the delay. So that was really nice.I understand stuff happens, but plane failures are likely due to lack of maintenance. Additionally, air conditioning wasn't working, no snack/drink service, no WiFi. Fortunately, the crew was communicative and light-hearted. United grabbed another plane and we were able to get to our destination.There was no food available for this red eye... one little waffle cookie for a 6+ hour flight... thank God I was able to sleep someVery good but wish they had the seat-back video screens for movies & gamesFlight was delayed not sure why no explanation given and no apologies either. Otherwise the flight was fineWhile waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.Flight delays numerous times. Everytime we would get close to boarding it would be delayed again. Strung along the entire time.This flight never occurred because AA couldn’t get their act together.During service there was a garbage/beverage spill near our seats that never was cleaned up. On a relatively short flight when we’re fortunate enough to actually have in flight movies available, the flight attendants pitching the AADVANTAGE credit card shouldn’t talk for the last 10 minutes of the flight so that we miss the end of the movie.Waited on the runway for takeoff for 2.5 hours. Air traffic rerouted us. The plane didn't have enough fuel, so had to go back to the gate. Had to wait for a new pilot. Should have landed at 5:22. Didn't land until 9:10. Trash flight.The boarding was pretty easy. However, the first class seats are not lay flat as other airlines (like JetBlue) has and therefore sleeping was a challenge.Everything about the flight was lovely…We left early, arrived early, cabin crew were efficient and helpful. Flight was easy and most pleasant.Would have thought that they would gas up plane before everyone got on boardI never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm.

Very unhappy and very poor service.Everything was fine. I'm average height and I pack light. I'm ready for my Spirit flight.Cancelled my flight last minute and did not help me rebook. It was a horrible experience.Wow truly top notch airline Efficient nice snacks courteous staff Fast boarding !My experience with Spirit was good, but the experience with Kayak was not. Based on the Spirit agent Kayak added an additional charge after purchasing the tickets. When I buy the tickets I paid the total amount and I only pay once. This time they added an additional charge because based on Spirit they partially charge the tickets and I still needed to pay a second time. This is not good at all and UnprofessionalSpirit gets such a bad rap. I have never had a bad experience with them and the crew is always friendly and funny. This trip I had knee replacement surgery surgery 10 weeks ago. It is still a little rough to get get from point a to point b. And Spirit was on top of it. When there was a seat available the stewardess asked me if I wanted to move to an open seat so I could elevate my leg on the empty seat? 5 stars all around. They helped me on and helped me off the plane. I can’t say enough about the crew!!This gate agents are always so rude! I stopped flirting with spirit years ago for that reason I thought it would change by now. It’s so tacky they try to treat you like a school child i hate itNot great. Seats uncomfortable. Crew a little rude. Amenities like wifi and drinks way too expensive.EVERYTHING! It was so bad that I will be filing a claim for reimbursement for my seat as I could not fully sit in it due to an obese person being next to me and spilling over into my "space." And my personal item in the overhead been got crushed between two suitcases, so now my business laptop has been damaged beyond repair. Also, it was expensive! Since you pay for EVERYTHING, the cost of the trip was probably more than if you I used an airline that was not discounted. I will NEVER fly Spirit Airlines again!Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.I was 2 hr arrive in the airport and 45 min in the line . After take to my turn . The agent tell me I’m later . I can not board . So my vacation was going to the floor . Just for their bad customer service agent in the airline2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.Since you have to pay for overhead bags then they shouldn't be running out of space and asking individuals who paid to remove stuff from the overheadBook with frontier airlines with the mentality that they'll cancel your flight, kick you off and lose your luggage. Anything besides that is a win. Compare prices with other airlines (to include luggage) and if frontier is still worth it, book it but know all of their policies.You get what you pay for nothing essentially but a hard uncomfortable seat that doesn’t recline and kids screaming all around you and chaotic boarding and limited check bag weight allowance when compared to other airlinesNot very good. Paid in excess of $400 for assigned seating for my family and that was not provided. I want that money back.I chose the seats when booked the flight and paid for them. However after checking in I found we were assigned different seats!It was a no frills flight. Would have liked to be able to charge my deviceSeats were extremely uncomfortable and it was very hot on the plane.Southwest8.0United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Baltimore to TampaAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Baltimore to TampaFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Baltimore to Tampa according to KAYAK users.
