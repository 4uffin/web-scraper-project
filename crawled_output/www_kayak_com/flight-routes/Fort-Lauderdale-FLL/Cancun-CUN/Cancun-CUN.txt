That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.8.0 ExcellentTarun, Sep 2025MCO - LHRRead more Delta reviewsPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.For a 69 year old with health problems I had the worse experience, no wheelchair when I entered a lady told me to sit and wait while a gentleman told me I had to walk to the Delta station, which I did. I had a carry on and a bag, and I was traveling with my service dog, which was on his carrier and the lady charged me for my carry on luggage, beside all the waiting cause of the delay, I had to walk to get my luggage cause no wheelchair showed up, I am so disappointed. I will get in touch with the company. I got home at 3:00 am, not good for my health situation.Flight was an hour late, who knows why. It was OK, nothing outstanding.Excellent check-in. Crew was good. Excellent communication from flight deck.Amazing flight! I have never noticed the uniforms of the attendants before in twenty years of flying except today when one female had the most amazing dress on. It was beautifully designed and showed she was in charge. I never dreamed I would google who designed Delta uniforms . The ultimate compliment is when another woman admires your outfit. . I hope your designer puts it on the marketThis had nothing to do with Delta… The flights were on time and flawless. The service was excellent. We purchased seats in (aisle/middle) comfort plus since this was a cross country flight. Unfortunately, the woman seated at the window was 300+ pounds and, as might be expected, covered up about a third of the middle seat also. there was absolutely nothing that Delta could have done about that… I just don’t know what the answer should be. If you purchase a seat, you should should be able to use the entire seat and not just the portion that someone else is not sitting/oozing in. Disappointing…there should be something that could be done….I'm just not sure what solution could be.The worst part was I was NOT allowed in the lounge even though I was holding a first class ticket and have a premium American Express card. I have flown Business or First Class with many airlines. Delta is the ONLY one who does not extend this courtesy to anyone except people who hold the very expensive American Express card. As a result, I won’t fly Delta if I have any other choice.It was an overnight flight and I desperately needed coffee before we landed, but Delta does only one beverage service, and that is shortly after takeoff, not before landing at 5 am.very difficult boarding process - aggressive passengers not the friendliest crewWiFi was not eorkig (again) And the plane was from 1990 with the screens which were.not touch and most didn’t even work and if lucky could tune in tvIt was great. I had never flown on JetBlue before, but would be very happy to fly with them in the future.The captain gave good announcements and the flight attendants were friendly. The WiFi was pretty good. The plane itself looked very old inside and the seats were very uncomfortable. The screens in the seat backs were the smallest I’ve ever seen. There were so many loud and obnoxious kids on this flight and the parents didn’t do much to try to quiet them down. Some had videos and games on tablets with higher than necessary volume going the whole time.Spend hours delayed with no food, water anything sitting on the aieplane with no ability to eat or use the restroom. My entire experience was the absolute worst. I will never fly jet Blue again.It would have been nice if they had offered more than one set of snacksFlight was delayed several 3 hours - no reason was given and no communication what so ever.No overhead baggage room even though I was seated in row 2. Consequently had to check in my carry on bag. Baggage carousel was jammed. Took 45 min to get my bag.Cancelled flight with no specific instructions to get a boarding pass for another flight. The whole flight of people were in line for an hour because there was only 1 person to help at the desk. This was unusual for JetBlue.Except for the 28 minute delay leaving and the earlier reschedule to a later takeoff time the flight was good.I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.I will use spirit more New clean aircraft Excellent crew ! Quick boarding process !I liked the check in procedure. The luggage charges and overweight cost can be better.The flight was delayed be over 3 hours. I tried to get a refund for Vivian Kirby and my session kept being stopped. I was NEVER able to finish the prosses...after 2 hours of attempting.For the minimalist experience, it is really a great ride-- feels a little like public transport i guessThis gate agents are always so rude! I stopped flirting with spirit years ago for that reason I thought it would change by now. It’s so tacky they try to treat you like a school child i hate itFlight was on time and was not crowded. Flight attendants were very understanding of my wife’s back problems.It amaze me how other airlines leave on time and Spirit always have some type of delay. I’ve flown with Spirit many times, but it reached a point I’d rather pay twice the amount and not deal with this corporation they never do nothing to reimburse people for their time or headaches.Spirit charges you to breathe in their presence. They have you pick and buy your seat in advance and then I got bumped from the seat I paid for because THEY overbooked the flight by a dozen people. they do not provide any entertainment, they do not provide even a small cup of water - you have to pay for everything. I will never fly Spirit again.I feel like Spirit Airlines is a trash airline. They canceled my flight and could not Even help me book a new flight for the same dateDelta7.9JetBlue7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Everything you need to know for your flight from Fort Lauderdale to CancúnAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsFort Lauderdale (FLL)Cancún (CUN)Cabin class types available on flights from Fort Lauderdale to CancúnCabin classes available on flights from Fort Lauderdale to Cancún.
