I had never flown on JetBlue before, but would be very happy to fly with them in the future.The captain gave good announcements and the flight attendants were friendly. The WiFi was pretty good. The plane itself looked very old inside and the seats were very uncomfortable. The screens in the seat backs were the smallest I’ve ever seen. There were so many loud and obnoxious kids on this flight and the parents didn’t do much to try to quiet them down. Some had videos and games on tablets with higher than necessary volume going the whole time.Spend hours delayed with no food, water anything sitting on the aieplane with no ability to eat or use the restroom. My entire experience was the absolute worst. I will never fly jet Blue again.It would have been nice if they had offered more than one set of snacksFlight was delayed several 3 hours - no reason was given and no communication what so ever.No overhead baggage room even though I was seated in row 2. Consequently had to check in my carry on bag. Baggage carousel was jammed. Took 45 min to get my bag.Cancelled flight with no specific instructions to get a boarding pass for another flight. The whole flight of people were in line for an hour because there was only 1 person to help at the desk. This was unusual for JetBlue.Except for the 28 minute delay leaving and the earlier reschedule to a later takeoff time the flight was good.I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.I will use spirit more New clean aircraft Excellent crew ! Quick boarding process !I liked the check in procedure. The luggage charges and overweight cost can be better.The flight was delayed be over 3 hours. I tried to get a refund for Vivian Kirby and my session kept being stopped. I was NEVER able to finish the prosses...after 2 hours of attempting.For the minimalist experience, it is really a great ride-- feels a little like public transport i guessThis gate agents are always so rude! I stopped flirting with spirit years ago for that reason I thought it would change by now. It’s so tacky they try to treat you like a school child i hate itFlight was on time and was not crowded. Flight attendants were very understanding of my wife’s back problems.It amaze me how other airlines leave on time and Spirit always have some type of delay. I’ve flown with Spirit many times, but it reached a point I’d rather pay twice the amount and not deal with this corporation they never do nothing to reimburse people for their time or headaches.Spirit charges you to breathe in their presence. They have you pick and buy your seat in advance and then I got bumped from the seat I paid for because THEY overbooked the flight by a dozen people. they do not provide any entertainment, they do not provide even a small cup of water - you have to pay for everything. I will never fly Spirit again.I feel like Spirit Airlines is a trash airline. They canceled my flight and could not Even help me book a new flight for the same dateThe experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Boarding in Orlando was not good. Giant mob at the gate, should have been lines.My flight was delayed by two hours which made it so that I would miss my layover flight. I stood in line for customer service for over an hour and when I reached the agent she told me to scan a QR code and it'll give me options. I wasn't offered any help, guidance or compensation, only told that I have options but that I had to figure it all out myself. I was refunded part of the trip and had to buy an expensive same day ticket from another airline in order to get home. I will never fly Frontier again.The confirmation # CK8GNW and my name was not recognized/in Frontier system. I was able to check in on Frintier app so i went to the Frontier ticket agent, at time they told me that my name/ confirmation did not show up as a purchased ticket. I had to purchase a new ticket that cost $289.00 one way.Although an hour and a half early was told by staff at check in they had overbooked and could not check us in for the flight.The crew was delayed because they came on another flight that was delayed due to weather 10pm flight left at 1.30 am The airline made no effort to align alternate crewWorst airline experience. They were rude and kept changing our seats and/or giving our seats away so our family didn’t get to sit with each other. Almost everyone we dealt with at both airports with this airline was rude. The app kept giving us wrong information making things take longer. Dealing with them before TSA can take close to an hour…longer than I’ve ever had to deal with before. Never using this airline again.Seats are uncomfortable but price is good. Guess I can put up with misery for four hours.JetBlue7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Fort Lauderdale to Punta CanaAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsFort Lauderdale (FLL)Punta Cana (PUJ)Cabin class types available on flights from Fort Lauderdale to Punta CanaCabin classes available on flights from Fort Lauderdale to Punta Cana.
