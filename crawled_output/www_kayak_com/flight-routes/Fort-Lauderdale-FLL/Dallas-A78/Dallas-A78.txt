Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.If we are going to have to pay for luggage, make it easier to do. Put something on the app during check-in so I don't need to do it at the kiosk. I've done it twice recently and I ended up having to pay at the desk because something went wrong at the kiosk in Tampa.The price of the tickets isn't matching the flight experience. No matter how long the flight is, you're only getting pretzels. The flight attendants looked unkept and over it.Multiple delays and gate changes. Arrived at final destination 6 hours late. All rental cars had been taken.The movies using Southwest WiFi kept pausing and I had to restart multiple times.First, my flight was a usual flight nothing exceptional or unexpected. Over all it was a normal, good flight! Second, your questionaire is wholly lacking in the proper options to which one can answer a question. Often on short flights, there is no food let alone entertainment so why isn't that reflected in your questionaire? A simple "not applicable" would cover that issue appropriately but no, your form arbitrarily enters an answer based on the initial assessment which normally isn't factual. Until you provide an accurate means of assessing flights, I'll no longer be completing of these unimpressive and misleading assessements. Thank you!Easy to book and to get check in and get on and off.It seems as though the provisions are even less. Although SWA used to be an economy Airline, that isn't really the case anymore. I paid over $700. for a round trip to Denver and I could have flown just about any airline for the price. The drinks are now in a 6-ounce cup and with ice I'm sure a can would fill more than 2 cups. However, I am very proud of SWA for using paper rather than continuing to contribute to the millions of plastic cups being used each day. I've thought of this fr many years and am so glad to see it come to fruition, if not by only SWA so far.Service was great, boarding and exiting went smoothly, and the flight was very pleasant.American almost always Delays flights from Austin to Dallas and back. I cannot believe they have such poor service on this route. I was about to switch to American from Delta, but they gave me enough reasons not to.There's nothing I liked about it. For first off I scheduled this trip two weeks in advance then they delayed my flight which messed up my whole trip. So I scheduled it for the following weekend thinking there won't be a delay and guess what as soon as I got to the airport we said in the airplane on the tarmac for an hour and a half. Not only was it delayed I missed my connecting flight meaning I had to stay the night at Dallas-Fort Worth airport sleeping on the floor. I will tell you this I will never fly American airlines ever again I have had nothing but horrible experience with them and I just throw money at themHaving to reschedule flights a day later, they loaded by luggage on the wrong plane from Little rock now I have to HOPE they deliver it to where im staying like they said would. International flight crew was very disgruntled and not very friendly.The entertainment package was vast and the selections were very current. Keep updating it was great.Great flight. No issues at all. I still think boarding could be more efficient but otherwise, a good experience.4 hours late, including over +1 hour waiting in plane to take off. Baggage left behind too.Our flight was 1.5 hours delayed. There was no weather for the inbound flight, so I don't understand why. This meant a VERY late arrival and only a quick nap before my morning flight.It was very difficult to stretch my knee out and I am very short. I also had a torn tendon in my knee which made it extra uncomfortable anyways. My husband is 6'2" and I can't imagine him flying in that plane.Delayed flight, so I switched fights to SFO to Phoenix , Phoenix to DSM. Excellent service through American AirlinesThe AA app really sucks ... Every flight & connecting flights were delayed over 30 mins. One connecting flight on American Eagle said it was delayed in its arrival ... when it was actually parked across from the gate for over 1 hr before they pulled it to the gate. Seats in the economy/ main cabin are packed together like sardines ... no leg room.I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.I will use spirit more New clean aircraft Excellent crew ! Quick boarding process !The flight was delayed be over 3 hours. I tried to get a refund for Vivian Kirby and my session kept being stopped. I was NEVER able to finish the prosses...after 2 hours of attempting.For the minimalist experience, it is really a great ride-- feels a little like public transport i guessThis gate agents are always so rude! I stopped flirting with spirit years ago for that reason I thought it would change by now. It’s so tacky they try to treat you like a school child i hate itFlight was on time and was not crowded. Flight attendants were very understanding of my wife’s back problems.It amaze me how other airlines leave on time and Spirit always have some type of delay. I’ve flown with Spirit many times, but it reached a point I’d rather pay twice the amount and not deal with this corporation they never do nothing to reimburse people for their time or headaches.Easy boarding and good flight. Need to work on the beverage and snack situationSpirit charges you to breathe in their presence. They have you pick and buy your seat in advance and then I got bumped from the seat I paid for because THEY overbooked the flight by a dozen people. they do not provide any entertainment, they do not provide even a small cup of water - you have to pay for everything. I will never fly Spirit again.why's KAYAK involved? why'd Spirit charge me $19.72 on Apr 28 and $4.49 on May 1 ? And ironically my credit card had to be cancelled after trip due to a bogus charge, wonder if using it on the plane enabled a scammer to get it.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Boarding in Orlando was not good. Giant mob at the gate, should have been lines.baggage clamed had to wait over a hour and half for all people on my flight it was terribleMy flight was canceled I was promised a reginf still not received.My flight was delayed by two hours which made it so that I would miss my layover flight. I stood in line for customer service for over an hour and when I reached the agent she told me to scan a QR code and it'll give me options. I wasn't offered any help, guidance or compensation, only told that I have options but that I had to figure it all out myself. I was refunded part of the trip and had to buy an expensive same day ticket from another airline in order to get home. I will never fly Frontier again.The confirmation # CK8GNW and my name was not recognized/in Frontier system. I was able to check in on Frintier app so i went to the Frontier ticket agent, at time they told me that my name/ confirmation did not show up as a purchased ticket. I had to purchase a new ticket that cost $289.00 one way.Although an hour and a half early was told by staff at check in they had overbooked and could not check us in for the flight.The crew was delayed because they came on another flight that was delayed due to weather 10pm flight left at 1.30 am The airline made no effort to align alternate crewSouthwest8.0American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Fort Lauderdale to DallasAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsFort Lauderdale (FLL)Cabin class types available on flights from Fort Lauderdale to DallasCabin classes available on flights from Fort Lauderdale to Dallas.
