Internet would stop working during flight.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.If we are going to have to pay for luggage, make it easier to do. Put something on the app during check-in so I don't need to do it at the kiosk. I've done it twice recently and I ended up having to pay at the desk because something went wrong at the kiosk in Tampa.Everything was on time. I was disappointed by the front section female, African American flight attendant. I did not see her name tag or would have identified by name not race. As passengers moved to the bathroom early in flight, she would say with a disdainful tone “I have to say the seat belt light is on” then go back to her book. Better trained flight attendants say something like be careful the seat belt light is on.The price of the tickets isn't matching the flight experience. No matter how long the flight is, you're only getting pretzels. The flight attendants looked unkept and over it.WiFi on the flight was not working. Thus, entertainment options were limited.Flight was awfully bumpy and landing was a bit jolting. I was in the restroom when snacks and drinks were served and was not asked if i wanted any. I had to ask for water finally.Crew was great flight was great baggage claim was a failure. It took over 1 hour for bags to arrive. Poor communication poor effort when I spoke to the supervisor about the delayPlanes are aged. The wifi is unreliable and on many fights, no-existent. The flight attendants were very good.I had a wonderful flight, but the only thing that annoyed me was how crowded TSA was. I still believe airports and all planes work together to bunch everyone together to drive up cost.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.Overall, it was good. I was seating next to a wonderful lady and did not notice how time flew. ThanksThis is the best united airlines flight that I took. The crew was very friendly and the food was tasty!It is clear that someone knew, and competent, is in charge of food at United Airlines at least for the international flights. I was flying in coach, but the choices of the dinner were excellent. Tasty, and appropriate size. I had the beef, which was a little bit like a shepherds pie, and it was good. Nothing comparable has been served on a United flight in years. It will not be confused with three star food, but it is very good for airline food. Even better was the breakfast choice between a cinnamon roll and a breakfast sandwich. I chose the breakfast sandwich which was absolutely delicious and which I would happily order again at my local Starbucks or Panera. It is clear that someone knew indifferent is in charge of the food and it’s about time.Had one staff that was not pleasant. Seems they are stressed with too many people to care for.I would have liked an opportunity to move to a different seat ( even would have checked in my hand luggage)as I had health issues where I didn't have to clamber over the passenger next to me to for toilet use/ movement [ She was a highly unpleasant neighbor to sit next to]. In addition, I found that my European phone plan had run out of data and so I was not receiving emails from yourselves on airport wifi to be able to check in online and verifications difficult as did not accept the ticket number I had. I asked for an extra blanket but was told there was none. Then I saw other passengers receiving them. I couldn't eat the food and asked for snacks : Stewardess said " on the way" but they did not bring. The best bit was the check in process in Lisbon. Very efficient. However, I did not understand why we had to collect our bags at Washington then go through customs again. It was not explained. I also with my leg and health issue had approximately mile walk to the gate ( which then changed) . There appeared to be no moving walkways or help provided.The attendant were friendly. I suggest you have a medical attendant on board every flight so that in case someone is sick , he/she will help them.We had a very long diversion and our food voucher didn’t work because the restaurants were closedUnited airlines, mediocre at best. No issues , nothing great . Worked for meTurbulent taking off & landing to Dulles from Raleigh. Flight from Dulles to Tokyo very good!!After we'd boarded , they canceled the flight. The crew didn't even know , we just all received text messages. Then after they deplaned us , AA was just like "too bad, go F your self, we sure ain't gonna help you"Initial flight was cancelled at the time of arrival to the airport, flight alternative requires switching from direct to flight with a layover, and the plane felt like it would split apart, it was so rattle-y.Weather delay for 2.5 hours followed by half hour crew delay, did not have ginger ale, uncomfortable seatsIt was nobody’s fault - but the plane came 4-hrs late and we were updated randomly in 20-30 mins increments which left us hostage to sit and wait expectantly. It was very long and got very late. Our plane didn’t land until nearly 1 am! Also the toilet wasn’t working. The hosts were nice enough but were clearly “about to pass out” as one told me. Lastly, there was no snack or even time for it. Just a bad experience overall.Crew professional. Easy bag drop off. On time. Good entertainment.The boarding crew was incredibly helpful getting me on an earlier flightThey have lost any customer service care and support. Terrible airline now and been for awhile.Great experience. Flight boarded easily. Departed early. Smooth flight. Great arrival in DC--almost no taxing! Almost direct to gate from runway. Crew was terrific. Same cookies and beverages in main cabin. I did not use the entertainment system on this flight.Flight delayed on both ends - have a gate ready at DCA, don't make us sit for 30min after being late to take off as well.AA can't control the weather. But the airplane was hot and stuffy while stuck on the runway with a broken entertainment system.very difficult boarding process - aggressive passengers not the friendliest crewWiFi was not eorkig (again) And the plane was from 1990 with the screens which were.not touch and most didn’t even work and if lucky could tune in tvIt was great. I had never flown on JetBlue before, but would be very happy to fly with them in the future.The captain gave good announcements and the flight attendants were friendly. The WiFi was pretty good. The plane itself looked very old inside and the seats were very uncomfortable. The screens in the seat backs were the smallest I’ve ever seen. There were so many loud and obnoxious kids on this flight and the parents didn’t do much to try to quiet them down. Some had videos and games on tablets with higher than necessary volume going the whole time.Spend hours delayed with no food, water anything sitting on the aieplane with no ability to eat or use the restroom. My entire experience was the absolute worst. I will never fly jet Blue again.It would have been nice if they had offered more than one set of snacksFlight was delayed several 3 hours - no reason was given and no communication what so ever.No overhead baggage room even though I was seated in row 2. Consequently had to check in my carry on bag. Baggage carousel was jammed. Took 45 min to get my bag.Cancelled flight with no specific instructions to get a boarding pass for another flight. The whole flight of people were in line for an hour because there was only 1 person to help at the desk. This was unusual for JetBlue.Except for the 28 minute delay leaving and the earlier reschedule to a later takeoff time the flight was good.I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.I will use spirit more New clean aircraft Excellent crew ! Quick boarding process !The flight was delayed be over 3 hours. I tried to get a refund for Vivian Kirby and my session kept being stopped. I was NEVER able to finish the prosses...after 2 hours of attempting.For the minimalist experience, it is really a great ride-- feels a little like public transport i guessThis gate agents are always so rude! I stopped flirting with spirit years ago for that reason I thought it would change by now. It’s so tacky they try to treat you like a school child i hate itFlight was on time and was not crowded. Flight attendants were very understanding of my wife’s back problems.It amaze me how other airlines leave on time and Spirit always have some type of delay. I’ve flown with Spirit many times, but it reached a point I’d rather pay twice the amount and not deal with this corporation they never do nothing to reimburse people for their time or headaches.Spirit charges you to breathe in their presence. They have you pick and buy your seat in advance and then I got bumped from the seat I paid for because THEY overbooked the flight by a dozen people. they do not provide any entertainment, they do not provide even a small cup of water - you have to pay for everything. I will never fly Spirit again.why's KAYAK involved? why'd Spirit charge me $19.72 on Apr 28 and $4.49 on May 1 ? And ironically my credit card had to be cancelled after trip due to a bogus charge, wonder if using it on the plane enabled a scammer to get it.I love Spirit. New aircraft, great cabin service, the airfares are low cost which helps me visit my hospitalized daughter anytime I can without paying a fortune.Southwest8.0United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2JetBlue7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Everything you need to know for your flight from Fort Lauderdale to Washington, D.C.AirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsFort Lauderdale (FLL)Cabin class types available on flights from Fort Lauderdale to Washington, D.C.Cabin classes available on flights from Fort Lauderdale to Washington, D.C..
