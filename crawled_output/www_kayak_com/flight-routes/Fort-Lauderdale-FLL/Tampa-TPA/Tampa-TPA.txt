Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.If we are going to have to pay for luggage, make it easier to do. Put something on the app during check-in so I don't need to do it at the kiosk. I've done it twice recently and I ended up having to pay at the desk because something went wrong at the kiosk in Tampa.The quality of Southwest Airlines continues to degrade each time I fly with them. If it were not for the free luggage, I would probably choose another airline. Their prices are a little bit competitive, but way too high for the quality of the service. Southwest is not unique in this way. Domestic flight in the United States of America has continued to be a lower and lower quality product. Very sad when you compare the quality of domestic airlines to that of many international airlines around the world.Everything was on time. I was disappointed by the front section female, African American flight attendant. I did not see her name tag or would have identified by name not race. As passengers moved to the bathroom early in flight, she would say with a disdainful tone “I have to say the seat belt light is on” then go back to her book. Better trained flight attendants say something like be careful the seat belt light is on.I'm not a fan of Southwest's model. I don't like the herding style of boarding.It is southwest seat was ok. Not the most comfortable seatThe price of the tickets isn't matching the flight experience. No matter how long the flight is, you're only getting pretzels. The flight attendants looked unkept and over it.Plz don't take away free bags and free seatingWiFi on the flight was not working. Thus, entertainment options were limited.The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.It is clear that someone knew, and competent, is in charge of food at United Airlines at least for the international flights. I was flying in coach, but the choices of the dinner were excellent. Tasty, and appropriate size. I had the beef, which was a little bit like a shepherds pie, and it was good. Nothing comparable has been served on a United flight in years. It will not be confused with three star food, but it is very good for airline food. Even better was the breakfast choice between a cinnamon roll and a breakfast sandwich. I chose the breakfast sandwich which was absolutely delicious and which I would happily order again at my local Starbucks or Panera. It is clear that someone knew indifferent is in charge of the food and it’s about time.Flight attendant in first class gave poor service (like he didn't want to be there) and food was awful. We sat waiting for gate upon arrival over 45 mins.This is for UA2274 from Houston to Sacramento. The flight was delayed arriving due to mechanical issues so we left about 3 hours later than scheduled. When boarding the plane the temperature inside was excessive - likely close to 100. Pilot apologized and said it was going to improve at altitude, which it did. But before that I honestly thought there might have been more delays removing passengers made ill from the heat. We were delayed leaving due to another mechanical issue. There was not water on the plane due to a panel that was not secured. They did that quickly, but the combination of mechanical issues was rather disturbing and did not reflect well on United.Terrible. Delayed 7 hours, and cancelled the flight, leaving me stranded and out of pocket $500 for an alternative last minute flightI liked the choice of lemon ginger tea. I think stewardesses can be more considerate of older people needs.I love flying with United. Unfortunately, I flew on an older plane with minimal upgraded technology (no Bluetooth functionality or handy charging ports). Otherwise, the flight was great and even arrived early.They changed my seats after I checked in and I was stressed from the time I saw that information until just before boarding, when the gate attendant fixed it, but it shouldn't have happened. And if it couldn't be prevented, then the people on the phone I spoke with should have done something to help, which they did not, nor did they offer me compensation, just meaningless apologies.My flight was delayed a very short period of time but they did not hold my connecting flight to San Diego, also through United. So they closed the doors before we got off our plane. They would only have to help the door open for another five to ten minutes. So I missed a court deadline for a manditory mediation settlement conference for my client. I had to get an associate to be there in person and be on the phone with him relaying what he needs to do the entire time. The court was very upset with me and so was my client. United cannot be trusted.Smooth flight, especially take off and landing, and great crew on board. Really loved the stroopwaffles!Everything was great. I liked the text updates so that I never miss a gate change & I have all the latest info.It was great. I had never flown on JetBlue before, but would be very happy to fly with them in the future.My JetBlue experience was nice. The flights ran on time, the aircraft was clean and comfortable, and the flight attendants were attentive. My only issue, which is isolated to the low-cost (budget) option at JetBlue, is that the check in process makes the user feel that they have to buy their seats. The seats offered for purchase are upgrades from the budget seats you get (which are essentially the last seats remaining). The interface should not make it feel like you must purchase a seat.I especially liked the lead crew officer. His boarding and safety announcements were made with a bit of novelty and humor. The flight also left the gate 10 minutes early and we landed about 20 minutes early… It was a delightful flight…Communication since no reason or explanation was given for 3 hrs delayExcellent. Although they used to greet me as a mosaic member and provide a free drink, early boarding helps me to keep coming back to JetBlue.Except for the 28 minute delay leaving and the earlier reschedule to a later takeoff time the flight was good.Loved the leg room and tvs screens on the seats and free WiFi. Wish the price was lower and could save by rebookingIt took 1-1/2 hours to get our luggage after we landed. That to me is unacceptableThe flight was delayed for 4 hours. Once onboard the crew was wonderful.Don't board the plane and have us sit for 2 hours and go nowhere!I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.I will use spirit more New clean aircraft Excellent crew ! Quick boarding process !The flight was delayed be over 3 hours. I tried to get a refund for Vivian Kirby and my session kept being stopped. I was NEVER able to finish the prosses...after 2 hours of attempting.For the minimalist experience, it is really a great ride-- feels a little like public transport i guessThis gate agents are always so rude! I stopped flirting with spirit years ago for that reason I thought it would change by now. It’s so tacky they try to treat you like a school child i hate itFlight was on time and was not crowded. Flight attendants were very understanding of my wife’s back problems.It amaze me how other airlines leave on time and Spirit always have some type of delay. I’ve flown with Spirit many times, but it reached a point I’d rather pay twice the amount and not deal with this corporation they never do nothing to reimburse people for their time or headaches.Spirit charges you to breathe in their presence. They have you pick and buy your seat in advance and then I got bumped from the seat I paid for because THEY overbooked the flight by a dozen people. they do not provide any entertainment, they do not provide even a small cup of water - you have to pay for everything. I will never fly Spirit again.why's KAYAK involved? why'd Spirit charge me $19.72 on Apr 28 and $4.49 on May 1 ? And ironically my credit card had to be cancelled after trip due to a bogus charge, wonder if using it on the plane enabled a scammer to get it.TERRIBLE. Cancelled my flight one month before my trip. Have not received my refund back.Airline is in bankrupt and they didn't communicate it to customersThe outgoing flight tpa to fll was seriously delayed due to a frontal system impacting the incoming flight from key west. Weather is not under the control of the airline, better to arrive late than never! Thank you Silver Airways for your caution.They canceled the flight and no longer fly out of Orlando. Trying to get my money refunded. Lost a night I paid for in Key West.There was no serving off food on the flight being that it was so short.The flight was VERY, VERY hot and the blowers weren't cooling it off...don't know what the problem was, but.....otherwise it was fine.My flight from Avianca was 45 minutes late and it's very complicated to recheck in in ...also I have to say the silver desk folks were neither efficient nor helpful...so I missed my connecting flight. I actually got there before tge flight left but they refused to let me on....and gave me no vouchers for hotel etcThe cancelled our flight 3 times and we never made it to our destination. Every single airplane had a maintenance problem. Never fly this airline9 hrs wait in airport then flt redirected to airport an hour away from our booked airport. Then at 8:00pm flight Cancelled. Silver supposed to book us on American the next day. Booked my husband but not me. Cost me Ubers, hotel, meals, new ticket and 1 hour taxi Cuz no flights to our home airport. Absolute disaster. Silver staff had no idea what was going on or what to do. Never Again SilverNothing about this flight was good. They are always cancelling or grossly delayed. We were delayed for 45 minutes for no apparent reason with no explanation or anything we could see and I missed my connection to Durham NC. I was on my way to my best friends memorial and funeral. Now I'll missed them both!!Southwest8.0United Airlines7.4JetBlue7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Silver Airways5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Fort Lauderdale to TampaAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsFort Lauderdale (FLL)Tampa (TPA)Cabin class types available on flights from Fort Lauderdale to TampaCabin classes available on flights from Fort Lauderdale to Tampa.
