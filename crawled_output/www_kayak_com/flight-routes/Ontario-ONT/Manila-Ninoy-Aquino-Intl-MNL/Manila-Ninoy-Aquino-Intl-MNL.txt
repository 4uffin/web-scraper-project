Very clean plane and food was good!I was unable to select decent seats, and so I was stuck in the middle seat because it was selected for meThere was a lot of partial tv shows but not enough to last the flight. The food was incredible! The crew were so helpful and patient. Lots more space than what I usually get on an international flight. Very comfortable!Stingy on the drinks - 15 hour direct flight and could barely get attention for some waterNot many people, so you can lay down on two seatsThe delay in Korea was a pain and set us back a day. I have to give big props to Korean Air for setting up a hotel with dinner and transportation to and from the hotel. I also needed assistance with a wheelchair and they did an outstanding job.Great except for the delay in Korea. Korean Air did a great job setting up a hotel for the night. I also needed assistance with a wheelchair and they were outstanding.The flight was uneventful and the crew was kind and professional. Really appreciate the option to order a vegan meal for the flight!I love my Delta crew, they were so welcoming and helpful.I absolutely loved my flight from Taipei to LAX. I was originally assigned to a different seat, however one of the stewardess noticed I was uncomfortable in my seat. She offered to move me to a more comfortable setting. Although she didn’t have to do what she did, I am more than grateful and thankful for her doing so. My longer flight felt much more comfortable, just by her taking notice. I really appreciate her.Overall was a lovely experience. The crew were kind and courteous throughout the entire flight.Better organization of boarding procedures. Terrible leadership guiding people to gates.They need to improve on how the plane lands cause it was not smooth at all.I did not like how the plane landed. It was not smooth.Been flying with China Airline over years many times. Good experience with them, no issues.China Airlines crews are very excellent doing their job. Very friendly and hardworking. I will always choose China Airlines over and over. Thank you all for making my flight comfortable. God bless to all the staff. :)Most relaxing long distance flight I have been on. And I have flown on many.Better screens, it would have been nice to have more comfortable seats.2nd major delay due to maintenance issues. 1st delay missed my connecting flight.It was great, but my bag was not loaded onto the connecting flight. I'm currently getting it resolved. If this isn't a problem, everything else was excellent.The aircraft was massive (A-380) and became crowded with 400+ passengers on board.My luggage didn’t arrive with my flight. Flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours while we sat on the plane and I almost missed my connecting flight and subsequently missed the last train from the airport so it took me another 2 hours to get to my destination after arriving, Crew skipped me several times when offering beverages, and I couldn’t get their attention at times because they wouldn’t even make eye contact with me. They didn’t give me a form for disembarking so I had to go to the back of the line after waiting an eternity for immigration. Paid for on flight wi- fi that didn’t work for most of the flight.Love flying Asiana. Been using it for over a decade now.The staff was courteous and the flight was very smooth. It was so nice to see the captain greeting the passengers at the end of the flights.The beefsteak on the lunch menu was excellent! I usually do not eat airplane food. I loved it.Flight was too cold. I wore a regular cotton tee and it wasn’t enough. It was a night time flight so I would have thought a blanket would be provided to passengers. A 4 hour flight and no options for a meal? I flew Asiana the next day from Seoul to Manilla. Same duration, 4 hours. They give everyone a pillow and blanket and serve a meal. Why is United so cheap and holding back meals and amenities? Also, they promote too much gay stuff and DEI in their advertisements. Please be mindful of other beliefs and don’t shove your gay ideology down my throat.It was amazing. I was not expecting the phenomenal customer service Asiana provides.We had to deboard 2 times due to maintenance issues. They changed the plane, and then we got deviated to LAX due to maibtenance issues on the other plane, had to sleep at LAX and los a full day.From the first moment you interact with United Airlines, you can expect nothing less but extreme frustration. The baggage handler at the bag drop seems completely unbothered by the presence of customers waiting in line. No help was extended to load the baggage whatsoever. And if any of your bags is overweight by 0.01 pound they will make you re-distribute everything in your suitcase just to play power trip. When it was time to board no help was extended to customers to locate their seats. Moreover. It was a chaotic mess at the gate when it was unclear who should board first and everyone just bunched up, trying to get on the plane. I am sure the crew was doing their best to perform their jobs while being paid their wages however it shouldn’t be that hard to smile once or twice when you’re in the business if serving customers. It is a shame for the United States of America to have a flagship carrier of such low caliber. Our flight was also delayed by about an hour and a half due to further delays prior to our inbound flight. Being someone who has travelled for both business and leisure in Asia, Europe, and South America I have never experienced such poor quality of service.I understand stuff happens, but plane failures are likely due to lack of maintenance. Additionally, air conditioning wasn't working, no snack/drink service, no WiFi. Fortunately, the crew was communicative and light-hearted. United grabbed another plane and we were able to get to our destination.The pilots were late and it made us 1 hour late. The meat was tough and bok choy was also tough.Stuck on tarmac for two hours plus a 5.5 hour flight. Rude flight attendant. And no meals, not even for purchase!I learned that seating towards the end of plane that a line forms for the restroom and people use your chair as a hand railing, bumping your seat consistently. I was seated in the aisle. I think that next time if I am towards the back row I would want to sit in the middle or window seat.The best airline I have ever travel , really good customer service, attention and service !!United sent me a mileage plus number last year but that number is invalid so I can’t use it to check into flights or collect mileage. There is human to speak about the problem, only computers who keep asking me if I am using the correct email. It’s so frustrating and I cannot resolve it.Not a great experience. We paid for the upgrade for premium economy seats and seated ourselves in very comfortable seats. Someone came along with the same seat on their boarding pass. The aircraft had been changed and as a result we were booted out and sent further back to small uncomfortable seats. After complaining we were moved to emergency row seats, which gave us more leg room but the seats don’t recline. For people in our 70’s we found having to sit upright from California to NJ very uncomfortable. Not sure why they chose to move senior citizens instead of the two people that were allowed to take the more comfortable seats. Not happy.Everything was great. Only thing that could’ve made it better was buy on board options for hot food, but the snacks were decent. The flight attendants were great. I had no complaints. I was able to make it to my destination safelyIt’s sad how legacy airlines feel like budget airlines now. Cramped space Non reclining seats No inflight entertainment (need to connect via your own device) Saving grace is the crew. Truly nice and sincere service.Short flight with limited entertainment wasn't that bad. Staff was friendly and plane was clean. Meal was good.It was great! The flight was on time and had a smoother flightCrew excellent calling me by name ! Only downside was no inflight WiFiI was glad that the plane was not totally full.Boarding and flying on time is the most important need of passengers they did thatEverything was very good but seats are small for a big man!Well, I needed to make a change to my flight and I called the airline and they said yes no problem $700 and we can do that and I agreed to it so they canceled my tickets and went to rebook and came back after being on hold for an hour and a half and said I’m sorry, sir. There was an error. It is $2800 Now and I said never mind. I will just use those flights and she proceeded to tell me that they already canceled them because I said I was interested in doing the change. I told her yes for $700. I was fine with doing a change but not $2800 so give me my tickets back and she proceeded to tell me that she could not do that and I had to pay the $2800 to get my tickets back that I already spent $2800 on. So I had to book tickets on another airline to get home And that cost a lot of money too. I’m a little pissed off at Philippine airline right now because of what they did to me and I’m not sure I ever wanna fly with them again. I’ve flown with them plenty in the past, but this just really put a bad taste in my mouth.. Not to mention on my way there leaving Seattle going to Vancouver. I got to the airport three hours in advance and they had booked me through Alaska Airlines to do that little trip. My connecting flight would leave about six hours after I got to Vancouver BC. I stood in Alaska Airlines lying for a little over two hours and then they proceeded to tell me that they couldn’t check me in because I wasn’t there an hour in advance. I kept telling the lady at the beginning of the line that I was afraid they were not gonna let me in because it was taking so long and she said oh don’t worry about it. You’re fine you’ve got time. Well I ended up spending $600 to get to Canada that night just to make my connecting flight because Alaska air wouldn’t do anything and Filipino Air told me it was Alaska air problem but Alaska air said since you booked through Philippine air, we can’t fix it. I had about 50 minutes to make my flight, but they refused to check me in because I wasn’t there an hour in advance yet. I’ve been standing in their line for about two hours and 15 minutes.reach the standard, crew tried to fix up issues fast.Overall the flight was a good experience. It is different from American Airlines because they board the back of the plane first rather than the front first. Food was decent. They gave out pillows ,blankets , and face masks. I did find this airline had faster flights back home than others.
