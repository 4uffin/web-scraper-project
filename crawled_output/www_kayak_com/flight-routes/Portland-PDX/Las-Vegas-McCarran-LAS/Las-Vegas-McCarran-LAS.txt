Not a fan of no seat selection on line. I had to consult gate agent each time to change seats on flights with lots of open seats. This cannot possibly be cost effective for airline. On plus side, Alaska seat legroom seemed larger than American. nsI appreciated that the staff went out of the way to make sure I was taken care of.Staff inside Portland terminal were rude, made us fell rushed and not at all accommodating to seniors. For this alone I will probably never booked from them again.It was fine—the seats are not very comfortable and the aisles are very narrow. Nothing different from other airlinesI booked a round trip. I ordered a lunch going and a lunch for the return but got both lunches going. Could have been my error. Both lunches were good.Well the flight being delayed multiple time really was frustrating. But the crew and flight was good.generally good. No snacks or drinks on the flight 3379 from Portland to San Jose, CA. Sad.Everything except for the lack of a choice of the snack provided was great.Seats extremely uncomfortable, no entertainment, no snacks, and when boarding, half of the passengers needed to check in the carry on luggage without any explanation.I wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.First class ticket. They ran out of food and I sat hungry watching the others eatThey we able to seat my companion and I next to each other. Plane’s temperature was very cool. Willl be more prepared on return trip.All was good and they were able to seat my travel companion next to me. Thank you.Like the ample leg room. May as well not bother with snacks if it's only a two ounce bag of pretzels. Didn't use the entertainment option. Was there one?What an amazing flight. I haven’t experienced this level of service in a flight in years. This will be the only way to fly to Hawaii for me in the future.Kayak sold me a ticket after check in time. Could not check in. Could not get on flight.Love you guys are so friendly and kind and wonderfulAgents talk too fast over intercom. I know it’s memorized and we’ve all heard it before. Just slow down a little. Stop charging for checked bags. I was pleased to get my bags promptly at each end of my flight.Everything was great except having to check in at Alaska. That was a surprise and took extra time and effort. Should have been explained somewhere maybe on the HA electronic ticket.It was clean and the crew was great. I wish the chairs could recline just a little more and you would provide small pillows for people with bad backs. My back is fused and a little support would be great.Spirit Airlines was ok but TRAVELHELPDESK, the 3rd party travel agent IS A JOKE! VERY RUDE CUSTOMER AGENTS ont he phone. NO HELP AT ALL. But the airlines was ok.The staff was very very rude in Las Vegas when boarding the flight. When presenting the boarding ticket. Las Vegas flight, it was hot and stuffy, it smelled really bad.Unbelievable check in horrible. Asked to print tickets at the gate after a delaycheck in at security was a hassle being scanned. Spirit employees were helpful and professional.I liked how cheap it was but both my flights were delayed heavilyIt was okay delay was long but I made itI have never flown Spirit it was much better than anticipated!Staff was very friendly. They attended to people nicely and reprimanded, in a professional way, to those who wouldn’t listen. AC wasn’t working on the flight waiting to depart in Burbank, so it was uncomfortable for a while since the flight was delayed but then better before take off.Good on that leg. When I arrived in Detroit I had to wait over an hour for luggage.The crew was very nice. I would like to see them offer basic refreshments just like a soda and pretzels, etc. for free.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Alaska Airlines8.0Southwest8.0Hawaiian Airlines7.8Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Portland to Las VegasAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Portland to Las VegasFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Portland to Las Vegas according to KAYAK users.
