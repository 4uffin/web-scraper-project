For this alone I will probably never booked from them again.It was fine—the seats are not very comfortable and the aisles are very narrow. Nothing different from other airlinesWell the flight being delayed multiple time really was frustrating. But the crew and flight was good.generally good. No snacks or drinks on the flight 3379 from Portland to San Jose, CA. Sad.Everything except for the lack of a choice of the snack provided was great.I like the friendliness of the staff. The food choices were OK. I wish there was more options. The entertainment through the movie portal was alright.There was a very drunk man behind me who kept talking loudly to no one in particular. He was slurring his words and at times he didn’t know where we were going or whether or not we landed. He was also loudly using a lot of profanity. The attendants didn’t seem to notice or care and in fact continued to serve him alcohol. He was allowed to purchase 4 little bottles.At the Portland airport, Alaska Airlines has put in a system where you have to create your own bag tag, then put your own suitcase onto a scale to weigh it. The day we were there, the system was not working properly, and we kept on being told to go onto different lines so it took us approximately 45 minutes to check our bag in. I do not work for the airlines why am I subjected to doing this? How all these companies are shifting their work onto people who have paid good money for their products is crazy. And then the system that the customers are supposed to use don't work properly..I liked Alaska better than other carriers that I have EVER used. Unfortunately, the plane from LAX to Guanacaste leg of my journey had some mechanical problems and had to return to LAX - causing my journey to be very long and added a day to my total trip. The Airline was very prompt in offering their apology and have given me credit to use for my next flight. I thought the terminal in LAX was too cold for comfort, especially if there is a long wait between flights.I'm a platinum member with American Airlines, however, my ticket did not display status and thus I did not board with an early group. I traveled with my two daughters and we were given a row of seats that did not recline. Not the treatment I would have expected for a platinum customer. The flight was also a bit late leaving Portland. Also on my flight to Portland we were not given premium seats. In fact, we were in the last row of the aircraft.The flight crew was friendly. I tried to adjust my seat online ahead of time but no option existed without additional fees. My friend asked at the gate about a seat change and was able to make it happen. That was great! The flight crew moved a very tall gentleman and his companion which allowed us to have more space which was nice. Overall, good experience. Appreciated the blanket and pillow.I was uncomfortably cold on the plane. Other than that it was uneventful and therefore as enjoyable as a plane ride can be.Food was surprisingly good but the WiFi was not greatMy flight was extremely cold. I had a jacket and a cover was left in each seat. The cover was extremely thin and I have a disability, fibromyalgia and arthrithis and AC air is the worst. I closed my vent and my husbands vent and it still was frigid. I asked the attendant if I could get another cover and she quickly almost dismissively and totally unconcerned stating, (I quote) (one per chair) and walked off so quickly that I didn't get a chance to explain to her that I literally have adisability. I didnt want to make a seen so I set on that flight for over 5 hours in pain, joints locking up and extremely uncomfortable. When my fibromyalgia flares up my joints not only ache but they will lock up also and it takes me days to get back to my regular self even though I take medication for it. I felt like it would not have hurt anyone at all for her to just give me an extra cover because I'm sure they have all types of medical issues in people that fly every day.Not a "Delta" issue, but a JFK issue: We booked a connecting flight with 3 1/2 hours between to clearn immigration and customs. Our inbound flight (BCN to JFK) was on the taxiway 45 minutes which ate into our layover time. Immigtration was insanely quick with the CBP MPC app; however, clearing TSA (again, after we were ALREADY cleared in Spain on the inbound international flight) took over 95 minutes. This left us with 10 minutes before boarding the connecting flight (JFK to SAN) to walk to the far end of Terminal 4 and try to find food. We didn't find any food that could promise to serve us in under 10 minutes so we boarded the Delta flight after coming off a plance and an 8-hour flight knowing that we wouldn't be served any food on the next 5 1/2 hour flight. I feel like Delta needs to put pressure on the JFK TSA to open more screening stations (by our count, we saw only 5 scanners open and a line of - as we said - over 90 minutes. The insult is that we WERE ALREADY SCREENED through TSA, but as you come off one flight into the USA, you have to go through the whole process again. It seems like if you have a connecting flight, there should be a way to pass through immigration and customs without needing to return through TSA.There are 4 flights in consecutive gates with about the same departure time. Two flights were boarding at the same time. One was delayed or boarding would be happening at the same time. I am not sure what Delta and LAX need to do to have a better layout at the end of Terminal 25 hours of delay that could've been much shorter if Delta had taken the 1 hour delay they imposed on the flight before boarding to run any of the plane checks required for flight to find the hydraulic issue that required nearly 3 hours to fix. $24 of meal credit buys a sandwich and a soft drink. Poor communication within the terminal about what gate we'd be re-boarding from and when we'd be re-boarding.The entertainment and wifi mostly didn't work on this flight.Terrible entertainment system - kept freezing and audio kept cutting out. Snacks were mediocre at best for a 5 hour flight.I am still upset that my bag was lost on a recent trip to Rome ; we were inconvenienced and out €150 Euros ; delta has refused to reimburse usThe stewardess hit me with the food kart twice on the head and didn't say I'm sorry once. The same stewardess gave me a warm Apple Juice with No ice. The Flight was delayed for Departure 6 times, starting from 2:36pm, finally taking off 7:50pm. I was late picking up my child from the sitter by 3 hours.Did not get the seat I selected and paid for.There is no room, no gluten free options, or any free internet/entertainment. You have to bring your own tablet or smartphone because there are no screens.American Airlines is a mediocre airlines: they do not maintain the highest standard of cleanliness in the cabins, and the food is not well thought out. Service is not at top of mind compared to other international airlines such as Singapore Airlines, JAL or others.Boarding gate in Honolulu was staffed with a great clerk with a soothing voice despite the flight delay of over an hour. Flight attendants in the plane were all grumpy, not pleasant looking bunch. Their sour attitude showed throughout the flight. Inly able to get a select few movies started. Most of the movie links in the “free entertainment” did not work.Boarding was very efficient. Everyone got on board and we got on our way very quickly. It was frustrating that the entertainment app was not functioning properly. I was not able to activate some of the movies offered. The crew on this flight appears to be pretty grumpy. They had no smile on their faces. I felt like they were doing us a favor for being there.Loved the staff, boarding and drink options! Wish the comfort of the seat could have been better neverthelessHonestly, I haven’t flown American in years, probably due to the pandemic and my being unable to travel for certain periods in the last two years, but it was a good experience to dig out or obtain a new American Airlines account after many years of traveling for business with American in the past.One bottle of water and a package of cookies for comfort plus. We had to literally beg a flight attendant for an extra bottle of water later in the flight due to feeling dehydrated.Flight boarded from Gate 39 at OGG, the farthest gate in the terminal. There were no Hawaiian themed amenities for the flight. The first class service was mediocre at best; I received not special welcome or recognition as an executive platinum member of American Advantage program. The flight attendants were more concerned with their cell phones than saying "thank you" to the passengers as we disembarked. Fortunately, the flight arrived at LAX a few minutes early.Cancelled my flight last minute and did not help me rebook. It was a horrible experience.Boarding was a breeze, however, two of the flights that I boarded with Spirit did not have Wi-Fi available.Very good. Nothing more or less than expected. No complaints.My experience with the spirit as a first time it was OK, but the seats need a little cushion, the problem I had the most impacted me was when checking in the scales were so off and wrong. It will tell that you would have more weight, which was not true. The scale was say that it had Thirty Eight Pounds, when get in the labels when we send the luggage into the band. It says that it was overweight. I really really dislike that because the scales are not accurate. If I use Spirit and I have that issue again. That will be my last time flying with the spirit, even though I like so much to service the planes, and everything elseWorst airline ever! The guy weighing my bag had his foot on the metal plate and when I called him out on it, I got this stupid little smirk. La is a scam and so is Spirit Airlines. All the flight attendants looked like they hated our flight just as much as we did.Spirit is awful. Too expensive for what you get. Stop nickel and diming.would be great to get basic water, soda at least and stop charging for carry onsYour crew is a representation of your Standards and Values. The crew from Seattle to LAX, was very disappointing. The crew was more interested in hanging out at the lobby area. Talking, laughing loudly and eating all the snacks. They did not do regular rounds to see if customers needed anything. This was a huge disappointment. I will no longer be flying with your airlines moving forward.- flight attendants not very friendly. - Paid for WiFi and plane didn’t have it working , never got a refund.We got to fly on the new airplane. Much better as it’s roomier and cleaner than before. Most Importantly it’s much more comfortable. I still can’t move the seat back but the extra space made up for it. I didn’t taste the food or drinks because they charge for everything so I didn’t bother. I didn’t experience the entertainment because I downloaded my own movies on my phone. The crew was great. The flight itself was smooth . No complaints.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Alaska Airlines8.0Delta7.9American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Portland to Los AngelesAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Portland to Los AngelesFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Portland to Los Angeles according to KAYAK users.
