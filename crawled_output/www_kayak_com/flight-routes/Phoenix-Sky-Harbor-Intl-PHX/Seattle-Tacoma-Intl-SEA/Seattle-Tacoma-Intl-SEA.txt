They made me pay extra to continue flying with them. Their customer service is non-responsive. I used to love Alaska Airlines, but they've definitely regressed.My flight was delayed 2 hours which led me to lose my connection. As a consequence, I had to spend hours changing flights and hotel reservations to arrange my arrival to Vancouver.No Free Wifi and the flight was a tad late.The plane was clean. They got us to the destination. It was very difficult to hear the announcements at the gate. The person was speaking way too quickly, and the sound system did not carry to all parts of the seating area at the gate. The flight left more than an hour late, which left many of the passengers missing connections.The flights left both airports on schedule. The flight from Idaho Falls to Seattle was a typical commuter trip. The flight from Seattle to Maui was not good: It was too long for a flight in a single-aisle plane and too cramped. I kept asking myself if I would ever visit Maui again if airlines continue to run this long flight like a typical short commuter flight. I am not looking forward to the trip home.The chicken salad was very small, the lettuce was wilted and there was no flavor. The hamburger was excellent.Mid flight we were bothered by a bee. Kind of odd, but a bee allergy made it a bit stressful. Attendants passed by our aisle during service multiple times. Otherwise, it was fine.5 1/2 hour flight with no food service or options is inexcusable.Mostly good. Delayed which in my experience so far happens often with Alaska Airlines. Thank you.Excellent overall, but had to wait 30 months while taxiing. In fact, I’m still on the plane now!I wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.Lounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneThree seats in first class were broken and while they were able to still acommodate us it was looking very touch and go and they had others they could not acommodateMechanic delay in addition to a 2 hour change in takeoff time was frustrating.Very accommodating on flight changes when something came up. Definitely felt a notch above other airlines.Had a hard time checking into my flight on my phone because they gave me the wrong confirmation number. Otherwise everything else went well.First class ticket. They ran out of food and I sat hungry watching the others eatThey we able to seat my companion and I next to each other. Plane’s temperature was very cool. Willl be more prepared on return trip.All was good and they were able to seat my travel companion next to me. Thank you.Like the ample leg room. May as well not bother with snacks if it's only a two ounce bag of pretzels. Didn't use the entertainment option. Was there one?What an amazing flight. I haven’t experienced this level of service in a flight in years. This will be the only way to fly to Hawaii for me in the future.Kayak sold me a ticket after check in time. Could not check in. Could not get on flight.Love you guys are so friendly and kind and wonderfulAgents talk too fast over intercom. I know it’s memorized and we’ve all heard it before. Just slow down a little. Stop charging for checked bags. I was pleased to get my bags promptly at each end of my flight.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Alaska Airlines8.0Southwest8.0Delta7.9Hawaiian Airlines7.8Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Sky Harbor Intl to SeattleAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Sky Harbor Intl to SeattleFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Sky Harbor Intl to Seattle according to KAYAK users.
