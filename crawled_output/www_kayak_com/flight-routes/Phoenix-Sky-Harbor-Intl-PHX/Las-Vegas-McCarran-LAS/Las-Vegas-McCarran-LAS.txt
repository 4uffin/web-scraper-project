Very grateful.10.0 ExcellentRobert, Sep 2025SFO - LASRead more Southwest reviewsAs always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.Flight wasn’t even full, but too many carry-ons caused us to run out of bin space. New bag fee has folks who would usually check their bags carrying on. Watching Southwest morph into Spirit/Frontier is so sad to watchFirst time traveling on Southwest since bag fees were implemented. Usual good service. Just more expensive now.Very good. Sad to learn Southwest is going start to charge for bagsGreat flight staff. Ease of boarding. Overall, very uneventful and easy trip.We had a nice flight. Boarding was easy, our seats were comfortable and the on board service was pleasant.I used to fly SWA all the time. I know the crew has their little acts that are often fun, and entertaining. On this flight one of the crew was just not nice. Very surprising.Delayed 4 hours due to mechanical issues. No mention of compensation for being over 3 hours lateCrew was pleasant; flight was on time. Paid extra for early bird check-in and still got B boarding.At time of arrival to the airport, there were plenty of kiosks open/running for checking and baggage tags. While waiting to drop my bag, a team member was checking everyone's IDs against their baggage tag to verify a match/compliance to save additional time when dropping it at the front of the line. This was actually a really big time saver and greatly appreciated! Once boarding was starting, the team member had a clear and audible voice with their announcements, with direct (yet friendly) instructions for the boarding process. Once actually boarding, the flight crew gave genuine greetings while walking on board and were very nice and attentive during the flight. The take-off and landing were one of the smoothest I've had in MANY of years. Kudos to the pilots! I literally cannot remember the last time a had such a smooth landing :DWe will be writing a long, detailed letter to corporate about our awful experience with American airlines.Ring in first class for an overnight flight, there was no blankets nor pillows for first class customers.I didn't like that my paid for seat was changed 2 hours before my flight.Overall, a good experience. The food, however, was subpar. The breakfast was a joke.Very helpful ground crew after an earlier flight delay and being rebooked on a different flight.First world problems, but still… We were seated in first class and asked for a cocktail on a very short, 50 minute flight. After our drink order was taken, a half hour went by, and we noticed that every other person in the small plane had been served except for us. We got up to ask about it, the drinks finally came, then were taken away three minutes later since the flight was so short. Really strange situation, on the other hand, we were in Utah.Boarding took forever, the plane was cramped and cold, and the seatbelt song came on constantly throughout the red eye flight with a loud pre-recorded message playing each timeWonderful crew and early arrival to our destination. It was so nice to have free wifi access and movies too. Thank you!I was a little disappointed of not having an android charger. Only one it was for an iPhone. I've flown American in the past and had access to one.Bigger seats. Board back to front! Disembark front to back!Didn’t like that we weren’t even offered a water. And really didn’t like the male flight attendant, he had major attitude. The flight however was good, pilots got us there in time safely.Spirit Airlines was ok but TRAVELHELPDESK, the 3rd party travel agent IS A JOKE! VERY RUDE CUSTOMER AGENTS ont he phone. NO HELP AT ALL. But the airlines was ok.The staff was very very rude in Las Vegas when boarding the flight. When presenting the boarding ticket. Las Vegas flight, it was hot and stuffy, it smelled really bad.Unbelievable check in horrible. Asked to print tickets at the gate after a delaycheck in at security was a hassle being scanned. Spirit employees were helpful and professional.I liked how cheap it was but both my flights were delayed heavilyIt was okay delay was long but I made itI have never flown Spirit it was much better than anticipated!Staff was very friendly. They attended to people nicely and reprimanded, in a professional way, to those who wouldn’t listen. AC wasn’t working on the flight waiting to depart in Burbank, so it was uncomfortable for a while since the flight was delayed but then better before take off.Good on that leg. When I arrived in Detroit I had to wait over an hour for luggage.Everyone seemed to be in zone 1 for boarding. Maybe break it up a little. Otherwise, smooth flight.Frontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Boarding in Orlando was not good. Giant mob at the gate, should have been lines.The ticketing agents were rude but then we had a great gate agent very nice we had to ride a buss out to where the plane was parked but it was in some back corner of the airport when we got to the plane the captain who was great btw was cleaning the plane because the same rude ticketing agent told them they we not contracted to vacuum the plane. The ride to las Vegas was fine We had a connecting flight to Dallas. The flight was fine but when we arrived in Dallas everyone who flew on any frontier airlines the picked up bags from baggage claim D15 had to wait over a hour for their bags to start we arrived at 11:30pm ish to the gate we didn't leave the baggage clamed till 12:50 am very not happy and i used to fly frontier 4 times a week for work in Denver i will not be using them againI missed a flight because of a delay. I had to buy a new ticket through Southwest.Southwest8.0American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Sky Harbor Intl to Las VegasAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Sky Harbor Intl to Las VegasFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Sky Harbor Intl to Las Vegas according to KAYAK users.
