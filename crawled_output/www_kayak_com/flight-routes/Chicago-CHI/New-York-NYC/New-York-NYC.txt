The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!10.0 ExcellentG, Sep 2025LAS - ATLRead more Southwest reviewsI wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.On this flight I felt the food offering was not as complete as on previous flights. The tomato salad was a bit off and there was nothing additional such a bread or butter. The breakfast was only one option, so you either ate what they had or ate nothing. The crew was efficient, but most seemed frustrated throughout the flight. The flight arrived early and was obstacle-free, so I’m overall quite happy, but the shine in the rest of the experience just wasn’t there.Great flight with Delta! Boarding was quick and easy, the amenities were solid, and the plane was in great shape. The flight attendants had a fun, lively energy while staying professional. All in all, a smooth trip — even managed to catch up on some rest. Thanks, Delta!De planning was an absolute mess. We were never told that we weren’t at the gate and that we had to go down unstable stairs and then hop on a bus. People were falling, we couldn’t tell who was in charge. Overall terrible communication that ended up leaving a bad impression at the very end of the experience.For a 69 year old with health problems I had the worse experience, no wheelchair when I entered a lady told me to sit and wait while a gentleman told me I had to walk to the Delta station, which I did. I had a carry on and a bag, and I was traveling with my service dog, which was on his carrier and the lady charged me for my carry on luggage, beside all the waiting cause of the delay, I had to walk to get my luggage cause no wheelchair showed up, I am so disappointed. I will get in touch with the company. I got home at 3:00 am, not good for my health situation.The crew was amazing; Von, Vera and Guadalupe were very friendly and attentive throughout the entire flight. They were friendly and welcoming to everyone. A solid and dedicated team for sure!Terrible. I was bumped off of my original flight and spent the next six days fighting to get back on it. I lost hours of my vacation trying to get this situation corrected.Our flight was canceled after several delays. No hotel vouchers offered, minimal help for resolution leave me ultimately to cancel and book on an other airline. Then waited to get bags for more than 3 hours This whole experience has been awful!!!My flight was canceled after being rescheduled for four days canceling my trip. Kayak and everyone affiliated with it I.e the airlines, and just fly have been excruciating to deal with. My trip to visit family had to be canceled as there was no way to make it. I am furious at all of you.They delayed our flight because of bad weather in NY which was completely understandable. Then they cancelled our flight and a later flight that evening. The earliest we could fly was the next morning. We ended up buying last minute tickets on another airline and made it home slightly delayed but safely that evening. Delta kept saying it was weather related but if that was the case how did we make it back on another airline? The weather in NY was cloudy but not bad.Once we got in the air the pilot made up some of the time of the delay. So that was really nice.Excellent flight. Boarding was efficient and departure was on time. Smooth flight with on time arrival. Deplaning was also efficient.It was delayed instead of departing at 9:20pm, we departed at 11pm… putting us in Columbus after 2am! It was awful. Had I known about the delay, I could have spent some time in the United Lounge… I was starving because I started my journey in Budapest… so I was exhausted and hungry. Plus I had to make new arrangements to be picked up at the airport in Columbus, instead of midnight it was 2:30 am after getting luggage and out of airport. Not feasible. I would have just stayed in Chicago for the night and gotten a morning flight.It was great, I’m very grateful for the pilots and crew flight attendants for everything.Evidently, my seat had the only broken TV. I couldn’t plug it in, get it to come on, or watch anything, and of course, no one could fix it while we were on the plane. The service was good and the boarding was quickI was charged for my daughters bag when I am supposed to receive two free checked bags with my United Explorer card.The schedule to Moline changed 5 times. The gate changed 6 times. That is a pathetic way to run an airline. No wonder that no one in our company flies on United Express to or from Moline. Changes happen most of the time. I learned my lesson on this trip…never again!Flight was great. Efficient boarding. Short flight. Early arrival. Friendly flight crew. The entertainment system did not work well. Could not access it until the aircraft reached 10K feet or more. Lots of glitches.A bit rush for transit. Food and entertainment are not availableSmooth boarding process. Early departure, smooth flight, early arrival. The entertainment package has very good recent movie options. The flight crew were friendly and professional.There was no TV's on the plane? I tried to activated the WiFi multiple times before the plane took off but it wasn't work well.Air Marco’s fleet of airplanes are old and pathetic. The seats are torn and stained. The monitors don’t work properly. If this wasn’t a business trip and I had control of booking the flight, I would not travel on this carrier.Good service, friendly staff. Food was average for airlines and the seats were small.Pathetic check in experience once again. Not enough staff scheduled at bag drop or for special assistance at LHR. Really need to rethink the whole self check in procedure. The crew was good. A very decent selection of special meals in this leg as compared to the JFK-LHR leg.Flight was cancelled 3 hrs AFTER etd. Thetefore Missed connection from JFK to New Zealand . No accommodation provided… This cost ne aporox 1000 USD in extra expenses and turned whst should have been a 24 hr trip ftom Boston - New Zealand into a VERY expensive , late 70+ hr nightmare … Complete nonsense!!!Overall fine, but the delay was annoying and the reasons for the delay were not communicated. The crew on board were phenomenal!A cookie and a soda, packed like sardines, will never be a positive experience. Also, boarded a 5:30 flight at 7:45pmWhenever a passenger purchase a ticket his advantage number should automatically to his information. It's not everyone remember the number. You request for your number and American airline agent say they will email it....and they never email anything and you loose your mileage just because you don't remember your number. It should automatically go your information and associate with your email account at all timesThe flight was two hours late to take off. The captain kept making announcements in English, but the volume on the speakers was low and we could not hear him. The flight attendant’s French translation was loud and clear, but we couldn’t understand French. The crew was nowhere to be found to relay what the captain was announcing. Very frustrating experience. American has to do better.Paid $35 and not able to access the internet at all.Spirit is low fare air line. Food also cost you. No free food.The flight was delayed twice with minimal explanation. The terminal and airplane were filthy. The food voucher didn’t even cover a tiny pizza from a kiosk in the terminal. All in all, a pretty miserable experience for a flight to attend a funeralEveryone was kind for the most part. I did travel with children and paid for seats and even then it was not as suitable. I tried calling their customer service prior to check in and I was told they couldn't help me because I didn't purchase my tickets with them.It was very bad it got delayed by 2 hours.Never going to travel with spirit airlines in future.The flight times got delayed multiple times due to weather which is understandable, but later the time got prepared 30min. Made to the flight barely but got stressed too much.Onboarding was an easy process. Staff waa friendly and courteous. Should have a complimentary snack and drink. We paid $900 round trip for two to myrtle from New York, which is an expensive fare. Going to the seats were not in good shape but our return home, the air plane seemed to be new with comfortable seating with slightly more space. If traveling again, we will still consider flying SpIrit.It was absolutely awesome. The crew was welcoming to all, not just the first class. They were full of energy. The in-cabin music was an excellent choice, not boring like most airlines. We were ready for takeoff ahead of time. Pilots were great. Smooth takeoff and landing. The plane was beautiful and nicely cleaned. This was truly a fantastic flight. I fly Delta and American all the time. I was apprehensive about Spirit. I will definitely be looking for Spirit first. Thanks for a great experience.Tell them to chose a better, less bumpy route :( my seat had no window all the way at the end 😔All was good expecting the seats need a bit of cushion. Besides that I can’t complain.Worst airline ever! The guy weighing my bag had his foot on the metal plate and when I called him out on it, I got this stupid little smirk. La is a scam and so is Spirit Airlines. All the flight attendants looked like they hated our flight just as much as we did.Southwest8.0Delta7.9United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Everything you need to know for your flight from Chicago to New YorkAirlinesCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Chicago to New YorkFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Chicago to New York according to KAYAK users.
