Put msnbc and free speech tv on the news channel selection list.after landing, we stay 2 hours on the taxi way before reaching the gate The airline and the crew were good thoughI'm not a fan of Southwest's model. I don't like the herding style of boarding.My flight to Chicago left and landed early. My return flight left two minutes late and arrived 2 minutes late. My seat selections were ideal! There were no snacks going to Chicago and no snacks on the return trip. There are no charging outlets on board.Multiple delays and gate changes. Arrived at final destination 6 hours late. All rental cars had been taken.The movies using Southwest WiFi kept pausing and I had to restart multiple times.One of the crew performed a hilarious skit to accompany the standard instructions. Passengers enjoyed it so much they applauded at the end!First, my flight was a usual flight nothing exceptional or unexpected. Over all it was a normal, good flight! Second, your questionaire is wholly lacking in the proper options to which one can answer a question. Often on short flights, there is no food let alone entertainment so why isn't that reflected in your questionaire? A simple "not applicable" would cover that issue appropriately but no, your form arbitrarily enters an answer based on the initial assessment which normally isn't factual. Until you provide an accurate means of assessing flights, I'll no longer be completing of these unimpressive and misleading assessements. Thank you!Easy to book and to get check in and get on and off.Excellent experience. WiFi worked on this leg of My tripCheck in was quick and easy during early hours. Flight was on time, and customer services was a plus.Once we got in the air the pilot made up some of the time of the delay. So that was really nice.Excellent flight. Boarding was efficient and departure was on time. Smooth flight with on time arrival. Deplaning was also efficient.It was delayed instead of departing at 9:20pm, we departed at 11pm… putting us in Columbus after 2am! It was awful. Had I known about the delay, I could have spent some time in the United Lounge… I was starving because I started my journey in Budapest… so I was exhausted and hungry. Plus I had to make new arrangements to be picked up at the airport in Columbus, instead of midnight it was 2:30 am after getting luggage and out of airport. Not feasible. I would have just stayed in Chicago for the night and gotten a morning flight.It was great, I’m very grateful for the pilots and crew flight attendants for everything.Evidently, my seat had the only broken TV. I couldn’t plug it in, get it to come on, or watch anything, and of course, no one could fix it while we were on the plane. The service was good and the boarding was quickI was charged for my daughters bag when I am supposed to receive two free checked bags with my United Explorer card.The schedule to Moline changed 5 times. The gate changed 6 times. That is a pathetic way to run an airline. No wonder that no one in our company flies on United Express to or from Moline. Changes happen most of the time. I learned my lesson on this trip…never again!Flight was great. Efficient boarding. Short flight. Early arrival. Friendly flight crew. The entertainment system did not work well. Could not access it until the aircraft reached 10K feet or more. Lots of glitches.A bit rush for transit. Food and entertainment are not availableFull flight so overhead bin space ran out & bags had to be checked. When you’re in the last boarding group, you might as well expect that. Don’t pay to check bags though because when they run out of space for carry-ons, they check your bag to your destination for free. When traveling with children, no need to pay extra for seats, they will assign seats & have to sit your children with you.American almost always Delays flights from Austin to Dallas and back. I cannot believe they have such poor service on this route. I was about to switch to American from Delta, but they gave me enough reasons not to.There's nothing I liked about it. For first off I scheduled this trip two weeks in advance then they delayed my flight which messed up my whole trip. So I scheduled it for the following weekend thinking there won't be a delay and guess what as soon as I got to the airport we said in the airplane on the tarmac for an hour and a half. Not only was it delayed I missed my connecting flight meaning I had to stay the night at Dallas-Fort Worth airport sleeping on the floor. I will tell you this I will never fly American airlines ever again I have had nothing but horrible experience with them and I just throw money at themHaving to reschedule flights a day later, they loaded by luggage on the wrong plane from Little rock now I have to HOPE they deliver it to where im staying like they said would. International flight crew was very disgruntled and not very friendly.The entertainment package was vast and the selections were very current. Keep updating it was great.Great flight. No issues at all. I still think boarding could be more efficient but otherwise, a good experience.4 hours late, including over +1 hour waiting in plane to take off. Baggage left behind too.Our flight was 1.5 hours delayed. There was no weather for the inbound flight, so I don't understand why. This meant a VERY late arrival and only a quick nap before my morning flight.It was very difficult to stretch my knee out and I am very short. I also had a torn tendon in my knee which made it extra uncomfortable anyways. My husband is 6'2" and I can't imagine him flying in that plane.Delayed flight, so I switched fights to SFO to Phoenix , Phoenix to DSM. Excellent service through American AirlinesFlight was good and on time. Everyone was nice. Seats aren't very comfortableThe seats are too small the plane makes weird noise when landing 🛬It was very bad it got delayed by 2 hours.Never going to travel with spirit airlines in future.Flight delayed over 3 or 4 hours because no captain to fly plane. I couldn’t make a connection and had to wait 9 hours for another flight. Had to fly red eye flight. SucksThe flight times got delayed multiple times due to weather which is understandable, but later the time got prepared 30min. Made to the flight barely but got stressed too much.First off, i received an e-mail to allow me to check in for our flight. I folllowed the link, when it came to the seat selection, I was unable to select any "free" seats ( meaning without any additional charge) because everything was " unavailable". My Husband and I were ttavelling with our 3 children hence, i wanted to be assured that we were all seated next to each other. I tried 3 times and everytime I click the selection it said " error loading". What the system wants is for me to buy the seats ( anywhere from $25 to $50 dollars each passenger) like I did on our flight bound to L.A. I called customer service and the guy was unhelpful all he kept repeating was to come really early at the airport and we will be assigned seats there. Imagine my anxiety!!! Spirit says they are a budget airline but they are actually the opposite!! And just before our flight, the flight attendant KEPT announcing/ selling the seats that were not purchased for a cheaper price!! Like it was a bidding/ bargaining game! This was our first and last time to fly Spirit.My flight got cancelled by Spirit airlines, it was bad experience to meSpirit gets you there; it's no worse than any other aircraft, all things considered. (It's not like everyone else is such a hero). But - holy moses - do they nickel and dime you to absolutely every nickel - I was really expecting to have to pay to use the bathroom. And when the captain comes on with a 5 minute sales pitch about getting "points", that was like something on Bizarro world. Other than that, everyone else was professional and worked hard to get us from point A to point B. I'm not loving all the "self-service" stuff but there it is - just when the machines don't work you don't have anyone to talk to.Easy boarding and good flight. Need to work on the beverage and snack situationThe staff was great, but because the 2nd lieutenant didn’t show up for the flight we all had to deboard and wait 2 1/2 hours for one to show up. Very disappointing the crew can’t get schedules confirmed which wouldn’t have caused this issue.Frontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.Southwest8.0United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Chicago to DallasCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsCabin class types available on flights from Chicago to DallasCabin classes available on flights from Chicago to Dallas.
