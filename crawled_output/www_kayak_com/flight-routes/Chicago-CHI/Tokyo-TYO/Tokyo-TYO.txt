Only the fish entree in the Japanese meal was overcooked and quite dry but everything else was greatGreat first time experience on this airline. Very professional staff and great service.Warm the bread. Movies: better choices to include Chinese movies options or some of the older winners of flim festivalBusiness class on ANA was awesome. There lie flat seats made it easier to sleep on a 12 hour flight. Food was great and service was excellent.The crew was very nice and polite. They made sure everybody got their meal and drinks. Even the economy class had a very adequate leg room for someone that is over 6 foot tall.Overall it was good. Making changes to the reservation on ANA’s website was little challenging. Would like to see those features improved in the future.The flight crew was outstanding. Very cheerful and always respectful. I wish the same could be said about United. The AC wasn't the best on the plane.The seats are uncomfortable. The flight attendants are not pleasant. They do their job, but not with a ray of sunshine and warmth. The food was awful, not what I would expect from an Asian airline. All of the other Asian airlines I have flown have far better food. The food was on par with United airlines food, which is really bad. Maybe ANA should get out of the alliance with United.During booking, I selected the seats so that my wife and I would sit next to each other. However, the airline changed our seats at boarding so that we were seated apart. Very disappointing.Every leg of the flight was late causing us to miss our flight to Okinawa and have to take the next flight out.highly recommend for trip to japan only reason why i gave good not excellent is because their selection of movies and tv shows in English is more limited .We asked for Hindu vegetarian meal in advance and the quality of the food was horrendous. Never flying JAL again!Overall a great experience. One complain was the vegetarian food that my wife had which was mostly boiled vegetables with not much flavor.Very accommodating and kind airline crews. The plane is also big which makes the passengers more comfortable and relaxI actually didn’t make it onto the flight. I spent quite a few hours trying to rebook the flight just to get screwed out of $5000. Fun!We booked business class round trip from Delhi to San Diego and back. On our last leg from Bangalore to Delhi we were down graded to economy class which was big disappointment other than that everything was great.Had an incident with a stewardess who insisted that I take a seat. I informed her that I came to use the restroom and to have some water. After using the restroom, I wanted to stretch my legs out a little cuz my knees were aching from sitting. I understood her concern for my concern and the potential turbulence (she said she knows this route and the turbulence and safety is not to be taken lightly) but I felt that her mood, tone, demeanor, and a lack of compassion for the pain in my knees were not the proper way to address a customer or anyone for that matter. This left a bitter taste in my mouth. It was her lack of professionalism that surprised me.we have requested for hindu veg. meal during booking. but served meal was of very poor qualty and taste. they can get such meal from 5 star Indian restaurant at Vancouver/ tokyo/ Bangalore.pure hindu veg meal and no AVMLIt was good but need mor amenities for toiletries and entertainmentExtremely poor at handling baggage. I had oversized golf bag and JAL would not recheck in Boston. Had to haul by myself to Jet Blue. Both JAL and Jet Blue claimed I had overweight bag. Had to adjust baggage several times. Will avoid JAL in future and I always avoid Jet Blue when I can. QATAR always superior.My connecting flight was canceled or never existed. My stopover went from 1 hour and a half to 10 hours. It was a long day that I wasn't prepared for and it would have been nice to know that ahead of time. Cathay is great though. Great staff, entertainment and food.Great entertainment system, the seat is a bit old style needs refurbishmentBoarding at the airport was not well managed. Otherwise, had a good flight sitting in the first row (which I paid for). Crew was pretty friendly, and flight was smooth.I was only given 2 meals, and my screen showed that there were 3 meals. Second meal was 1-2 hours late according to the screen.it was a great experience as far as business class.. but I have had better meals and wine on other airlines.. that said.. the price was a great value for what I got in return.. crew made the difference.Check in process at the kiosk, crew in flight and overall comfort was good. Food selection could have been better. Flight from Hong Kong to Los Angeles did not have any vegetarian main course option, it was either sea food or chicken. Being a vegetarian I could only eat yogurt and fruit. Most international flights have one vegetarian main course dish which I found missing in Cathay Pacific menu.Paid a premium a have a shorter transit time in Hong Kong, but Cathay pacific rebooked me and ended up waiting for 10 hrs in Hong Hong airport.Great. Efficient boarding process with the face recognition. Plenty of cabin space for luggage.Cabin crew is very helpful and nice, it is another level of service compared to Air CanadaEntertainment for kids was good. Good was terrible, needs lots of work.Once we got in the air the pilot made up some of the time of the delay. So that was really nice.We had a layover from YVR to Denver. We bought 4 bottles of Absolut Vodka at the YVR Duty Free for $116.20, after going through security and American Customs Pre Clearance at YVR, Vancouver. When we landed in Denver, United put us behind the American Customs as well as TSA again for some reason. We were forced to go through American Customs and TSA again. TSA confiscated our rightfully owned Duty Free Absolut Vodka bottles. Because United incorrectly forced our flight behind American border and TSA again, we missed the connecting flight. After United put us on a later flight, we eventually arrived in Chicago very late, with hardly any sleep. I am looking for compensation from United for our incorrectly confiscated Absolut Vodka bottles worth $116.20, as well as compensation for incorrectly putting us behind American Customs and TSA again, causing us to miss our connecting flight, making us arrive extremely late in Chicago.Excellent flight. Boarding was efficient and departure was on time. Smooth flight with on time arrival. Deplaning was also efficient.The flight got cancelled so I don’t know why or what happened. We waited around and didn’t know until so late and they couldn’t really help with anything but had us call the airlines.It was delayed instead of departing at 9:20pm, we departed at 11pm… putting us in Columbus after 2am! It was awful. Had I known about the delay, I could have spent some time in the United Lounge… I was starving because I started my journey in Budapest… so I was exhausted and hungry. Plus I had to make new arrangements to be picked up at the airport in Columbus, instead of midnight it was 2:30 am after getting luggage and out of airport. Not feasible. I would have just stayed in Chicago for the night and gotten a morning flight.It was great, I’m very grateful for the pilots and crew flight attendants for everything.Evidently, my seat had the only broken TV. I couldn’t plug it in, get it to come on, or watch anything, and of course, no one could fix it while we were on the plane. The service was good and the boarding was quickThe boarding of took of late.The presentation of the food was horrable as was the tast of the food was cold and tastless.Delay and keep changing gates. I have to run around from B to C then to E.I was charged for my daughters bag when I am supposed to receive two free checked bags with my United Explorer card.Short flight. Everything was fine except the flight was delayed twice for a total of an hour.There labor disputes cancelled my flight less than 24 hours before my boarding time but there customer service/website was easy enough to navigate and they rebooked me for no upcharge.Very bad, flight was cancelled due to strike and staff was unable to rebook usNot to out myself as both a child at heart and kind of a terrible person, but the Pokémon safety video was the first time I watched an airplane safety video in like a decade. It was ADORABLE!! A great way to encourage attention from young and old alike.Flight was delayed by 1.5hrs. Once inside, people had their small handbags on the storage. The crew (male guy) was not helpful in making some space in the storage. Instead, he asked few bags to be checked-in and it was not a great experience. No attempt to help but just followed the things with a straight face. People had their literally small bags and he wouldnt not move from one storage to another even if there was space and would not let us do i as well. Once flight was on, they ran out of Orange juice, really running out of orange juice when the temp were 32.degrees outside. didnt made the sense. Onasking for a extra snack, he made a face as if he was giving me out of his pocket. if the flight was delayed, there could have an attempt to provide something extra incase people did asked.Seamless! Long but the seat back entertainment kept us all busy the whole time! Meals were excellent! Crew fantastic! Very attentive!Abandoned me in hallway in a wheelchair… which I asked for because I sprained my back. After waiting in the hallway, I decided to walk the rest of the way since someone respecting me up.. My experience with the united was totally the opposite. Wheelchair access, propped swift and save me a lot of grief. Air Canada totally disorganized.Terrible confusion btw air Canada and United. Wasn’t able to change ticket because I had purchased on kayak. Rethinking booking tickets on this site, and will try to avoid United and aircanada going forward.Conflicting information provided about baggage allowance. One screen said I had a carry on and another said I didnt.Miserable staff as it was a late/delayed flight and crew wasn’t in the best spirits. Completely understood as neither was most of the passengers.
