Enjoyed the experience8.0 ExcellentAnonymous, Sep 2025SFO - LASRead more Alaska Airlines reviewsFlight was smooth, pleasant passengers and crew. Enjoyed the experienceFlight attendant was awful, I felt second hand embarrassment with every one of her interactions with people onboard. She was so incredibly rude every chance she gotGreat flight - efficient and cheerful team on board, at SFO gate. Also, PAE (Paine Field, Everett, WA) is a great little airport to fly out or in to!I was sitting towards back of plane and the flight attendants I thought spoke unusually loud for an evening flight. They chatted and chatted all night long and it seemed odd to me that they didn’t try to lower their voices. It is annoying as a passenger to hear all their conversations.Had to pay $8 for internet wasnt cool, no tv’s, had to use phone to watch movies, no food choices seemed available unless u ordered in advance maybe I'm wrong about that but seemed that way, no snacks were served. Seemed a very bare bones flight. But it was on time and safe so that was goodWe were singled out, greeted and helped with check-in at the busy airport. They offered to take our bags there and gave no fuss when we said they were carry-on. With United just last week I had to put up a fight just to get onto the flight with my one authorized carry-on.boarding was late worst was going back LAX to SFO delayed not once ? but TWICE😡I was at the airport practically almost 5 hours of previous time , very inconvenient! i would have spend longer time with family , I was wanting to avoid TSA line? but it just got me to spend unwanted time @ d airportPlane boarded and left on time or very close to the stated departure. Arrived on time. Staff was subdued. Could not hear the flight attendant too well. No announcement from the pilot which is always nice. Biggest complaint absolutely no little snacks! But the important thing is we left and arrived on time and we survived.Crew was not happy to be there and neither was I 😭 well at least the lady that helped me.. I was stuck in the middle seat between two men. Totally my fault since I didn’t pay a fee to select my seat though. I recommend paying the fee even if you’re in a budget. It’s better than being placed aaaaallllllll the way in the back next to the smelly bathrooms. The seats didn’t recline either!! It was a red eye flight so I got no sleep whatsoever. Ordered a coffee and it tasted like…. Let’s just say it was horrible. I had to to return it to the same crew lady and she looked at me like this girl…. Sorry but I was not going to drink that- please take it back!! Oh and lastly, my luggage was completely broken and damaged. All wheels were missing by the time my luggage came around in the luggage cart. Lmao. Overall poor experience to say the least. Tickets were cheap though😂😂😂Delayed flight both ways. Then, on the return flight, we were stuck on the tarmac for at least 30+ minutes. Idk what happened, but this was a bad experience.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.My husband upgraded our seats and I don't know if it was due to the type of planet was or if they didn't upgrade our seats. We were supposed to be in I believe comfort seats and they were just as tight as any other seat- no leg room and we are very tall people but at least it wasn't extremely cold. My husband did put in a complaint about our seating because he paid extra and if we would have known that the space and the tightness would have been the same, we just would have gotten the emergency row emergency row seats that we normally get. We love Delta but both our flights coming home we're not good. Oh I forgot to mention that on our flight to Hawaii our luggage wheels got broke and we had to purse new luggage on vacation then we never had this problem so we didn't know protocol and reported it after we got home only for them to tell is we only had 24hrs to report the damage. Not sure what was going on with Delta this vacation trip.Crew was excellent. Comfort seats not as nice as other kinds of planes.It was a great flight and the stewards and stewardess were all kind and accommodating!! The seats were comfortable and entertainment screen excellent!There are 4 flights in consecutive gates with about the same departure time. Two flights were boarding at the same time. One was delayed or boarding would be happening at the same time. I am not sure what Delta and LAX need to do to have a better layout at the end of Terminal 2There was a security issue at the airport and we were unable to land. We circled endlessly and then landed at another airfield for fuel. We then circled the airport again, almost landed but didn’t fully touch down before circling again. I am thankful to the crew for keeping us safe- the issue was the airline and staff at the airport getting us seats on our connecting flights. That part was hours of searching for someone and getting in double my steps.Most aspects were good however if they assign boarding zones they ought to enforce them or why bother? My luggage from SAN-JFK-MAD was lost in NY so I without my main bag for two days upon arrival in Spain. They were helpful in tracking it and eventually delivered it to my hotel. The flub was because of a delay upon arrival in NYC. I had booked 2 1/2 hours between flights but we had to hold on the taxiway for an hour after landing while waiting for a clear gate which likely caused the baggage error.Excellent flight, the planes were newer, they did a nice job with boarding, great service overall.It would be nice if was given wires ear buds. Overall was a good experience was able to sleep on the plane737-800 in first class was pretty dumpy. Seat had an uncomfortable angle, storage under the seat was blocked so even my very modest backpack didn't fit, power outlet was flaky. Weird tiny seat pockets that couldn't hold a gallon ziploc bag, emesis bag missing, etc. etc. No in-flight service due to turbulence. Crew was excellent, boarding was smooth despite a full flight.What an amazing flight. I haven’t experienced this level of service in a flight in years. This will be the only way to fly to Hawaii for me in the future.Kayak sold me a ticket after check in time. Could not check in. Could not get on flight.I could not believe that on a 5 hour plus flight we were not given a complimentary meal . That should be illegal. Or it would be nice to be informed beforehand that a complimentary meal would not be provided. The wording in the email I got about pre ordering food was phrased in a way that made the food seem like it would be free. Very misleading! Also during boarding we were informed there would be empty seats we could move to if we wanted, all we had to do was wait for an announcement, however an announcement was never made. Then when we tried to change seats ourselves we were singled out over the loud speaker and told we could not move without asking. Then the flight was about to take off , so we didn’t have time to ask . Then we were told we could not move to the exit row because you had to pay for those seats, but we were not told where we could move. Also no one was in the exit rows so , if something happened no one would be there to assist the passengers. Also people should be allowed to move there if the airline wasn’t able to sell them. One passenger asked if he could pay for the upgrade and the flight attendant said she did not have the capability to charge for the seat on her mobile device, so the airline ended up losing possible income anyways . So why not let people move there during flight if you have no way to charge them? Then the landing was bumpy and awful and many passengers complained out loud when we landed .The flight was great! The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. I would definitely fly Hawaiian Aurlines again!You have to buy the ear buds and they only offers little cup of water twice.The flight was supposed to leave at 7:30pm, but departed 10:50pm. They kept moving departure time out every half hour. It was a 45 minute flight from n Sunday night with great weather.Flight got delayed and it was very inconvenient . Had to come with another carrier. Had to spend one more night in San Francisco.The worst flight experience I've ever had. Our flight was delayed 14 whole hours because the flight crew never showed up. We had to wait in a two hour line to get our new boarding passes, we were told we had no other option but to fly at 10pm (we didn't depart until 11:45pm). Everyone had to contact their hotels and car rental places, workplaces, etc. since we lost an entire day's worth of travel. The crew showed up at 10:15, which was past the time we were supposed to board. They were laughing and being completely smug when they boarded, and they took another hour to board us onto our flight. The flight crew never came to check in on us, we were quickly given one drink and sandwich and they turned off the lights and were negligent the rest of the trip. My mom asked three attendants for a seat belt extender, they never brought one. I was dehydrated and never received another drink. They were very rude and unfriendly, we had been up since 4am the morning of our flight and didn't land in our destination until 2am the next day (5am local time). This was unacceptable service and treatment, these flights are not cheap and we were inconvenienced out of an entire day of travel. This was 100% avoidable and was the fault of Hawaiian Airlines, and their crews inability to show up to work on time.Loved the leg room, usb charging, outlet, food, staff. The seats were very uncomfortable for some reason and made my buttocks ache and would have liked to be seated together from the time of purchasing tickets without having to pay extra.Usually we have a pleasant trip on HA. Not this time! All stewards were unpleasant, rude, rushed, condescending. First step onto the plane, WE greeted the crew with an “Hello!”. They greeted us with a terse smile then ignored us. Not a good start. Even over the PA announcements, they were rushed and unpleasant. One Stewart even berated a passenger in front of us when all they asked is if the purchase cart had vodka to purchase. The steward said “LIKE WE SAID OVER THE PA, THIS ONLY HAS FOOD OR BEVERAGE!” Vodka is a beverage! It was a legitimate question. Not sure why she treated the passenger this way. Taking trash was even unpleasant, No “Thank you” or at least a smile. I work in CS. I know good CS can make or break your trip. There was absolutely no “aloha” on this trip. All clearly did not want to be on this plane and felt strongly that they did not want to provide a premium service to their clients. This might be our last HA and cancellation of my HA-MC if we are treated the same way going home. We are typically treated with kindness and warmth in the past with HA. This trip was unacceptable.We had to deboard 2 times due to maintenance issues. They changed the plane, and then we got deviated to LAX due to maibtenance issues on the other plane, had to sleep at LAX and los a full day.From the first moment you interact with United Airlines, you can expect nothing less but extreme frustration. The baggage handler at the bag drop seems completely unbothered by the presence of customers waiting in line. No help was extended to load the baggage whatsoever. And if any of your bags is overweight by 0.01 pound they will make you re-distribute everything in your suitcase just to play power trip. When it was time to board no help was extended to customers to locate their seats. Moreover. It was a chaotic mess at the gate when it was unclear who should board first and everyone just bunched up, trying to get on the plane. I am sure the crew was doing their best to perform their jobs while being paid their wages however it shouldn’t be that hard to smile once or twice when you’re in the business if serving customers. It is a shame for the United States of America to have a flagship carrier of such low caliber. Our flight was also delayed by about an hour and a half due to further delays prior to our inbound flight. Being someone who has travelled for both business and leisure in Asia, Europe, and South America I have never experienced such poor quality of service.The pilots were late and it made us 1 hour late. The meat was tough and bok choy was also tough.Stuck on tarmac for two hours plus a 5.5 hour flight. Rude flight attendant. And no meals, not even for purchase!I learned that seating towards the end of plane that a line forms for the restroom and people use your chair as a hand railing, bumping your seat consistently. I was seated in the aisle. I think that next time if I am towards the back row I would want to sit in the middle or window seat.The best airline I have ever travel , really good customer service, attention and service !!Everything was great. Only thing that could’ve made it better was buy on board options for hot food, but the snacks were decent. The flight attendants were great. I had no complaints. I was able to make it to my destination safelyHorrific. They missed my connecting flight to San Diego. I didn’t get there until Monday at 9am when I had a mandatory court settlement conference scheduled at 6am since we had parties on the east coast. This caused many issues. All because United apparently forgot to hold the doors open until my flight landed that only had a 10 minute delay. This was the last flight to Southern California. So I couldn’t even rent a car to finish the trip. United cannot be trusted when traveling on specific days and times since weather didn’t have anything to do with the delays.Very comfortable (upgraded to business class). The audio on my screen didn’t work, but I managed to play the audio through my phone while watching the screen.Flight was late as pilot crew had to land at different airport in their previous flight. Passengers boarded and had to wait for pilots inside plane. Series of incomplete and unnecessary announcements by an annoying voice, rather than complete, informative announcements.The seats in economy were appeared to be quite thin and lack sufficient cushioning to be comfortable. Perhaps it was my seating position but the plane seemed notably load.The entertainment package was vast and the selections were very current. Keep updating it was great.The seat was so hard my tailbone was aching The crew was kind of a b**** because I made a joke that I didn't care if they close the door I total c*** when she was trying to f****** act like she was mad at me because I said that The flight was bumpy. Sure you didnt have control over that.4 hours late, including over +1 hour waiting in plane to take off. Baggage left behind too.While waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.Was not able to watch most shows on the entertainment site. They would not loadOur flight was 1.5 hours delayed. There was no weather for the inbound flight, so I don't understand why. This meant a VERY late arrival and only a quick nap before my morning flight.Delayed flight, so I switched fights to SFO to Phoenix , Phoenix to DSM. Excellent service through American AirlinesAA re-routed flight from HNL to LAX due to delay. My group of 3 with reserved seats in row 9 was broken up, with one assigned to a middle seat, another in the last row of the plane. Not happy. No explanation to the delay. No apologies. No compensation. Would have been nice to be offered an Admiral Club admission or a voucher for the extra 3 hours of layover in LAX. Could not hear the boarding gate announcements in LAX. Adjacent gate was boarding at the same time. Loud speakers were competing against each other. Barely made my boarding group.Almost a 6 hour flight and the only food option is a cheese plate… and chips. Also how is it there are no options for texting on American.
