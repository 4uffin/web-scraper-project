Food was so-so. Service was very good. First leg was very good. Second leg from Copenhagen to Barcelona was terrible. We paid a LOT for business class and to have seats worse than most coach seats with no entertainment and no charging available for 1/3rd of the whole trip was not acceptable. Very disappointing. I thought they were coming back in the U.S. with style, NOT YET.6.0 GoodArt, Aug 2025SEA - CPHRead more Scandinavian Airlines reviewsWill not recommend SAS for business travel. Food was so-so. Service was very good. First leg was very good. Second leg from Copenhagen to Barcelona was terrible. We paid a LOT for business class and to have seats worse than most coach seats with no entertainment and no charging available for 1/3rd of the whole trip was not acceptable. Very disappointing. I thought they were coming back in the U.S. with style, NOT YET.I do not have a problem with the airline but both my two suitcases that were supposed to go from Hawaii to Copenhagen didn’t get on the plane in Seattle. I arrive on Monday the 21st at 10:30 in the morning. I did not get my two suitcases before Friday late afternoon that is unacceptable.No choice of food. Needed to pay more even for a can of coke!!!It was great, used to fly them a lot back 20 years ago but since did KLM as my flight route changed, but very happy with my experience and will come again!The seats were really close together and hard to get comfortable. The food was okay. The cheese was amazing! I loved the cold towels they gave us.When my flight was changed from delays they were quick to rebook me.I really enjoyed how clean and big the aircraft was, as well as how friendly the crew was.Airline left me stranded in the U.S. gave me an unrequested refund of 40% of booking and canceled my trip back! When I asked why, the said “we don’t have to tell you why”. “But you can rebook”. Never again! Paid 2x and rebooked on Austrian. What a joke!Painful seats for a 10 hour flight. There’s a very hard flat board in the seat that goes up to half the back and after 7 hours it gets impossible to find the right position to avoid the pain.I paid for the seat with more leg room but on the day of my departure my seat was changed. I brought it to the airline costumer service and he was able to change it back. The person sitting next to me had the same exact issue.We had to deboard 2 times due to maintenance issues. They changed the plane, and then we got deviated to LAX due to maibtenance issues on the other plane, had to sleep at LAX and los a full day.From the first moment you interact with United Airlines, you can expect nothing less but extreme frustration. The baggage handler at the bag drop seems completely unbothered by the presence of customers waiting in line. No help was extended to load the baggage whatsoever. And if any of your bags is overweight by 0.01 pound they will make you re-distribute everything in your suitcase just to play power trip. When it was time to board no help was extended to customers to locate their seats. Moreover. It was a chaotic mess at the gate when it was unclear who should board first and everyone just bunched up, trying to get on the plane. I am sure the crew was doing their best to perform their jobs while being paid their wages however it shouldn’t be that hard to smile once or twice when you’re in the business if serving customers. It is a shame for the United States of America to have a flagship carrier of such low caliber. Our flight was also delayed by about an hour and a half due to further delays prior to our inbound flight. Being someone who has travelled for both business and leisure in Asia, Europe, and South America I have never experienced such poor quality of service.The pilots were late and it made us 1 hour late. The meat was tough and bok choy was also tough.Stuck on tarmac for two hours plus a 5.5 hour flight. Rude flight attendant. And no meals, not even for purchase!I learned that seating towards the end of plane that a line forms for the restroom and people use your chair as a hand railing, bumping your seat consistently. I was seated in the aisle. I think that next time if I am towards the back row I would want to sit in the middle or window seat.The best airline I have ever travel , really good customer service, attention and service !!Everything was great. Only thing that could’ve made it better was buy on board options for hot food, but the snacks were decent. The flight attendants were great. I had no complaints. I was able to make it to my destination safelyHorrific. They missed my connecting flight to San Diego. I didn’t get there until Monday at 9am when I had a mandatory court settlement conference scheduled at 6am since we had parties on the east coast. This caused many issues. All because United apparently forgot to hold the doors open until my flight landed that only had a 10 minute delay. This was the last flight to Southern California. So I couldn’t even rent a car to finish the trip. United cannot be trusted when traveling on specific days and times since weather didn’t have anything to do with the delays.Very comfortable (upgraded to business class). The audio on my screen didn’t work, but I managed to play the audio through my phone while watching the screen.Flight was late as pilot crew had to land at different airport in their previous flight. Passengers boarded and had to wait for pilots inside plane. Series of incomplete and unnecessary announcements by an annoying voice, rather than complete, informative announcements.Rude staff. I would avoid using the word racist but definitely partially or discriminatory. My 72 yrs old mother who is also disabled was traveling on this flight. She was the second passenger boarded to the plane. The First elderly couple ahead of my mother were allowed to use the airplane bathroom but my mother was denied entry stating it was for safety reasons. My mother objected the the couple in front of her were allowed but hostess still stated that due to the flight safety reasons she can’t use it. Even my mother explained that he is using blood pressure medication that’s why she have to use the restroom frequently but the crew continued arguing her. At one point the Mae attendent even suggested that if that’s the case my mother can urinate in her seat. The level of disrespect against an elderly lady is beyond my comprehension. This matter will be taken to the social media to shame the employees involved.my experience was great with Turkish airlines . the problem i encountered was with kayak booking. When I booked . it showed that im allowed a bag . and when I got to the airport, i had to pay $165 for one bag.Not up to Business Class standards. Two of the three toilets were out of order. The hostesses were aware and didn’t show any responsible act to do something. Food quality was not what we expect from Turkish hospitality. Overall we were not impressed and disappointed.During mid flight, try to get a flight attendant to help I couldn’t find one Otherwise, everything was perfectI was not given basinett seat.The connecting flight was missed due to airline fault i was not accomodated for hotel.Drinks were normt served frewuently.Never travelling again on tirkish airlines.I always travel wiyh family by turkish airline but no more.zero starsThe crew were very hospitable and pleasant. The food was pretty good. Unfortunately, there was a flight delay of more than 2 hours. We're not sure why but it appeared to be outside the control of Turkish Airlines.Bough tickets with luggage, but made me pay at Airport as wellThe economy seat was so uncomfortable, had not enough leg room for 13 hours flight, front seat basket was broken and couldn’t hold anything, food quality was horrible( we got food poisoned ) we charged for logged which used to be free. We paid too much for this flight and very disappointed. Turkish air line better to make satisfy and respect people instead of find different way to scam people.This is really the rating of two flights. JFK to IST then IST to NQZ. New York to Istanbul was good. Good crew and all positives. The flight to Astana was so bad that brought it all down. Crew was nonexistent above the minimum, seats were cramped, and it was hot on the plane. Turkish Airlines seems to be slipping down to US based carriers level.The 2 agents on the check in counter were super nice , helpful and very polite. Boarding was like a 1 2 3, I would recommend Turkish airlines for your next trip.They gave us sandwiches as a meal twice. Snacks mid flight with cookies and a tuna panini. Then just the same tuna panini for dinner. That was it.Top notch re cleanliness, comfort, operational. Attendants attentive, cheerful, courteous and professional. An unusually high-grade experience all around.The staff was very good, the only thing was the air conditioning wasn't working during the boarding process so it was very hot inside the plane until we got airborne. The food wasn't great, the chicken was dry and hard to cut, the ravioli was ok and the little pizza pocket thing was pretty bad. Other than that is was a good flight all aroundBetter consideration for families traveling with a disabled person. They insisted each person hold their own boarding pass on their own devices and gave us a hard time accepting eight boarding passes on a single device.Two of my four flights had issues with toilets either NOT fully operational or completely out of order. Boarding was a joke because they have NOT established who is running the show. In the end, she did a terrible job. The seats 💺 were loose goose and the drinks and snacks were limiting in choices. Also, following Alitalia as an inspiration was strange since they went out of business.We had a 3 hour delay and then a long taxi to take off. It would have been helpful for the pilot to have communicated more about what was going on. There was no A/C during the wait, and the cabin must have been more than 85 to 90 degrees. The crew gave water to the people in the front but by the time they go to the back of the plane they stopped giving out water. Eventually I went back and asked for some in the rear of the plane (for a second time). The food was close to inedible. I thought on an Italian flight that the pasta would be better than the chick, but honestly, a Swanson's TV dinner would have been better. I had a bite or two to keep my blood sugar up, but basically I couldn't eat it.Boarding was chaotic. Service was poor. Attendant was slow and rude. In business class, I was not offered a drink until 1.5 hrs,after takeoff. Food was inedible.Terrible. They canceled 2 flights and then sent everyone by BUS from Rome. They should make amends by offering some sort of compensation.We ordered a gluten free meal and never got it!The company tries shamelessly to squeeze every dollar)Euro out of its passengers. During the check-in the force you to go through the seat selection, you can skip it. They will assign you the worst seat available, then show you the other available seats on the map, for a fee. But they won't show you the fee until you click on it. And once you do click, there's no way to unselect it!! You will get stuck and forced to pay for that seat. Cheaters!!The crew was great. Good etc was unacceptable for an overseas flight. Wine with a meal should be complimentary. Seat comfort /space horrible and I am 5‘3“ with heels on. Short haul probably ok but not on long haul flightsIt was extremely difficult to upgrade my partners flight over the Internet from economy to economy, plus. Then it said clearly the checked luggage can be 32 kg. At the check-in counter in Hamburg, we had to pay 100 Euros ( $122.17) for the only 31kg peace checked luggage. We were told because the change was made less than 24 hours before the flight , the luggage weight would not be upgraded. Then they offered me that for €90 I can upgrade at the counter from economy to economy, plus so we can sit together on the flight from Frankfurt to San Francisco. I happily agreed and was charged. €99.($120.95), which I noticed too late. Especially about the Euro 100 up charge I feel upset and it’s a unfair way of doing business!Take off was not good, too hot inside the plane and seats are beyond uncomfortable.The company said that it was Condor's responsibility to issue my train ticket, and that I should contact them. But when I did, condor said I have to contact the train company and show them my booking number. I went to the station to board my train and they said where is my bar code ticket. It was a disaster and the people at the train station said how messed up this is and that condor is the worst for putting people through this. I boarded the train with NO ticket cause no one can issue me one even though I paid and it is in my booking confirmation.Helpful crew in a comfortable and well designed aircraft. My kids also loved the striped design of the airplane.The return flight, the food was better. Didn't like that even at checkin we still had to pay when only 5 seats were available. Had to pay or would be stuck in the very middle between two others. I had to pay for an aisle and a middle seat. Both were considered prime seats but the two other middle ones were not.There was one flight attendant who was exceptionally rude about the fact that they didn’t have any meatless options left when I told her I was a vegetarian. The boarding process was a bit disorganized and unclear but everything else was very good.Seats are not comfortable. Some of the food was good and some not so good.Really, nothing. I flew economy, and received a very good economy experience.Flight attendants were polite but not attentive. They did not clean cabin throughout trip, and the airplane upon disembarking looked disastrous! Garbage everywhere ! The state of the cabin did NOT leave passenger with a ‘cared-for’ feeling. It looked a total mess. They also closed themselves off in the back of the plane and passengers felt like they needed to knock to get a glass of water. Very dissppointing.Scandinavian Airlines7.4United Airlines7.4Turkish Airlines7.3ITA Airways6.7Condor6.3Everything you need to know for your flight from San Francisco to RomeAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from San Francisco to RomeFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from San Francisco to Rome according to KAYAK users.
