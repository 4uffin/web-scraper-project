Other airlines should learn from them when it comes to boarding and departing from the airplane. They also display efficiency in serving meals. They don't keep the aisles blocked for hours like some other airlines. The food is poor. Generally the food was unrecognizable and poorly prepared. The only thing that made it better than US flag carriers is that there was a fresh fruit bowl with each meal.8.0 ExcellentDavid, Sep 2025SEA - TPERead more EVA Air reviewsThe crews are very efficient.

Cabin and restrooms were kept cleanVery good service and food. Crew was professional and considerate. Cabin and restrooms were kept cleanFlight Attendants could have been nicer and food portions could be bigger.Great experience, comfort and food is delicious. Always great service and one timeThe food from Los Angeles to Taipei made me throw up. The flight is also not comfort. But the staffs are very friendly and nice.Aircraft was late getting to the gate - probably due to weather. We left the gate one hour late and had to wait another hour since we lost our slot in the takeoff queue. Our box was very wet and was falling apart when we got to Clark. It appears that luggage was exposed to weather in TPE while waiting to be loaded. Crew, however, handled the delay well and was able to provide planned service.I appreciate the email reminders for online check-in which made my entry to the lines less stressful. The flight was on schedule and on time. The baording staff were proactively helpful and approachable. The airplane inflight food, entertainment and comfies as well as provisions are excellent even in the economy seating. The airline transfer was smooth and easy! Luggage safe and intact! Thank you EVA airline for making my trip a reliable safe and comfortable experience.I was sleep when they brought the food. They had put a note on my seat. There was no food when I asked for food later. There was just one main meal served in this 14 hours flight. They offered me sandwich with ham which I don’t eat since I am pescatarian. Long story short I had to wait to get to TPE to get something to eat. I am extremely disappointed from the service. I have been flying EVA since I was 1 year old. Perhaps no more EVA for me. Seems EVA glorious day is long gonebasic and only minimum of service, they offer nothing specialThe flat bed full lying position is not comfortable at all, this could be improved, it is at an awkward position which i dont have the same issues with other airlines business class.The flight was uneventful and the crew was kind and professional. Really appreciate the option to order a vegan meal for the flight!I love my Delta crew, they were so welcoming and helpful.I absolutely loved my flight from Taipei to LAX. I was originally assigned to a different seat, however one of the stewardess noticed I was uncomfortable in my seat. She offered to move me to a more comfortable setting. Although she didn’t have to do what she did, I am more than grateful and thankful for her doing so. My longer flight felt much more comfortable, just by her taking notice. I really appreciate her.Overall was a lovely experience. The crew were kind and courteous throughout the entire flight.Better organization of boarding procedures. Terrible leadership guiding people to gates.They need to improve on how the plane lands cause it was not smooth at all.I did not like how the plane landed. It was not smooth.Been flying with China Airline over years many times. Good experience with them, no issues.China Airlines crews are very excellent doing their job. Very friendly and hardworking. I will always choose China Airlines over and over. Thank you all for making my flight comfortable. God bless to all the staff. :)I was only given 2 meals, and my screen showed that there were 3 meals. Second meal was 1-2 hours late according to the screen.Great. Efficient boarding process with the face recognition. Plenty of cabin space for luggage.Special request meals are really below average. Vegetarian options are very limited if you didn't prebook.I've stomach problems after 2 hours of flight, Iris, the flight purser not only did her best to make me feel comfortable, she went above and beyond providing pain relievers medicines and ointment. She look and found a doctor passenger on the flight to provide advise. She even report on ground staffs about my condition and provide wheelchair upon arrival. Kudos to her and Cathay Pacific!So so, crew was overly professional and lacks human touch. Equipment is very old, especially the HKG-PVG CX366 flight. That plane along with its decor must have twenty years of history, or at least I had that impression.Crew was great. But a bit understaffed. The business class seat, etc were dated. But comfortable. Some legs had entertainment system from a decade ago. Selections were rather poor. Food was mediocre at best. Actually poor for business class standards. I liked the lounge in Hong Kong. Showers were great. Food was nice.Very noisy and careless crew on this overnight flight. They should understand customers want to sleepEverything was fine and I have no complaints or things to note.Highly impressive. On time. Smooth and fast boarding and disembarkment. Really great serviceThe economy seats are much indeed roomier. Meals needs improvement.We had to deboard 2 times due to maintenance issues. They changed the plane, and then we got deviated to LAX due to maibtenance issues on the other plane, had to sleep at LAX and los a full day.From the first moment you interact with United Airlines, you can expect nothing less but extreme frustration. The baggage handler at the bag drop seems completely unbothered by the presence of customers waiting in line. No help was extended to load the baggage whatsoever. And if any of your bags is overweight by 0.01 pound they will make you re-distribute everything in your suitcase just to play power trip. When it was time to board no help was extended to customers to locate their seats. Moreover. It was a chaotic mess at the gate when it was unclear who should board first and everyone just bunched up, trying to get on the plane. I am sure the crew was doing their best to perform their jobs while being paid their wages however it shouldn’t be that hard to smile once or twice when you’re in the business if serving customers. It is a shame for the United States of America to have a flagship carrier of such low caliber. Our flight was also delayed by about an hour and a half due to further delays prior to our inbound flight. Being someone who has travelled for both business and leisure in Asia, Europe, and South America I have never experienced such poor quality of service.The pilots were late and it made us 1 hour late. The meat was tough and bok choy was also tough.Stuck on tarmac for two hours plus a 5.5 hour flight. Rude flight attendant. And no meals, not even for purchase!I learned that seating towards the end of plane that a line forms for the restroom and people use your chair as a hand railing, bumping your seat consistently. I was seated in the aisle. I think that next time if I am towards the back row I would want to sit in the middle or window seat.The best airline I have ever travel , really good customer service, attention and service !!Everything was great. Only thing that could’ve made it better was buy on board options for hot food, but the snacks were decent. The flight attendants were great. I had no complaints. I was able to make it to my destination safelyHorrific. They missed my connecting flight to San Diego. I didn’t get there until Monday at 9am when I had a mandatory court settlement conference scheduled at 6am since we had parties on the east coast. This caused many issues. All because United apparently forgot to hold the doors open until my flight landed that only had a 10 minute delay. This was the last flight to Southern California. So I couldn’t even rent a car to finish the trip. United cannot be trusted when traveling on specific days and times since weather didn’t have anything to do with the delays.Very comfortable (upgraded to business class). The audio on my screen didn’t work, but I managed to play the audio through my phone while watching the screen.Flight was late as pilot crew had to land at different airport in their previous flight. Passengers boarded and had to wait for pilots inside plane. Series of incomplete and unnecessary announcements by an annoying voice, rather than complete, informative announcements.It’s sad how legacy airlines feel like budget airlines now. Cramped space Non reclining seats No inflight entertainment (need to connect via your own device) Saving grace is the crew. Truly nice and sincere service.Short flight with limited entertainment wasn't that bad. Staff was friendly and plane was clean. Meal was good.It was great! The flight was on time and had a smoother flightCrew excellent calling me by name ! Only downside was no inflight WiFiI was glad that the plane was not totally full.Boarding and flying on time is the most important need of passengers they did thatEverything was very good but seats are small for a big man!Well, I needed to make a change to my flight and I called the airline and they said yes no problem $700 and we can do that and I agreed to it so they canceled my tickets and went to rebook and came back after being on hold for an hour and a half and said I’m sorry, sir. There was an error. It is $2800 Now and I said never mind. I will just use those flights and she proceeded to tell me that they already canceled them because I said I was interested in doing the change. I told her yes for $700. I was fine with doing a change but not $2800 so give me my tickets back and she proceeded to tell me that she could not do that and I had to pay the $2800 to get my tickets back that I already spent $2800 on. So I had to book tickets on another airline to get home And that cost a lot of money too. I’m a little pissed off at Philippine airline right now because of what they did to me and I’m not sure I ever wanna fly with them again. I’ve flown with them plenty in the past, but this just really put a bad taste in my mouth.. Not to mention on my way there leaving Seattle going to Vancouver. I got to the airport three hours in advance and they had booked me through Alaska Airlines to do that little trip. My connecting flight would leave about six hours after I got to Vancouver BC. I stood in Alaska Airlines lying for a little over two hours and then they proceeded to tell me that they couldn’t check me in because I wasn’t there an hour in advance. I kept telling the lady at the beginning of the line that I was afraid they were not gonna let me in because it was taking so long and she said oh don’t worry about it. You’re fine you’ve got time. Well I ended up spending $600 to get to Canada that night just to make my connecting flight because Alaska air wouldn’t do anything and Filipino Air told me it was Alaska air problem but Alaska air said since you booked through Philippine air, we can’t fix it. I had about 50 minutes to make my flight, but they refused to check me in because I wasn’t there an hour in advance yet. I’ve been standing in their line for about two hours and 15 minutes.reach the standard, crew tried to fix up issues fast.Overall the flight was a good experience. It is different from American Airlines because they board the back of the plane first rather than the front first. Food was decent. They gave out pillows ,blankets , and face masks. I did find this airline had faster flights back home than others. Less travel and layover time.EVA Air8.4China Airlines8.3Cathay Pacific7.6United Airlines7.4Philippine Airlines7.2Everything you need to know for your flight from San Francisco to ManilaAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from San Francisco to ManilaFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from San Francisco to Manila according to KAYAK users.
