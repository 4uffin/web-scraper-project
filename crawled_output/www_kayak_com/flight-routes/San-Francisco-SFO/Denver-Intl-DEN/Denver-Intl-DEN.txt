Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.The Southwest employees (all two of them) were very nice and cheerful despite the fact the line to self-check a bag (simply drop it off) was hundreds of people long. Thank God I arrived early to the airport because I stood in this line for at least an hour. Once on the flight that had been delayed by an hour, we had no Wi-Fi and thus no entertainment. Finally, I hope the investor strong arm tactics against Southwest pay off in a short-term windfall to your C-Suite because the rest of you are screwed. I have been a faithful Southwest customer for 15 years due to everything you just got rid of. I'm flying to Idaho and Washington in October, both places I used to simply book with Southwest without a second thought now with Frontier (Washington) and United (Idaho) because they offer everything the "new" Southwest does but cheaper and at better times, destinations, etc. This really makes me sad...Delayed flight. Nicest crew member was a SW pilot flying seated next to me who kindly move to seat the final passenger. Flight extra delayed. My cup of refreshment of ginger ale was so packed with ice it was literally 2 sips.No trays in our seats, we sat in first row, purchased a business class fare. Had to hold our drinks and snack in our hands. No plugs for our cell phones. Had to pay for it a drink cocktail each. Seats so uncomfortable.Flight wasn’t even full, but too many carry-ons caused us to run out of bin space. New bag fee has folks who would usually check their bags carrying on. Watching Southwest morph into Spirit/Frontier is so sad to watchFlights delayed by 4-6 hours. Boarding was a mess and unclear. Bags were not at arrival airport and had never even been put on the plane. No idea when I’ll get them. Don’t fly into Denver!Southwest is Southwest. No frills. If you're luck enough to get a happy crew (we did), then it makes for a nicer flight.I understand stuff happens, but plane failures are likely due to lack of maintenance. Additionally, air conditioning wasn't working, no snack/drink service, no WiFi. Fortunately, the crew was communicative and light-hearted. United grabbed another plane and we were able to get to our destination.Had to cancel first flight because Airporter Bus took over 3 hrs to get to airport which resulted in an extra $378 dollar fare . Is there anyway I can be reimbursed for initial fare since it was not my fault? Sent from my iPhone EJ LedetExcellent flight. Boarding was efficient and departure was on time. Smooth flight with on time arrival. Deplaning was also efficient.Our flight was understandably diverted to a small regional airport in Laramie, Wyoming due to weather conditions, which I fully recognize and appreciate. However, the low rating stems from the experience that followed: passengers remained on board for over an hour without the option to deplane and stretch, despite the aircraft being stationary. Although the pilot opened the cabin door, only he was permitted to exit. Meanwhile, passengers grew increasingly uncomfortable as warm summer air entered the cabin through the open door, and being in the second row meant we were impacted immediately. While the flight attendants made efforts to keep everyone at ease, I believe allowing passengers to deplane briefly, given the extended delay, would have significantly improved the overall experience.I never flew. Flight was canceled. DIA worst airport in the country. Avoid at all costs.Very rough getting into denver. my kid threw up it was so rough.Why wasn't this flight departure scheduled eith another crew so that it could leave on time? When we arrived in Denver we had so little time between flights we had run to the connecting flight. We should received some credit for the inconvenience.I was supposed to be on business class at first class from Denver back to Miami due to weather changes. I missed my connection and it’s put on a flight to Fort Lauderdale. Instead of honoring my business class/1st class ticket, they put me in coach, but there were two first class seats open. I think it’s absolutely disgusting that I paid for first class $1300 ticket and they put me in economy and they had to open seats available and I have still not been refunded the difference. I ended up having to eat a snack box instead of the meal I was supposed to get and did not get home till 2 AM so I think that’s a little pathetic that I had to live off crackers for dinner And my poor dog ate some cheese and salami. Oh yes, apparently when they switched me to the new flight they forgot to mention I had a service dogExcellent service despite turbulence during the flight. Flight attendants were remarkable!Flight attendant moved my bag without notifying me and was rude to me when I asked him about it. There was no reason to move it.The entertainment package was vast and the selections were very current. Keep updating it was great.The seat was so hard my tailbone was aching The crew was kind of a b**** because I made a joke that I didn't care if they close the door I total c*** when she was trying to f****** act like she was mad at me because I said that The flight was bumpy. Sure you didnt have control over that.Our bags took a long time to get unloaded once we landed.4 hours late, including over +1 hour waiting in plane to take off. Baggage left behind too.While waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.Was not able to watch most shows on the entertainment site. They would not loadOur flight was 1.5 hours delayed. There was no weather for the inbound flight, so I don't understand why. This meant a VERY late arrival and only a quick nap before my morning flight.Delayed flight, so I switched fights to SFO to Phoenix , Phoenix to DSM. Excellent service through American AirlinesAA re-routed flight from HNL to LAX due to delay. My group of 3 with reserved seats in row 9 was broken up, with one assigned to a middle seat, another in the last row of the plane. Not happy. No explanation to the delay. No apologies. No compensation. Would have been nice to be offered an Admiral Club admission or a voucher for the extra 3 hours of layover in LAX. Could not hear the boarding gate announcements in LAX. Adjacent gate was boarding at the same time. Loud speakers were competing against each other. Barely made my boarding group.Almost a 6 hour flight and the only food option is a cheese plate… and chips. Also how is it there are no options for texting on American. I’ll be going back to delta and united.Crew was great. No entertainment and food and beverage was for purchase only, even waterIt was canceled. The flight wasn’t rescheduled, everyone had to figure out their own new arrangements. They said we would get refunded our original fare and receive an additional $150. We received links for $100 only and they expired before we could activate them.The plane had originated in Las Vegas at 6:30 in the morning and flew to Moline where we boarded. The flight left around 12:30 PM and there were no boxed snacks available and many of the alcoholic beverages were unavailable. I would find it hard to believe that that many of the passengers coming from Las Vegas at 6:30 in the morning, drank and ate that much of the items. I can only come to the conclusion that someone failed to stock the plane for the round-trip. This is a huge revenue failure for the airline and disappointment for the passengers. The flight crew did not seem happy to be there and did not engage with passengers. Allegiant you can do better.They did not let my husband on the plane with our service animal at the last minute. Do NOT fly this airline with a service animal!Tight! Seats are not designed for those of us who wear extra-large clothes.The non-stop flight from Grand Rapids was excellent. I neither expected or needed a budget flight and Allegiant made the trip easy and for an affordable price, Arriving at the Mesa Airport (AZA) is a delight compared to the international airport. For our return flight, we were able to arrive 75 minutes before the flight, return the rental car, check our bag and make it to the gate in plenty of time. That would never happen at most airports.Easiest flights I’ve ever taken. Plane was comfortable without overly crowded seating.Terrible. Still have not received the refund from them. They sent it to some account that I don't even know. Spoke with costumer service and they are unable to help.I didn’t like it at all. I miss my second flight because of the delay on Allegiant Air now I m stuck in MCO.Good, but a bit late on take off after loading. Don't like charging for carry ons!Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.Frontier Airlines was AWFUL. I was an hour early for my flight and the lady refused to check me in. I had to purchase a whole new ticket with a different airline.Late, terrible communication, horrible planning of passenger seating until the literal last minute. One of the worst flying experiences of my life. Y'all suckFirst of all, we never got on the connecting flight to Denver. They delayed our flight for two hours. If we would have gotten on that flight, we would have been stuck in Denver for 13 hours. So we re- routed our flight for a straight through flight to Oklahoma two days later. THEN, they delayed that flight for two hours. After that we were able to finally get on our flight and come home. Frontier Airlines - one of the worst airlines I have ever been on.Terrible communication with weather delay, lost baggage, near impossible to reach customer serviceMy tickets got canceled on me by your site and I didn't have a flight. Then you kept sending me emails on the status of q flight I didn't have tickets for.Flight was late. Missed connecting in Denver. My new flight is more than 24 hours later and I have no room, vouchers, or compensation, and might also be bumped from the one tomorrow.This was one of the first frontier airline flights this spring that wasn't delayed. It actually left on time. Some of the flight crew did not look happy, they didn't smile when the passengers were boarding or getting off the plane, and the passengers initiated greetings, not the staff. To me this was an odd experience to have with any flight/airline. I had a bad experience booking this flight. The price didn't solidify until late hours into the night. Ever time I purchased the ticket, I either received a denial email or an error because the price has changed, but it was never reflected on the flyfrontier or kayak websites until way after midnight on the date of travel. This caused me anxiety and irritation with the websites. Then I noticed a mishap with my name on my voucher as I went to check in, it was incorrect. When I proceeded to correct it, Frontier had no easy, let alone free, way to remedy it. I couldn't correct my name without a $75 charge, I couldn't cancel my voucher to repurchase it with the correct name without a $100 charge, because it was too close to departure. Then calling frontier was nearly impossible to remedy the situation with a human. It's already difficult to want to choose frontier because of all the upcharges, but you feel kinda trapped into doing so because it's the more affordable airline.Southwest8.0United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Allegiant Air7.2Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from San Francisco to DenverAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from San Francisco to DenverFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from San Francisco to Denver according to KAYAK users.
