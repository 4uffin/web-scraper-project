Only the fish entree in the Japanese meal was overcooked and quite dry but everything else was greatGreat first time experience on this airline. Very professional staff and great service.Warm the bread. Movies: better choices to include Chinese movies options or some of the older winners of flim festivalI was able to change my flight last minute. It was more expensive, but that was my fault. Thank you for allowing me to fly!Business class on ANA was awesome. There lie flat seats made it easier to sleep on a 12 hour flight. Food was great and service was excellent.The crew was very nice and polite. They made sure everybody got their meal and drinks. Even the economy class had a very adequate leg room for someone that is over 6 foot tall.Overall it was good. Making changes to the reservation on ANA’s website was little challenging. Would like to see those features improved in the future.The flight crew was outstanding. Very cheerful and always respectful. I wish the same could be said about United. The AC wasn't the best on the plane.The seats are uncomfortable. The flight attendants are not pleasant. They do their job, but not with a ray of sunshine and warmth. The food was awful, not what I would expect from an Asian airline. All of the other Asian airlines I have flown have far better food. The food was on par with United airlines food, which is really bad. Maybe ANA should get out of the alliance with United.During booking, I selected the seats so that my wife and I would sit next to each other. However, the airline changed our seats at boarding so that we were seated apart. Very disappointing.highly recommend for trip to japan only reason why i gave good not excellent is because their selection of movies and tv shows in English is more limited .I avoid American Airlines for a reason. Our flight was delayed at LAX. The situation at the gate was chaotic. The woman making announcements wasn't being clear or transparent regarding why there were delays. There was a lot of confusion regarding flight and gate status. Other passengers were pretty rude. I was elbowed in the eye by someone who was in a hurry to get their bags from the overhead bin immediately after the flight landed. Ultimately, I will avoid AA as much as possible in the future.We asked for Hindu vegetarian meal in advance and the quality of the food was horrendous. Never flying JAL again!Japan airline is excellent service .I recommend to Kayak and Japan airline to Frend.Overall a great experience. One complain was the vegetarian food that my wife had which was mostly boiled vegetables with not much flavor.Very accommodating and kind airline crews. The plane is also big which makes the passengers more comfortable and relaxI actually didn’t make it onto the flight. I spent quite a few hours trying to rebook the flight just to get screwed out of $5000. Fun!We booked business class round trip from Delhi to San Diego and back. On our last leg from Bangalore to Delhi we were down graded to economy class which was big disappointment other than that everything was great.Had an incident with a stewardess who insisted that I take a seat. I informed her that I came to use the restroom and to have some water. After using the restroom, I wanted to stretch my legs out a little cuz my knees were aching from sitting. I understood her concern for my concern and the potential turbulence (she said she knows this route and the turbulence and safety is not to be taken lightly) but I felt that her mood, tone, demeanor, and a lack of compassion for the pain in my knees were not the proper way to address a customer or anyone for that matter. This left a bitter taste in my mouth. It was her lack of professionalism that surprised me.we have requested for hindu veg. meal during booking. but served meal was of very poor qualty and taste. they can get such meal from 5 star Indian restaurant at Vancouver/ tokyo/ Bangalore.pure hindu veg meal and no AVMLBetter screens, it would have been nice to have more comfortable seats.2nd major delay due to maintenance issues. 1st delay missed my connecting flight.It was great, but my bag was not loaded onto the connecting flight. I'm currently getting it resolved. If this isn't a problem, everything else was excellent.Very clean ,flight attendants very professional,nice , Boarding was very easyThe aircraft was massive (A-380) and became crowded with 400+ passengers on board.The plane hasnt left im stuck in seatle still my flight has been grounded for almost 5 hoursMy luggage didn’t arrive with my flight. Flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours while we sat on the plane and I almost missed my connecting flight and subsequently missed the last train from the airport so it took me another 2 hours to get to my destination after arriving, Crew skipped me several times when offering beverages, and I couldn’t get their attention at times because they wouldn’t even make eye contact with me. They didn’t give me a form for disembarking so I had to go to the back of the line after waiting an eternity for immigration. Paid for on flight wi- fi that didn’t work for most of the flight.Love flying Asiana. Been using it for over a decade now.Coming back to America was a peaceful flight everyone and everything was perfectThe staff was courteous and the flight was very smooth. It was so nice to see the captain greeting the passengers at the end of the flights.We had to deboard 2 times due to maintenance issues. They changed the plane, and then we got deviated to LAX due to maibtenance issues on the other plane, had to sleep at LAX and los a full day.From the first moment you interact with United Airlines, you can expect nothing less but extreme frustration. The baggage handler at the bag drop seems completely unbothered by the presence of customers waiting in line. No help was extended to load the baggage whatsoever. And if any of your bags is overweight by 0.01 pound they will make you re-distribute everything in your suitcase just to play power trip. When it was time to board no help was extended to customers to locate their seats. Moreover. It was a chaotic mess at the gate when it was unclear who should board first and everyone just bunched up, trying to get on the plane. I am sure the crew was doing their best to perform their jobs while being paid their wages however it shouldn’t be that hard to smile once or twice when you’re in the business if serving customers. It is a shame for the United States of America to have a flagship carrier of such low caliber. Our flight was also delayed by about an hour and a half due to further delays prior to our inbound flight. Being someone who has travelled for both business and leisure in Asia, Europe, and South America I have never experienced such poor quality of service.The pilots were late and it made us 1 hour late. The meat was tough and bok choy was also tough.Stuck on tarmac for two hours plus a 5.5 hour flight. Rude flight attendant. And no meals, not even for purchase!I learned that seating towards the end of plane that a line forms for the restroom and people use your chair as a hand railing, bumping your seat consistently. I was seated in the aisle. I think that next time if I am towards the back row I would want to sit in the middle or window seat.The best airline I have ever travel , really good customer service, attention and service !!Everything was great. Only thing that could’ve made it better was buy on board options for hot food, but the snacks were decent. The flight attendants were great. I had no complaints. I was able to make it to my destination safelyHorrific. They missed my connecting flight to San Diego. I didn’t get there until Monday at 9am when I had a mandatory court settlement conference scheduled at 6am since we had parties on the east coast. This caused many issues. All because United apparently forgot to hold the doors open until my flight landed that only had a 10 minute delay. This was the last flight to Southern California. So I couldn’t even rent a car to finish the trip. United cannot be trusted when traveling on specific days and times since weather didn’t have anything to do with the delays.Very comfortable (upgraded to business class). The audio on my screen didn’t work, but I managed to play the audio through my phone while watching the screen.Flight was late as pilot crew had to land at different airport in their previous flight. Passengers boarded and had to wait for pilots inside plane. Series of incomplete and unnecessary announcements by an annoying voice, rather than complete, informative announcements.Real smooth and easy, Real good leg room in coach!Re luggage I carried a backpack only. I did not check any bags in. However there were other passengers with carry on luggage going in the plane. My question is why are others allowed to have a carry on luggage inside the plane? Shouldn’t they have dropped it off at the gate? I’m asking because I could have brought the same thing instead of a backpack only. Please clarify for future reference. Thank you.Like the service. Very hard to communicate or contact when have problemsThey rescheduled me and I had no issues with the new flightNo paper towels in bathroom. Aisle seat difficult to get out of Other than those, excellent serviceBoth flights are delayed so I rate the whole experience as mediocre.Bad experience boarding and flight got delayed didn’t make it to my next flightThe food on the trip Toronto to Athens could be better: the chicken didn’t taste good.Before final boarding, my husband and I — both seniors — were told that we could not bring our carry-on bags with us due to being in Zone 6. The staff took our bags with little explanation, stating it was policy. While we understand boarding procedures may vary by zone, the way we were spoken to was unnecessarily rude and dismissive. We felt disrespected and singled out, and the interaction left us deeply uncomfortable. As seniors, we expect to be treated with courtesy and dignity, especially during travel when accommodations and communication matter most. We hope you will look into this matter and ensure better training for staff in handling such situations with more empathy and professionalism.Easy boarding and comfortable seating were plusses. Enjoyed the experience and good service from the captain and crew.
