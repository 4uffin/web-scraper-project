Comfortable seats. Served great Indian food and Masala Chai!Except for the uncleaned tray, and the delay in serving food for our section (which may have been due to the location of our row) everything else was good. The crew were very professional and responded to our requests promptly throughout the flight. We as a family were not disappointed by Emirates.It was great, a little more leg room would have been better particularly since we were in premium economyThe boarding process was smooth and the stewardesses were nice. Some delays with drinks at the end of the flight, but no issues.Thay crew was so nice.Air hostess il ham was so nice.my mom was little scray with airplan turbulence she help us alot.Seat 💺 was all the way on last row. Food was okay .Charged for internet that never really worked. The food selection was just ok.Boarding, seats, entertainment and service were all great. The food was great except for the fact that there were too many sweet items.Boarding, seats, entertainment and service were all great. Food was great except for the fact that there were too many sweet items.I was in a middle seat where I felt a bit too cramped otherwise the trip was goodCrew and service excellent. 2 hour delay for takeoff. SQ app showed flight on time.The usual excellent experience with Singapore Airlines. The airplane was on time and actually early to Haneda Airport. The onboarding experience was pleasant with no delays, perhaps owing to the fact that the flight was not full. Nevertheless, the air crew were their usual outstanding standards in serving the passengers.Good service and food. For buying items on flight should be preordered as they don’t keep much stock on board.We were not given option for meals since they ran out of the other option but good thing the remaining options tasted great.Very good flight from Boarding to landing -efficient and comfortable with decent entertainment optionsConstruction at PDX resulting in very lung walk from the rental car to the gate. SFO, extremely long walk between terminals to get to connecting Singapore airlines flight. My smart watch recorded a total of 3 miles.Crew and service was excellent, but passengers should be offered a welcome drink before take off which did not happen. Food was very good. Unfortunately the lie-flat bed in business class was one of the most uncomfortable I have experienced. The configuration forces you to sleep with your legs at an angle instead of in a straight line, plus there is very little padding on the bed so it wasn't possible to sleep for more than 2-3 hours on an 18 hour flight. For what the airlines charges for a business class ticket their hard product leaves a lot to be desired.Everything was great keep up the good work 😁, can't ask for more.Flight from SFO did not include entertainment as it was not working the entire duration of the flight. Was informed that there would be a $350 voucher for the inconvenience. Uncertain how the voucher will be provided.My entire row did not have power for the full duration of a 14.5 hour flight. Could not charge any devices such as laptop or phones for the entirety of the long flight. The flight attendants tried to remedy the issue by resetting the power, but were not successful. The only other solution provided was to move me to another seat on the plane which was in the middle row. I had paid for a “preferred” seat that was a window seat. This was a downgrade being offered due to the power issue.Nothing to complain. The staff and flight was good especially the seats which was better compared than the cloth ones on Qatar airwaysEconomy travel is really hard with no room to move especially when the person sitting beside you is an XL or XXL size person who if moving could hit your faceI was travelling 3.5 years after. Agree Economy is no business class but the food was mediocre. Ordered a Hindu meal, the salads were bitter . The food was really below quality and had no tast from what I had in the past. Indian Railways probably have a better quality food when compared. However the kids meal was really nice and really appreciate how they were taken care of. The restrooms were dirty .My flight was with American Airlines 120. The flight was delayed 3 hours and I missed my connection. When I arrived in Doha, the AA staff told me to call an 800 number to rebook a different flight, which was unacceptable. Eventually a Qatar Air staff member helped rebook me on a flight to Manila, that was 12 hours later. They offered me a hotel and meal voucher which I declined, because I didn’t want to leave the airport. Long story short, I spent 12 hours in the Doha airport waiting for my next flight.Overall the experience was neat with crew being nice and caring especially to parent with kids. The free snacks option was okay. The kiosk at Philly airport didn’t work.Reason for travelling Tampa to Orlando is to fly Qatar Airline. we end up with American Airline. This was the miserable experience I ever had in my entire travel history. Flight attendants were rude. They hit my knee with the food cart and I was holding ice pack for 2 hours. I still have the pain after a week. WE boarded the flight twice because of the temperature inside the plan.First keep the airline as you promise. Reason for travelling from Orlando to Tampa is to go with Qatar Airline. We end up with American Airline. As expected the service was horrible.Not sure how we end up with American Airlines instead of Qatar Airways. From Philadelphia to Qatar they boarded us then they asked us to unload. After 30 minutes later they board us again. The inside the plane it was burning hot and we were sweating like crazy. Crew members are absolute rude. The way they served the passengers were horrible. One of the crew members hit my knee with food cart and kept going. I was holding an ice pack for almost 2 hours. I am still with the pain.I felt that when I was rerouted it should have been to business class.Rude staff. I would avoid using the word racist but definitely partially or discriminatory. My 72 yrs old mother who is also disabled was traveling on this flight. She was the second passenger boarded to the plane. The First elderly couple ahead of my mother were allowed to use the airplane bathroom but my mother was denied entry stating it was for safety reasons. My mother objected the the couple in front of her were allowed but hostess still stated that due to the flight safety reasons she can’t use it. Even my mother explained that he is using blood pressure medication that’s why she have to use the restroom frequently but the crew continued arguing her. At one point the Mae attendent even suggested that if that’s the case my mother can urinate in her seat. The level of disrespect against an elderly lady is beyond my comprehension. This matter will be taken to the social media to shame the employees involved.my experience was great with Turkish airlines . the problem i encountered was with kayak booking. When I booked . it showed that im allowed a bag . and when I got to the airport, i had to pay $165 for one bag.Not up to Business Class standards. Two of the three toilets were out of order. The hostesses were aware and didn’t show any responsible act to do something. Food quality was not what we expect from Turkish hospitality. Overall we were not impressed and disappointed.During mid flight, try to get a flight attendant to help I couldn’t find one Otherwise, everything was perfectI was not given basinett seat.The connecting flight was missed due to airline fault i was not accomodated for hotel.Drinks were normt served frewuently.Never travelling again on tirkish airlines.I always travel wiyh family by turkish airline but no more.zero starsThe crew were very hospitable and pleasant. The food was pretty good. Unfortunately, there was a flight delay of more than 2 hours. We're not sure why but it appeared to be outside the control of Turkish Airlines.Outdated business class on this aircraft, no flat bed, and even minimal recline. Couldn’t sleep at all. Laggy and outdated entertainment system. Food sub standard.Bough tickets with luggage, but made me pay at Airport as wellThe economy seat was so uncomfortable, had not enough leg room for 13 hours flight, front seat basket was broken and couldn’t hold anything, food quality was horrible( we got food poisoned ) we charged for logged which used to be free. We paid too much for this flight and very disappointed. Turkish air line better to make satisfy and respect people instead of find different way to scam people.This is really the rating of two flights. JFK to IST then IST to NQZ. New York to Istanbul was good. Good crew and all positives. The flight to Astana was so bad that brought it all down. Crew was nonexistent above the minimum, seats were cramped, and it was hot on the plane. Turkish Airlines seems to be slipping down to US based carriers level.Overall it was good. But air planes should be upgraded.only passenger seats are too much narrow. It’s not comfortable otherwise it’s good. Seats are very important because it’s main in TravelMiss my flight from delhi to amritsar due to lock the luggage door of airplane.and there was no more flight even for next days and they not refund the fare. I took bus grom delhi.. bad experiance.very run down aircraft. seat tilted. the mobile / magazine holder was broken. The entertainment screen was not working. The crew was good, polite and helpfulBoarding was through bus even though aerobridges were empty. Major messNever can get flight and nof light for three days .finally travel by bus. Very bad experience.Extremely bad experience compared to Vistara. No priority in check in, no priority for boarding. No upgrade. Seat selection is paid. Curtains were dirty. Demo bag was dirty. Warmth of the crew was missing.Mumbai to New York was not comfortable as I was given different sits in hat what I paid forThe flight got delayed and was not updated in time.Food not of any international or even Indian standard. We have many cuisine available but only paneer & sundry items. Improve & provide some good indian items. Entertainment website or channel out of order.Emirates8.1Singapore Airlines8.1Qatar Airways7.4Turkish Airlines7.3Air India5.5Everything you need to know for your flight from San Francisco to MumbaiAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from San Francisco to MumbaiFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from San Francisco to Mumbai according to KAYAK users.
