Food was great except for the fact that there were too many sweet items.I have difficulties to book wheelchair for my parents returned flightI was in a middle seat where I felt a bit too cramped otherwise the trip was goodCrew and service excellent. 2 hour delay for takeoff. SQ app showed flight on time.Good service and food. For buying items on flight should be preordered as they don’t keep much stock on board.Very good flight from Boarding to landing -efficient and comfortable with decent entertainment optionsConstruction at PDX resulting in very lung walk from the rental car to the gate. SFO, extremely long walk between terminals to get to connecting Singapore airlines flight. My smart watch recorded a total of 3 miles.Loved the airline with the exception of their carry on limitations. They enforce a strict 7 kilo limit for carry on baggage which is ridiculous. We traveled from SFO to SIN with carry on with no difficulty yet when we checked in Delhi they forced us to check the carry on bags. The weight of our carry on bags were 11 and 12 kilos and while they exceeded the limitations set by Singapore Airlines they were well under weight limitations set by may other carriers. Interestingly my wife and I were each allowed two 22 KG bags to check in addition to the 7 kg carry on for a total weight of 102 KG's. Our total weight with the one bag we planned to check and our two carry ons was 46 kgs.Crew and service was excellent, but passengers should be offered a welcome drink before take off which did not happen. Food was very good. Unfortunately the lie-flat bed in business class was one of the most uncomfortable I have experienced. The configuration forces you to sleep with your legs at an angle instead of in a straight line, plus there is very little padding on the bed so it wasn't possible to sleep for more than 2-3 hours on an 18 hour flight. For what the airlines charges for a business class ticket their hard product leaves a lot to be desired.Everything was great keep up the good work 😁, can't ask for more.Flight from SFO did not include entertainment as it was not working the entire duration of the flight. Was informed that there would be a $350 voucher for the inconvenience. Uncertain how the voucher will be provided.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.My husband upgraded our seats and I don't know if it was due to the type of planet was or if they didn't upgrade our seats. We were supposed to be in I believe comfort seats and they were just as tight as any other seat- no leg room and we are very tall people but at least it wasn't extremely cold. My husband did put in a complaint about our seating because he paid extra and if we would have known that the space and the tightness would have been the same, we just would have gotten the emergency row emergency row seats that we normally get. We love Delta but both our flights coming home we're not good. Oh I forgot to mention that on our flight to Hawaii our luggage wheels got broke and we had to purse new luggage on vacation then we never had this problem so we didn't know protocol and reported it after we got home only for them to tell is we only had 24hrs to report the damage. Not sure what was going on with Delta this vacation trip.Crew was excellent. Comfort seats not as nice as other kinds of planes.It was a great flight and the stewards and stewardess were all kind and accommodating!! The seats were comfortable and entertainment screen excellent!There are 4 flights in consecutive gates with about the same departure time. Two flights were boarding at the same time. One was delayed or boarding would be happening at the same time. I am not sure what Delta and LAX need to do to have a better layout at the end of Terminal 2There was a security issue at the airport and we were unable to land. We circled endlessly and then landed at another airfield for fuel. We then circled the airport again, almost landed but didn’t fully touch down before circling again. I am thankful to the crew for keeping us safe- the issue was the airline and staff at the airport getting us seats on our connecting flights. That part was hours of searching for someone and getting in double my steps.Most aspects were good however if they assign boarding zones they ought to enforce them or why bother? My luggage from SAN-JFK-MAD was lost in NY so I without my main bag for two days upon arrival in Spain. They were helpful in tracking it and eventually delivered it to my hotel. The flub was because of a delay upon arrival in NYC. I had booked 2 1/2 hours between flights but we had to hold on the taxiway for an hour after landing while waiting for a clear gate which likely caused the baggage error.Excellent flight, the planes were newer, they did a nice job with boarding, great service overall.It would be nice if was given wires ear buds. Overall was a good experience was able to sleep on the plane737-800 in first class was pretty dumpy. Seat had an uncomfortable angle, storage under the seat was blocked so even my very modest backpack didn't fit, power outlet was flaky. Weird tiny seat pockets that couldn't hold a gallon ziploc bag, emesis bag missing, etc. etc. No in-flight service due to turbulence. Crew was excellent, boarding was smooth despite a full flight.My entire row did not have power for the full duration of a 14.5 hour flight. Could not charge any devices such as laptop or phones for the entirety of the long flight. The flight attendants tried to remedy the issue by resetting the power, but were not successful. The only other solution provided was to move me to another seat on the plane which was in the middle row. I had paid for a “preferred” seat that was a window seat. This was a downgrade being offered due to the power issue.Nothing to complain. The staff and flight was good especially the seats which was better compared than the cloth ones on Qatar airwaysEconomy travel is really hard with no room to move especially when the person sitting beside you is an XL or XXL size person who if moving could hit your faceI was travelling 3.5 years after. Agree Economy is no business class but the food was mediocre. Ordered a Hindu meal, the salads were bitter . The food was really below quality and had no tast from what I had in the past. Indian Railways probably have a better quality food when compared. However the kids meal was really nice and really appreciate how they were taken care of. The restrooms were dirty .My flight was with American Airlines 120. The flight was delayed 3 hours and I missed my connection. When I arrived in Doha, the AA staff told me to call an 800 number to rebook a different flight, which was unacceptable. Eventually a Qatar Air staff member helped rebook me on a flight to Manila, that was 12 hours later. They offered me a hotel and meal voucher which I declined, because I didn’t want to leave the airport. Long story short, I spent 12 hours in the Doha airport waiting for my next flight.Overall the experience was neat with crew being nice and caring especially to parent with kids. The free snacks option was okay. The kiosk at Philly airport didn’t work.Reason for travelling Tampa to Orlando is to fly Qatar Airline. we end up with American Airline. This was the miserable experience I ever had in my entire travel history. Flight attendants were rude. They hit my knee with the food cart and I was holding ice pack for 2 hours. I still have the pain after a week. WE boarded the flight twice because of the temperature inside the plan.First keep the airline as you promise. Reason for travelling from Orlando to Tampa is to go with Qatar Airline. We end up with American Airline. As expected the service was horrible.Not sure how we end up with American Airlines instead of Qatar Airways. From Philadelphia to Qatar they boarded us then they asked us to unload. After 30 minutes later they board us again. The inside the plane it was burning hot and we were sweating like crazy. Crew members are absolute rude. The way they served the passengers were horrible. One of the crew members hit my knee with food cart and kept going. I was holding an ice pack for almost 2 hours. I am still with the pain.I felt that when I was rerouted it should have been to business class.We had extra baggage which is an ordinary event. The check-in counter experience for them to calculate the additional amount owed and collect payment was terrible - very manual, multiple counters to resolve, took more than 30 minutesNever can get flight and nof light for three days .finally travel by bus. Very bad experience.Food not of any international or even Indian standard. We have many cuisine available but only paneer & sundry items. Improve & provide some good indian items. Entertainment website or channel out of order.First and the foremost I was shocked to see airindia standards have come down so low . The food was horrible . They served us 3 meals for vegetarian and all the was paneer . The orange juice was not at all cold it was smelly . After you take this heavy price air India should learn from other air lines . I at one point felt like throwing up . After all this when we landed we were not given landing slip . We had to wait for 45 min at the immigration just because no one was given landing slip . To top it all we were 3 passengers and had checked in 4 check in luggage . Out of which 3 have not yet arrived . Basically status says the loaded it in our flight ( this was a direct fight ) and it never reached . We are still waiting . There is nothing great to tell about our flight . The he only good thing was the crew were very helpful .Bags got damaged for multiple passengers, and they wouldn't even reimburse the depreciated price of the bag.Lay out shows 1st row and second row given after taking payment. It's a fraudThe seats were extremely uncomfortable. Air India seats used to be very comfortable . with sufficient legroom. In this aircraft there was no legroom. It is a shame that for your profit margins you are trying to pack people like cattle on these long haul flights. The food was terrible. The bread was hard like a rock. Mr CEO of Air India, why don’t you take a flight in economy from India to USA and experience the hardships first hand. It is utter disgraceAbsolutely nothing. Cold and unpleasant airline staff, and to top it all, the entertainment system was broken. Really harrowing experience.BAD experience. Entertainment system was not working and most of the passengers had this issue. Staff was not helpful. Meal was yuck. Bad old flights.Communication was terrible. Flight was delayed for 4-5 hours in DC (on the front end, and also after we boarded, we had to get off - some issue with fueling the old plane correctly). There was little to no information on timing or what was happening. Once we reach Delhi airspace, apparently there was weather that caused us not to land - we were actually near the ground, saw the run way, and lifted back up to the sky after being sooo close. Then we circled for about 30 minutes, and they decided to go to Jaipur to land until the weather cleared and to refuel. Again, once we landed in Jaipur (wrong city), there was little to no information on timing or what was happening. Then we heard that the crew was reaching their 24 hours. We sat on the place, on the tarmac for another 3 HOURS, with no food and not enough water for everyone on the flight. Then, they kicked us off the plane with no plan, in the wrong city. We went thru customs, got our bags (thank goodness), and had to ask a bunch of staff what was happening and what to do. Eventually, their soltuion was to bus people back to Delhi (like 6 hours we were told) but not everyone would fit on the bus, and unknown timing on when it would leave. At this point it was 9PM (we were scheduled to arrive in Delhi at 11AM...). My husband and I decided to risk it and take a cab that we had to pay ourselves (about $200 US dollars) to get to Delhi (about 5 hour drive). We both had terrible trips back to the US as well - almost missed connecting flight, forced to pay for carry-on luggage (a small back pack!) and duty-free goods by the Air India staff last minute. Just terrible experience all around. Never again with AI! The ONLY good thing was the air hostesses were kind and patient - example: they made sure people with food allergies got their correct.Emirates8.1Singapore Airlines8.1Delta7.9Qatar Airways7.4Air India5.5Everything you need to know for your flight from San Francisco to BengaluruAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from San Francisco to BengaluruFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from San Francisco to Bengaluru according to KAYAK users.
