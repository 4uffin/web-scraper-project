Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.It is clear that someone knew, and competent, is in charge of food at United Airlines at least for the international flights. I was flying in coach, but the choices of the dinner were excellent. Tasty, and appropriate size. I had the beef, which was a little bit like a shepherds pie, and it was good. Nothing comparable has been served on a United flight in years. It will not be confused with three star food, but it is very good for airline food. Even better was the breakfast choice between a cinnamon roll and a breakfast sandwich. I chose the breakfast sandwich which was absolutely delicious and which I would happily order again at my local Starbucks or Panera. It is clear that someone knew indifferent is in charge of the food and it’s about time.Plane was crowded and even when we hit altitude, the plane was hot, not enough air flow.Flight was delayed and missed my connection Lufthansa didn’t respond.the delay for 3 hours was understandable due to weather conditions but the flight should’ve provided some on flight compensations or at least provide more food.United could have one single once of customer service. No human United employee would help me with the invalid mileage plus number, they said I had to speak with the computer.Overall it was good. I missed my connection but I was put on another flight.The attendant were friendly. I suggest you have a medical attendant on board every flight so that in case someone is sick , he/she will help them.Although the flight was delayed the crew and the flight itself were very good. Couldn't fault anything and after the disappointment of being abandoned in the US by BA it was a welcome relief to travel with UnitedThere's nothing I liked about it. For first off I scheduled this trip two weeks in advance then they delayed my flight which messed up my whole trip. So I scheduled it for the following weekend thinking there won't be a delay and guess what as soon as I got to the airport we said in the airplane on the tarmac for an hour and a half. Not only was it delayed I missed my connecting flight meaning I had to stay the night at Dallas-Fort Worth airport sleeping on the floor. I will tell you this I will never fly American airlines ever again I have had nothing but horrible experience with them and I just throw money at themAfter we'd boarded , they canceled the flight. The crew didn't even know , we just all received text messages. Then after they deplaned us , AA was just like "too bad, go F your self, we sure ain't gonna help you"Initial flight was cancelled at the time of arrival to the airport, flight alternative requires switching from direct to flight with a layover, and the plane felt like it would split apart, it was so rattle-y.Weather delay for 2.5 hours followed by half hour crew delay, did not have ginger ale, uncomfortable seatsIt was nobody’s fault - but the plane came 4-hrs late and we were updated randomly in 20-30 mins increments which left us hostage to sit and wait expectantly. It was very long and got very late. Our plane didn’t land until nearly 1 am! Also the toilet wasn’t working. The hosts were nice enough but were clearly “about to pass out” as one told me. Lastly, there was no snack or even time for it. Just a bad experience overall.The boarding crew was incredibly helpful getting me on an earlier flightThey changed my seat from one that I had paid for as an upgrade to a regular seat at the last minute.Great experience. Flight boarded easily. Departed early. Smooth flight. Great arrival in DC--almost no taxing! Almost direct to gate from runway. Crew was terrific. Same cookies and beverages in main cabin. I did not use the entertainment system on this flight.Flight delayed on both ends - have a gate ready at DCA, don't make us sit for 30min after being late to take off as well.AA can't control the weather. But the airplane was hot and stuffy while stuck on the runway with a broken entertainment system.Spirit is low fare air line. Food also cost you. No free food.Everyone was kind for the most part. I did travel with children and paid for seats and even then it was not as suitable. I tried calling their customer service prior to check in and I was told they couldn't help me because I didn't purchase my tickets with them.I think the staff was nice. They took time to explain safety protocols. Boarding was great. They started early and our flight left a little early which was convenient. Having free games to play would have been betterJust total easy flight experience!! What could you do better..? Hmmm..? There was nothing I can remember. Spirit was a far more comfortable and easy process than American, United & Delta. I'll always look for Spirit and I've told a few people about, since flying this past trip!! I'm a SPIRIT FAN!! Thank You, SPIRIT AIRLINES!! Very, VERY well done, 100%!! See you...SOON!! -Best, Linda R.The flight was 3.5 hrs delayed. I was not notified prior to arriving to the airport via spirit app. or via boarding pass that I already had loaded on my phone. The agent that i saw at the counter didn’t mention anything about the delay either. I only saw the update after logging in to my email account.Better than my las vagas experience, but still dissapointed with the airline support service.Unfortunately, spirits crew had us boarding and parking the plane often, would wait long periods of time before allowing the people attending the flight on the plane to know what was going on this caused for my plane to not only get diverted but then canceled at an airport 2 hours away and basically stranded with charter buses MAYBE being hired. I was left with no choice but to stay overnight and use a comp room in Altantic City to then arrive home the next day. This trip was the first time seeing my partner since he joined the Air Force and this stressful ride caused unwarranted tears on what was supposed to be an east flight home. I understand weather is unpredictable but to have passengers deboard to then reboard an hour later to taxi on the runway for another hour to then basically leave an entire fight stranded. I waited almost 30 minutes at the airport and not one employee could tell me about a charter bus so I had to leave and make accommodations to stay overnight and get a ride home.Great! We boarded on time! Everything went so smoothly! The flight was so smoothSeats uncomfortable, hard to check luggage, etc. It was like the last flight out of HanoiI will never fly with Spirit again. I was late getting through TSA after dealing with traffic and getting on the wrong shuttle. I got to the gate 2 minutes before the ticket said the gate closes and they agents were gone and doors were closed. They rescheduled my flight for 12 hours later and the agent had the nerve to tell me, “Be on time next time”. I was already upset from nothing going right for me that morning. I booked another flight through Alaska Airlines and they were very accommodating, nerer again Spirit Airlines!!!!I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from George Bush Intcntl to Washington, D.C.AirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsHouston George Bush Airport (IAH)Cabin class types available on flights to Washington, D.C.Cabin classes available on flights to Washington, D.C..
