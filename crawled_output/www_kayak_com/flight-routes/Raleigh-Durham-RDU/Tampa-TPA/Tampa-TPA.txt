The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!10.0 ExcellentG, Sep 2025LAS - ATLRead more Southwest reviewsI wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.Great! Only problem is we can’t use the northbound flight on this route as it arrives much too late and is not non-stop.Given some type of snack. Had staff that hated their job and life in general. Have regular overhead bins. The bags have to go sideways and even then, they barely fit. The seats in the front - what would be considered business class were nice. Nothing extra but nice for a short flight. But the regular seats were so close I have no idea how people even fit it them.Our gate was changed twice, but since they were super close it wasn't an issue. We were delayed 90 mins or so, which wasn't great, but sometimes that's just what happens. Communication was the issue. We weren't kept informed about delays--with more information I would have gotten a real meal, taken a "bio break" and purchased a new book. Because another. flight was being updated more frequently about their delays, I thought ours would be shorter and stayed close by. It left me feeling more frustrated than was necessary.Your feedback should include a "not applicable" button. There was no food, nor entertainment on our flight. Also, a snack on a short flight will be nice to haveBoarding at BDL gate 24 was confused, but balanced out by friendly, responsive gate attendants. The crew were friendly and made for a straightforward flight. Seats were fine, but the aircraft needs to go in for cabin maintenance. The air nozzles overhead were all loose and could not be closed or adjusted.Head rest did not move, very uncomfortable. Staff was great. There was no entertainment, would be nice not to have to pay for snack.Worst airline - on our flight down from MCO to EYW, there was a huuuuuge delay. We were supposed to take off 12p and it was pushed back to almost 2:30p. We boarded the plane and then sat on the tarmac forever because we were "over" weight and had to burn fuel. Rather than ask guests to volunteer and leave, they kept us on the plane. Finally a family decided to off board and take their luggage with them. Shortly after, we left the terminal but then the pilot told us we may have to sit at the end of the runway for 15-20mins to burn more fuel. Which we ended up doing and of course it started to rain. We finally took off 2:50p. We were supposed to land 1p and didn't land until 3:45p. Basically had time to scramble off the plane, grab our luggage, request transportation to our hotel, unpack, rinse off and hustle over to our 6:30p dinner ressy. It's a shame Breeze is the only non-stop airline from MCO to EYW. For this, not sure I'd ever go back to EYW - most def will not take Breeze again.Flight was rescheduled from (originally) early Saturday departure to a late Sunday departure. Then the late Sunday departure was delayed again (weather) and got in very late. We’ve enjoyed Breeze a lot, but this particular experience was a little disappointing.Breeze was good but the sandiego airport had traffic and waiting 1 hour in the plane till take offThe return flight was soooooo much colder than the departure flight to Connecticut! I appreciated the layover because I didn't have to change planes. The staff and the service were the best! Everyone was so professional and accommodating. Having internet was great, but for the movies the flight offers through the app could be updated. THANKS EVERYONE! I fly BREEZE every opportunity I can get.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Always good but we must do something about people in rows ahead of you that don't put their seats back up when they are suppose to. And It's rough to not be able to even lean over to get something out of my purse.Flight was delayed, 30+ bags had to be gate checked. Crew were very friendly!this crew didn't care much. bumping carts into seats more times than i care to rememberEverything was fine except the entertainment was not working for half of the flight.Easy boarding with an extremely kind attendant. Seats were spacious and we had 3 seats for 2 people so we could stretch out. Comfortable air flow and very attentive and hospital attendants. Bathrooms and food were the only negative. Bathrooms were so small you could hardly get in and close the door. I don’t think an obese person would fit or a person with a movement disability. Food was the trending food for flights, nonexistent. We spent $40 getting sandwich and snack at airport for our 6 hour flught.I am very bothered by the events today. I can't believe the flight attendants allowed someone to take my seat and made me move. It was embarrassing. I was in the right. The lady just didn't want move. I can't believe delta would allow this to stand and disrespect my rights as a passenger. The lady complained about her leg and that she couldn't move. Firstly somehow she was able to make it to row 24. Not sure how much her leg could have hurt. Secondly, I'm in plenty of pain myself. I just finished chemotherapy a several weeks ago. My body is constantly sore. Yet deltas flight attendants didn't appropriately protect my rights. In the end they found me a seat on the plane but I want to understand how delta can operate this way. They in essence allowed a bully to get their way.Delta is my preferred airline. I've traveled with them for years. On time in most cases, good communication, easy to use app. Most planes are pretty nice. I was on a CRJ 700/900 however, which was pretty badly aged inside and needed a refresh. No infotainment, unreliable wifi, best to download before boarding or bring a book. Food choices are really just snacks on this flight, nice variety but about what you'd expect. Great staff and prompt in departure and early arrival too. Overall quite satisfied.Crew was friendly Love the entertainment in the seat head rest.The WiFi didn't seem as fast as it normally isWish they had the seat-back video screens for watching movies or playing games.Very good but wish they had the seat-back video screens for movies & gamesFlight was delayed not sure why no explanation given and no apologies either. Otherwise the flight was fineWhile waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.Flight delays numerous times. Everytime we would get close to boarding it would be delayed again. Strung along the entire time.This flight never occurred because AA couldn’t get their act together.During service there was a garbage/beverage spill near our seats that never was cleaned up. On a relatively short flight when we’re fortunate enough to actually have in flight movies available, the flight attendants pitching the AADVANTAGE credit card shouldn’t talk for the last 10 minutes of the flight so that we miss the end of the movie.Waited on the runway for takeoff for 2.5 hours. Air traffic rerouted us. The plane didn't have enough fuel, so had to go back to the gate. Had to wait for a new pilot. Should have landed at 5:22. Didn't land until 9:10. Trash flight.The boarding was pretty easy. However, the first class seats are not lay flat as other airlines (like JetBlue) has and therefore sleeping was a challenge.Everything about the flight was lovely…We left early, arrived early, cabin crew were efficient and helpful. Flight was easy and most pleasant.I was 2 hr arrive in the airport and 45 min in the line . After take to my turn . The agent tell me I’m later . I can not board . So my vacation was going to the floor . Just for their bad customer service agent in the airline2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.Since you have to pay for overhead bags then they shouldn't be running out of space and asking individuals who paid to remove stuff from the overheadBook with frontier airlines with the mentality that they'll cancel your flight, kick you off and lose your luggage. Anything besides that is a win. Compare prices with other airlines (to include luggage) and if frontier is still worth it, book it but know all of their policies.You get what you pay for nothing essentially but a hard uncomfortable seat that doesn’t recline and kids screaming all around you and chaotic boarding and limited check bag weight allowance when compared to other airlinesI liked the price of the flight and the chance to buy a seat with no person seated in the middle seat.. Also the flight was right on time.Not very good. Paid in excess of $400 for assigned seating for my family and that was not provided. I want that money back.I chose the seats when booked the flight and paid for them. However after checking in I found we were assigned different seats!It was a no frills flight. Would have liked to be able to charge my deviceSeats were extremely uncomfortable and it was very hot on the plane.Southwest8.0Breeze Airways8.0Delta7.9American Airlines7.2Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Raleigh to TampaAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsRaleigh (RDU)Tampa (TPA)Cabin class types available on flights from Raleigh to TampaCabin classes available on flights from Raleigh to Tampa.
