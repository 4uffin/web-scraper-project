The crew was fantastic.On this flight I felt the food offering was not as complete as on previous flights. The tomato salad was a bit off and there was nothing additional such a bread or butter. The breakfast was only one option, so you either ate what they had or ate nothing. The crew was efficient, but most seemed frustrated throughout the flight. The flight arrived early and was obstacle-free, so I’m overall quite happy, but the shine in the rest of the experience just wasn’t there.Great flight with Delta! Boarding was quick and easy, the amenities were solid, and the plane was in great shape. The flight attendants had a fun, lively energy while staying professional. All in all, a smooth trip — even managed to catch up on some rest. Thanks, Delta!De planning was an absolute mess. We were never told that we weren’t at the gate and that we had to go down unstable stairs and then hop on a bus. People were falling, we couldn’t tell who was in charge. Overall terrible communication that ended up leaving a bad impression at the very end of the experience.For a 69 year old with health problems I had the worse experience, no wheelchair when I entered a lady told me to sit and wait while a gentleman told me I had to walk to the Delta station, which I did. I had a carry on and a bag, and I was traveling with my service dog, which was on his carrier and the lady charged me for my carry on luggage, beside all the waiting cause of the delay, I had to walk to get my luggage cause no wheelchair showed up, I am so disappointed. I will get in touch with the company. I got home at 3:00 am, not good for my health situation.Flight was delayed, 30+ bags had to be gate checked. Crew were very friendly!My flight was canceled after being rescheduled for four days canceling my trip. Kayak and everyone affiliated with it I.e the airlines, and just fly have been excruciating to deal with. My trip to visit family had to be canceled as there was no way to make it. I am furious at all of you.They delayed our flight because of bad weather in NY which was completely understandable. Then they cancelled our flight and a later flight that evening. The earliest we could fly was the next morning. We ended up buying last minute tickets on another airline and made it home slightly delayed but safely that evening. Delta kept saying it was weather related but if that was the case how did we make it back on another airline? The weather in NY was cloudy but not bad.I like for how they process during check in. It was very smoothly.Most aspects were good however if they assign boarding zones they ought to enforce them or why bother? My luggage from SAN-JFK-MAD was lost in NY so I without my main bag for two days upon arrival in Spain. They were helpful in tracking it and eventually delivered it to my hotel. The flub was because of a delay upon arrival in NYC. I had booked 2 1/2 hours between flights but we had to hold on the taxiway for an hour after landing while waiting for a clear gate which likely caused the baggage error.All of the United employees I interacted with were professional and courteous. The aircraft was clean, the food on the flight was good. No complaints here.There was no food available for this red eye... one little waffle cookie for a 6+ hour flight... thank God I was able to sleep someTerrible. Delayed 7 hours, and cancelled the flight, leaving me stranded and out of pocket $500 for an alternative last minute flightNot a great experience. We paid for the upgrade for premium economy seats and seated ourselves in very comfortable seats. Someone came along with the same seat on their boarding pass. The aircraft had been changed and as a result we were booted out and sent further back to small uncomfortable seats. After complaining we were moved to emergency row seats, which gave us more leg room but the seats don’t recline. For people in our 70’s we found having to sit upright from California to NJ very uncomfortable. Not sure why they chose to move senior citizens instead of the two people that were allowed to take the more comfortable seats. Not happy.Cramped seat even in economy plus seat 10A. Over booked flight, no space for the bagsVery comfortable (upgraded to business class). The audio on my screen didn’t work, but I managed to play the audio through my phone while watching the screen.Turbulent taking off & landing to Dulles from Raleigh. Flight from Dulles to Tokyo very good!!get E+, a must for 5 hours flight if you are tallMultiple delays and not straight answer from the United teamI just got back from a trip with 3 flights each way. The flights were good and we were happy with out experience. There was one steward on our first flight that was harsh and grump with passengers. It did not leave a good impression. All of the other flight crews were great on the other five flights.There was no TV's on the plane? I tried to activated the WiFi multiple times before the plane took off but it wasn't work well.Air Marco’s fleet of airplanes are old and pathetic. The seats are torn and stained. The monitors don’t work properly. If this wasn’t a business trip and I had control of booking the flight, I would not travel on this carrier.Good service, friendly staff. Food was average for airlines and the seats were small.Pathetic check in experience once again. Not enough staff scheduled at bag drop or for special assistance at LHR. Really need to rethink the whole self check in procedure. The crew was good. A very decent selection of special meals in this leg as compared to the JFK-LHR leg.Flight was cancelled 3 hrs AFTER etd. Thetefore Missed connection from JFK to New Zealand . No accommodation provided… This cost ne aporox 1000 USD in extra expenses and turned whst should have been a 24 hr trip ftom Boston - New Zealand into a VERY expensive , late 70+ hr nightmare … Complete nonsense!!!Overall fine, but the delay was annoying and the reasons for the delay were not communicated. The crew on board were phenomenal!This flight never occurred because AA couldn’t get their act together.Whenever a passenger purchase a ticket his advantage number should automatically to his information. It's not everyone remember the number. You request for your number and American airline agent say they will email it....and they never email anything and you loose your mileage just because you don't remember your number. It should automatically go your information and associate with your email account at all timesNewark airport grounded inbound flight and only announced when the flight was about to start taxing.Boarding took forever, the plane was cramped and cold, and the seatbelt song came on constantly throughout the red eye flight with a loud pre-recorded message playing each timeI don’t usually fly budget airlines or airlines in the United States. It was as good as any other airline. The seats are comfortable and the airline attendants are not rude & surly. Very nice flight (s).They have the most inexperienced / rude flight staff I’ve encounteredI paid extra for a seat closer to the front. The TV didn’t work at all for the entire flight. Would have been nice to know before I purchased an “upgraded “ seatToo many long delays with JetBlue. Worst major airline that serves JFK but unfortunately I keep going back because of the prices.flight cancelled after 2 delays. left us sitting in JFK at 1am. no customer service to assist rebooking.To not have food or proper snacks on a 5 hour flight was the worst.Spend hours delayed with no food, water anything sitting on the aieplane with no ability to eat or use the restroom. My entire experience was the absolute worst. I will never fly jet Blue again.It would have been nice if they had offered more than one set of snacksGround crew gave me interference about carrying a laptop and a small shoulder bag, even though I told them I traveled with them all the time. I then placed my laptop bag in my carryon and took out a medical device, and ground crew still tried to give interference. I had to remind them that medical devices don't count towards luggage limits. It was quite annoying and unneThe gate and ground staff were excellent, friendly, went out of their way to acknowledge my Mosaic status. The plane was an older Airbus, so the seats were a little worn. The in flight attendant was not very nice, and seemed to be annoyed to be at work or be on this flight. Flight was fast and we landed early and pilots kept us informed.Frontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone.
