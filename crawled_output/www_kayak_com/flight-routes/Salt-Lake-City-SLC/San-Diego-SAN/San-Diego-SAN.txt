Told to go in one direction and then met with a very rude agent when we did. He blamed his attitude on all the folks flying over labor day that were paying his salary. Gate area for D3 is a mess compared to the North terminal. Overall Alaska is number 1 in my book.This time it is good, no delay and right on timeAgent boarding us in San Diego lectured me on showing up on time for the flight, and said that if I had been three minutes later, he would have denied myself and my wife boarding. Our trusted traveler numbers were not in the system, even though I entered them when I bought the tickets. Our food orders were not in the system, even though I entered them prior to the flight. My wife requires a wheelchair, and that was delayed on both flights.Staff at Gate desk were helpful. My connecting flight from the first part of my trip Kona to Seattle was late. I had to run through SeaTac Seattle to catch my flight to San Jose. They made an exception to let me board. On my return trip San Jose to San Diego and San Diego to Honolulu the same thing happened. One flight arrived late and I had to run through the terminal to catch my connection. There are no Gluten-free & Vegan options meals and snacks to purchase.Very pleasant , a flight attendant Jo did a great job mixing me up a beverage and just brightened the trip .Very smooth checking in our luggage with a super pleasant SW agent. I enjoyed a fun entertaining movie.First time traveling on Southwest since bag fees were implemented. Usual good service. Just more expensive now.It was a perfect flight in all aspects! Both legs!Boarding process, crew were good. But the seats were so uncomfortable that was all I could focus on. I literally had to sit forward so that all 3 of us could fit in row. I will try to avoid Southwest in the future for any flights over 60 minutes.Great flight, 47 passengers on a 180 seat plane. Stewardess was pleasant and cheerful.Great experience flying Southwest. The crew was really kind and helpful, and very friendly with our toddler.Plane late from DC to Austin 30 minutes. Crew made up much of the time enroute to San Diego.Fine, but how to board on SW versus othrr airlines, is just lame. Goood staff though and all was solid otherwise.For the first time in a long time we had a flawless experience with Southwest. Both flights were early and no mechanical errors at all. We were shocked and pleasantly surprised 😮.Was as expected. Crowed planes. Too many carryons delaying takeoff. But the ride only took an hour and saved me a lot of time SFO is a not a great airport.Nothing special. The crew never went out of their way for anything.The flight attendants in SLC were rude. I arrived 40 minutes early to gate. Ticket said I needed check in for seat assignments and tried check in and attendants said they weren’t doing it. And proceeded to never call me to give me a ticket so when time to board I received the very last seat. Please relay to employees to do their job better..,I was uncomfortably cold on the plane. Other than that it was uneventful and therefore as enjoyable as a plane ride can be.Having to up charge for a seat assignment is not good. Delta can do betterFood was surprisingly good but the WiFi was not greatMy flight was extremely cold. I had a jacket and a cover was left in each seat. The cover was extremely thin and I have a disability, fibromyalgia and arthrithis and AC air is the worst. I closed my vent and my husbands vent and it still was frigid. I asked the attendant if I could get another cover and she quickly almost dismissively and totally unconcerned stating, (I quote) (one per chair) and walked off so quickly that I didn't get a chance to explain to her that I literally have adisability. I didnt want to make a seen so I set on that flight for over 5 hours in pain, joints locking up and extremely uncomfortable. When my fibromyalgia flares up my joints not only ache but they will lock up also and it takes me days to get back to my regular self even though I take medication for it. I felt like it would not have hurt anyone at all for her to just give me an extra cover because I'm sure they have all types of medical issues in people that fly every day.Not a "Delta" issue, but a JFK issue: We booked a connecting flight with 3 1/2 hours between to clearn immigration and customs. Our inbound flight (BCN to JFK) was on the taxiway 45 minutes which ate into our layover time. Immigtration was insanely quick with the CBP MPC app; however, clearing TSA (again, after we were ALREADY cleared in Spain on the inbound international flight) took over 95 minutes. This left us with 10 minutes before boarding the connecting flight (JFK to SAN) to walk to the far end of Terminal 4 and try to find food. We didn't find any food that could promise to serve us in under 10 minutes so we boarded the Delta flight after coming off a plance and an 8-hour flight knowing that we wouldn't be served any food on the next 5 1/2 hour flight. I feel like Delta needs to put pressure on the JFK TSA to open more screening stations (by our count, we saw only 5 scanners open and a line of - as we said - over 90 minutes. The insult is that we WERE ALREADY SCREENED through TSA, but as you come off one flight into the USA, you have to go through the whole process again. It seems like if you have a connecting flight, there should be a way to pass through immigration and customs without needing to return through TSA.There are 4 flights in consecutive gates with about the same departure time. Two flights were boarding at the same time. One was delayed or boarding would be happening at the same time. I am not sure what Delta and LAX need to do to have a better layout at the end of Terminal 25 hours of delay that could've been much shorter if Delta had taken the 1 hour delay they imposed on the flight before boarding to run any of the plane checks required for flight to find the hydraulic issue that required nearly 3 hours to fix. $24 of meal credit buys a sandwich and a soft drink. Poor communication within the terminal about what gate we'd be re-boarding from and when we'd be re-boarding.The entertainment and wifi mostly didn't work on this flight.We got surprised and switched to Alaska airline. Dirtiest tray and seats I have ever board on and we travel all the time. Help desk would not help by chat as I'm disabled to get my sets assigned tell me call Hawaiian air. I call Hawaiian air was told the flights RT are by Alaska. Make it short, worse flights of our life.First class ticket. They ran out of food and I sat hungry watching the others eatEverything was great except having to check in at Alaska. That was a surprise and took extra time and effort. Should have been explained somewhere maybe on the HA electronic ticket.I accidentally made this purchase and they wouldn’t refund me even though I called immediately to cancel it.You. Changed my AIRLINE, CONFIRMATION CODE, TERMINAL. AND GATE COMM N CATION. WAS POOR AND SUBOPTITMUM AND RIDICULOUS MY AIRLINE WAS HAWAIIN. ,THEN SUDDENLY. YOU SAY IT WAS ALASKA Give me a break,,Black is not White I could not check in over the phone...all I received was Error. And info from Hawaiian air agent saying tooooo many people were trying to check in causing the problem On the other hand I am aliveI like that you have eliminated plastic cups, bottles and straws. The crew was conscientious about separating the used paper cups from the trash. This change to paper is a great move and makes me want to choose Alaska when I fly.Attendants seemed un-engaged and indifferent when asked for assistance.Overall it was a good flight. The thing I most appreciated was that you eliminated plastic cups and water bottles and stir sticks and had paper cups, wood stir sticks and cans. Plus, I saw that the airline staff were actually keeping the used paper cups separate and unfolding the used cardboard meal boxes and keeping those items separate from the trash. Good for them! This makes me want to support Alaska Airlines and fly Alaska again. Thank for taking this step in working to reduce single use plastics! Kudos!Ok but why they need to sell the ear buds?Alaskan has always been great. Unfortunately, going TO Cabo, on Hawaiian, was a nightmare. But Alaskan has always been great.I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.Alaska Airlines8.0Southwest8.0Delta7.9Hawaiian Airlines7.8Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Salt Lake City to San DiegoAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsSalt Lake City (SLC)San Diego (SAN)Cabin class types available on flights from Salt Lake City to San DiegoCabin classes available on flights from Salt Lake City to San Diego.
