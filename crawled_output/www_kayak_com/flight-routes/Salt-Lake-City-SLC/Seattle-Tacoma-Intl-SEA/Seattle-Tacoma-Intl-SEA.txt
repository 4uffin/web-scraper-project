No one yelled….all nice The microphone was working for boarding….unlike SeaTac BIGGEST BUMMER….GOT SEATED BACK BY THE BATHROOMS AND YOU IT SMELLED THE WHOLE TRIP. A BLESSING….is they … Left the lights and air on until we were unloaded….UNLIKE SEATAC TO ST. LOUIS….THEY TURNED THE LIGHTS AND AIR OFF IN ALMOST 100 degree weather…IT SUCKED!Everything went well with all aspects of the flight. Honestly, if fares continue to compete with SW (which I always used to fly) I will fly Alaska if I can.Don’t cancel the flight, had to spend a whole day sitting in the airport.They closed boarding too early. They made me pay extra to continue flying with them. Their customer service is non-responsive. I used to love Alaska Airlines, but they've definitely regressed.My flight was delayed 2 hours which led me to lose my connection. As a consequence, I had to spend hours changing flights and hotel reservations to arrange my arrival to Vancouver.No Free Wifi and the flight was a tad late.The plane was clean. They got us to the destination. It was very difficult to hear the announcements at the gate. The person was speaking way too quickly, and the sound system did not carry to all parts of the seating area at the gate. The flight left more than an hour late, which left many of the passengers missing connections.The flights left both airports on schedule. The flight from Idaho Falls to Seattle was a typical commuter trip. The flight from Seattle to Maui was not good: It was too long for a flight in a single-aisle plane and too cramped. I kept asking myself if I would ever visit Maui again if airlines continue to run this long flight like a typical short commuter flight. I am not looking forward to the trip home.The chicken salad was very small, the lettuce was wilted and there was no flavor. The hamburger was excellent.Mid flight we were bothered by a bee. Kind of odd, but a bee allergy made it a bit stressful. Attendants passed by our aisle during service multiple times. Otherwise, it was fine.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.The flight attendants in SLC were rude. I arrived 40 minutes early to gate. Ticket said I needed check in for seat assignments and tried check in and attendants said they weren’t doing it. And proceeded to never call me to give me a ticket so when time to board I received the very last seat. Please relay to employees to do their job better..,Having to up charge for a seat assignment is not good. Delta can do betterCheck in process was terrible. Lady at counter didn’t know what she was doingDelayed and took off even later than the scheduled delay timeThere was a security issue at the airport and we were unable to land. We circled endlessly and then landed at another airfield for fuel. We then circled the airport again, almost landed but didn’t fully touch down before circling again. I am thankful to the crew for keeping us safe- the issue was the airline and staff at the airport getting us seats on our connecting flights. That part was hours of searching for someone and getting in double my steps.Boarding was organised and relaxed. Crew were fantastic! Seats were lacking padding causing butt pain and stiffness.Take this flight once or twice a month. Just don’t cut it from the schedule.Food from the flight from Atlanta to Santiago was very poor..The worst part was I was NOT allowed in the lounge even though I was holding a first class ticket and have a premium American Express card. I have flown Business or First Class with many airlines. Delta is the ONLY one who does not extend this courtesy to anyone except people who hold the very expensive American Express card. As a result, I won’t fly Delta if I have any other choice.We got surprised and switched to Alaska airline. Dirtiest tray and seats I have ever board on and we travel all the time. Help desk would not help by chat as I'm disabled to get my sets assigned tell me call Hawaiian air. I call Hawaiian air was told the flights RT are by Alaska. Make it short, worse flights of our life.Would have been better if the flight went out as scheduled and we’d have been kept informed. Rescheduling the connecting flight out of Portland was especially difficult.Very accommodating on flight changes when something came up. Definitely felt a notch above other airlines.Had a hard time checking into my flight on my phone because they gave me the wrong confirmation number. Otherwise everything else went well.First class ticket. They ran out of food and I sat hungry watching the others eatThey we able to seat my companion and I next to each other. Plane’s temperature was very cool. Willl be more prepared on return trip.All was good and they were able to seat my travel companion next to me. Thank you.Like the ample leg room. May as well not bother with snacks if it's only a two ounce bag of pretzels. Didn't use the entertainment option. Was there one?What an amazing flight. I haven’t experienced this level of service in a flight in years. This will be the only way to fly to Hawaii for me in the future.Kayak sold me a ticket after check in time. Could not check in. Could not get on flight.Flight was canceled without warning, gave credit that is hard to access. Awful airline.Flight was cancelled without warning close to flight date. Stuck witha credit has to buy a new ticket from another airline in either to get to location. Email cancelling was lost in mail.Don't board the plane and have us sit for 2 hours and go nowhere!Flight was good and on time. Everyone was nice. Seats aren't very comfortableDidn’t like that we weren’t even offered a water. And really didn’t like the male flight attendant, he had major attitude. The flight however was good, pilots got us there in time safely.The seats are too small the plane makes weird noise when landing 🛬I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm.

I'm ready for my Spirit flight.Frontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone.
