Never flying JAL again!Overall a great experience. One complain was the vegetarian food that my wife had which was mostly boiled vegetables with not much flavor.Very accommodating and kind airline crews. The plane is also big which makes the passengers more comfortable and relaxI actually didn’t make it onto the flight. I spent quite a few hours trying to rebook the flight just to get screwed out of $5000. Fun!We booked business class round trip from Delhi to San Diego and back. On our last leg from Bangalore to Delhi we were down graded to economy class which was big disappointment other than that everything was great.Had an incident with a stewardess who insisted that I take a seat. I informed her that I came to use the restroom and to have some water. After using the restroom, I wanted to stretch my legs out a little cuz my knees were aching from sitting. I understood her concern for my concern and the potential turbulence (she said she knows this route and the turbulence and safety is not to be taken lightly) but I felt that her mood, tone, demeanor, and a lack of compassion for the pain in my knees were not the proper way to address a customer or anyone for that matter. This left a bitter taste in my mouth. It was her lack of professionalism that surprised me.we have requested for hindu veg. meal during booking. but served meal was of very poor qualty and taste. they can get such meal from 5 star Indian restaurant at Vancouver/ tokyo/ Bangalore.pure hindu veg meal and no AVMLIt was good but need mor amenities for toiletries and entertainmentExtremely poor at handling baggage. I had oversized golf bag and JAL would not recheck in Boston. Had to haul by myself to Jet Blue. Both JAL and Jet Blue claimed I had overweight bag. Had to adjust baggage several times. Will avoid JAL in future and I always avoid Jet Blue when I can. QATAR always superior.Cramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The airport was reasonably clean. The boarding process reasonably efficient. The cabin crew was efficient, polite but not that friendly. The food quality was unremarkable and the choices were awful . There was either a so so chicken dish or a “ vegetarian “ option which was really cheap carbohydrates drowned in cheese. Signing onto i flight wifi was not straightforward. Overall it was a very average experienceThe staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.The newer screen was super cool and had the option to watch many different shows or movies. Crew was polite and helpful. However again, many children screaming bloody murder and kicking my seat, and parents doing nothing about it as usual.Flight was good and crew was super polite. However, there were around 5 kids screaming the WHOLE 2 hours. I understand kids have to come but parents need to do something to control their children. They make the experience terrible, especially after finishing 16 hour shifts at the hospital I needed some sleep, which I did not get.Plane was crowded and even when we hit altitude, the plane was hot, not enough air flow.The flight got cancelled so I don’t know why or what happened. We waited around and didn’t know until so late and they couldn’t really help with anything but had us call the airlines.Flight was delayed and missed my connection Lufthansa didn’t respond.the delay for 3 hours was understandable due to weather conditions but the flight should’ve provided some on flight compensations or at least provide more food.United could have one single once of customer service. No human United employee would help me with the invalid mileage plus number, they said I had to speak with the computer.A little bit more leg room in premium economy. I am 6’4”.Overall it was good. I missed my connection but I was put on another flight.Although the flight was delayed the crew and the flight itself were very good. Couldn't fault anything and after the disappointment of being abandoned in the US by BA it was a welcome relief to travel with UnitedFlight from Dallas to OKC was good, but my trip was interrupted due to a delayed flight from Austin to DFW, which happens all the time. I frequently miss my connection from DFW and American can never seem to make this work!Because the plane was 90 degrees F, they would not let us board. I wish they had, because it meant we were delayed. It's Texas, of course it's hot. We would have survived.Wish they had the seat-back video screens for watching movies or playing games.Very good but wish they had the seat-back video screens for movies & gamesAmerican airlines suck they delay the flights all the time made me sleep in an airport because my flight was delayed and I miss my connecting flightThe stewardess hit me with the food kart twice on the head and didn't say I'm sorry once. The same stewardess gave me a warm Apple Juice with No ice. The Flight was delayed for Departure 6 times, starting from 2:36pm, finally taking off 7:50pm. I was late picking up my child from the sitter by 3 hours.Our bags took a long time to get unloaded once we landed.My flight was delayed for several hours. Sitting at gate 16 for several hours, I got a text from Kayak the gate changed to 9 before it was announced. Very bad communication at each gate from American Airlines employees. I received 10 notifications of delay from Kayak. My vacation started off horrible! I will write to American Airlines corporate office also.My Internet did not work for Outlook email or basically anything. I paid for one hour of in-flight usage and it was terrible. I spent a lot of time on different sites and browsers with no luck and a lot of frustration. Other than that, the flight was on time, crew was nice, service was fine. Seat was OK even though I paid for the extra 6 inches. I cannot imagine how tight the seats in the back must be.Delayed flight that lead to a missed connection and a 5-hour trip became a 12-hour flight 🙄Air Canada is my new fave airline..I plan to use when I can. No complaints at all just rave compliments for the staff and airline.Not to out myself as both a child at heart and kind of a terrible person, but the Pokémon safety video was the first time I watched an airplane safety video in like a decade. It was ADORABLE!! A great way to encourage attention from young and old alike.I was forcefully re-routed to another destination and was delayed a total of 8hours. I have still not received my bags, no one is taking responsibility. The agents at the airport lied to me that I will get to my destination same time as my previous flight where I was forcefully re-routed from.Seamless! Long but the seat back entertainment kept us all busy the whole time! Meals were excellent! Crew fantastic! Very attentive!Or the greatest and it ended up picking us up from Chicago to Toronto not sure who was tesponsible for the 4 hr delay. United should have been properly prepared for a scheduled flight from Austin to Chicago and they were not.The whole experience what excellent, from Anjou at the ticket counter to the attendants on the flight. Although it was an older plane, it was a very good flight. One of the best flights I have had on Air Canada!My experience with Air Canada was good. Great customer service… only a few delays and issues with the tunnel to exit the plain. I did not appreciate that we arrived at terminal D and had to go to terminal E to get the bags/ luggage.Everything should be better, terrible flight and airport service. Delayed for 6 hours, flying around for 1 hr, and keeping us on a plane for another 2,5 -3hrs.Economy middle seat was so narrow that I could not sit back comfortably with passengers on either side of me. Over the 9-hour flight, with my body slightly twisted most of that time, my previously-healthy left knee became very painful, even though I got up to walk multiple times. The knee is still painful 3 weeks later. Otherwise, it was a nice flight, but I was crippled over my entire vacation.Dealing with Air Canada was totally miserable and as a result of their website incompetence, lack of customer support, and total non-responsiveness we could not use this flight. We have made a formal complaint to Air Canada and are waiting to hear back, but if prior experience (more than one hour waits on the telephone with no response) is any guide, we wonder if we will ever hear back at all.Japan Airlines8.3Delta7.9United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Air Canada7.1Everything you need to know for your flight from Dallas/Fort Worth to TokyoAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsDallas/Fort Worth Airport (DFW)Cabin class types available on flights to TokyoCabin classes available on flights to Tokyo.
