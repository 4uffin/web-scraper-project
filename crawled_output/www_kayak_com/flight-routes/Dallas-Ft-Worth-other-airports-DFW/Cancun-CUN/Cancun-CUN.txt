We would have survived.Wish they had the seat-back video screens for watching movies or playing games.Very good but wish they had the seat-back video screens for movies & gamesAmerican airlines suck they delay the flights all the time made me sleep in an airport because my flight was delayed and I miss my connecting flightThe stewardess hit me with the food kart twice on the head and didn't say I'm sorry once. The same stewardess gave me a warm Apple Juice with No ice. The Flight was delayed for Departure 6 times, starting from 2:36pm, finally taking off 7:50pm. I was late picking up my child from the sitter by 3 hours.Our bags took a long time to get unloaded once we landed.My flight was delayed for several hours. Sitting at gate 16 for several hours, I got a text from Kayak the gate changed to 9 before it was announced. Very bad communication at each gate from American Airlines employees. I received 10 notifications of delay from Kayak. My vacation started off horrible! I will write to American Airlines corporate office also.My Internet did not work for Outlook email or basically anything. I paid for one hour of in-flight usage and it was terrible. I spent a lot of time on different sites and browsers with no luck and a lot of frustration. Other than that, the flight was on time, crew was nice, service was fine. Seat was OK even though I paid for the extra 6 inches. I cannot imagine how tight the seats in the back must be.Delayed flight that lead to a missed connection and a 5-hour trip became a 12-hour flight 🙄The bad thing is they didnt send me the deatils about how much alowed bagage ehight 1 carryon or cheacking bag Also they just send in spanishlanfuage i couldnt understand emailsThe boarding process was ridiculous. The boarded groups into a walkway just before the aerobridge (about 20 mins late), whilst we watch the crew stroll casually onto the plane, running late. And then they made us line up on then aerobridge with no aircon for 10 minutes before we boarded. Staff are just as ghetto as the customers. Wouldn’t fly againThey closed the gate over 25 minutes before departure and I didn’t get to board.No empathy for my situation, arriving at the check-in counter 5 minutes after the deadline to deposit baggage due to a very delayed incoming intercontinental flight. The attendant simply stared past my shoulder and picked up the microphone to announce a "reminder that all passengers must arrive at least one hour before the flight" before speaking to the passenger behind me. I understand that there are rules above deadlines but at least show some damn empathy. It was Christmas morning and I'd been travelling for 20 hours for goodness sake!They no longer offer anything free to eat or drink, everything is sold, not even a bottle of water is offered for free.I paid for Viva play and most of the time didn’t work and also I order some drinks and the price was to expensive.The terminal and gate was never the right one announced in the Viva App, neither in screens, moved from one terminal to anotherThe smart/express line to check in was a mess, employees not doing the process smooth and quick, using their mobile phones, talking to their coworkersMy flight was changed 4 tienes , delaying my arrival lore than 5 hoursEverything was okay, but boarding begins late and when I was returning there was a gate change. The app never showed the change.I did not take this flight because the reservation made by Kayak was wrong! Kayak owes me a trip from Minneapolis to Duluth.When I got to the airport in Seattle, they told me the flight "did not exist". Kayak reserved me a seat on a flight that did not exist. This is inexcusable. I was able to change my reservation to a flight that actually did exist, but the flight was later and then I didn't make it in time for the next leg of my trip from Minneapolis to Duluth. Kayak owes me a trip from Minneapolis to Duluth, and a big apology for messing up my reservation.The plane was freezing cold. Asked for a blanket and there were none. Was told twice that the pilots would warm the plane and it never happened Worst experience flying everMultiple delays because they screwed up on the crew schedule and had to wait for over an hour for more people to come.It was good. Basic flight. Drinks only. Pay budget. Get budget and I’m good with that. I want to get where I need to go. Not hard to please. Female First Officer is an absolute bonus for me!The Wi-Fi was off, the arm rests are hard plastic.The assistance with the wheel chairs was fabulous. All the people were so very friendly and helpful. I want to thank them all.We almost missed our return flight. We got to the gate one minute from closing the cabin door, and the agent got us aboard the plane! We are so very grateful!!!!!Boarded flight, issues with the place and had to get off the plane, wait, and then board a different plane at a different gate. This impacted my short trip negatively. A worker died outside of the plane window and we sat there the entire time while they tried to revive him, unsuccessfully, which was traumatic.The flight there was frustrating but the flight home was very good.Spirit is low fare air line. Food also cost you. No free food.Everyone was kind for the most part. I did travel with children and paid for seats and even then it was not as suitable. I tried calling their customer service prior to check in and I was told they couldn't help me because I didn't purchase my tickets with them.I think the staff was nice. They took time to explain safety protocols. Boarding was great. They started early and our flight left a little early which was convenient. Having free games to play would have been betterJust total easy flight experience!! What could you do better..? Hmmm..? There was nothing I can remember. Spirit was a far more comfortable and easy process than American, United & Delta. I'll always look for Spirit and I've told a few people about, since flying this past trip!! I'm a SPIRIT FAN!! Thank You, SPIRIT AIRLINES!! Very, VERY well done, 100%!! See you...SOON!! -Best, Linda R.The flight was 3.5 hrs delayed. I was not notified prior to arriving to the airport via spirit app. or via boarding pass that I already had loaded on my phone. The agent that i saw at the counter didn’t mention anything about the delay either. I only saw the update after logging in to my email account.Better than my las vagas experience, but still dissapointed with the airline support service.Unfortunately, spirits crew had us boarding and parking the plane often, would wait long periods of time before allowing the people attending the flight on the plane to know what was going on this caused for my plane to not only get diverted but then canceled at an airport 2 hours away and basically stranded with charter buses MAYBE being hired. I was left with no choice but to stay overnight and use a comp room in Altantic City to then arrive home the next day. This trip was the first time seeing my partner since he joined the Air Force and this stressful ride caused unwarranted tears on what was supposed to be an east flight home. I understand weather is unpredictable but to have passengers deboard to then reboard an hour later to taxi on the runway for another hour to then basically leave an entire fight stranded. I waited almost 30 minutes at the airport and not one employee could tell me about a charter bus so I had to leave and make accommodations to stay overnight and get a ride home.Great! We boarded on time! Everything went so smoothly! The flight was so smoothSeats uncomfortable, hard to check luggage, etc. It was like the last flight out of HanoiI will never fly with Spirit again. I was late getting through TSA after dealing with traffic and getting on the wrong shuttle. I got to the gate 2 minutes before the ticket said the gate closes and they agents were gone and doors were closed. They rescheduled my flight for 12 hours later and the agent had the nerve to tell me, “Be on time next time”. I was already upset from nothing going right for me that morning. I booked another flight through Alaska Airlines and they were very accommodating, nerer again Spirit Airlines!!!!I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.American Airlines7.2Viva7.0Sun Country Air6.9Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Dallas/Fort Worth to CancúnAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsDallas/Fort Worth Airport (DFW)Cancún (CUN)Cabin class types available on flights to CancúnCabin classes available on flights to Cancún.
