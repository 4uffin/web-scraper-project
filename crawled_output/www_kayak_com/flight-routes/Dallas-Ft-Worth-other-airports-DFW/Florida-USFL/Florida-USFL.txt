Seats very narrow.southwest just starting charging for luggage. hadnt realized it until it was too late. now out $70 when i couldve bought a carry on if i wouldve known. free bags was one of the only reasons i chose southwest over another airline (the other being no assigned seats, which is apparently also being changed). stupid business decision. wont be flying southwest anymore.The quality of Southwest Airlines continues to degrade each time I fly with them. If it were not for the free luggage, I would probably choose another airline. Their prices are a little bit competitive, but way too high for the quality of the service. Southwest is not unique in this way. Domestic flight in the United States of America has continued to be a lower and lower quality product. Very sad when you compare the quality of domestic airlines to that of many international airlines around the world.I'm not a fan of Southwest's model. I don't like the herding style of boarding.Flight crew and cabin crew were great. I had to rearrange flights because my original flight was 3hrs delayed for weather, the rub is the flight I moved to boarded on time then we sat at the gate for 2 hours because scheduling stole our first officer for another flight, TWICE. Then our actual FO was an hour delayed. To make it worse my original flight went from a 3 hour delay to departing 15min EARLY. Just poor scheduling operations all around.Bring back peanuts Take our drink orders when were all seated, especially after you switch to assigned seating.It is southwest seat was ok. Not the most comfortable seatPlz don't take away free bags and free seatingExcellent! Only question is how we check in at exactly 24 hours in advance and end up at the end of the B boarding groupIt went well. Plane wasn't full. Will be great when assigned seating is in placeAlways good but we must do something about people in rows ahead of you that don't put their seats back up when they are suppose to. And It's rough to not be able to even lean over to get something out of my purse.Everything was good until we were boarding our connection flight in Atlanta, we were told to gate check our carry-on, but when we got inside the plane, there was plenty of room in the overhead.this crew didn't care much. bumping carts into seats more times than i care to rememberEverything was fine except the entertainment was not working for half of the flight.Easy boarding with an extremely kind attendant. Seats were spacious and we had 3 seats for 2 people so we could stretch out. Comfortable air flow and very attentive and hospital attendants. Bathrooms and food were the only negative. Bathrooms were so small you could hardly get in and close the door. I don’t think an obese person would fit or a person with a movement disability. Food was the trending food for flights, nonexistent. We spent $40 getting sandwich and snack at airport for our 6 hour flught.The check in and bag drop off for Sky Priority members is slow. The Clear security was also slow - a TSA issue.I am very bothered by the events today. I can't believe the flight attendants allowed someone to take my seat and made me move. It was embarrassing. I was in the right. The lady just didn't want move. I can't believe delta would allow this to stand and disrespect my rights as a passenger. The lady complained about her leg and that she couldn't move. Firstly somehow she was able to make it to row 24. Not sure how much her leg could have hurt. Secondly, I'm in plenty of pain myself. I just finished chemotherapy a several weeks ago. My body is constantly sore. Yet deltas flight attendants didn't appropriately protect my rights. In the end they found me a seat on the plane but I want to understand how delta can operate this way. They in essence allowed a bully to get their way.Crew was friendly Love the entertainment in the seat head rest.Simply outstanding. Their new lounge for Delta One customers is a cut above the rest.I loved having a most black flight crew during Black History Month; rather by design or accident I appreciated the representation. ❤️Flight from Dallas to OKC was good, but my trip was interrupted due to a delayed flight from Austin to DFW, which happens all the time. I frequently miss my connection from DFW and American can never seem to make this work!Because the plane was 90 degrees F, they would not let us board. I wish they had, because it meant we were delayed. It's Texas, of course it's hot. We would have survived.Wish they had the seat-back video screens for watching movies or playing games.Very good but wish they had the seat-back video screens for movies & gamesAmerican airlines suck they delay the flights all the time made me sleep in an airport because my flight was delayed and I miss my connecting flightThe stewardess hit me with the food kart twice on the head and didn't say I'm sorry once. The same stewardess gave me a warm Apple Juice with No ice. The Flight was delayed for Departure 6 times, starting from 2:36pm, finally taking off 7:50pm. I was late picking up my child from the sitter by 3 hours.Our bags took a long time to get unloaded once we landed.My flight was delayed for several hours. Sitting at gate 16 for several hours, I got a text from Kayak the gate changed to 9 before it was announced. Very bad communication at each gate from American Airlines employees. I received 10 notifications of delay from Kayak. My vacation started off horrible! I will write to American Airlines corporate office also.My Internet did not work for Outlook email or basically anything. I paid for one hour of in-flight usage and it was terrible. I spent a lot of time on different sites and browsers with no luck and a lot of frustration. Other than that, the flight was on time, crew was nice, service was fine. Seat was OK even though I paid for the extra 6 inches. I cannot imagine how tight the seats in the back must be.Delayed flight that lead to a missed connection and a 5-hour trip became a 12-hour flight 🙄Don't board the plane and have us sit for 2 hours and go nowhere!I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm.

Very unhappy and very poor service.Everything was fine. I'm average height and I pack light. I'm ready for my Spirit flight.Wow truly top notch airline Efficient nice snacks courteous staff Fast boarding !My experience with Spirit was good, but the experience with Kayak was not. Based on the Spirit agent Kayak added an additional charge after purchasing the tickets. When I buy the tickets I paid the total amount and I only pay once. This time they added an additional charge because based on Spirit they partially charge the tickets and I still needed to pay a second time. This is not good at all and UnprofessionalSpirit gets such a bad rap. I have never had a bad experience with them and the crew is always friendly and funny. This trip I had knee replacement surgery surgery 10 weeks ago. It is still a little rough to get get from point a to point b. And Spirit was on top of it. When there was a seat available the stewardess asked me if I wanted to move to an open seat so I could elevate my leg on the empty seat? 5 stars all around. They helped me on and helped me off the plane. I can’t say enough about the crew!!This gate agents are always so rude! I stopped flirting with spirit years ago for that reason I thought it would change by now. It’s so tacky they try to treat you like a school child i hate itJust total easy flight experience!! What could you do better..? Hmmm..? There was nothing I can remember. Spirit was a far more comfortable and easy process than American, United & Delta. I'll always look for Spirit and I've told a few people about, since flying this past trip!! I'm a SPIRIT FAN!! Thank You, SPIRIT AIRLINES!! Very, VERY well done, 100%!! See you...SOON!! -Best, Linda R.Great! We boarded on time! Everything went so smoothly! The flight was so smoothI was 2 hr arrive in the airport and 45 min in the line . After take to my turn . The agent tell me I’m later . I can not board . So my vacation was going to the floor . Just for their bad customer service agent in the airline2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.Since you have to pay for overhead bags then they shouldn't be running out of space and asking individuals who paid to remove stuff from the overheadBook with frontier airlines with the mentality that they'll cancel your flight, kick you off and lose your luggage. Anything besides that is a win. Compare prices with other airlines (to include luggage) and if frontier is still worth it, book it but know all of their policies.You get what you pay for nothing essentially but a hard uncomfortable seat that doesn’t recline and kids screaming all around you and chaotic boarding and limited check bag weight allowance when compared to other airlinesNot very good. Paid in excess of $400 for assigned seating for my family and that was not provided. I want that money back.I chose the seats when booked the flight and paid for them. However after checking in I found we were assigned different seats!It was a no frills flight. Would have liked to be able to charge my deviceSeats were extremely uncomfortable and it was very hot on the plane.Would be great if Frontier can Assign Seats together under one PNRSouthwest8.0Delta7.9American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Dallas/Fort Worth to FloridaAirportsCabin classComplete your tripFlights to other citiesOriginsPopular routesReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsDallas/Fort Worth Airport (DFW)Cabin class types available on flights to Dallas/Fort WorthCabin classes available on flights to Dallas/Fort Worth.
