I was apprehensive about flying a small plane between Ironwood and Chicago, but the flight and service was great. I noticed, after boarding , that my cell phone had little battery left. The flight attendant kindly lent me a charging device to keep me connected with my contact in Chicago upon landing. I will always remember that kindness.10.0 ExcellentMette, Sep 2025IWD - ORDRead more Denver Air Connection reviewsExcellent, from check Iin to arrival.

I will always remember that kindness.Great snacks and friendly people for check in at Pierre SD!The connecting flight came in 45 min late but everything else was greatAbsolutely easy travels and no cost cutting by the airline.Their snacks and hospitality was amazing. They offered full sized snacks. Im talking full sized water bottles, full sized snickers bars, gold fish, full sized canned sodas, what ever you wanted they took care of it for FREE. The crew was really nice and hospitable. I was honestly shockedNear 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.The Southwest employees (all two of them) were very nice and cheerful despite the fact the line to self-check a bag (simply drop it off) was hundreds of people long. Thank God I arrived early to the airport because I stood in this line for at least an hour. Once on the flight that had been delayed by an hour, we had no Wi-Fi and thus no entertainment. Finally, I hope the investor strong arm tactics against Southwest pay off in a short-term windfall to your C-Suite because the rest of you are screwed. I have been a faithful Southwest customer for 15 years due to everything you just got rid of. I'm flying to Idaho and Washington in October, both places I used to simply book with Southwest without a second thought now with Frontier (Washington) and United (Idaho) because they offer everything the "new" Southwest does but cheaper and at better times, destinations, etc. This really makes me sad...Flights delayed by 4-6 hours. Boarding was a mess and unclear. Bags were not at arrival airport and had never even been put on the plane. No idea when I’ll get them. Don’t fly into Denver!Southwest is typically delayed, and it gets wearisome. It is no longer a discount airline and you get way less than you pay for when it comes to comfort and Ce.We sat on the plane on the tarmac for 4 hours.Plz don't take away free bags and free seatingAfter a 3 hour layover in Denver my flight was delayed over 5 hours! No explanation; no assistance; no offer to provide compensation; no one at Southwest was willing to offer any assistance. 8 hours in the Denver airport - ridiculous!WiFi on the flight was not working. Thus, entertainment options were limited.I really like open seating. I hate that I've heard this is going away. This is one of the unique things that makes Southwest my goto choice.For the first time in a long time we had a flawless experience with Southwest. Both flights were early and no mechanical errors at all. We were shocked and pleasantly surprised 😮.I understand stuff happens, but plane failures are likely due to lack of maintenance. Additionally, air conditioning wasn't working, no snack/drink service, no WiFi. Fortunately, the crew was communicative and light-hearted. United grabbed another plane and we were able to get to our destination.Had to cancel first flight because Airporter Bus took over 3 hrs to get to airport which resulted in an extra $378 dollar fare . Is there anyway I can be reimbursed for initial fare since it was not my fault? Sent from my iPhone EJ LedetExcellent flight. Boarding was efficient and departure was on time. Smooth flight with on time arrival. Deplaning was also efficient.Our flight was understandably diverted to a small regional airport in Laramie, Wyoming due to weather conditions, which I fully recognize and appreciate. However, the low rating stems from the experience that followed: passengers remained on board for over an hour without the option to deplane and stretch, despite the aircraft being stationary. Although the pilot opened the cabin door, only he was permitted to exit. Meanwhile, passengers grew increasingly uncomfortable as warm summer air entered the cabin through the open door, and being in the second row meant we were impacted immediately. While the flight attendants made efforts to keep everyone at ease, I believe allowing passengers to deplane briefly, given the extended delay, would have significantly improved the overall experience.I never flew. Flight was canceled. DIA worst airport in the country. Avoid at all costs.Very rough getting into denver. my kid threw up it was so rough.Why wasn't this flight departure scheduled eith another crew so that it could leave on time? When we arrived in Denver we had so little time between flights we had run to the connecting flight. We should received some credit for the inconvenience.I was supposed to be on business class at first class from Denver back to Miami due to weather changes. I missed my connection and it’s put on a flight to Fort Lauderdale. Instead of honoring my business class/1st class ticket, they put me in coach, but there were two first class seats open. I think it’s absolutely disgusting that I paid for first class $1300 ticket and they put me in economy and they had to open seats available and I have still not been refunded the difference. I ended up having to eat a snack box instead of the meal I was supposed to get and did not get home till 2 AM so I think that’s a little pathetic that I had to live off crackers for dinner And my poor dog ate some cheese and salami. Oh yes, apparently when they switched me to the new flight they forgot to mention I had a service dogExcellent service despite turbulence during the flight. Flight attendants were remarkable!Flight attendant moved my bag without notifying me and was rude to me when I asked him about it. There was no reason to move it.The flight was fine. This survey is not. There is no option for N/A so items which don’t apply to my experience still must be rated. In those instances I give a “3” rating which ultimately skews the results.The actual trip was fine, however, the changes made to our flights and the layovers were had to endure were awful.Flight from Dallas to OKC was good, but my trip was interrupted due to a delayed flight from Austin to DFW, which happens all the time. I frequently miss my connection from DFW and American can never seem to make this work!Because the plane was 90 degrees F, they would not let us board. I wish they had, because it meant we were delayed. It's Texas, of course it's hot. We would have survived.Wish they had the seat-back video screens for watching movies or playing games.Very good but wish they had the seat-back video screens for movies & gamesAmerican airlines suck they delay the flights all the time made me sleep in an airport because my flight was delayed and I miss my connecting flightThe stewardess hit me with the food kart twice on the head and didn't say I'm sorry once. The same stewardess gave me a warm Apple Juice with No ice. The Flight was delayed for Departure 6 times, starting from 2:36pm, finally taking off 7:50pm. I was late picking up my child from the sitter by 3 hours.Our bags took a long time to get unloaded once we landed.My flight was delayed for several hours. Sitting at gate 16 for several hours, I got a text from Kayak the gate changed to 9 before it was announced. Very bad communication at each gate from American Airlines employees. I received 10 notifications of delay from Kayak. My vacation started off horrible! I will write to American Airlines corporate office also.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.Frontier Airlines was AWFUL. I was an hour early for my flight and the lady refused to check me in. I had to purchase a whole new ticket with a different airline.Late, terrible communication, horrible planning of passenger seating until the literal last minute. One of the worst flying experiences of my life. Y'all suckFirst of all, we never got on the connecting flight to Denver. They delayed our flight for two hours. If we would have gotten on that flight, we would have been stuck in Denver for 13 hours. So we re- routed our flight for a straight through flight to Oklahoma two days later. THEN, they delayed that flight for two hours. After that we were able to finally get on our flight and come home. Frontier Airlines - one of the worst airlines I have ever been on.Terrible communication with weather delay, lost baggage, near impossible to reach customer serviceMy tickets got canceled on me by your site and I didn't have a flight. Then you kept sending me emails on the status of q flight I didn't have tickets for.Flight was late. Missed connecting in Denver. My new flight is more than 24 hours later and I have no room, vouchers, or compensation, and might also be bumped from the one tomorrow.This was one of the first frontier airline flights this spring that wasn't delayed. It actually left on time. Some of the flight crew did not look happy, they didn't smile when the passengers were boarding or getting off the plane, and the passengers initiated greetings, not the staff. To me this was an odd experience to have with any flight/airline. I had a bad experience booking this flight. The price didn't solidify until late hours into the night. Ever time I purchased the ticket, I either received a denial email or an error because the price has changed, but it was never reflected on the flyfrontier or kayak websites until way after midnight on the date of travel. This caused me anxiety and irritation with the websites. Then I noticed a mishap with my name on my voucher as I went to check in, it was incorrect. When I proceeded to correct it, Frontier had no easy, let alone free, way to remedy it. I couldn't correct my name without a $75 charge, I couldn't cancel my voucher to repurchase it with the correct name without a $100 charge, because it was too close to departure. Then calling frontier was nearly impossible to remedy the situation with a human. It's already difficult to want to choose frontier because of all the upcharges, but you feel kinda trapped into doing so because it's the more affordable airline.Denver Air Connection9.0Southwest8.0United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Dallas/Fort Worth to DenverAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Dallas/Fort Worth to DenverFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Dallas/Fort Worth to Denver according to KAYAK users.
