Only the fish entree in the Japanese meal was overcooked and quite dry but everything else was greatGreat first time experience on this airline. Very professional staff and great service.Warm the bread. Movies: better choices to include Chinese movies options or some of the older winners of flim festivalBusiness class on ANA was awesome. There lie flat seats made it easier to sleep on a 12 hour flight. Food was great and service was excellent.The crew was very nice and polite. They made sure everybody got their meal and drinks. Even the economy class had a very adequate leg room for someone that is over 6 foot tall.Overall it was good. Making changes to the reservation on ANA’s website was little challenging. Would like to see those features improved in the future.The flight crew was outstanding. Very cheerful and always respectful. I wish the same could be said about United. The AC wasn't the best on the plane.The seats are uncomfortable. The flight attendants are not pleasant. They do their job, but not with a ray of sunshine and warmth. The food was awful, not what I would expect from an Asian airline. All of the other Asian airlines I have flown have far better food. The food was on par with United airlines food, which is really bad. Maybe ANA should get out of the alliance with United.During booking, I selected the seats so that my wife and I would sit next to each other. However, the airline changed our seats at boarding so that we were seated apart. Very disappointing.Every leg of the flight was late causing us to miss our flight to Okinawa and have to take the next flight out.highly recommend for trip to japan only reason why i gave good not excellent is because their selection of movies and tv shows in English is more limited .We asked for Hindu vegetarian meal in advance and the quality of the food was horrendous. Never flying JAL again!Overall a great experience. One complain was the vegetarian food that my wife had which was mostly boiled vegetables with not much flavor.Very accommodating and kind airline crews. The plane is also big which makes the passengers more comfortable and relaxI actually didn’t make it onto the flight. I spent quite a few hours trying to rebook the flight just to get screwed out of $5000. Fun!We booked business class round trip from Delhi to San Diego and back. On our last leg from Bangalore to Delhi we were down graded to economy class which was big disappointment other than that everything was great.Had an incident with a stewardess who insisted that I take a seat. I informed her that I came to use the restroom and to have some water. After using the restroom, I wanted to stretch my legs out a little cuz my knees were aching from sitting. I understood her concern for my concern and the potential turbulence (she said she knows this route and the turbulence and safety is not to be taken lightly) but I felt that her mood, tone, demeanor, and a lack of compassion for the pain in my knees were not the proper way to address a customer or anyone for that matter. This left a bitter taste in my mouth. It was her lack of professionalism that surprised me.we have requested for hindu veg. meal during booking. but served meal was of very poor qualty and taste. they can get such meal from 5 star Indian restaurant at Vancouver/ tokyo/ Bangalore.pure hindu veg meal and no AVMLIt was good but need mor amenities for toiletries and entertainmentExtremely poor at handling baggage. I had oversized golf bag and JAL would not recheck in Boston. Had to haul by myself to Jet Blue. Both JAL and Jet Blue claimed I had overweight bag. Had to adjust baggage several times. Will avoid JAL in future and I always avoid Jet Blue when I can. QATAR always superior.Flight was smooth, pleasant passengers and crew. Enjoyed the experienceThe first leg of the trip was excellent. Lovely flight attendants and comfortable plane. The second leg left a lot to be desired. The flight attendant was rude when I asked for a Diet Coke, the boarding required quite a long walk and the plane was crammed and uncomfortable.Flight attendant was awful, I felt second hand embarrassment with every one of her interactions with people onboard. She was so incredibly rude every chance she gotI liked everything. I fell sleep so I did not eat but everything was wonderful. Thank youGreat flight - efficient and cheerful team on board, at SFO gate. Also, PAE (Paine Field, Everett, WA) is a great little airport to fly out or in to!My flight wait is 3 hours delayed due to Unknown reason. We waited a very long time in the tarmac. Our flight 24 was scheduled @ 7, therefore we left my house at 330 to park our car. We were at the gate @ 530, then we were told at 6a that it will be late , we boarded at 930 but did not take off until 1015. Therefore my arranged pick up in JFK was cancelled because of no show. Before all these I got an email offers of changing my flight to a different date which I took a day earlier. I will never again take Alaska Airlines, very Inefficient and Disappointing.Such great crew, from checkin to the plane. So friendly and helpful, I was genuinely impressed.I was sitting towards back of plane and the flight attendants I thought spoke unusually loud for an evening flight. They chatted and chatted all night long and it seemed odd to me that they didn’t try to lower their voices. It is annoying as a passenger to hear all their conversations.Staff at Gate desk were helpful. My connecting flight from the first part of my trip Kona to Seattle was late. I had to run through SeaTac Seattle to catch my flight to San Jose. They made an exception to let me board. On my return trip San Jose to San Diego and San Diego to Honolulu the same thing happened. One flight arrived late and I had to run through the terminal to catch my connection. There are no Gluten-free & Vegan options meals and snacks to purchase.Had to pay $8 for internet wasnt cool, no tv’s, had to use phone to watch movies, no food choices seemed available unless u ordered in advance maybe I'm wrong about that but seemed that way, no snacks were served. Seemed a very bare bones flight. But it was on time and safe so that was goodHad a hard time checking into my flight on my phone because they gave me the wrong confirmation number. Otherwise everything else went well.All was good and they were able to seat my travel companion next to me. Thank you.What an amazing flight. I haven’t experienced this level of service in a flight in years. This will be the only way to fly to Hawaii for me in the future.Kayak sold me a ticket after check in time. Could not check in. Could not get on flight.Everything was great except having to check in at Alaska. That was a surprise and took extra time and effort. Should have been explained somewhere maybe on the HA electronic ticket.I accidentally made this purchase and they wouldn’t refund me even though I called immediately to cancel it.The flight was delayed and they didn’t have a pilot for the flight. Seemed very unorganized and took way longer than expected.I could not believe that on a 5 hour plus flight we were not given a complimentary meal . That should be illegal. Or it would be nice to be informed beforehand that a complimentary meal would not be provided. The wording in the email I got about pre ordering food was phrased in a way that made the food seem like it would be free. Very misleading! Also during boarding we were informed there would be empty seats we could move to if we wanted, all we had to do was wait for an announcement, however an announcement was never made. Then when we tried to change seats ourselves we were singled out over the loud speaker and told we could not move without asking. Then the flight was about to take off , so we didn’t have time to ask . Then we were told we could not move to the exit row because you had to pay for those seats, but we were not told where we could move. Also no one was in the exit rows so , if something happened no one would be there to assist the passengers. Also people should be allowed to move there if the airline wasn’t able to sell them. One passenger asked if he could pay for the upgrade and the flight attendant said she did not have the capability to charge for the seat on her mobile device, so the airline ended up losing possible income anyways . So why not let people move there during flight if you have no way to charge them? Then the landing was bumpy and awful and many passengers complained out loud when we landed .It was pretty good except there was no food, which was understandable because it was a short flight but I would have liked to at least have a snack; otherwise it was great. Staff/crew, great. Thank youThe flight was great! The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. I would definitely fly Hawaiian Aurlines again!Easy to board and fly, no frills. Yummy ramen on board.It was for the most part a 10/10 they said they had entertainment options but all they had was old movies for streaming from the mid 2010’s so like 10 years agoall good for a very budget flight - well priced and excellent service. Will fly againCouple of the crew members were really nice and the rest are really rude and didn't help when we needed help, food was not worth it at all and most importantly there's no even entertainment system other than a very interruptive and slow internet and some movies.I appreciate the economy price of the tickets. The long flight made the comfort level on the lower average side. Wi-Fi connection was not consistent but working. Overall, I would fly again with zip air but next time get the flat, premium seats with the amount of money I would save otherwise.Comfortable seats and lucky no one was in middle seat. No water on the plane. Plane was on time and staff was fast.You get what you pay for and nothing more. Wanted a cheap flight and that’s exactly what I got, though it’s human nature to wanting to feel like you got a good deal as well. There was none of that here. I was cheap and they were too. Got to my destination safely and that’s all that really matters.Nice service. I wish it could provide hot water on the flight.internet didn't work. No offer of drinks or snacks.Flight was seamless. Free wifi helped pass the time. Food was okay, just make sure you pre order or pick something up from the airportANA8.4Japan Airlines8.3Alaska Airlines8.0Hawaiian Airlines7.8ZIPAIR7.6Everything you need to know for your flight from San Jose to TokyoAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsSan Jose (SJC)Cabin class types available on flights from San Jose to TokyoCabin classes available on flights from San Jose to Tokyo.
