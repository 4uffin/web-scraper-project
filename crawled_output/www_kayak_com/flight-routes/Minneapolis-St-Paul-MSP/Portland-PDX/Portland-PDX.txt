I had my own row, complimentary wine, friendly flight attendants, free texting, and early arrival. Coach felt like 1st class. What more could I ask for?The flight was good, but your car partner, Wisecars, was worse thane awful. They didn't have an agent nor had they inform me which car rental they were supposed to have issued a voucher.Good. Night flight so tried to sleep most of the time. Very nice crew and smooth flight.The first leg of the trip was excellent. Lovely flight attendants and comfortable plane. The second leg left a lot to be desired. The flight attendant was rude when I asked for a Diet Coke, the boarding required quite a long walk and the plane was crammed and uncomfortable.Planes were on time. Pilot kept everyone updated. Crew was friendly and helpfulYou no longer give receipts for baggage at the counter. And it is next to impossible to get it on your webpage. Spent 20 min trying and gave up... I need receipt to submit for reimbursement and don't have time to waste on your poor webpage Disappointing .....The flight attendants were unkempt and show no customer service skills. They avoided eye contact. There were no smiles and they were dismissive and snarky.Complete flight rebooked and 6 hours delayed. Zero accountability from the airline or Kayak for the issues and I’m injured which is why I opted to pay more to fly than drive because it’s painful to sit or stand too long. What was supposed to be a 3ish hour travel day turned into a 9 hour excruciatingly painful experience that has left me in worse pain than when I initially started.It was a good flight, short so there was no food or water serviceChecking in very confusing compared to Hawaiian Airlines - much simpler! Front checking in at airport can improve. Hawaiian service always gives the extra mile, with a smile. Alaska can use and spread the Aloha Spirit. Mahalo nui loa Thank you 🤙Cramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneThree seats in first class were broken and while they were able to still acommodate us it was looking very touch and go and they had others they could not acommodateWe got surprised and switched to Alaska airline. Dirtiest tray and seats I have ever board on and we travel all the time. Help desk would not help by chat as I'm disabled to get my sets assigned tell me call Hawaiian air. I call Hawaiian air was told the flights RT are by Alaska. Make it short, worse flights of our life.Would have been better if the flight went out as scheduled and we’d have been kept informed. Rescheduling the connecting flight out of Portland was especially difficult.Very accommodating on flight changes when something came up. Definitely felt a notch above other airlines.Had a hard time checking into my flight on my phone because they gave me the wrong confirmation number. Otherwise everything else went well.First class ticket. They ran out of food and I sat hungry watching the others eatThey we able to seat my companion and I next to each other. Plane’s temperature was very cool. Willl be more prepared on return trip.All was good and they were able to seat my travel companion next to me. Thank you.Like the ample leg room. May as well not bother with snacks if it's only a two ounce bag of pretzels. Didn't use the entertainment option. Was there one?What an amazing flight. I haven’t experienced this level of service in a flight in years. This will be the only way to fly to Hawaii for me in the future.Kayak sold me a ticket after check in time. Could not check in. Could not get on flight.I did not take this flight because the reservation made by Kayak was wrong! Kayak owes me a trip from Minneapolis to Duluth.When I got to the airport in Seattle, they told me the flight "did not exist". Kayak reserved me a seat on a flight that did not exist. This is inexcusable. I was able to change my reservation to a flight that actually did exist, but the flight was later and then I didn't make it in time for the next leg of my trip from Minneapolis to Duluth. Kayak owes me a trip from Minneapolis to Duluth, and a big apology for messing up my reservation.The plane was freezing cold. Asked for a blanket and there were none. Was told twice that the pilots would warm the plane and it never happened Worst experience flying everMultiple delays because they screwed up on the crew schedule and had to wait for over an hour for more people to come.It was good. Basic flight. Drinks only. Pay budget. Get budget and I’m good with that. I want to get where I need to go. Not hard to please. Female First Officer is an absolute bonus for me!The Wi-Fi was off, the arm rests are hard plastic.The assistance with the wheel chairs was fabulous. All the people were so very friendly and helpful. I want to thank them all.We almost missed our return flight. We got to the gate one minute from closing the cabin door, and the agent got us aboard the plane! We are so very grateful!!!!!I already filled out a survey for this flight. We booked through KAYAK with airfare assist, and airfare assist did not confirm or honor our flight. Therefore, we had to go to a different place with a different travel agency. I tried very hard with airfare assist, They also promoted this on cheapair.com, but it was a bait and switch in both instances.Boarded flight, issues with the place and had to get off the plane, wait, and then board a different plane at a different gate. This impacted my short trip negatively. A worker died outside of the plane window and we sat there the entire time while they tried to revive him, unsuccessfully, which was traumatic.Frontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.This airline sucks. They offer low rates then charge you for everything, the app does not work well, the seats are the most uncomfortable. Maintenance issues on the flight, and you still have to sit through their credit card commercials. People are nice enough but does not make up for overall poor experience.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone.
