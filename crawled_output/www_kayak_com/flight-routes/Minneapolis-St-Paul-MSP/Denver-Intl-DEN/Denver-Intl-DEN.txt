The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!10.0 ExcellentG, Sep 2025LAS - ATLRead more Southwest reviewsI wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.The staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneThree seats in first class were broken and while they were able to still acommodate us it was looking very touch and go and they had others they could not acommodateMechanic delay in addition to a 2 hour change in takeoff time was frustrating.Delayed due to thunderstorms and no in-flight service due to rough weather — both of which are out of Delta’s control. Flight was good overall.I understand stuff happens, but plane failures are likely due to lack of maintenance. Additionally, air conditioning wasn't working, no snack/drink service, no WiFi. Fortunately, the crew was communicative and light-hearted. United grabbed another plane and we were able to get to our destination.Had to cancel first flight because Airporter Bus took over 3 hrs to get to airport which resulted in an extra $378 dollar fare . Is there anyway I can be reimbursed for initial fare since it was not my fault? Sent from my iPhone EJ LedetExcellent flight. Boarding was efficient and departure was on time. Smooth flight with on time arrival. Deplaning was also efficient.Our flight was understandably diverted to a small regional airport in Laramie, Wyoming due to weather conditions, which I fully recognize and appreciate. However, the low rating stems from the experience that followed: passengers remained on board for over an hour without the option to deplane and stretch, despite the aircraft being stationary. Although the pilot opened the cabin door, only he was permitted to exit. Meanwhile, passengers grew increasingly uncomfortable as warm summer air entered the cabin through the open door, and being in the second row meant we were impacted immediately. While the flight attendants made efforts to keep everyone at ease, I believe allowing passengers to deplane briefly, given the extended delay, would have significantly improved the overall experience.I never flew. Flight was canceled. DIA worst airport in the country. Avoid at all costs.Very rough getting into denver. my kid threw up it was so rough.Why wasn't this flight departure scheduled eith another crew so that it could leave on time? When we arrived in Denver we had so little time between flights we had run to the connecting flight. We should received some credit for the inconvenience.I was supposed to be on business class at first class from Denver back to Miami due to weather changes. I missed my connection and it’s put on a flight to Fort Lauderdale. Instead of honoring my business class/1st class ticket, they put me in coach, but there were two first class seats open. I think it’s absolutely disgusting that I paid for first class $1300 ticket and they put me in economy and they had to open seats available and I have still not been refunded the difference. I ended up having to eat a snack box instead of the meal I was supposed to get and did not get home till 2 AM so I think that’s a little pathetic that I had to live off crackers for dinner And my poor dog ate some cheese and salami. Oh yes, apparently when they switched me to the new flight they forgot to mention I had a service dogExcellent service despite turbulence during the flight. Flight attendants were remarkable!Flight attendant moved my bag without notifying me and was rude to me when I asked him about it. There was no reason to move it.The plane was freezing cold. Asked for a blanket and there were none. Was told twice that the pilots would warm the plane and it never happened Worst experience flying everMultiple delays because they screwed up on the crew schedule and had to wait for over an hour for more people to come.It was good. Basic flight. Drinks only. Pay budget. Get budget and I’m good with that. I want to get where I need to go. Not hard to please. Female First Officer is an absolute bonus for me!The Wi-Fi was off, the arm rests are hard plastic.The assistance with the wheel chairs was fabulous. All the people were so very friendly and helpful. I want to thank them all.We almost missed our return flight. We got to the gate one minute from closing the cabin door, and the agent got us aboard the plane! We are so very grateful!!!!!I already filled out a survey for this flight. We booked through KAYAK with airfare assist, and airfare assist did not confirm or honor our flight. Therefore, we had to go to a different place with a different travel agency. I tried very hard with airfare assist, They also promoted this on cheapair.com, but it was a bait and switch in both instances.Boarded flight, issues with the place and had to get off the plane, wait, and then board a different plane at a different gate. This impacted my short trip negatively. A worker died outside of the plane window and we sat there the entire time while they tried to revive him, unsuccessfully, which was traumatic.The flight there was frustrating but the flight home was very good.Flight was delayed in phoenix by 1 hour. When Kenny got to minneapolis st paul, Kenny missed his connecting flight to Duluth on Sun country air. Sun country customer service did nothing to help Kenny get home to Duluth. We will not fly with sun country ever again.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.Frontier Airlines was AWFUL. I was an hour early for my flight and the lady refused to check me in. I had to purchase a whole new ticket with a different airline.Late, terrible communication, horrible planning of passenger seating until the literal last minute. One of the worst flying experiences of my life. Y'all suckFirst of all, we never got on the connecting flight to Denver. They delayed our flight for two hours. If we would have gotten on that flight, we would have been stuck in Denver for 13 hours. So we re- routed our flight for a straight through flight to Oklahoma two days later. THEN, they delayed that flight for two hours. After that we were able to finally get on our flight and come home. Frontier Airlines - one of the worst airlines I have ever been on.Terrible communication with weather delay, lost baggage, near impossible to reach customer serviceMy tickets got canceled on me by your site and I didn't have a flight. Then you kept sending me emails on the status of q flight I didn't have tickets for.Flight was late. Missed connecting in Denver. My new flight is more than 24 hours later and I have no room, vouchers, or compensation, and might also be bumped from the one tomorrow.This was one of the first frontier airline flights this spring that wasn't delayed. It actually left on time. Some of the flight crew did not look happy, they didn't smile when the passengers were boarding or getting off the plane, and the passengers initiated greetings, not the staff. To me this was an odd experience to have with any flight/airline. I had a bad experience booking this flight. The price didn't solidify until late hours into the night. Ever time I purchased the ticket, I either received a denial email or an error because the price has changed, but it was never reflected on the flyfrontier or kayak websites until way after midnight on the date of travel. This caused me anxiety and irritation with the websites. Then I noticed a mishap with my name on my voucher as I went to check in, it was incorrect. When I proceeded to correct it, Frontier had no easy, let alone free, way to remedy it. I couldn't correct my name without a $75 charge, I couldn't cancel my voucher to repurchase it with the correct name without a $100 charge, because it was too close to departure. Then calling frontier was nearly impossible to remedy the situation with a human. It's already difficult to want to choose frontier because of all the upcharges, but you feel kinda trapped into doing so because it's the more affordable airline.Southwest8.0Delta7.9United Airlines7.4Sun Country Air6.9Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Minneapolis to DenverAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Minneapolis to DenverFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Minneapolis to Denver according to KAYAK users.
