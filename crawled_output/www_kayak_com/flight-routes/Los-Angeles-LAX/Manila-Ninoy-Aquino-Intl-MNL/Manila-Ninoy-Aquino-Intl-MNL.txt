Other airlines should learn from them when it comes to boarding and departing from the airplane. They also display efficiency in serving meals. They don't keep the aisles blocked for hours like some other airlines. The food is poor. Generally the food was unrecognizable and poorly prepared. The only thing that made it better than US flag carriers is that there was a fresh fruit bowl with each meal.8.0 ExcellentDavid, Sep 2025SEA - TPERead more EVA Air reviewsThe crews are very efficient.

Cabin and restrooms were kept cleanVery good service and food. Crew was professional and considerate. Cabin and restrooms were kept cleanEVA airlines was excellent: on time or early, safe, courteous crew. Highly recommended.Flight Attendants could have been nicer and food portions could be bigger.Great experience, comfort and food is delicious. Always great service and one timeThe food from Los Angeles to Taipei made me throw up. The flight is also not comfort. But the staffs are very friendly and nice.Aircraft was late getting to the gate - probably due to weather. We left the gate one hour late and had to wait another hour since we lost our slot in the takeoff queue. Our box was very wet and was falling apart when we got to Clark. It appears that luggage was exposed to weather in TPE while waiting to be loaded. Crew, however, handled the delay well and was able to provide planned service.I appreciate the email reminders for online check-in which made my entry to the lines less stressful. The flight was on schedule and on time. The baording staff were proactively helpful and approachable. The airplane inflight food, entertainment and comfies as well as provisions are excellent even in the economy seating. The airline transfer was smooth and easy! Luggage safe and intact! Thank you EVA airline for making my trip a reliable safe and comfortable experience.I was sleep when they brought the food. They had put a note on my seat. There was no food when I asked for food later. There was just one main meal served in this 14 hours flight. They offered me sandwich with ham which I don’t eat since I am pescatarian. Long story short I had to wait to get to TPE to get something to eat. I am extremely disappointed from the service. I have been flying EVA since I was 1 year old. Perhaps no more EVA for me. Seems EVA glorious day is long goneThe flat bed full lying position is not comfortable at all, this could be improved, it is at an awkward position which i dont have the same issues with other airlines business class.The flight was uneventful and the crew was kind and professional. Really appreciate the option to order a vegan meal for the flight!I love my Delta crew, they were so welcoming and helpful.Overall was a lovely experience. The crew were kind and courteous throughout the entire flight.Sat next to a woman who had her period. Blood was on her seat and on the arm rest between us. I ended up having period blood on my jacket and shoes. Very gross!Better organization of boarding procedures. Terrible leadership guiding people to gates.They need to improve on how the plane lands cause it was not smooth at all.I did not like how the plane landed. It was not smooth.Been flying with China Airline over years many times. Good experience with them, no issues.China Airlines crews are very excellent doing their job. Very friendly and hardworking. I will always choose China Airlines over and over. Thank you all for making my flight comfortable. God bless to all the staff. :)Better screens, it would have been nice to have more comfortable seats.2nd major delay due to maintenance issues. 1st delay missed my connecting flight.Very clean ,flight attendants very professional,nice , Boarding was very easyThe aircraft was massive (A-380) and became crowded with 400+ passengers on board.My luggage didn’t arrive with my flight. Flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours while we sat on the plane and I almost missed my connecting flight and subsequently missed the last train from the airport so it took me another 2 hours to get to my destination after arriving, Crew skipped me several times when offering beverages, and I couldn’t get their attention at times because they wouldn’t even make eye contact with me. They didn’t give me a form for disembarking so I had to go to the back of the line after waiting an eternity for immigration. Paid for on flight wi- fi that didn’t work for most of the flight.Love flying Asiana. Been using it for over a decade now.Coming back to America was a peaceful flight everyone and everything was perfectThe staff was courteous and the flight was very smooth. It was so nice to see the captain greeting the passengers at the end of the flights.The beefsteak on the lunch menu was excellent! I usually do not eat airplane food. I loved it.Flight was too cold. I wore a regular cotton tee and it wasn’t enough. It was a night time flight so I would have thought a blanket would be provided to passengers. A 4 hour flight and no options for a meal? I flew Asiana the next day from Seoul to Manilla. Same duration, 4 hours. They give everyone a pillow and blanket and serve a meal. Why is United so cheap and holding back meals and amenities? Also, they promote too much gay stuff and DEI in their advertisements. Please be mindful of other beliefs and don’t shove your gay ideology down my throat.they are deley vancouver to hankong 3 hour after honkong 20 hour stay there honkong not visa approved and they cant help to visa so we are stay in airport 20 hour even honkong staf very bad person they cant do for us 6 hour we arround they said you there you go there waste time next time i dont want to go cathay stay in honkongI was only given 2 meals, and my screen showed that there were 3 meals. Second meal was 1-2 hours late according to the screen.Just want to do a little more clean up so does not smell like urine.Entertainment for kids was good. Good was terrible, needs lots of work.If I had blood clots, that window seat would've killed me for certain.Short staffs, I ask stewardess to bring me cognac twice during dinner but they didn't bring it!I've stomach problems after 2 hours of flight, Iris, the flight purser not only did her best to make me feel comfortable, she went above and beyond providing pain relievers medicines and ointment. She look and found a doctor passenger on the flight to provide advise. She even report on ground staffs about my condition and provide wheelchair upon arrival. Kudos to her and Cathay Pacific!I have a Peanut Allergy and the Steward staff were very accommodating in ensuring my safety as my allergy is life threatening. Very professional and so vested in their profession.Everything was fine and I have no complaints or things to note.The economy seats are much indeed roomier. Meals needs improvement.It’s sad how legacy airlines feel like budget airlines now. Cramped space Non reclining seats No inflight entertainment (need to connect via your own device) Saving grace is the crew. Truly nice and sincere service.Short flight with limited entertainment wasn't that bad. Staff was friendly and plane was clean. Meal was good.It was great! The flight was on time and had a smoother flightCrew excellent calling me by name ! Only downside was no inflight WiFiI was glad that the plane was not totally full.Boarding and flying on time is the most important need of passengers they did thatEverything was very good but seats are small for a big man!Well, I needed to make a change to my flight and I called the airline and they said yes no problem $700 and we can do that and I agreed to it so they canceled my tickets and went to rebook and came back after being on hold for an hour and a half and said I’m sorry, sir. There was an error. It is $2800 Now and I said never mind. I will just use those flights and she proceeded to tell me that they already canceled them because I said I was interested in doing the change. I told her yes for $700. I was fine with doing a change but not $2800 so give me my tickets back and she proceeded to tell me that she could not do that and I had to pay the $2800 to get my tickets back that I already spent $2800 on. So I had to book tickets on another airline to get home And that cost a lot of money too. I’m a little pissed off at Philippine airline right now because of what they did to me and I’m not sure I ever wanna fly with them again. I’ve flown with them plenty in the past, but this just really put a bad taste in my mouth.. Not to mention on my way there leaving Seattle going to Vancouver. I got to the airport three hours in advance and they had booked me through Alaska Airlines to do that little trip. My connecting flight would leave about six hours after I got to Vancouver BC. I stood in Alaska Airlines lying for a little over two hours and then they proceeded to tell me that they couldn’t check me in because I wasn’t there an hour in advance. I kept telling the lady at the beginning of the line that I was afraid they were not gonna let me in because it was taking so long and she said oh don’t worry about it. You’re fine you’ve got time. Well I ended up spending $600 to get to Canada that night just to make my connecting flight because Alaska air wouldn’t do anything and Filipino Air told me it was Alaska air problem but Alaska air said since you booked through Philippine air, we can’t fix it. I had about 50 minutes to make my flight, but they refused to check me in because I wasn’t there an hour in advance yet. I’ve been standing in their line for about two hours and 15 minutes.reach the standard, crew tried to fix up issues fast.Overall the flight was a good experience. It is different from American Airlines because they board the back of the plane first rather than the front first. Food was decent. They gave out pillows ,blankets , and face masks. I did find this airline had faster flights back home than others. Less travel and layover time.EVA Air8.4China Airlines8.3Asiana Airlines8.2Cathay Pacific7.6Philippine Airlines7.2Everything you need to know for your flight from Los Angeles to ManilaAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Los Angeles to ManilaFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Los Angeles to Manila according to KAYAK users.
