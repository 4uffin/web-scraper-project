Only the fish entree in the Japanese meal was overcooked and quite dry but everything else was great10.0 Excellentmichael, Sep 2025LHR - HNDRead more ANA reviewsEverything was excellent. Only the fish entree in the Japanese meal was overcooked and quite dry but everything else was greatGreat first time experience on this airline. Very professional staff and great service.Warm the bread. Movies: better choices to include Chinese movies options or some of the older winners of flim festivalBusiness class on ANA was awesome. There lie flat seats made it easier to sleep on a 12 hour flight. Food was great and service was excellent.The crew was very nice and polite. They made sure everybody got their meal and drinks. Even the economy class had a very adequate leg room for someone that is over 6 foot tall.Overall it was good. Making changes to the reservation on ANA’s website was little challenging. Would like to see those features improved in the future.The flight crew was outstanding. Very cheerful and always respectful. I wish the same could be said about United. The AC wasn't the best on the plane.The seats are uncomfortable. The flight attendants are not pleasant. They do their job, but not with a ray of sunshine and warmth. The food was awful, not what I would expect from an Asian airline. All of the other Asian airlines I have flown have far better food. The food was on par with United airlines food, which is really bad. Maybe ANA should get out of the alliance with United.During booking, I selected the seats so that my wife and I would sit next to each other. However, the airline changed our seats at boarding so that we were seated apart. Very disappointing.Every leg of the flight was late causing us to miss our flight to Okinawa and have to take the next flight out.highly recommend for trip to japan only reason why i gave good not excellent is because their selection of movies and tv shows in English is more limited .I avoid American Airlines for a reason. Our flight was delayed at LAX. The situation at the gate was chaotic. The woman making announcements wasn't being clear or transparent regarding why there were delays. There was a lot of confusion regarding flight and gate status. Other passengers were pretty rude. I was elbowed in the eye by someone who was in a hurry to get their bags from the overhead bin immediately after the flight landed. Ultimately, I will avoid AA as much as possible in the future.We asked for Hindu vegetarian meal in advance and the quality of the food was horrendous. Never flying JAL again!Overall a great experience. One complain was the vegetarian food that my wife had which was mostly boiled vegetables with not much flavor.Very accommodating and kind airline crews. The plane is also big which makes the passengers more comfortable and relaxI actually didn’t make it onto the flight. I spent quite a few hours trying to rebook the flight just to get screwed out of $5000. Fun!We booked business class round trip from Delhi to San Diego and back. On our last leg from Bangalore to Delhi we were down graded to economy class which was big disappointment other than that everything was great.Had an incident with a stewardess who insisted that I take a seat. I informed her that I came to use the restroom and to have some water. After using the restroom, I wanted to stretch my legs out a little cuz my knees were aching from sitting. I understood her concern for my concern and the potential turbulence (she said she knows this route and the turbulence and safety is not to be taken lightly) but I felt that her mood, tone, demeanor, and a lack of compassion for the pain in my knees were not the proper way to address a customer or anyone for that matter. This left a bitter taste in my mouth. It was her lack of professionalism that surprised me.we have requested for hindu veg. meal during booking. but served meal was of very poor qualty and taste. they can get such meal from 5 star Indian restaurant at Vancouver/ tokyo/ Bangalore.pure hindu veg meal and no AVMLIt was good but need mor amenities for toiletries and entertainmentCrew and service excellent. 2 hour delay for takeoff. SQ app showed flight on time.The usual excellent experience with Singapore Airlines. The airplane was on time and actually early to Haneda Airport. The onboarding experience was pleasant with no delays, perhaps owing to the fact that the flight was not full. Nevertheless, the air crew were their usual outstanding standards in serving the passengers.Horrendous. We upgraded and they took the money but cancelled one of our tickets. The recline action didn’t work on the seats for the flight from Singapore to London, pre booked meals but they seemed to have disappeared as well.. Phone customer service was horrendous. Took 5 phone calls and no fix. Craig at the airport was the only one who seemed to be able to get the ticket back.Very good flight from Boarding to landing -efficient and comfortable with decent entertainment optionsConstruction at PDX resulting in very lung walk from the rental car to the gate. SFO, extremely long walk between terminals to get to connecting Singapore airlines flight. My smart watch recorded a total of 3 miles.Crew and service was excellent, but passengers should be offered a welcome drink before take off which did not happen. Food was very good. Unfortunately the lie-flat bed in business class was one of the most uncomfortable I have experienced. The configuration forces you to sleep with your legs at an angle instead of in a straight line, plus there is very little padding on the bed so it wasn't possible to sleep for more than 2-3 hours on an 18 hour flight. For what the airlines charges for a business class ticket their hard product leaves a lot to be desired.Delayed 1hour due to storm still didn't get window seat for third flight despite paying £240 extra to book themEverything was great keep up the good work 😁, can't ask for more.Flight from SFO did not include entertainment as it was not working the entire duration of the flight. Was informed that there would be a $350 voucher for the inconvenience. Uncertain how the voucher will be provided.The food options and quality could use some more excitement and variety.Easy to board and fly, no frills. Yummy ramen on board.It was for the most part a 10/10 they said they had entertainment options but all they had was old movies for streaming from the mid 2010’s so like 10 years agoall good for a very budget flight - well priced and excellent service. Will fly againCouple of the crew members were really nice and the rest are really rude and didn't help when we needed help, food was not worth it at all and most importantly there's no even entertainment system other than a very interruptive and slow internet and some movies.I appreciate the economy price of the tickets. The long flight made the comfort level on the lower average side. Wi-Fi connection was not consistent but working. Overall, I would fly again with zip air but next time get the flat, premium seats with the amount of money I would save otherwise.Comfortable seats and lucky no one was in middle seat. No water on the plane. Plane was on time and staff was fast.You get what you pay for and nothing more. Wanted a cheap flight and that’s exactly what I got, though it’s human nature to wanting to feel like you got a good deal as well. There was none of that here. I was cheap and they were too. Got to my destination safely and that’s all that really matters.Nice service. I wish it could provide hot water on the flight.internet didn't work. No offer of drinks or snacks.Flight was seamless. Free wifi helped pass the time. Food was okay, just make sure you pre order or pick something up from the airportThe flight got cancelled so I don’t know why or what happened. We waited around and didn’t know until so late and they couldn’t really help with anything but had us call the airlines.United sent me a mileage plus number last year but that number is invalid so I can’t use it to check into flights or collect mileage. There is human to speak about the problem, only computers who keep asking me if I am using the correct email. It’s so frustrating and I cannot resolve it.it was so bad. I tried to board my flight from vancouver to saskatoon. And to my surprise they did not board me cause the flight was changed and no email was send to me. and on my boarding pass which i got from seattle says different flight. I did not knew anyone from Vancouver, air canada crew was rude, i asked for today flight but they were rude and i had early morning dental appointment in saskatoon. I was so much in pain and my whole day is wasted today. and i suffered alot. They did provide me hotel but they did not provide me any food. I am really really disappointed first time had so bad experience with air canada. I may think twice to book it again. If i can get any reply or any composition that would be great. ThanksThe food was the worst I’ve had on any flight I’ve ever been on.For economy, it was very good. Staff was great, they even let some of us change seats for more leg room... Put an empty seat between us which was fantastic for a 12hr flight. Onboard entertainment was excellent, I think over 200 choices of movies/tv/etc The bad was the barely/nonfunctional wifi that cost either $16.99 or 1700 miles (full flight). It was atrocious... Definitely the worst of the last 3 long haul major airlines I was on the last few months.The gate was too far away for the connecting flightSeats were comfortable. It’s was so cold and very uncomfortable. I paid 2000 miles for wifi service that was choppy the whole flight. Would like to be reimbursed for my miles Food was so disappointing. Three cold and terrible meals for $3000 round trip. This needs to be better.Very good - being handicap it was very hard for me in a center aisle bulkhead seat that Zi was assigned think it was 29-G as I had a hard time opening the entertainment screen and tray table. 30-G would have maid it easier. I was assign 29-G as it was the only handicap seat without being charged even though I was handicap (disability)Plenty of room for me and the cat in Premium Economy. Seat was comfortable. Boarding was a breeze. The lady at the special check-in desk was great, super helpful and professional.Smooth flight. As always dinner could have been more generous. Breakfast was great.ANA8.4Japan Airlines8.3Singapore Airlines8.1ZIPAIR7.6United Airlines7.4Everything you need to know for your flight from Los Angeles to TokyoAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Los Angeles to TokyoFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo according to KAYAK users.
