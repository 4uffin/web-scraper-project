It was awesome to have boarding from the front and back of the plane as it made the process go very quicklyIt was okay. The airplane was a little smaller than a flight from Thailand to Helsinki.Wish that everyone would board the back of the plane first. Also let kids on first. The gate wasn’t open at arrival and we waited 45 minutes to takeoff. They made up for time in the air.This was an absolutely exceptional flight. The flight attendants were extremely attentive and very friendly. They seemed to go out of their way to make us comfortable and to make sure that we had everything we needed., We were in business and were very happy with the size and the details for our pods. We would definitely recommend Finnair and will definitely be flying with them again.We had an excellent trip with Finnair. This was our first time and we’re very pleased. The only issue was with the boarding - it was a little bit confusing and needs a little bit of streamlining.Crew very lovely. Arrived an hour late due to bad weather. We were given new tickets to an other flight but it could have been organised better, so we did not have to run through the whole airport to.Flight delayed over an hour. They said they would hold our connection but then did not.Major problems checking in at Alaska counter. They could not find our booking code because it came from Finnair.Do not use KAYAK or Finair for future travel. Unless you purchase the tickets directly from the airline, you were going to have a difficult time checking in. Kayak canceled my flights twice and ended up causing great difficulty in me getting back from Europe because they double sold my tickets between American Airlines and Finair. The event caused significant delays and led to me having to rebook my flights.The staff were all particularly great. The plane was clean and fresh. The bassinet worked great. It was all very nice.The seats in economy were appeared to be quite thin and lack sufficient cushioning to be comfortable. Perhaps it was my seating position but the plane seemed notably load.The entertainment package was vast and the selections were very current. Keep updating it was great.The seat was so hard my tailbone was aching The crew was kind of a b**** because I made a joke that I didn't care if they close the door I total c*** when she was trying to f****** act like she was mad at me because I said that The flight was bumpy. Sure you didnt have control over that.Boarding: Boarding was a bit of a mess. Our tickets indicated "BC" for Business Class, but we and many others were confused as that was not indicated anywhere in the airport, so we didn't know when we're supposed to board. The airplane: The airplane was nice. However, we sat near the back of the business class cabin and the flight attendants and passengers from other cabins would constantly move the curtain (which was very loud), preventing me from fallling asleep on my 8 hour flight. The flight crew: Amazing, generally. However, they nearly forgot to serve breakfast to me. The flight food: I was able to select my meal for dinner, which was really good. Breakfast was a bit of a mess, however. The crew forgot to serve me breakfast until the last minute. Very little was available by the time they remembered. The entertainment: Paltry, underwhelming, and dated. Not one new movie was available. Bottom line: For the money, you might want to consider other options for your international business class flights.We arrived 4 hours early and still almost missed the flight because they weren’t able to access one of the boarding tickets. They then sent hour bags late and we were all of our without clothing and eventually had to take an expensive cab back and forth to the airport as they wouldn’t deliver the bag which arrived late at night that day and we would have to wait until noon the began day (messing up a second day of plans). Also, all the food has dairy or pork. No vegan or even vegetarian option in the flight—even for purchase.4 hours late, including over +1 hour waiting in plane to take off. Baggage left behind too.While waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.Was not able to watch most shows on the entertainment site. They would not loadOur flight was 1.5 hours delayed. There was no weather for the inbound flight, so I don't understand why. This meant a VERY late arrival and only a quick nap before my morning flight.Delayed flight, so I switched fights to SFO to Phoenix , Phoenix to DSM. Excellent service through American AirlinesThis flight arrived late. We joined well over a thousand of other people waiting to go through customs. Air Portugal has lost my bag. We had to chase down a representative even though we had waited at the baggage claim for well over 1 hour and 35 minutes for baggage to come. No representative was there to explain the delay or to give any direction. After 1 hour and 35 minutes at least four passengers had no baggage to pick up or had a fraction of their baggage. The representative was a young woman who clearly did not have the experience to deal with what was happening. Very disappointing as of course we were dealing with great amount of jet lag and having been up for 24 hours at that point and not being able to have any of the things necessary at home that were contained in the bag was quite upsetting. That instant occurred last night at approximately 11:15 p.m. and as of 12:30 p.m. the next day I have not heard anything from Air Portugal.An old airplane with very uncomfortable seats in the Comfort “class! Small, narrow, and hard seat. Entertainment options are inferior, old movies. Boarding started at the back of the airplane, as we entered the aircraft last instead of after business class, risking the possibility that the comfort section would not have room for carry-on in the overhead bin. The food was ok. White wine was terrible. Overall, the flight felt worse than cheap airliners, and the price was as high as premium carriers.I had a business class ticket from EWR to Madrid with a layover at LIS for 11 hours. It was obvious that I needed to pick up my luggage in Lisbon for 11 hours and check it in again when boarding the second flight to Madrid. Before buying the ticket, I called TAP customer service. Customer service assured me that I could get my luggage in Lisbon. When I arrived at Newark airport, I immediately asked to check my luggage to Lisbon. However, the TAP employee refused me, saying that I should resolve this issue upon arrival in Lisbon. She checked my luggage to Madrid. I asked the TAP employee at the gate to help me when boarding the plane, I asked the flight attendants manager on board the plane to help me. All the employees refused to help me and said that I should resolve this issue in Lisbon. It took me 4 hours to resolve this issue in Lisbon. I arrived at 11am and they didn't give me my luggage until 3pm. As a result, I was so tired after a sleepless night on the plane and 4 hours on my feet at the airport and all my plans were ruined that I couldn't fly to Madrid. It was a terrible experiance,The seats were not designed to comfortably see people in coach for more than 10 minutesVery rude person at the boarding desk; flight attendant coughing 3 inches from my face three times- not even covering her mouth; boarding process very unacceptable for older people with stairs to all planes (are you all stuck in the 1960’s?). I am sure that I am not remembering all of the negative things, but I am sure you get the message!We flew TAP last October from Newark to Lisbon. The meal was bad. This flight had good food. Also, this flight was delayed. There were TAP employees waiting at Lisbon to make sure we made our connecting flight. I find the TAP website and app frustrating, but the service once we reached the airport was very goodFlight being delayed for 35 minutes had me lose the connection to my transportThe long wait at JFK made the trip horrible. Also not having enough buses when we deplaned was annoyingFlight was delayed on 6/20 to miss international connection. Next flight out was 24 hours later. Not acceptable.Terrible! I had to cancel our flights due to my wife Carmen requiring an unexpected second cancer surgery. I first contacted orbitz about obtaining a credit due to medical interruption and orbitz directed me to TAP. I contacted TAP and the representative directed me back to orbitz and refused to even explain what TAP’s medical interruption policy was or how it worked—I wanted that information for a second call to orbitz. Terrible service at a particularly difficult time.The crew were friendly and helpful. Iberia lost our luggage on arrival, Friday and we didn't get it until Sunday at 10:00 p.m. local Malaga time. I also paid $382.80 for seat assignments but two out out of the four were not together. Iberia mentioned that it was because the plane was delayed in Madrid before our flight began in LAX. They should compensate us half of my payment.We liked the flight but while we purchased an aisle seat, our seats had a different configuration on this flight. A fellow passenger suggested that the airplane had been changed. Too bad we were not informed and had no chance to modify our seat preferences. We were stuck in the window and middle seats with no chance to walk around and go to the bathroom without disturbing our sleeping fellow passenger.Boarding an international flight via several sets of stairs and shuttle busses to the tarmac even when multiple jet-bridges were empty at Madrid airport (the hub for Iberia) was not pleasant. I was fine, but a lot of elderly folks and families with kids were struggling. A bad way to start a flight. Business class seats were nice, although not cleaned well from the prior flight.The flight was great; I don't see any area of improvement.The crew were not very personable. The crew did not serve tea or coffee. The bathroom was not kept clean. Two out of the 5 toilets in the cabin weren't working.Delayed first flight Geneva Madrid.. We didn’t miss our 2nd flight only because the 2nd flight Madrid Dallas was 1h delayed. However we did end up missing the 3rd leg Dallas Austin. Luggage didn’t show up in Dallas. So we re missing 2 suit cases. Customer service sent us to a hotel in Dallas. Only one room booked for 5!! Pretty bad experience overall. I won’t book a flight on Iberia in the futureCrew was excellent, great customer service, checked luggage took 1 hour and a half to come out at the baggage claim, the only negative thing about the flight.Horrible experience airline crew was unprofessional. Flight was delayed. Suit cases did not arrive. Never flying iberia againIberia lost my bag, said they found it in another country, said they sent it to me, but never did. Went my whole trip without my stuff, but expecting it to show up because that’s what they said would happen. Their communication sucks, their website sucks, and to top it all off, their seats are small and uncomfortable. They’re bad at their jobs and they should feel bad about themselves. Do not even get me started on the flight home. AVOID!The flight was delayed over 4 hours. Business class is just slightly upgraded economy.Need to offer Better food from LAX to London Service from London to Delhi very delayed after take off.Great crew and food and beverage. Seating tight but not the airline's fault. Will definitely fly BA in future!Three major things that led to my low rating, 1. Internet wasn't available for the whole time, and 2. TV became available way into flight, after numerous system reboots, and 3. Food is not good at all.Crying baby the ENTIRE flight. Not your fault, but I paid 2700 for a premium economy ticket and it wasn't worth it. should have just stuck with coach. flight attendants very mediocre - minimal effort. Plane didn't seem very clean. Didn't have any cleansing wipes - most airlines give you this when you board. Flat screen scrolling didn't work. Toiletry case a joke - why bother at all?Was delayed on first leg and missed connection. They would not let me board although I arrived at the gate 5 min before take off. I was delayed 24hrsEnjoyable flight, helpful crew everything was organized to accommodate passengers.I was transferred to an American Airlines flight. The boarding was late and unorganized. The seating was extremely tight and uncomfortable. Will not use AA again.The check-in of my luggage was terrible. When purchased my tickets, one luggage and one carry-on was part of the fight. My flight was switched from British to American Airline. During check-in of luggage at the airport, I was denied and had to pay extra $75. How do I get reimbursed for this extra luggage payment?This was the second time on BA, food terrible, bathrooms gross,( granted, that was mostly due to the disgusting children urinating all over it)boarding was late and disorganized. No gate issued until last minute st Heathrow, bad system, caused undue stress. Seats were painful, that's what you get for traveling like a poor in economy, right BA? Should have been able to afford business or first class if you want to actually be able to walk upright without back pain after a trip.The delay was not communicated via text and the person who helped with check in also didn’t inform me about the delay. I ended up missing my connection and it was a waste of 5 hours. The crew didn’t mention there would be someone at the gate informing of if I would be rebooked and there was no signage. Overall a very poor experience. The British Airways app was also very buggy, and didn’t work. I will avoid flying with British Airways when possible.Finnair7.6American Airlines7.2TAP AIR PORTUGAL7.1Iberia7.0British Airways6.7Everything you need to know for your flight from Los Angeles to MadridAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Los Angeles to MadridFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Los Angeles to Madrid according to KAYAK users.
