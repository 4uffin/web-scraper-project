Only the fish entree in the Japanese meal was overcooked and quite dry but everything else was greatGreat first time experience on this airline. Very professional staff and great service.Warm the bread. Movies: better choices to include Chinese movies options or some of the older winners of flim festivalI was able to change my flight last minute. It was more expensive, but that was my fault. Thank you for allowing me to fly!Business class on ANA was awesome. There lie flat seats made it easier to sleep on a 12 hour flight. Food was great and service was excellent.The crew was very nice and polite. They made sure everybody got their meal and drinks. Even the economy class had a very adequate leg room for someone that is over 6 foot tall.Overall it was good. Making changes to the reservation on ANA’s website was little challenging. Would like to see those features improved in the future.The flight crew was outstanding. Very cheerful and always respectful. I wish the same could be said about United. The AC wasn't the best on the plane.The seats are uncomfortable. The flight attendants are not pleasant. They do their job, but not with a ray of sunshine and warmth. The food was awful, not what I would expect from an Asian airline. All of the other Asian airlines I have flown have far better food. The food was on par with United airlines food, which is really bad. Maybe ANA should get out of the alliance with United.During booking, I selected the seats so that my wife and I would sit next to each other. However, the airline changed our seats at boarding so that we were seated apart. Very disappointing.highly recommend for trip to japan only reason why i gave good not excellent is because their selection of movies and tv shows in English is more limited .I avoid American Airlines for a reason. Our flight was delayed at LAX. The situation at the gate was chaotic. The woman making announcements wasn't being clear or transparent regarding why there were delays. There was a lot of confusion regarding flight and gate status. Other passengers were pretty rude. I was elbowed in the eye by someone who was in a hurry to get their bags from the overhead bin immediately after the flight landed. Ultimately, I will avoid AA as much as possible in the future.We asked for Hindu vegetarian meal in advance and the quality of the food was horrendous. Never flying JAL again!Japan airline is excellent service .I recommend to Kayak and Japan airline to Frend.Overall a great experience. One complain was the vegetarian food that my wife had which was mostly boiled vegetables with not much flavor.Very accommodating and kind airline crews. The plane is also big which makes the passengers more comfortable and relaxI actually didn’t make it onto the flight. I spent quite a few hours trying to rebook the flight just to get screwed out of $5000. Fun!We booked business class round trip from Delhi to San Diego and back. On our last leg from Bangalore to Delhi we were down graded to economy class which was big disappointment other than that everything was great.Had an incident with a stewardess who insisted that I take a seat. I informed her that I came to use the restroom and to have some water. After using the restroom, I wanted to stretch my legs out a little cuz my knees were aching from sitting. I understood her concern for my concern and the potential turbulence (she said she knows this route and the turbulence and safety is not to be taken lightly) but I felt that her mood, tone, demeanor, and a lack of compassion for the pain in my knees were not the proper way to address a customer or anyone for that matter. This left a bitter taste in my mouth. It was her lack of professionalism that surprised me.we have requested for hindu veg. meal during booking. but served meal was of very poor qualty and taste. they can get such meal from 5 star Indian restaurant at Vancouver/ tokyo/ Bangalore.pure hindu veg meal and no AVMLThe flat bed full lying position is not comfortable at all, this could be improved, it is at an awkward position which i dont have the same issues with other airlines business class.The flight was uneventful and the crew was kind and professional. Really appreciate the option to order a vegan meal for the flight!I love my Delta crew, they were so welcoming and helpful.I absolutely loved my flight from Taipei to LAX. I was originally assigned to a different seat, however one of the stewardess noticed I was uncomfortable in my seat. She offered to move me to a more comfortable setting. Although she didn’t have to do what she did, I am more than grateful and thankful for her doing so. My longer flight felt much more comfortable, just by her taking notice. I really appreciate her.Overall was a lovely experience. The crew were kind and courteous throughout the entire flight.Better organization of boarding procedures. Terrible leadership guiding people to gates.I did not like how the plane landed. It was not smooth.Been flying with China Airline over years many times. Good experience with them, no issues.China Airlines crews are very excellent doing their job. Very friendly and hardworking. I will always choose China Airlines over and over. Thank you all for making my flight comfortable. God bless to all the staff. :)Most relaxing long distance flight I have been on. And I have flown on many.Better screens, it would have been nice to have more comfortable seats.2nd major delay due to maintenance issues. 1st delay missed my connecting flight.It was great, but my bag was not loaded onto the connecting flight. I'm currently getting it resolved. If this isn't a problem, everything else was excellent.Very clean ,flight attendants very professional,nice , Boarding was very easyThe plane hasnt left im stuck in seatle still my flight has been grounded for almost 5 hoursMy luggage didn’t arrive with my flight. Flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours while we sat on the plane and I almost missed my connecting flight and subsequently missed the last train from the airport so it took me another 2 hours to get to my destination after arriving, Crew skipped me several times when offering beverages, and I couldn’t get their attention at times because they wouldn’t even make eye contact with me. They didn’t give me a form for disembarking so I had to go to the back of the line after waiting an eternity for immigration. Paid for on flight wi- fi that didn’t work for most of the flight.Love flying Asiana. Been using it for over a decade now.Coming back to America was a peaceful flight everyone and everything was perfectI had a bad experience coming from America to Thailand. On my connecting flight my check in suitcase was not put on the departing aircraft, I received my suitcase 24 hours after arriving in Bangkok and when I open my luggage my hand swelled up. The next morning when I put on an outfit from my suitcase my face swelled up and became numb. My entire vacation was ruined it seems that some kind of chemical was sprayed into suitcase and ruined my clothes and got me sick. The staff at my hotel called the airline and spoke to someone and they told me to file a complaint and gave my a website to do so. I did not file a complaint I felt like it would have fell on death ears. I had to throw away my brand new vacation clothes and suitcase and I had the worst vacation ever due to this happening to me.The beefsteak on the lunch menu was excellent! I usually do not eat airplane food. I loved it.The entertainment package was vast and the selections were very current. Keep updating it was great.The seat was so hard my tailbone was aching The crew was kind of a b**** because I made a joke that I didn't care if they close the door I total c*** when she was trying to f****** act like she was mad at me because I said that The flight was bumpy. Sure you didnt have control over that.4 hours late, including over +1 hour waiting in plane to take off. Baggage left behind too.While waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.Was not able to watch most shows on the entertainment site. They would not loadOur flight was 1.5 hours delayed. There was no weather for the inbound flight, so I don't understand why. This meant a VERY late arrival and only a quick nap before my morning flight.Delayed flight, so I switched fights to SFO to Phoenix , Phoenix to DSM. Excellent service through American AirlinesAA re-routed flight from HNL to LAX due to delay. My group of 3 with reserved seats in row 9 was broken up, with one assigned to a middle seat, another in the last row of the plane. Not happy. No explanation to the delay. No apologies. No compensation. Would have been nice to be offered an Admiral Club admission or a voucher for the extra 3 hours of layover in LAX. Could not hear the boarding gate announcements in LAX. Adjacent gate was boarding at the same time. Loud speakers were competing against each other. Barely made my boarding group.Almost a 6 hour flight and the only food option is a cheese plate… and chips. Also how is it there are no options for texting on American. I’ll be going back to delta and united.Bad food, small seats that didn’t recline. I thought I was buying a quantas ticket so I feel like I got scammedANA8.4Japan Airlines8.3China Airlines8.3Asiana Airlines8.2American Airlines7.2Everything you need to know for your flight from Los Angeles to OkinawaAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsLos Angeles (LAX)Okinawa (OKA)Cabin class types available on flights from Los Angeles to OkinawaCabin classes available on flights from Los Angeles to Okinawa.
