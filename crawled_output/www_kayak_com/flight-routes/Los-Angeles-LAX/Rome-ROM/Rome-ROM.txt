No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.2.0 MediocreAnonymous, Sep 2025SNA - SEARead more Delta reviewsFlight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.My husband upgraded our seats and I don't know if it was due to the type of planet was or if they didn't upgrade our seats. We were supposed to be in I believe comfort seats and they were just as tight as any other seat- no leg room and we are very tall people but at least it wasn't extremely cold. My husband did put in a complaint about our seating because he paid extra and if we would have known that the space and the tightness would have been the same, we just would have gotten the emergency row emergency row seats that we normally get. We love Delta but both our flights coming home we're not good. Oh I forgot to mention that on our flight to Hawaii our luggage wheels got broke and we had to purse new luggage on vacation then we never had this problem so we didn't know protocol and reported it after we got home only for them to tell is we only had 24hrs to report the damage. Not sure what was going on with Delta this vacation trip.Crew was excellent. Comfort seats not as nice as other kinds of planes.It was a great flight and the stewards and stewardess were all kind and accommodating!! The seats were comfortable and entertainment screen excellent!There are 4 flights in consecutive gates with about the same departure time. Two flights were boarding at the same time. One was delayed or boarding would be happening at the same time. I am not sure what Delta and LAX need to do to have a better layout at the end of Terminal 2There was a security issue at the airport and we were unable to land. We circled endlessly and then landed at another airfield for fuel. We then circled the airport again, almost landed but didn’t fully touch down before circling again. I am thankful to the crew for keeping us safe- the issue was the airline and staff at the airport getting us seats on our connecting flights. That part was hours of searching for someone and getting in double my steps.Most aspects were good however if they assign boarding zones they ought to enforce them or why bother? My luggage from SAN-JFK-MAD was lost in NY so I without my main bag for two days upon arrival in Spain. They were helpful in tracking it and eventually delivered it to my hotel. The flub was because of a delay upon arrival in NYC. I had booked 2 1/2 hours between flights but we had to hold on the taxiway for an hour after landing while waiting for a clear gate which likely caused the baggage error.Excellent flight, the planes were newer, they did a nice job with boarding, great service overall.It would be nice if was given wires ear buds. Overall was a good experience was able to sleep on the plane737-800 in first class was pretty dumpy. Seat had an uncomfortable angle, storage under the seat was blocked so even my very modest backpack didn't fit, power outlet was flaky. Weird tiny seat pockets that couldn't hold a gallon ziploc bag, emesis bag missing, etc. etc. No in-flight service due to turbulence. Crew was excellent, boarding was smooth despite a full flight.We had to deboard 2 times due to maintenance issues. They changed the plane, and then we got deviated to LAX due to maibtenance issues on the other plane, had to sleep at LAX and los a full day.From the first moment you interact with United Airlines, you can expect nothing less but extreme frustration. The baggage handler at the bag drop seems completely unbothered by the presence of customers waiting in line. No help was extended to load the baggage whatsoever. And if any of your bags is overweight by 0.01 pound they will make you re-distribute everything in your suitcase just to play power trip. When it was time to board no help was extended to customers to locate their seats. Moreover. It was a chaotic mess at the gate when it was unclear who should board first and everyone just bunched up, trying to get on the plane. I am sure the crew was doing their best to perform their jobs while being paid their wages however it shouldn’t be that hard to smile once or twice when you’re in the business if serving customers. It is a shame for the United States of America to have a flagship carrier of such low caliber. Our flight was also delayed by about an hour and a half due to further delays prior to our inbound flight. Being someone who has travelled for both business and leisure in Asia, Europe, and South America I have never experienced such poor quality of service.I understand stuff happens, but plane failures are likely due to lack of maintenance. Additionally, air conditioning wasn't working, no snack/drink service, no WiFi. Fortunately, the crew was communicative and light-hearted. United grabbed another plane and we were able to get to our destination.The pilots were late and it made us 1 hour late. The meat was tough and bok choy was also tough.Stuck on tarmac for two hours plus a 5.5 hour flight. Rude flight attendant. And no meals, not even for purchase!I learned that seating towards the end of plane that a line forms for the restroom and people use your chair as a hand railing, bumping your seat consistently. I was seated in the aisle. I think that next time if I am towards the back row I would want to sit in the middle or window seat.The best airline I have ever travel , really good customer service, attention and service !!United sent me a mileage plus number last year but that number is invalid so I can’t use it to check into flights or collect mileage. There is human to speak about the problem, only computers who keep asking me if I am using the correct email. It’s so frustrating and I cannot resolve it.Not a great experience. We paid for the upgrade for premium economy seats and seated ourselves in very comfortable seats. Someone came along with the same seat on their boarding pass. The aircraft had been changed and as a result we were booted out and sent further back to small uncomfortable seats. After complaining we were moved to emergency row seats, which gave us more leg room but the seats don’t recline. For people in our 70’s we found having to sit upright from California to NJ very uncomfortable. Not sure why they chose to move senior citizens instead of the two people that were allowed to take the more comfortable seats. Not happy.Everything was great. Only thing that could’ve made it better was buy on board options for hot food, but the snacks were decent. The flight attendants were great. I had no complaints. I was able to make it to my destination safelyThe overpriced dinner was pasta, bread and an awfully sweet dessert…. a feast of inexpensive carbs. She was the exception, but one flight attendant was incredibly rude. Cheap ticket though.Terminal experiences, including departure and deplaning were the weak points of our trip. Appreciated that premium passengers boarded and deplaned in group 1, but experience with buses did not feel premium. Terminals used at CDG and JFK had old, limited facilities and no good lounges. In flight experience was good and crew worked hard.It was very uncomfortable. I would never book any flights with Norse anymore .The flight attendants were extremely rude. I hate the culture of Norse air. Their is nothing really economical about it, the flights are slightly less expensive than average but it doesn’t justify no food, no blankets or pillows - my god you have to pay extra just to make your already over crowded no leg room flight just comfortable enough to be enjoyable. As if travel isn’t hard enough already. You have to pay extra to pick a seat so if you really are on a tight budget you’ll be left with the most uncomfortable, saddest flight of your life while the flight attendants treats you like the steerage on the HMS Titanic."I felt uncomfortable. It's well known that Norway is a racist country. As soon as they detected my accent, they were very rude."Norse is one of those airlines that sells the luggage and the good seats if you want them but otherwise the prices are great. It was very comfortable, the crew was great, and the food was actually good. I will take it again.Everything was good during the flight. But it's the only flight that I have experienced where food is not included not even drinks or even water unless you pay for it. For such a long trip to not offer even a glass of water I think it's very extreme!There should be an app so I can check in before I get to the airport and get a mobile ticket. There should also be wifi on the plane.When you book economy it says you can have a carry on bag, but when you check in all of a sudden the economy becomes 4 different types and you get charged extra, that’s not fare. Also there’s no option to check in online. Wouldn’t recommendNo online check in, so you and three hundred others are queuing at JFK at 5 check in counters. The employees are well organized and keep it moving, doing the best they can with an inefficient system. No blankets or pillows on the seven hour overnight flight and they kept the lights on for 2 hours for a flight that took off at 1am. Seemingly didn’t even have beverage service, and of course you have to pay for food (expected). The worst $1200 I’ve spent.Staff were nice, we left on time and arrived early, food was good. Unfortunately, they lost one of our bags and have been unable to find it. So we are in Italy for a week for my husband‘s birthday and he does not have any of his clothing.They gave us sandwiches as a meal twice. Snacks mid flight with cookies and a tuna panini. Then just the same tuna panini for dinner. That was it.Top notch re cleanliness, comfort, operational. Attendants attentive, cheerful, courteous and professional. An unusually high-grade experience all around.The staff was very good, the only thing was the air conditioning wasn't working during the boarding process so it was very hot inside the plane until we got airborne. The food wasn't great, the chicken was dry and hard to cut, the ravioli was ok and the little pizza pocket thing was pretty bad. Other than that is was a good flight all aroundBetter consideration for families traveling with a disabled person. They insisted each person hold their own boarding pass on their own devices and gave us a hard time accepting eight boarding passes on a single device.Two of my four flights had issues with toilets either NOT fully operational or completely out of order. Boarding was a joke because they have NOT established who is running the show. In the end, she did a terrible job. The seats 💺 were loose goose and the drinks and snacks were limiting in choices. Also, following Alitalia as an inspiration was strange since they went out of business.We had a 3 hour delay and then a long taxi to take off. It would have been helpful for the pilot to have communicated more about what was going on. There was no A/C during the wait, and the cabin must have been more than 85 to 90 degrees. The crew gave water to the people in the front but by the time they go to the back of the plane they stopped giving out water. Eventually I went back and asked for some in the rear of the plane (for a second time). The food was close to inedible. I thought on an Italian flight that the pasta would be better than the chick, but honestly, a Swanson's TV dinner would have been better. I had a bite or two to keep my blood sugar up, but basically I couldn't eat it.Boarding was chaotic. Service was poor. Attendant was slow and rude. In business class, I was not offered a drink until 1.5 hrs,after takeoff. Food was inedible.Terrible. They canceled 2 flights and then sent everyone by BUS from Rome. They should make amends by offering some sort of compensation.We ordered a gluten free meal and never got it!Great crew and food and beverage. Seating tight but not the airline's fault. Will definitely fly BA in future!Crying baby the ENTIRE flight. Not your fault, but I paid 2700 for a premium economy ticket and it wasn't worth it. should have just stuck with coach. flight attendants very mediocre - minimal effort. Plane didn't seem very clean. Didn't have any cleansing wipes - most airlines give you this when you board. Flat screen scrolling didn't work. Toiletry case a joke - why bother at all?Enjoyable flight, helpful crew everything was organized to accommodate passengers.The airline was efficient and accommodating to work with though there was a delay. Appreciate the service and smooth experience!I was transferred to an American Airlines flight. The boarding was late and unorganized. The seating was extremely tight and uncomfortable. Will not use AA again.The check-in of my luggage was terrible. When purchased my tickets, one luggage and one carry-on was part of the fight. My flight was switched from British to American Airline. During check-in of luggage at the airport, I was denied and had to pay extra $75. How do I get reimbursed for this extra luggage payment?This was the second time on BA, food terrible, bathrooms gross,( granted, that was mostly due to the disgusting children urinating all over it)boarding was late and disorganized. No gate issued until last minute st Heathrow, bad system, caused undue stress. Seats were painful, that's what you get for traveling like a poor in economy, right BA? Should have been able to afford business or first class if you want to actually be able to walk upright without back pain after a trip.charging port did not work, no entertainment system. Other than that the flight was good and safe.The delay was not communicated via text and the person who helped with check in also didn’t inform me about the delay. I ended up missing my connection and it was a waste of 5 hours. The crew didn’t mention there would be someone at the gate informing of if I would be rebooked and there was no signage. Overall a very poor experience. The British Airways app was also very buggy, and didn’t work. I will avoid flying with British Airways when possible.Cancelled flight minutes before boarding.
