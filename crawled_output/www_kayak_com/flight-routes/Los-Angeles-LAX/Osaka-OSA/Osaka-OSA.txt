Only the fish entree in the Japanese meal was overcooked and quite dry but everything else was greatGreat first time experience on this airline. Very professional staff and great service.Warm the bread. Movies: better choices to include Chinese movies options or some of the older winners of flim festivalI was able to change my flight last minute. It was more expensive, but that was my fault. Thank you for allowing me to fly!Business class on ANA was awesome. There lie flat seats made it easier to sleep on a 12 hour flight. Food was great and service was excellent.The crew was very nice and polite. They made sure everybody got their meal and drinks. Even the economy class had a very adequate leg room for someone that is over 6 foot tall.Overall it was good. Making changes to the reservation on ANA’s website was little challenging. Would like to see those features improved in the future.The flight crew was outstanding. Very cheerful and always respectful. I wish the same could be said about United. The AC wasn't the best on the plane.The seats are uncomfortable. The flight attendants are not pleasant. They do their job, but not with a ray of sunshine and warmth. The food was awful, not what I would expect from an Asian airline. All of the other Asian airlines I have flown have far better food. The food was on par with United airlines food, which is really bad. Maybe ANA should get out of the alliance with United.During booking, I selected the seats so that my wife and I would sit next to each other. However, the airline changed our seats at boarding so that we were seated apart. Very disappointing.highly recommend for trip to japan only reason why i gave good not excellent is because their selection of movies and tv shows in English is more limited .I avoid American Airlines for a reason. Our flight was delayed at LAX. The situation at the gate was chaotic. The woman making announcements wasn't being clear or transparent regarding why there were delays. There was a lot of confusion regarding flight and gate status. Other passengers were pretty rude. I was elbowed in the eye by someone who was in a hurry to get their bags from the overhead bin immediately after the flight landed. Ultimately, I will avoid AA as much as possible in the future.We asked for Hindu vegetarian meal in advance and the quality of the food was horrendous. Never flying JAL again!Japan airline is excellent service .I recommend to Kayak and Japan airline to Frend.Overall a great experience. One complain was the vegetarian food that my wife had which was mostly boiled vegetables with not much flavor.Very accommodating and kind airline crews. The plane is also big which makes the passengers more comfortable and relaxI actually didn’t make it onto the flight. I spent quite a few hours trying to rebook the flight just to get screwed out of $5000. Fun!We booked business class round trip from Delhi to San Diego and back. On our last leg from Bangalore to Delhi we were down graded to economy class which was big disappointment other than that everything was great.Had an incident with a stewardess who insisted that I take a seat. I informed her that I came to use the restroom and to have some water. After using the restroom, I wanted to stretch my legs out a little cuz my knees were aching from sitting. I understood her concern for my concern and the potential turbulence (she said she knows this route and the turbulence and safety is not to be taken lightly) but I felt that her mood, tone, demeanor, and a lack of compassion for the pain in my knees were not the proper way to address a customer or anyone for that matter. This left a bitter taste in my mouth. It was her lack of professionalism that surprised me.we have requested for hindu veg. meal during booking. but served meal was of very poor qualty and taste. they can get such meal from 5 star Indian restaurant at Vancouver/ tokyo/ Bangalore.pure hindu veg meal and no AVMLBetter screens, it would have been nice to have more comfortable seats.It was great, but my bag was not loaded onto the connecting flight. I'm currently getting it resolved. If this isn't a problem, everything else was excellent.Very clean ,flight attendants very professional,nice , Boarding was very easyThe plane hasnt left im stuck in seatle still my flight has been grounded for almost 5 hoursMy luggage didn’t arrive with my flight. Flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours while we sat on the plane and I almost missed my connecting flight and subsequently missed the last train from the airport so it took me another 2 hours to get to my destination after arriving, Crew skipped me several times when offering beverages, and I couldn’t get their attention at times because they wouldn’t even make eye contact with me. They didn’t give me a form for disembarking so I had to go to the back of the line after waiting an eternity for immigration. Paid for on flight wi- fi that didn’t work for most of the flight.Love flying Asiana. Been using it for over a decade now.The beefsteak on the lunch menu was excellent! I usually do not eat airplane food. I loved it.Flight was too cold. I wore a regular cotton tee and it wasn’t enough. It was a night time flight so I would have thought a blanket would be provided to passengers. A 4 hour flight and no options for a meal? I flew Asiana the next day from Seoul to Manilla. Same duration, 4 hours. They give everyone a pillow and blanket and serve a meal. Why is United so cheap and holding back meals and amenities? Also, they promote too much gay stuff and DEI in their advertisements. Please be mindful of other beliefs and don’t shove your gay ideology down my throat.Staff always with a smile and very helpful with my mom who has mobility issues.It was amazing. I was not expecting the phenomenal customer service Asiana provides.The entertainment package was vast and the selections were very current. Keep updating it was great.The seat was so hard my tailbone was aching The crew was kind of a b**** because I made a joke that I didn't care if they close the door I total c*** when she was trying to f****** act like she was mad at me because I said that The flight was bumpy. Sure you didnt have control over that.4 hours late, including over +1 hour waiting in plane to take off. Baggage left behind too.While waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.Was not able to watch most shows on the entertainment site. They would not loadOur flight was 1.5 hours delayed. There was no weather for the inbound flight, so I don't understand why. This meant a VERY late arrival and only a quick nap before my morning flight.Delayed flight, so I switched fights to SFO to Phoenix , Phoenix to DSM. Excellent service through American AirlinesAA re-routed flight from HNL to LAX due to delay. My group of 3 with reserved seats in row 9 was broken up, with one assigned to a middle seat, another in the last row of the plane. Not happy. No explanation to the delay. No apologies. No compensation. Would have been nice to be offered an Admiral Club admission or a voucher for the extra 3 hours of layover in LAX. Could not hear the boarding gate announcements in LAX. Adjacent gate was boarding at the same time. Loud speakers were competing against each other. Barely made my boarding group.Almost a 6 hour flight and the only food option is a cheese plate… and chips. Also how is it there are no options for texting on American. I’ll be going back to delta and united.Bad food, small seats that didn’t recline. I thought I was buying a quantas ticket so I feel like I got scammedReal smooth and easy, Real good leg room in coach!Re luggage I carried a backpack only. I did not check any bags in. However there were other passengers with carry on luggage going in the plane. My question is why are others allowed to have a carry on luggage inside the plane? Shouldn’t they have dropped it off at the gate? I’m asking because I could have brought the same thing instead of a backpack only. Please clarify for future reference. Thank you.Like the service. Very hard to communicate or contact when have problemsThey rescheduled me and I had no issues with the new flightNo paper towels in bathroom. Aisle seat difficult to get out of Other than those, excellent serviceBoth flights are delayed so I rate the whole experience as mediocre.Bad experience boarding and flight got delayed didn’t make it to my next flightThe food on the trip Toronto to Athens could be better: the chicken didn’t taste good.Before final boarding, my husband and I — both seniors — were told that we could not bring our carry-on bags with us due to being in Zone 6. The staff took our bags with little explanation, stating it was policy. While we understand boarding procedures may vary by zone, the way we were spoken to was unnecessarily rude and dismissive. We felt disrespected and singled out, and the interaction left us deeply uncomfortable. As seniors, we expect to be treated with courtesy and dignity, especially during travel when accommodations and communication matter most. We hope you will look into this matter and ensure better training for staff in handling such situations with more empathy and professionalism.Easy boarding and comfortable seating were plusses. Enjoyed the experience and good service from the captain and crew.
