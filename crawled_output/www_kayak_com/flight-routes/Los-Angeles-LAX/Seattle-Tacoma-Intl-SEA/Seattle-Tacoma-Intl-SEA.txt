There was a delay in departure, which is why I did not rate it as excellent.delayed flight 3 hours, then took 45 min to get to gate and another 10 min to open doorThe plane was put out of service and had to wait for a new plane to be assigned. No one had any information and the information on the screens was never updated. The call wait time was 2 hours and the estimated time for text assistance was 55 minutes which was a lie because after 55 minutes nothing happened. I understand that delays happen but to not have anyone available to provide any update or reassurance was just negligent. Also, what is the point of having an 800 number if no one answers it and don’t get me started on the text message system. Ridiculous!Very expensive for short flights. Can’t communicate with Alaska Air about passport issue at check-in. Also no replies to my text messages. Wanted to extend our vacation for two more days but this expensive flight ticket is called SAVER and I couldn’t make changes or cancel or get a credit even, so I paid another airline for the return trip. Extremely disappointed.The flight was canceled at the last minute and we got very upset as we had plans in which our schedule that affects a family reunion was in jeopardy.Paying for first class and then they want $8:00 for wifi.fine. only problem,,,, for some,,,,was that many people started trying to exit from the back of the plane,, . lots of irate people. there should be a flight attendant mid plane..to be sure that doesn't happen. The crew up front had no idea what was happening. One big guy started it..then a bunch of others followed his lead. could have gotten ugly... One man stepped in and questioned those rule breakers.. nothing bad happened,,,but......Eddie, our flight attendant in the back was excellent. He was very kind and concerned for our happiness and comfort before and during our flight. He made the experience great. We had to deplane due to a ground delay and he made sure we had snacks and water to keep us comfortable while we waited. Overall, it was a great experience!Flight was delayed which caused us to have to change our connecting flight. Grilled cheese sandwich was served very hot.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Check in process was terrible. Lady at counter didn’t know what she was doingDelayed and took off even later than the scheduled delay timeMy husband upgraded our seats and I don't know if it was due to the type of planet was or if they didn't upgrade our seats. We were supposed to be in I believe comfort seats and they were just as tight as any other seat- no leg room and we are very tall people but at least it wasn't extremely cold. My husband did put in a complaint about our seating because he paid extra and if we would have known that the space and the tightness would have been the same, we just would have gotten the emergency row emergency row seats that we normally get. We love Delta but both our flights coming home we're not good. Oh I forgot to mention that on our flight to Hawaii our luggage wheels got broke and we had to purse new luggage on vacation then we never had this problem so we didn't know protocol and reported it after we got home only for them to tell is we only had 24hrs to report the damage. Not sure what was going on with Delta this vacation trip.There are 4 flights in consecutive gates with about the same departure time. Two flights were boarding at the same time. One was delayed or boarding would be happening at the same time. I am not sure what Delta and LAX need to do to have a better layout at the end of Terminal 2There was a security issue at the airport and we were unable to land. We circled endlessly and then landed at another airfield for fuel. We then circled the airport again, almost landed but didn’t fully touch down before circling again. I am thankful to the crew for keeping us safe- the issue was the airline and staff at the airport getting us seats on our connecting flights. That part was hours of searching for someone and getting in double my steps.Boarding was organised and relaxed. Crew were fantastic! Seats were lacking padding causing butt pain and stiffness.It would be nice if was given wires ear buds. Overall was a good experience was able to sleep on the planeFood from the flight from Atlanta to Santiago was very poor..Delta flight was on time, seats were comfortable, and crew was nice.I understand stuff happens, but plane failures are likely due to lack of maintenance. Additionally, air conditioning wasn't working, no snack/drink service, no WiFi. Fortunately, the crew was communicative and light-hearted. United grabbed another plane and we were able to get to our destination.Stuck on tarmac for two hours plus a 5.5 hour flight. Rude flight attendant. And no meals, not even for purchase!I learned that seating towards the end of plane that a line forms for the restroom and people use your chair as a hand railing, bumping your seat consistently. I was seated in the aisle. I think that next time if I am towards the back row I would want to sit in the middle or window seat.United sent me a mileage plus number last year but that number is invalid so I can’t use it to check into flights or collect mileage. There is human to speak about the problem, only computers who keep asking me if I am using the correct email. It’s so frustrating and I cannot resolve it.Not a great experience. We paid for the upgrade for premium economy seats and seated ourselves in very comfortable seats. Someone came along with the same seat on their boarding pass. The aircraft had been changed and as a result we were booted out and sent further back to small uncomfortable seats. After complaining we were moved to emergency row seats, which gave us more leg room but the seats don’t recline. For people in our 70’s we found having to sit upright from California to NJ very uncomfortable. Not sure why they chose to move senior citizens instead of the two people that were allowed to take the more comfortable seats. Not happy.Everything was great. Only thing that could’ve made it better was buy on board options for hot food, but the snacks were decent. The flight attendants were great. I had no complaints. I was able to make it to my destination safelyBoarded plane and then delayed 1.5 hours while on the planeit was so bad. I tried to board my flight from vancouver to saskatoon. And to my surprise they did not board me cause the flight was changed and no email was send to me. and on my boarding pass which i got from seattle says different flight. I did not knew anyone from Vancouver, air canada crew was rude, i asked for today flight but they were rude and i had early morning dental appointment in saskatoon. I was so much in pain and my whole day is wasted today. and i suffered alot. They did provide me hotel but they did not provide me any food. I am really really disappointed first time had so bad experience with air canada. I may think twice to book it again. If i can get any reply or any composition that would be great. ThanksThe food was the worst I’ve had on any flight I’ve ever been on.leg space better than expected. two washrooms for one plane isn't enough.No frills - because you get what you pay for. The crew was amazing!! I had plenty of room to spread out because the flight was half full. Which made it easy to sleep.Dear All, I have harassment and accident with the flight attendant . This is my phone to talk 8168073567, please, leave phone message . Regards Emily,Flight was on time but the amount of noise from several children and the kicking of my seat the entire flight was overwhelming.Had a issue with catching flight due to airline, was unable to board flightFirst off, i received an e-mail to allow me to check in for our flight. I folllowed the link, when it came to the seat selection, I was unable to select any "free" seats ( meaning without any additional charge) because everything was " unavailable". My Husband and I were ttavelling with our 3 children hence, i wanted to be assured that we were all seated next to each other. I tried 3 times and everytime I click the selection it said " error loading". What the system wants is for me to buy the seats ( anywhere from $25 to $50 dollars each passenger) like I did on our flight bound to L.A. I called customer service and the guy was unhelpful all he kept repeating was to come really early at the airport and we will be assigned seats there. Imagine my anxiety!!! Spirit says they are a budget airline but they are actually the opposite!! And just before our flight, the flight attendant KEPT announcing/ selling the seats that were not purchased for a cheaper price!! Like it was a bidding/ bargaining game! This was our first and last time to fly Spirit.Too many time late and postponed No electrical power for my electric devicesSpirit is by far the worst airline to travel with, period. Seats are cardboard, flight attendants need anger management and if you ask for water, you’re basically a criminal. I don’t care how much it costs but I will travel with an airline who actually cares about their customers. Oh and one more thing, the next time your gate agent puts his foot on someone’s baggage's scale, I hope they get what’s coming next, a viral video of your scams. You suck Spirit, do better.I mean, it’s Spirit. But it was frustrating to have our flight canceled, get bumped to a later flight, and then Spirit was unwilling to check our bag until 4 hours before our flight… tell us we could not sit in the waiting area’s chairs… and really negative experience getting checked in and dropping the bag.terrible service, no room for a dog underfoot, a broken chair that is impossible to sit on and all this costs a lot of moneyIt was fast but uncomfortable seats. Had to pay a bit extra not sure why? Maybe in selection of all my 4 tix together ? Just knew I had a balance before getting boarding pass online when departing from satx ? And flight was delayed..I’m not gonna fly Frontier Airlines because booking is not an option. No water or food is for high price, not equipped for health emergency incompetent crew for emergency services. Cheap airline shows it is cheaper in all service categories. Boarding is the best of all airlines!Cancelled flight after I arrived at airport after 75 min drive and parking. Next flight was 4 days in the future. Had to scramble and buy a much more expensive flight on another carrier.I never got to experience the flight because they delayed my first flight and I missed this one. Then Frontier didn't want to help me rebook a flight to get me to my final destination.I liked the turn-style feature at gate 209B at LAX. Very efficient process. The gate staff also made several, clearly directed announcements so I felt very informed.The seats were awful, hard plastic covered in sheet vinyl. The airline tries to scam you into paying extra to get seat together when the flight wasn’t full. They were going to separate a family with young children but my wife who had a row to herself gave up her seat so the young mom could be with her young boys. I’m never giving this airline my money again.It was a short flight so no food or entertainment….Frontier had yet another flight cancellation. Have never made a complete round trip with this airline without at least one leg getting cancelled. Miserable flights - dirty, uncomfortable planes that apparently always have issues since I've had multiple delays and cancellations with them.Flight was delayed 3 times, would have been nice to have received text message instead of email notifications. Frontier app wasn’t even updated accordingly, no gate number disclosed. No agent at front desk of gate to inform of delay. Very confused and left if the darkThey changed the timing , first delayed by 4 hours then went back to 40 mins late, we had to run back to airport to not miss our flight. This is ridiculousNo frills for sure. No gate announcements about flight delay, not even water to drink on the flight.Alaska Airlines8.0Delta7.9United Airlines7.4Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Los Angeles to SeattleAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Los Angeles to SeattleFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Los Angeles to Seattle according to KAYAK users.
