Our tickets indicated "BC" for Business Class, but we and many others were confused as that was not indicated anywhere in the airport, so we didn't know when we're supposed to board. The airplane: The airplane was nice. However, we sat near the back of the business class cabin and the flight attendants and passengers from other cabins would constantly move the curtain (which was very loud), preventing me from fallling asleep on my 8 hour flight. The flight crew: Amazing, generally. However, they nearly forgot to serve breakfast to me. The flight food: I was able to select my meal for dinner, which was really good. Breakfast was a bit of a mess, however. The crew forgot to serve me breakfast until the last minute. Very little was available by the time they remembered. The entertainment: Paltry, underwhelming, and dated. Not one new movie was available. Bottom line: For the money, you might want to consider other options for your international business class flights.We arrived 4 hours early and still almost missed the flight because they weren’t able to access one of the boarding tickets. They then sent hour bags late and we were all of our without clothing and eventually had to take an expensive cab back and forth to the airport as they wouldn’t deliver the bag which arrived late at night that day and we would have to wait until noon the began day (messing up a second day of plans). Also, all the food has dairy or pork. No vegan or even vegetarian option in the flight—even for purchase.Food was ok, but not as good as I have had before on AA.Pretty good. The food was just mediocre, the boarding and crew were good.The plane was broken so we had to change planes.The flight delay in Dallas created a domino effect that impacted all of the connecting flights. It also increased the number of connections. I missed my flight from Casablanca to Marrakech because of the tight turnaround when landing in Casablanca. . CMN airport was understaffed. Only one person could help while other employees were just watching him. It was an extremely frustrating situation. People were crying and slamming their palms on the counter when speaking to the customer service provider, Allabough (man’s name?). Allabough couldn’t change my flight in the system. simultaneously, I was on the call with America. Airlines customer service rep named Solomon that said he couldn’t change it either. So, I took a ONYA voyages train to from Casablanca to Marrakech to get there on Friday June 26. This was unpredictable trip.Food was terrible, all served at once, poor quality . Wine and bread offered only once.It was one of my worst flight ever. First they were changing the gate for at least 4 times, changing from gate D7 to D12 to D44. Considering the size of the Miami Airport, we are talking about long distance and the train at the airport was not working. Then the flight was delayed around one hour. Then finally we boarded into the plane and when everybody was seated, there was an announcement that there is an issue with one of the tire of the plane, so we all had to get out of the plane with our belongings, to replace the tire. So we had around 2.5-hour delayNo entertainment yatem in flight at seat 51H. Would not shut down either leaving a self moving and openin and changing menus with changes in colors,images brightness levels sort of the type when you get sleep deprivation and image overload when being tortured during an interrogation. 8 hours worth of it. Unable to place backpack underneath seat on that chair. One female stewardess was excellent as she gave up her carryon's space for my backpack but the rest of the iberia crew were very sharp an chtting during the whole flight. The plane did not have hot water so nobody had coffee nor tea. The plane was not up to par to be flying.An old airplane with very uncomfortable seats in the Comfort “class! Small, narrow, and hard seat. Entertainment options are inferior, old movies. Boarding started at the back of the airplane, as we entered the aircraft last instead of after business class, risking the possibility that the comfort section would not have room for carry-on in the overhead bin. The food was ok. White wine was terrible. Overall, the flight felt worse than cheap airliners, and the price was as high as premium carriers.I had a business class ticket from EWR to Madrid with a layover at LIS for 11 hours. It was obvious that I needed to pick up my luggage in Lisbon for 11 hours and check it in again when boarding the second flight to Madrid. Before buying the ticket, I called TAP customer service. Customer service assured me that I could get my luggage in Lisbon. When I arrived at Newark airport, I immediately asked to check my luggage to Lisbon. However, the TAP employee refused me, saying that I should resolve this issue upon arrival in Lisbon. She checked my luggage to Madrid. I asked the TAP employee at the gate to help me when boarding the plane, I asked the flight attendants manager on board the plane to help me. All the employees refused to help me and said that I should resolve this issue in Lisbon. It took me 4 hours to resolve this issue in Lisbon. I arrived at 11am and they didn't give me my luggage until 3pm. As a result, I was so tired after a sleepless night on the plane and 4 hours on my feet at the airport and all my plans were ruined that I couldn't fly to Madrid. It was a terrible experiance,The seats were not designed to comfortably see people in coach for more than 10 minutesVery rude person at the boarding desk; flight attendant coughing 3 inches from my face three times- not even covering her mouth; boarding process very unacceptable for older people with stairs to all planes (are you all stuck in the 1960’s?). I am sure that I am not remembering all of the negative things, but I am sure you get the message!Boarding experience was awful. TAP claims I did not have check in luggage with tickets. I went 3-4 check in agents until I finally found a helpful kind agent who checked in my luggage with no fees. On top of that our flight was over 2 hours delayed with barely an apology or explanation.We flew TAP last October from Newark to Lisbon. The meal was bad. This flight had good food. Also, this flight was delayed. There were TAP employees waiting at Lisbon to make sure we made our connecting flight. I find the TAP website and app frustrating, but the service once we reached the airport was very goodBoarding too way too long. Biggest peeve: zero in-seat power in economy! No plug sockets, no USB ports. Plane was an A330, so not old.Flight being delayed for 35 minutes had me lose the connection to my transportboarding is so disorganized, i was literally appalled at the boarding experienceWas the best airplane ✈️ ever that I never see I will traveling again again with u guys.Great staff, just very far from the main terminal, had to run to connect my flight. I had 90 minutes to spare. But my flight from Chicago was delayed also.My luggage is lost and nowhere to be found, no response from airlineBoarding was a shitshow. Had to bus to the gate. No separate bus and boarding process for Business Class.The plane was very old, no power outlets. We also had to wait a long time to board. They kept moving us to different lines before we actually could step foot on the plane. We ended up being delayed an hour but we were never told or informed for any reason. After the meal I asked for a coffee which the flight attendant forgot and I had to ask again. Overall not the worst but not the best experience.Need to pay for headsets, water, or any extra except air to breath.Sitting space was very tight and I am not big or fat (I am 5'10" 178 Lb), so eating was very challenging. The rest was good.Sitting space was very tight, so eating was difficult. But everything else was good.12 hours flight. Only one meal, not enough food. At the galley only water during the flight. Lavatories not clean. Headsets at extra cost.Need to pay for a cup of water. No food. Need to pay for headsets.Everything should improve! Service like a low cost but prices like a premium airline. Crew in general with bad manners arguing for everything. You pay for priority access but then they use buses, so your loose your advantage to put your carry on first. That was the purpose for paying for priority. Bording is a nightmare, people accessing the plane for bothering doors, front and rear, no matter which line do you have.Transportation from gate to airplane was poor we stayed in hot bus for 20 minute no vantilationThe crew were friendly and helpful. Iberia lost our luggage on arrival, Friday and we didn't get it until Sunday at 10:00 p.m. local Malaga time. I also paid $382.80 for seat assignments but two out out of the four were not together. Iberia mentioned that it was because the plane was delayed in Madrid before our flight began in LAX. They should compensate us half of my payment.We liked the flight but while we purchased an aisle seat, our seats had a different configuration on this flight. A fellow passenger suggested that the airplane had been changed. Too bad we were not informed and had no chance to modify our seat preferences. We were stuck in the window and middle seats with no chance to walk around and go to the bathroom without disturbing our sleeping fellow passenger.Boarding an international flight via several sets of stairs and shuttle busses to the tarmac even when multiple jet-bridges were empty at Madrid airport (the hub for Iberia) was not pleasant. I was fine, but a lot of elderly folks and families with kids were struggling. A bad way to start a flight. Business class seats were nice, although not cleaned well from the prior flight.The flight was great; I don't see any area of improvement.The crew were not very personable. The crew did not serve tea or coffee. The bathroom was not kept clean. Two out of the 5 toilets in the cabin weren't working.Delayed first flight Geneva Madrid.. We didn’t miss our 2nd flight only because the 2nd flight Madrid Dallas was 1h delayed. However we did end up missing the 3rd leg Dallas Austin. Luggage didn’t show up in Dallas. So we re missing 2 suit cases. Customer service sent us to a hotel in Dallas. Only one room booked for 5!! Pretty bad experience overall. I won’t book a flight on Iberia in the futureCrew was excellent, great customer service, checked luggage took 1 hour and a half to come out at the baggage claim, the only negative thing about the flight.Horrible experience airline crew was unprofessional. Flight was delayed. Suit cases did not arrive. Never flying iberia againIberia lost my bag, said they found it in another country, said they sent it to me, but never did. Went my whole trip without my stuff, but expecting it to show up because that’s what they said would happen. Their communication sucks, their website sucks, and to top it all off, their seats are small and uncomfortable. They’re bad at their jobs and they should feel bad about themselves. Do not even get me started on the flight home. AVOID!Need to offer Better food from LAX to London Service from London to Delhi very delayed after take off.Connection at Hethrow was horrible..We couldn't get out of the plane for an hour as they were buying people to the airport and there were not enough busses. We had 2 and half hf between flights so it was very tight. After departing plane we had to go thru security again. People with less time in between connections missed their flightsPoor all around experience. Sat at gate in Grand Rapids to Chicago for 2.5 hours. No food or water offered and no allowances to use restroom. Missed connecting flight to London and not offered any compensation including food or lodging. Not happy with AA, claims delay was weather related but no weather issues seen on radar. Take ownership for real reason behind delay which was actually the IT outage. Very disappointing and will not be recommending AA for domestic or international flights if this is the way that customers are treated.Horrible… I was downgraded without notice, had to sit in economy and given my back injury was in pain most of the journey. I expect to be reimbursed for this inconvenience and after my return flight home, I never plan to fly with British Airways again.Great crew and food and beverage. Seating tight but not the airline's fault. Will definitely fly BA in future!It was a good experience, especially travelling with a baby and their accessoriesThree major things that led to my low rating, 1. Internet wasn't available for the whole time, and 2. TV became available way into flight, after numerous system reboots, and 3. Food is not good at all.Love the A380 - loads of room. Headphone socket on my seat didn’t work. Sounds like a trivial issue? Well when flying long-haul the in-flight entertainment is what keeps you going so when it doesn’t work it’s a disaster. Pay attention to the details please BA. Spoiled what was otherwise an excellent flight with the usual brilliant crew.The overall seat and cushion needs to be updated. It was hard and no support. My butt was numb for most of the flight. The food was subpar at best being in premium economy cost. The flight attendants were excellent and attentive during the whole flight. Disappointed I had to select our seats 24 hours prior.Was delayed on first leg and missed connection. They would not let me board although I arrived at the gate 5 min before take off. I was delayed 24hrsAmerican Airlines7.2TAP AIR PORTUGAL7.1Air Europa7.0Iberia7.0British Airways6.7Everything you need to know for your flight from Miami to MadridAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Miami to MadridFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Miami to Madrid according to KAYAK users.
