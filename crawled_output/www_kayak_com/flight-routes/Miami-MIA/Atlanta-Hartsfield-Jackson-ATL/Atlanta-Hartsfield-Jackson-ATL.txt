I was disappointed by the front section female, African American flight attendant. I did not see her name tag or would have identified by name not race. As passengers moved to the bathroom early in flight, she would say with a disdainful tone “I have to say the seat belt light is on” then go back to her book. Better trained flight attendants say something like be careful the seat belt light is on.Staff was far less than helpful at all times. Departure and arrival times mean nothing to Southwest. Extremely disappointed, will never fly with them again, and I’ll be sure to share my experience with all.The price of the tickets isn't matching the flight experience. No matter how long the flight is, you're only getting pretzels. The flight attendants looked unkept and over it.WiFi on the flight was not working. Thus, entertainment options were limited.Flight was awfully bumpy and landing was a bit jolting. I was in the restroom when snacks and drinks were served and was not asked if i wanted any. I had to ask for water finally.Crew was great flight was great baggage claim was a failure. It took over 1 hour for bags to arrive. Poor communication poor effort when I spoke to the supervisor about the delayReally low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Three seats in first class were broken and while they were able to still acommodate us it was looking very touch and go and they had others they could not acommodateThey made us board and then deboard due to mechanical issue which delayed the departure by almost 2 hours and we barely made our connecting flight. These quality checks should've been done before boarding not after.I liked the friendliness of the staff. The cleanliness of all 3 planes.Flight was delayed, 30+ bags had to be gate checked. Crew were very friendly!Everything was good until we were boarding our connection flight in Atlanta, we were told to gate check our carry-on, but when we got inside the plane, there was plenty of room in the overhead.Very late arrival at PWM. Late jet getting to ATL. Equipment problem with aircraft - could not get enough water onto plane., Another delay getting FAA approval for flight with bottled H2O. Not the crew’s problem.After all the weather issues at least they got me to my destination the next dayFrom Atlanta to Savannah - flight connection was way to short (we weren't even late landing ) and flight was already boarding when we landed - we were told we were the last on board and so we had to gate check our bags. Once we got on the plane, there were at least seven open bag spots so that was unnecessary delay. There should be better communication between the gate agent and the crew.Crew was excellent. Comfort seats not as nice as other kinds of planes.We will be writing a long, detailed letter to corporate about our awful experience with American airlines.Food was ok, but not as good as I have had before on AA.Pretty good. The food was just mediocre, the boarding and crew were good.It was one of my worst flight ever. First they were changing the gate for at least 4 times, changing from gate D7 to D12 to D44. Considering the size of the Miami Airport, we are talking about long distance and the train at the airport was not working. Then the flight was delayed around one hour. Then finally we boarded into the plane and when everybody was seated, there was an announcement that there is an issue with one of the tire of the plane, so we all had to get out of the plane with our belongings, to replace the tire. So we had around 2.5-hour delayThe delays and cancellations kept me stuck in Miami for an additional 24 hours, and the whole thing seemed extremely disorganizedFlight was late and missed connecting flight. They could have better accommodated, but instead did an overnight and had to arrive the next afternoon.The flight was delayed leaving Miami. When we arrived in Charlotte, we were unable to park at our scheduled gate. We had to wait another 30-45 minutes before we could park at a different gate. All in all, we were delayed by almost two hours arriving in Charlotte.the pilot that landed this flight in Philadelphia did an amazing job, the weather was absolutely terrible and we landed safely.I never have a good experience with American and this was no different. The airplane was INCREDIBLY hot. Like unbearably so. Everyone was fanning themselves with pamphlets and sweating. When someone asked the flight attendant to turn down the temperature they were told there was nothing the crew could do. Once we pushed back from the gate we then had to wait an hour to take off and the communication from the crew was not good. People were getting up this whole time and a man was even in the bathroom when we took off. Once we landed at our destination we waited another 30 minutes at the gate to deplane with, again, no communication from the crew as to what was going on.I had a horrible experience from the time I dropped off my bags until the time I landed. The staff taking the bags at the check-in counter prior to security, forced me to check my baby stroller, even though it weighed less than 20 pounds. their excuse was that the wheels were too big. I have never had an issue gate checking this exact same stroller in the past either on American or on any other airline. when I asked for the agent to show me the rule about the size of the wheels on strollers, they told me to look it up on the AA website. I did so, and did not find any indication that wheel size was a problem for gate checking strollers. The only limitation would be the weight of the stroller which mine was below. I was left with a one-year-old child and all of my carry-on luggage, diaper bag, and the like to walk around the airport without the assistance of a stroller and had the same issue when I exited the plane and had to go all the way to baggage claim without a stroller. In addition, while on the airplane, I was told I can only get one bag of cookies as a snack, even though I was with a child. Apparently my child and I were supposed to share a cookie. While this latter issue is a minor one, it is just another example of the absolutely horrible customer service that American Airlines provides. In addition, the 737 aircraft that I was on was extremely hot and the air vents above the seat were so far away from the aisle and middle seats that it was comical. I could barely reach the air vent to adjust it. I had to ask the person in the window seat to do it for me. The whole experience was just a nightmare.We spent 5 1/2 hours at Ohare cause our flight was diverted cause of rain in the area. We missed appts that we had set on Tuesday and cause we were flying back the next day on the 7am flight we had no time to reschedule anything. Other airlines were landing and taking off fine having no issues. It was only Spirit. Very frustrating flight and I understand why the flights are only around 25-30% full.The flight was delayed twice with minimal explanation. The terminal and airplane were filthy. The food voucher didn’t even cover a tiny pizza from a kiosk in the terminal. All in all, a pretty miserable experience for a flight to attend a funeralWe sat on the tarmac for an hour waiting for a gate to deplane.I've flown Spirit many times. However, they seem to be getting worse. I don't understand how the contracts with the gates at the airport works, but Spirit never seems to have a gate ready when we land. This happened again on this flight. And once again, baggage took forever to arrive at the baggage claim belt. This time it was about 45 minutes to an hour, late at night, when the airport was not crowded. On a previous trip, they lost the luggage cart and we were all waiting for about 3 hours for our luggage. Plus, I did get a deal through Kayak on a flight that was shown sold out on Spirit's site. However, by the time I added all the luggage, and didn't even pick seats, I could have taken any direct flight I wanted through Delta. I'm about done with Spirit.I enjoyed my flight, it was pretty smooth and we landed earlier than eta.The flight was delayed four and half hours for paperwork on a maintenance issue. Very frustrating.I made it safely. The flight was delayed, though. Not upset or expect anything.Great experience overall. Early boarding, no delays. Drinks and snacks are not included in price and very expensive. Seats are not very comfortable. Not as much space or padding as other airlines. Good for a quick cheap flight.Crew from Columbus to Atlanta excellent. Flight overall was good. Flight crew from Atlanta to Newark were average probably because they had to deal with overbooked flight and obnoxious people on the flight. Ground crew in terminal needed to do a better job limiting luggage boarding the plane.The ease of booking the flight was very good. Speaking with customer service was also good. However, the crew people are unfriendly and unwelcoming which I found this as unprofessional. As far as comfort it was mediocre. This was my first time flying Spirit and I chose them because of the flight times met my needs and my budget. However, I would be reluctant to fly on Spirit again. In addition, if the crew were more friendly and at least appeared somewhat happy and welcoming personally it would probably make the experience of flying with Spirit better.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Boarding in Orlando was not good. Giant mob at the gate, should have been lines.My flight was delayed by two hours which made it so that I would miss my layover flight. I stood in line for customer service for over an hour and when I reached the agent she told me to scan a QR code and it'll give me options. I wasn't offered any help, guidance or compensation, only told that I have options but that I had to figure it all out myself. I was refunded part of the trip and had to buy an expensive same day ticket from another airline in order to get home. I will never fly Frontier again.The confirmation # CK8GNW and my name was not recognized/in Frontier system. I was able to check in on Frintier app so i went to the Frontier ticket agent, at time they told me that my name/ confirmation did not show up as a purchased ticket. I had to purchase a new ticket that cost $289.00 one way.Although an hour and a half early was told by staff at check in they had overbooked and could not check us in for the flight.The crew was delayed because they came on another flight that was delayed due to weather 10pm flight left at 1.30 am The airline made no effort to align alternate crewWorst airline experience. They were rude and kept changing our seats and/or giving our seats away so our family didn’t get to sit with each other. Almost everyone we dealt with at both airports with this airline was rude. The app kept giving us wrong information making things take longer. Dealing with them before TSA can take close to an hour…longer than I’ve ever had to deal with before. Never using this airline again.Southwest8.0Delta7.9American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Miami to AtlantaAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Miami to AtlantaFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Miami to Atlanta according to KAYAK users.
