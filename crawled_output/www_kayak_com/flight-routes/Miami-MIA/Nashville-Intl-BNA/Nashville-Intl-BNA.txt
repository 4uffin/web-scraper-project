There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.If we are going to have to pay for luggage, make it easier to do. Put something on the app during check-in so I don't need to do it at the kiosk. I've done it twice recently and I ended up having to pay at the desk because something went wrong at the kiosk in Tampa.Everything was on time. I was disappointed by the front section female, African American flight attendant. I did not see her name tag or would have identified by name not race. As passengers moved to the bathroom early in flight, she would say with a disdainful tone “I have to say the seat belt light is on” then go back to her book. Better trained flight attendants say something like be careful the seat belt light is on.The price of the tickets isn't matching the flight experience. No matter how long the flight is, you're only getting pretzels. The flight attendants looked unkept and over it.WiFi on the flight was not working. Thus, entertainment options were limited.Flight was awfully bumpy and landing was a bit jolting. I was in the restroom when snacks and drinks were served and was not asked if i wanted any. I had to ask for water finally.Wi Fi was horrible kept cutting out the whole time and too expensiveI really like open seating. I hate that I've heard this is going away. This is one of the unique things that makes Southwest my goto choice.We will be writing a long, detailed letter to corporate about our awful experience with American airlines.Food was ok, but not as good as I have had before on AA.Pretty good. The food was just mediocre, the boarding and crew were good.Crew should be nicer and emphatic with customers. Same cookies as the past 20 years. Seat are ok and the plane was clean though it was delayed.Delayed because of weather in Nashville. I think God or some higher power generally has cursed me when it comes to flying out of Charlotte on American. I'm delayed pretty much everytime. We need Team Cobra Kai types to come in and "sweep the leg(s)" of the Charlotte ops people on principle. Don't let the sweet southern rocking chairs fool you, Charlotte is a sinkholeIt was one of my worst flight ever. First they were changing the gate for at least 4 times, changing from gate D7 to D12 to D44. Considering the size of the Miami Airport, we are talking about long distance and the train at the airport was not working. Then the flight was delayed around one hour. Then finally we boarded into the plane and when everybody was seated, there was an announcement that there is an issue with one of the tire of the plane, so we all had to get out of the plane with our belongings, to replace the tire. So we had around 2.5-hour delayThe delays and cancellations kept me stuck in Miami for an additional 24 hours, and the whole thing seemed extremely disorganizedStaff lovely , economy seats very uncomfortable , wheelchair assistance wonderful in Heathrow awful in Nashville !Flight was late and missed connecting flight. They could have better accommodated, but instead did an overnight and had to arrive the next afternoon.The flight was delayed leaving Miami. When we arrived in Charlotte, we were unable to park at our scheduled gate. We had to wait another 30-45 minutes before we could park at a different gate. All in all, we were delayed by almost two hours arriving in Charlotte.Crew was great. No entertainment and food and beverage was for purchase only, even waterIt was canceled. The flight wasn’t rescheduled, everyone had to figure out their own new arrangements. They said we would get refunded our original fare and receive an additional $150. We received links for $100 only and they expired before we could activate them.The plane had originated in Las Vegas at 6:30 in the morning and flew to Moline where we boarded. The flight left around 12:30 PM and there were no boxed snacks available and many of the alcoholic beverages were unavailable. I would find it hard to believe that that many of the passengers coming from Las Vegas at 6:30 in the morning, drank and ate that much of the items. I can only come to the conclusion that someone failed to stock the plane for the round-trip. This is a huge revenue failure for the airline and disappointment for the passengers. The flight crew did not seem happy to be there and did not engage with passengers. Allegiant you can do better.They did not let my husband on the plane with our service animal at the last minute. Do NOT fly this airline with a service animal!Tight! Seats are not designed for those of us who wear extra-large clothes.The non-stop flight from Grand Rapids was excellent. I neither expected or needed a budget flight and Allegiant made the trip easy and for an affordable price, Arriving at the Mesa Airport (AZA) is a delight compared to the international airport. For our return flight, we were able to arrive 75 minutes before the flight, return the rental car, check our bag and make it to the gate in plenty of time. That would never happen at most airports.Easiest flights I’ve ever taken. Plane was comfortable without overly crowded seating.Terrible. Still have not received the refund from them. They sent it to some account that I don't even know. Spoke with costumer service and they are unable to help.I didn’t like it at all. I miss my second flight because of the delay on Allegiant Air now I m stuck in MCO.Good, but a bit late on take off after loading. Don't like charging for carry ons!We spent 5 1/2 hours at Ohare cause our flight was diverted cause of rain in the area. We missed appts that we had set on Tuesday and cause we were flying back the next day on the 7am flight we had no time to reschedule anything. Other airlines were landing and taking off fine having no issues. It was only Spirit. Very frustrating flight and I understand why the flights are only around 25-30% full.I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.Changing the flight time to 6:15 am on the return flight is extremely inconvenient. The flight was okay. It was on time. The crew was friendly. The seats were uncomfortable. All the upsells are annoying, and I would prefer paying a single higher fee and not have to purchase so much extra.The flight was delayed twice with minimal explanation. The terminal and airplane were filthy. The food voucher didn’t even cover a tiny pizza from a kiosk in the terminal. All in all, a pretty miserable experience for a flight to attend a funeralI will use spirit more New clean aircraft Excellent crew ! Quick boarding process !The flight was delayed be over 3 hours. I tried to get a refund for Vivian Kirby and my session kept being stopped. I was NEVER able to finish the prosses...after 2 hours of attempting.For the minimalist experience, it is really a great ride-- feels a little like public transport i guessI didn’t mind being delayed due to weather, but continuing to post (and not update) that we would be delayed until after the flight was already supposed to have taken off was a bit much. In the future, please announce the delay even if the time is still unknown.This gate agents are always so rude! I stopped flirting with spirit years ago for that reason I thought it would change by now. It’s so tacky they try to treat you like a school child i hate itFirst time on Spirit. Definitely a streamline flight but I would fly Spirit again.Southwest8.0American Airlines7.2Allegiant Air7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Everything you need to know for your flight from Miami to NashvilleAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsMiami (MIA)Nashville (BNA)Cabin class types available on flights from Miami to NashvilleCabin classes available on flights from Miami to Nashville.
