The food was just mediocre, the boarding and crew were good.The plane was broken so we had to change planes.Food was terrible, all served at once, poor quality . Wine and bread offered only once.It was one of my worst flight ever. First they were changing the gate for at least 4 times, changing from gate D7 to D12 to D44. Considering the size of the Miami Airport, we are talking about long distance and the train at the airport was not working. Then the flight was delayed around one hour. Then finally we boarded into the plane and when everybody was seated, there was an announcement that there is an issue with one of the tire of the plane, so we all had to get out of the plane with our belongings, to replace the tire. So we had around 2.5-hour delayNo entertainment yatem in flight at seat 51H. Would not shut down either leaving a self moving and openin and changing menus with changes in colors,images brightness levels sort of the type when you get sleep deprivation and image overload when being tortured during an interrogation. 8 hours worth of it. Unable to place backpack underneath seat on that chair. One female stewardess was excellent as she gave up her carryon's space for my backpack but the rest of the iberia crew were very sharp an chtting during the whole flight. The plane did not have hot water so nobody had coffee nor tea. The plane was not up to par to be flying.The delays and cancellations kept me stuck in Miami for an additional 24 hours, and the whole thing seemed extremely disorganizedThe chicken adobo was a little too spicy but good otherwise. My personal opinion. Movie selection could be improved, too many horror movies. Could add a few more chick flicks! The flight was bumpy at times. We arrived a little early too! Flight attendants friendly.really bad they refused to check in luggages that I had purchased, even showing them the transaction receipt from british airways app the staff in miami was MEDIOCREAn old airplane with very uncomfortable seats in the Comfort “class! Small, narrow, and hard seat. Entertainment options are inferior, old movies. Boarding started at the back of the airplane, as we entered the aircraft last instead of after business class, risking the possibility that the comfort section would not have room for carry-on in the overhead bin. The food was ok. White wine was terrible. Overall, the flight felt worse than cheap airliners, and the price was as high as premium carriers.I will avoid TAP if I can, the ground experience was very poor with bad behaviour from the ground crew and it was only a bit better on the aircraft.I had a business class ticket from EWR to Madrid with a layover at LIS for 11 hours. It was obvious that I needed to pick up my luggage in Lisbon for 11 hours and check it in again when boarding the second flight to Madrid. Before buying the ticket, I called TAP customer service. Customer service assured me that I could get my luggage in Lisbon. When I arrived at Newark airport, I immediately asked to check my luggage to Lisbon. However, the TAP employee refused me, saying that I should resolve this issue upon arrival in Lisbon. She checked my luggage to Madrid. I asked the TAP employee at the gate to help me when boarding the plane, I asked the flight attendants manager on board the plane to help me. All the employees refused to help me and said that I should resolve this issue in Lisbon. It took me 4 hours to resolve this issue in Lisbon. I arrived at 11am and they didn't give me my luggage until 3pm. As a result, I was so tired after a sleepless night on the plane and 4 hours on my feet at the airport and all my plans were ruined that I couldn't fly to Madrid. It was a terrible experiance,The seats were not designed to comfortably see people in coach for more than 10 minutesA good, comfortable flight with friendly crew and good entertainment options.Very rude person at the boarding desk; flight attendant coughing 3 inches from my face three times- not even covering her mouth; boarding process very unacceptable for older people with stairs to all planes (are you all stuck in the 1960’s?). I am sure that I am not remembering all of the negative things, but I am sure you get the message!Boarding experience was awful. TAP claims I did not have check in luggage with tickets. I went 3-4 check in agents until I finally found a helpful kind agent who checked in my luggage with no fees. On top of that our flight was over 2 hours delayed with barely an apology or explanation.We flew TAP last October from Newark to Lisbon. The meal was bad. This flight had good food. Also, this flight was delayed. There were TAP employees waiting at Lisbon to make sure we made our connecting flight. I find the TAP website and app frustrating, but the service once we reached the airport was very goodBoarding too way too long. Biggest peeve: zero in-seat power in economy! No plug sockets, no USB ports. Plane was an A330, so not old.boarding is so disorganized, i was literally appalled at the boarding experienceThe crew were friendly and helpful. Iberia lost our luggage on arrival, Friday and we didn't get it until Sunday at 10:00 p.m. local Malaga time. I also paid $382.80 for seat assignments but two out out of the four were not together. Iberia mentioned that it was because the plane was delayed in Madrid before our flight began in LAX. They should compensate us half of my payment.It was fortunate that the flight arrived in London in accordance with schedule, and the luggage was promptly transferred to the luggage carousel. However, I find it concerning that even minor issues in economy cabins are prevalent within the industry. American Airlines, in particular, appears to have the least legroom and feels more crowded due to the proximity of neighboring passengers. Additionally, the crew’s adherence to protocol is inconsistent. While they may enforce certain rules set by the FAA on a select few individuals, they often overlook numerous violations, such as failing to reset seat recline during landing.It was hidden that I needed a special fee to bring my guitar on. They charged me an extra 69 euros at the gate and did not refund me the checked bag I paid for and the over head bag I paid for which I didn't use because I had to pay for the special guitar case. Criminal behavior. They were very unkind about it as well. Terrible experience. I'd like my money back for the extras I paid for.We liked the flight but while we purchased an aisle seat, our seats had a different configuration on this flight. A fellow passenger suggested that the airplane had been changed. Too bad we were not informed and had no chance to modify our seat preferences. We were stuck in the window and middle seats with no chance to walk around and go to the bathroom without disturbing our sleeping fellow passenger.The crew were not very personable. The crew did not serve tea or coffee. The bathroom was not kept clean. Two out of the 5 toilets in the cabin weren't working.It was extremely cold in the back of the plane. The seats are uncomfortable and space very small. Crew was excellent as usual.Check in needed to be in person, not nice. Also I won’t do connections in Charlotte again because you need to go through security again and short connections become a problemIberia lost my bag, said they found it in another country, said they sent it to me, but never did. Went my whole trip without my stuff, but expecting it to show up because that’s what they said would happen. Their communication sucks, their website sucks, and to top it all off, their seats are small and uncomfortable. They’re bad at their jobs and they should feel bad about themselves. Do not even get me started on the flight home. AVOID!I described my experience in the previous window. I didn't realize that there would be another opportunity for this flight. Please look at my response in the previous window.Boarding was 2 1/2 late no explanation Captain said he did not know why, but he rested at home for an extra couple of hours. Food was edible, Nothing more.Staff were nice, we left on time and arrived early, food was good. Unfortunately, they lost one of our bags and have been unable to find it. So we are in Italy for a week for my husband‘s birthday and he does not have any of his clothing.They gave us sandwiches as a meal twice. Snacks mid flight with cookies and a tuna panini. Then just the same tuna panini for dinner. That was it.Top notch re cleanliness, comfort, operational. Attendants attentive, cheerful, courteous and professional. An unusually high-grade experience all around.The staff was very good, the only thing was the air conditioning wasn't working during the boarding process so it was very hot inside the plane until we got airborne. The food wasn't great, the chicken was dry and hard to cut, the ravioli was ok and the little pizza pocket thing was pretty bad. Other than that is was a good flight all aroundBetter consideration for families traveling with a disabled person. They insisted each person hold their own boarding pass on their own devices and gave us a hard time accepting eight boarding passes on a single device.Two of my four flights had issues with toilets either NOT fully operational or completely out of order. Boarding was a joke because they have NOT established who is running the show. In the end, she did a terrible job. The seats 💺 were loose goose and the drinks and snacks were limiting in choices. Also, following Alitalia as an inspiration was strange since they went out of business.We had a 3 hour delay and then a long taxi to take off. It would have been helpful for the pilot to have communicated more about what was going on. There was no A/C during the wait, and the cabin must have been more than 85 to 90 degrees. The crew gave water to the people in the front but by the time they go to the back of the plane they stopped giving out water. Eventually I went back and asked for some in the rear of the plane (for a second time). The food was close to inedible. I thought on an Italian flight that the pasta would be better than the chick, but honestly, a Swanson's TV dinner would have been better. I had a bite or two to keep my blood sugar up, but basically I couldn't eat it.Boarding was chaotic. Service was poor. Attendant was slow and rude. In business class, I was not offered a drink until 1.5 hrs,after takeoff. Food was inedible.Terrible. They canceled 2 flights and then sent everyone by BUS from Rome. They should make amends by offering some sort of compensation.We ordered a gluten free meal and never got it!Need to offer Better food from LAX to London Service from London to Delhi very delayed after take off.Connection at Hethrow was horrible..We couldn't get out of the plane for an hour as they were buying people to the airport and there were not enough busses. We had 2 and half hf between flights so it was very tight. After departing plane we had to go thru security again. People with less time in between connections missed their flightsPoor all around experience. Sat at gate in Grand Rapids to Chicago for 2.5 hours. No food or water offered and no allowances to use restroom. Missed connecting flight to London and not offered any compensation including food or lodging. Not happy with AA, claims delay was weather related but no weather issues seen on radar. Take ownership for real reason behind delay which was actually the IT outage. Very disappointing and will not be recommending AA for domestic or international flights if this is the way that customers are treated.Horrible… I was downgraded without notice, had to sit in economy and given my back injury was in pain most of the journey. I expect to be reimbursed for this inconvenience and after my return flight home, I never plan to fly with British Airways again.Great crew and food and beverage. Seating tight but not the airline's fault. Will definitely fly BA in future!Flight cancelled, lost luggage, crappy meal voucher. Nothing was good. Still dont have my luggage.The seating has become ridiculous… like a contest to see how narrow and short they can be made- forcing anyone over 5’1 to pay more to not be twisting oneself into a pretzel. Really insane- would have thought BA was better than this. Frankly- it cancels out a lot of the positive aspects.flight was delayed from BWI to London - missed my connecting flight & then connecting flight (also British Air) was delayed - food is awful, TV & movie selection is greatThree major things that led to my low rating, 1. Internet wasn't available for the whole time, and 2. TV became available way into flight, after numerous system reboots, and 3. Food is not good at all.Super tight economy class. My knees were hitting the back of seat in front of me (I'm only 5'6"). My small backpack (sized according to their required dimensions) would not fit under the seat in front of me because there is a box (is that the life jacket?) in the way. Over all, extremely uncomfortable. I forgive the tasteless food, but the tight seating was tortureAmerican Airlines7.2TAP AIR PORTUGAL7.1Iberia7.0ITA Airways6.7British Airways6.7Everything you need to know for your flight from Miami to RomeAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Miami to RomeFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Miami to Rome according to KAYAK users.
