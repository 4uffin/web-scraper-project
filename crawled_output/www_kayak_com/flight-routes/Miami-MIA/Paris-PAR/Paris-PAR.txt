That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.8.0 ExcellentTarun, Sep 2025MCO - LHRRead more Delta reviewsPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Knowing what gate to go to was such a issue I couldn’t tell on the app, they tell you what zone you are in but won’t give you the gate number, i almost missed my flight in Atlanta Georgia because of that, as soon as we landed my next flight was already boarding because our flight to Nashville arrived late, I don’t know how that works, but as soon as we got out I was told my next flight is boarding I had to rush lost few of my items, and when I finally got to the gate after struggling, I received a message about my gate after I already boarded, and no my tickets didn’t have the gate numbers either.For a 69 year old with health problems I had the worse experience, no wheelchair when I entered a lady told me to sit and wait while a gentleman told me I had to walk to the Delta station, which I did. I had a carry on and a bag, and I was traveling with my service dog, which was on his carrier and the lady charged me for my carry on luggage, beside all the waiting cause of the delay, I had to walk to get my luggage cause no wheelchair showed up, I am so disappointed. I will get in touch with the company. I got home at 3:00 am, not good for my health situation.Flight was an hour late, who knows why. It was OK, nothing outstanding.Excellent check-in. Crew was good. Excellent communication from flight deck.Great flight! Only complaint I had was that I didn’t get breakfast that morning because I don’t eat eggs for breakfast.. I ate an energy bar I bought in the airport which I had never done before. Otherwise, another great Delta flight!Amazing flight! I have never noticed the uniforms of the attendants before in twenty years of flying except today when one female had the most amazing dress on. It was beautifully designed and showed she was in charge. I never dreamed I would google who designed Delta uniforms . The ultimate compliment is when another woman admires your outfit. . I hope your designer puts it on the marketThis had nothing to do with Delta… The flights were on time and flawless. The service was excellent. We purchased seats in (aisle/middle) comfort plus since this was a cross country flight. Unfortunately, the woman seated at the window was 300+ pounds and, as might be expected, covered up about a third of the middle seat also. there was absolutely nothing that Delta could have done about that… I just don’t know what the answer should be. If you purchase a seat, you should should be able to use the entire seat and not just the portion that someone else is not sitting/oozing in. Disappointing…there should be something that could be done….I'm just not sure what solution could be.I bought business class tickets but the seats are exactly like economy with no comfort seats nor an empty seat next to me provided. Very poor, low quality airline.I don't understand the concept of paying to get your personal luggage onboard and then asked to check it in.... either sell the space or don't, its a hassle to carry those all through the airport just to make a check in at the last minute.It was a great experience. The only thing I would have changed was that the bathrooms were never cleaned and they got very dirty.It was an OK flight with below mediocre service by their flight attendantsWasted a lot of time trying to find the CDG lounge - it was not next to the connecting flight gate like the Air France staff said.My experience was good overall, the quality of the food really decreased! There used to be a choice between meat and fish now it’s between chicken and pasta! In the choices of entertainment meditation has been added which is very good. Soft chair workout to improve blood circulation and avoid phlebitis should be added.The only reason the overall rating wasn't "excellent" was due to problems in claiming luggage. The bags are delivered to the main area (Cinta 35) for domestic passengers, but to a DIFFERENT ROOM for international arrivees. After waiting 30 minutes, someone (who didn't appear to be from Air France or the airport) told us to go to another area. There we found our bags, which appeared to have been awaiting us for a while. We had to go through a bag check before leaving the airport. If we had been alerted to this possibility, or better yet, been to go directly to Cinta 34, we could have eliminated quite a bit of waiting.Much better than the major US Carriers especially in Biz Class.I wish that the meal included a vegetable or even a salad instead of couscous! Why serve chicken with rice AND couscous? Service was good overall though a bit lacking in friendliness. Usually on air france I've been offered a glass of champagne before dinner, wine with dinner, and a digestif after dinner. We were only offered wine this time!It was not Air France but Air Europa. But confusion over our checked luggage. Whether it was checked all the way to Tenerife or not. It was not. Had to line up again in Departures. At least our Sky Priority was honoured. Flight was fine.We will be writing a long, detailed letter to corporate about our awful experience with American airlines.Food was ok, but not as good as I have had before on AA.Pretty good. The food was just mediocre, the boarding and crew were good.The plane was broken so we had to change planes.Food was terrible, all served at once, poor quality . Wine and bread offered only once.It was one of my worst flight ever. First they were changing the gate for at least 4 times, changing from gate D7 to D12 to D44. Considering the size of the Miami Airport, we are talking about long distance and the train at the airport was not working. Then the flight was delayed around one hour. Then finally we boarded into the plane and when everybody was seated, there was an announcement that there is an issue with one of the tire of the plane, so we all had to get out of the plane with our belongings, to replace the tire. So we had around 2.5-hour delayNo entertainment yatem in flight at seat 51H. Would not shut down either leaving a self moving and openin and changing menus with changes in colors,images brightness levels sort of the type when you get sleep deprivation and image overload when being tortured during an interrogation. 8 hours worth of it. Unable to place backpack underneath seat on that chair. One female stewardess was excellent as she gave up her carryon's space for my backpack but the rest of the iberia crew were very sharp an chtting during the whole flight. The plane did not have hot water so nobody had coffee nor tea. The plane was not up to par to be flying.The delays and cancellations kept me stuck in Miami for an additional 24 hours, and the whole thing seemed extremely disorganizedThe chicken adobo was a little too spicy but good otherwise. My personal opinion. Movie selection could be improved, too many horror movies. Could add a few more chick flicks! The flight was bumpy at times. We arrived a little early too! Flight attendants friendly.really bad they refused to check in luggages that I had purchased, even showing them the transaction receipt from british airways app the staff in miami was MEDIOCREAn old airplane with very uncomfortable seats in the Comfort “class! Small, narrow, and hard seat. Entertainment options are inferior, old movies. Boarding started at the back of the airplane, as we entered the aircraft last instead of after business class, risking the possibility that the comfort section would not have room for carry-on in the overhead bin. The food was ok. White wine was terrible. Overall, the flight felt worse than cheap airliners, and the price was as high as premium carriers.I had a business class ticket from EWR to Madrid with a layover at LIS for 11 hours. It was obvious that I needed to pick up my luggage in Lisbon for 11 hours and check it in again when boarding the second flight to Madrid. Before buying the ticket, I called TAP customer service. Customer service assured me that I could get my luggage in Lisbon. When I arrived at Newark airport, I immediately asked to check my luggage to Lisbon. However, the TAP employee refused me, saying that I should resolve this issue upon arrival in Lisbon. She checked my luggage to Madrid. I asked the TAP employee at the gate to help me when boarding the plane, I asked the flight attendants manager on board the plane to help me. All the employees refused to help me and said that I should resolve this issue in Lisbon. It took me 4 hours to resolve this issue in Lisbon. I arrived at 11am and they didn't give me my luggage until 3pm. As a result, I was so tired after a sleepless night on the plane and 4 hours on my feet at the airport and all my plans were ruined that I couldn't fly to Madrid. It was a terrible experiance,Check-in guidance for transfer flight, boarding, in-flight service, seat comfort, etc.The seats were not designed to comfortably see people in coach for more than 10 minutesThere was chaos at the Naples airport. We arrived three hours early for the flight but there was no invitation available about where to go to check bags until an hour later. Then we had to go to a different terminal to check our bags and check in and back to the first to board.We flew TAP last October from Newark to Lisbon. The meal was bad. This flight had good food. Also, this flight was delayed. There were TAP employees waiting at Lisbon to make sure we made our connecting flight. I find the TAP website and app frustrating, but the service once we reached the airport was very goodThe airport temperature at the airport and on the flight was too warmBoarding too way too long. Biggest peeve: zero in-seat power in economy! No plug sockets, no USB ports. Plane was an A330, so not old.The long wait at JFK made the trip horrible. Also not having enough buses when we deplaned was annoyingFlight was delayed on 6/20 to miss international connection. Next flight out was 24 hours later. Not acceptable.The French bee web site kept telling me my luggage was free when trying to attempt to buy it 48 hours in advance. When i check in the price is now double and the site said because I didn’t pay for the luggage. Very disappointing when explaining that to their customer service and showing screen shots where there site said it was free therefore not allowing me to pre purchase. Seems scammy and I was surprised after showing them the screen shots they did not reimburse me for the double charge. I would have gladly paid $70 but 140 was insane seeing how I did everything I was supposed to and their site was at fault.Excellent-boarding was quick and efficient, plenty of room in board. Friendly crewBest price around. The food has gotten worse,,,might actually be better to board with one's own food... On time, professional staff at airport and on board.I received an email and text message from French Bee less than 24 hours prior to my flight that there was a flight change. That flight change indicated that my flight had already left yet the message went out just under an hour before the new departure time. When calling French Bee staff (located in Texas so open at central time) they only said “sorry for the inconvenience “ and never offered or supplied information about a rebooking or what took place even when asked. They had a very blasé attitude about the entire situation. I had to buy a ticket on another airline because I was not told what was going on! A ticket to fly internationally on the same day!!!$$$$$$ so disappointingThe seating on my French Bee flight was exceedingly uncomfortable, resulting in significant discomfort. I experienced considerable pain in both my back and feet throughout the journey. food I would rate it below 0. Crew are professional. And most importantly we arrived safe.Check in was in time. No free food. Not even water. Was asked to pay for water. Disgusting!I know this is a stripped down airline but I didn’t expect it to be so difficult to avoid the “up charges.” I was naive when planning and checking in for my flight to Paris from Newark and they got me on the outrageous $90 in cabin carry on bag charge at the gate. But on my return flight I did everything possible to pay in advance (you have a short window to do this 48 hours before the flight departure) for that same in cabin bag so the charge would be $45 instead. It was not to be. In spite of a confirmation email that they had “added a service “ and the $45 carry on bag was accounted for, my boarding pass did not reflect that and I was charged the full amount at the gate. It adds insult to injury that the French Bee staff is gleeful when they are successfully working this nefarious up charging scam. They couldn’t care less about their customers. Very disappointed with this airline and will not be flying French Bee anytime in the future. Do NOT recommend.Economy seats are too tight for a long haul flight. The meal was surprisingly good, though it was surprising to learn that even coffee and tea were extra pay. They also don’t distribute water regularly.Overall impression - very bad. There is not even free water on the plane and the seats are so uncomfortable that after 7.5 hours of flight my back was just falling apart. Never pay extra for "Private" seats. It's just that part of the regular cabin is separated by curtains. This does not give any effect. Money for nothing.Expensive long flight from SFO to PPT. Even at basic fare its very expensive given what you get and you get absolutely nothing... they even charge for the water...and if you are not french the crew will treat you like a intruder...very bad experience during my worlwide travel experience...Delta7.9Air France7.4American Airlines7.2TAP AIR PORTUGAL7.1French Bee6.0Everything you need to know for your flight from Miami to ParisAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Miami to ParisFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Miami to Paris according to KAYAK users.
