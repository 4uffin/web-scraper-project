Completely disappointed with Latam operation at GRUThe flight was late. Please do not delay next time.I couldn't travel, now I can't get a refund and to change the date I have to pay an absurd fine.My biggest complaint is the comfort. I am not tall and there was no legroom. It was very uncomfortable. During my transfer in Sao Paola, the flight was slightly delayed so boarding was confusing because there were no instructions in English.Horrible the worst airlines I have ever flown. Cancelled flight with no choices and when contacted them they were not helpfulI never got this flight. You sent me to Chile!!! And from Chile I got the other flight to São Paulo... I've arrived 7h latter than I was supposed to arrive because of Delta delays.Because the flight was late, we lost the connection to Brazil. You, Delta delayed, and you Delta anticipated the door closing in 15 min from Miami to GRU. Why? It caused a lot of stress! I almost could not see my mother in law alive because of your delay.Boarding was done by woman who insisted on strict standing in line policy; food was ok; entertainment minimalentertainment was not good; the shoulder strap on Business class seat did not sit well across the body (more like across the neck); the food was not hot and the special meal promoted by insert in the menu was not available to usWider seats, better seat cushions, (I felt like there was a board I was sitting on). I had the chicken to eat but It neither tasted nor looked like chicken. The fruit was good.We will be writing a long, detailed letter to corporate about our awful experience with American airlines.Food was ok, but not as good as I have had before on AA.Pretty good. The food was just mediocre, the boarding and crew were good.The plane was broken so we had to change planes.Food was terrible, all served at once, poor quality . Wine and bread offered only once.It was one of my worst flight ever. First they were changing the gate for at least 4 times, changing from gate D7 to D12 to D44. Considering the size of the Miami Airport, we are talking about long distance and the train at the airport was not working. Then the flight was delayed around one hour. Then finally we boarded into the plane and when everybody was seated, there was an announcement that there is an issue with one of the tire of the plane, so we all had to get out of the plane with our belongings, to replace the tire. So we had around 2.5-hour delayNo entertainment yatem in flight at seat 51H. Would not shut down either leaving a self moving and openin and changing menus with changes in colors,images brightness levels sort of the type when you get sleep deprivation and image overload when being tortured during an interrogation. 8 hours worth of it. Unable to place backpack underneath seat on that chair. One female stewardess was excellent as she gave up her carryon's space for my backpack but the rest of the iberia crew were very sharp an chtting during the whole flight. The plane did not have hot water so nobody had coffee nor tea. The plane was not up to par to be flying.The delays and cancellations kept me stuck in Miami for an additional 24 hours, and the whole thing seemed extremely disorganizedThe chicken adobo was a little too spicy but good otherwise. My personal opinion. Movie selection could be improved, too many horror movies. Could add a few more chick flicks! The flight was bumpy at times. We arrived a little early too! Flight attendants friendly.really bad they refused to check in luggages that I had purchased, even showing them the transaction receipt from british airways app the staff in miami was MEDIOCREHorrible service. No communication from the crew as to why a 6 hour delay then cancellationWe waited in an overcrowded bus for over a half hour. It was uncomfortable. It would have been better to have waited in the terminal in a lineThe food for sale on board has opportunity for improvement.I paid extra for a comfortable seat in the second flight, but the plane didn't have those seats, the first one didThe Arajet person who greeted us initially was unhelpful & rude about the mandatory migration form which has to be completed digitally but the systems don’t work properly. The boarding gate was changed twice and initial boarding was delayed. Once on board we we had to wait an hour and a half before take off. It was hot and there was very little room for tall-ish people to fit their knees in. The crew were pleasant but working in a poor situation. The plane was delayed because we were waiting for people from a delayed interconnecting flight. Arajet must have known that before we were asked to board. Better information, decisions & communication were needed.My seat was broken and the crew had to find me somewhere else to sit. The crew was extremely courteous about thisWe spent 5 1/2 hours at Ohare cause our flight was diverted cause of rain in the area. We missed appts that we had set on Tuesday and cause we were flying back the next day on the 7am flight we had no time to reschedule anything. Other airlines were landing and taking off fine having no issues. It was only Spirit. Very frustrating flight and I understand why the flights are only around 25-30% full.I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.Changing the flight time to 6:15 am on the return flight is extremely inconvenient. The flight was okay. It was on time. The crew was friendly. The seats were uncomfortable. All the upsells are annoying, and I would prefer paying a single higher fee and not have to purchase so much extra.The flight was delayed twice with minimal explanation. The terminal and airplane were filthy. The food voucher didn’t even cover a tiny pizza from a kiosk in the terminal. All in all, a pretty miserable experience for a flight to attend a funeralI will use spirit more New clean aircraft Excellent crew ! Quick boarding process !I liked the check in procedure. The luggage charges and overweight cost can be better.The flight was delayed be over 3 hours. I tried to get a refund for Vivian Kirby and my session kept being stopped. I was NEVER able to finish the prosses...after 2 hours of attempting.Again, when I use Kayak I expect to pay the total amount and that´s it. Someone added an additional charge few days later after purchasing the tickets.For the minimalist experience, it is really a great ride-- feels a little like public transport i guessI didn’t mind being delayed due to weather, but continuing to post (and not update) that we would be delayed until after the flight was already supposed to have taken off was a bit much. In the future, please announce the delay even if the time is still unknown.Everyone seemed to be in zone 1 for boarding. Maybe break it up a little. Otherwise, smooth flight.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Boarding in Orlando was not good. Giant mob at the gate, should have been lines.My flight was delayed by two hours which made it so that I would miss my layover flight. I stood in line for customer service for over an hour and when I reached the agent she told me to scan a QR code and it'll give me options. I wasn't offered any help, guidance or compensation, only told that I have options but that I had to figure it all out myself. I was refunded part of the trip and had to buy an expensive same day ticket from another airline in order to get home. I will never fly Frontier again.The confirmation # CK8GNW and my name was not recognized/in Frontier system. I was able to check in on Frintier app so i went to the Frontier ticket agent, at time they told me that my name/ confirmation did not show up as a purchased ticket. I had to purchase a new ticket that cost $289.00 one way.Although an hour and a half early was told by staff at check in they had overbooked and could not check us in for the flight.The crew was delayed because they came on another flight that was delayed due to weather 10pm flight left at 1.30 am The airline made no effort to align alternate crewWorst airline experience. They were rude and kept changing our seats and/or giving our seats away so our family didn’t get to sit with each other. Almost everyone we dealt with at both airports with this airline was rude. The app kept giving us wrong information making things take longer. Dealing with them before TSA can take close to an hour…longer than I’ve ever had to deal with before. Never using this airline again.LATAM Airlines7.5American Airlines7.2Arajet7.0Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Miami to Punta CanaAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsMiami (MIA)Punta Cana (PUJ)Cabin class types available on flights from Miami to Punta CanaCabin classes available on flights from Miami to Punta Cana.
