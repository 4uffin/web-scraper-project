Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.10.0 Excellentdarryl, Sep 2025MIA - GRURead more Delta reviewsQuick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.On this flight I felt the food offering was not as complete as on previous flights. The tomato salad was a bit off and there was nothing additional such a bread or butter. The breakfast was only one option, so you either ate what they had or ate nothing. The crew was efficient, but most seemed frustrated throughout the flight. The flight arrived early and was obstacle-free, so I’m overall quite happy, but the shine in the rest of the experience just wasn’t there.Great flight with Delta! Boarding was quick and easy, the amenities were solid, and the plane was in great shape. The flight attendants had a fun, lively energy while staying professional. All in all, a smooth trip — even managed to catch up on some rest. Thanks, Delta!De planning was an absolute mess. We were never told that we weren’t at the gate and that we had to go down unstable stairs and then hop on a bus. People were falling, we couldn’t tell who was in charge. Overall terrible communication that ended up leaving a bad impression at the very end of the experience.For a 69 year old with health problems I had the worse experience, no wheelchair when I entered a lady told me to sit and wait while a gentleman told me I had to walk to the Delta station, which I did. I had a carry on and a bag, and I was traveling with my service dog, which was on his carrier and the lady charged me for my carry on luggage, beside all the waiting cause of the delay, I had to walk to get my luggage cause no wheelchair showed up, I am so disappointed. I will get in touch with the company. I got home at 3:00 am, not good for my health situation.My flight was canceled after being rescheduled for four days canceling my trip. Kayak and everyone affiliated with it I.e the airlines, and just fly have been excruciating to deal with. My trip to visit family had to be canceled as there was no way to make it. I am furious at all of you.They delayed our flight because of bad weather in NY which was completely understandable. Then they cancelled our flight and a later flight that evening. The earliest we could fly was the next morning. We ended up buying last minute tickets on another airline and made it home slightly delayed but safely that evening. Delta kept saying it was weather related but if that was the case how did we make it back on another airline? The weather in NY was cloudy but not bad.Flight was an hour late, who knows why. It was OK, nothing outstanding.I like for how they process during check in. It was very smoothly.We will be writing a long, detailed letter to corporate about our awful experience with American airlines.Food was ok, but not as good as I have had before on AA.Pretty good. The food was just mediocre, the boarding and crew were good.It was one of my worst flight ever. First they were changing the gate for at least 4 times, changing from gate D7 to D12 to D44. Considering the size of the Miami Airport, we are talking about long distance and the train at the airport was not working. Then the flight was delayed around one hour. Then finally we boarded into the plane and when everybody was seated, there was an announcement that there is an issue with one of the tire of the plane, so we all had to get out of the plane with our belongings, to replace the tire. So we had around 2.5-hour delayThe delays and cancellations kept me stuck in Miami for an additional 24 hours, and the whole thing seemed extremely disorganizedFlight was late and missed connecting flight. They could have better accommodated, but instead did an overnight and had to arrive the next afternoon.The flight was delayed leaving Miami. When we arrived in Charlotte, we were unable to park at our scheduled gate. We had to wait another 30-45 minutes before we could park at a different gate. All in all, we were delayed by almost two hours arriving in Charlotte.the pilot that landed this flight in Philadelphia did an amazing job, the weather was absolutely terrible and we landed safely.I never have a good experience with American and this was no different. The airplane was INCREDIBLY hot. Like unbearably so. Everyone was fanning themselves with pamphlets and sweating. When someone asked the flight attendant to turn down the temperature they were told there was nothing the crew could do. Once we pushed back from the gate we then had to wait an hour to take off and the communication from the crew was not good. People were getting up this whole time and a man was even in the bathroom when we took off. Once we landed at our destination we waited another 30 minutes at the gate to deplane with, again, no communication from the crew as to what was going on.I had a horrible experience from the time I dropped off my bags until the time I landed. The staff taking the bags at the check-in counter prior to security, forced me to check my baby stroller, even though it weighed less than 20 pounds. their excuse was that the wheels were too big. I have never had an issue gate checking this exact same stroller in the past either on American or on any other airline. when I asked for the agent to show me the rule about the size of the wheels on strollers, they told me to look it up on the AA website. I did so, and did not find any indication that wheel size was a problem for gate checking strollers. The only limitation would be the weight of the stroller which mine was below. I was left with a one-year-old child and all of my carry-on luggage, diaper bag, and the like to walk around the airport without the assistance of a stroller and had the same issue when I exited the plane and had to go all the way to baggage claim without a stroller. In addition, while on the airplane, I was told I can only get one bag of cookies as a snack, even though I was with a child. Apparently my child and I were supposed to share a cookie. While this latter issue is a minor one, it is just another example of the absolutely horrible customer service that American Airlines provides. In addition, the 737 aircraft that I was on was extremely hot and the air vents above the seat were so far away from the aisle and middle seats that it was comical. I could barely reach the air vent to adjust it. I had to ask the person in the window seat to do it for me. The whole experience was just a nightmare.I don’t usually fly budget airlines or airlines in the United States. It was as good as any other airline. The seats are comfortable and the airline attendants are not rude & surly. Very nice flight (s).They have the most inexperienced / rude flight staff I’ve encounteredWiFi was not eorkig (again) And the plane was from 1990 with the screens which were.not touch and most didn’t even work and if lucky could tune in tvI paid extra for a seat closer to the front. The TV didn’t work at all for the entire flight. Would have been nice to know before I purchased an “upgraded “ seatToo many long delays with JetBlue. Worst major airline that serves JFK but unfortunately I keep going back because of the prices.flight cancelled after 2 delays. left us sitting in JFK at 1am. no customer service to assist rebooking.To not have food or proper snacks on a 5 hour flight was the worst.Spend hours delayed with no food, water anything sitting on the aieplane with no ability to eat or use the restroom. My entire experience was the absolute worst. I will never fly jet Blue again.It would have been nice if they had offered more than one set of snacksGround crew gave me interference about carrying a laptop and a small shoulder bag, even though I told them I traveled with them all the time. I then placed my laptop bag in my carryon and took out a medical device, and ground crew still tried to give interference. I had to remind them that medical devices don't count towards luggage limits. It was quite annoying and unneSpirit is low fare air line. Food also cost you. No free food.The flight was delayed twice with minimal explanation. The terminal and airplane were filthy. The food voucher didn’t even cover a tiny pizza from a kiosk in the terminal. All in all, a pretty miserable experience for a flight to attend a funeralEveryone was kind for the most part. I did travel with children and paid for seats and even then it was not as suitable. I tried calling their customer service prior to check in and I was told they couldn't help me because I didn't purchase my tickets with them.The flight was delayed four and half hours for paperwork on a maintenance issue. Very frustrating.The flight times got delayed multiple times due to weather which is understandable, but later the time got prepared 30min. Made to the flight barely but got stressed too much.Onboarding was an easy process. Staff waa friendly and courteous. Should have a complimentary snack and drink. We paid $900 round trip for two to myrtle from New York, which is an expensive fare. Going to the seats were not in good shape but our return home, the air plane seemed to be new with comfortable seating with slightly more space. If traveling again, we will still consider flying SpIrit.It was absolutely awesome. The crew was welcoming to all, not just the first class. They were full of energy. The in-cabin music was an excellent choice, not boring like most airlines. We were ready for takeoff ahead of time. Pilots were great. Smooth takeoff and landing. The plane was beautiful and nicely cleaned. This was truly a fantastic flight. I fly Delta and American all the time. I was apprehensive about Spirit. I will definitely be looking for Spirit first. Thanks for a great experience.Tell them to chose a better, less bumpy route :( my seat had no window all the way at the end 😔The flight was canceled and was bounced around time wise with my elderly parents. That being said the gentleman in custody service was amazingly helpfulIt amaze me how other airlines leave on time and Spirit always have some type of delay. I’ve flown with Spirit many times, but it reached a point I’d rather pay twice the amount and not deal with this corporation they never do nothing to reimburse people for their time or headaches.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.My first flight was delayed 5 hours. The 2nd flight was canceled til the next day and the never even tried to compensate for it. Worse I was delayed again on the flight the rebooked me on.Boarding in Orlando was not good. Giant mob at the gate, should have been lines.My flight was delayed by two hours which made it so that I would miss my layover flight. I stood in line for customer service for over an hour and when I reached the agent she told me to scan a QR code and it'll give me options. I wasn't offered any help, guidance or compensation, only told that I have options but that I had to figure it all out myself. I was refunded part of the trip and had to buy an expensive same day ticket from another airline in order to get home. I will never fly Frontier again.The confirmation # CK8GNW and my name was not recognized/in Frontier system. I was able to check in on Frintier app so i went to the Frontier ticket agent, at time they told me that my name/ confirmation did not show up as a purchased ticket. I had to purchase a new ticket that cost $289.00 one way.Although an hour and a half early was told by staff at check in they had overbooked and could not check us in for the flight.The crew was delayed because they came on another flight that was delayed due to weather 10pm flight left at 1.30 am The airline made no effort to align alternate crewDelta7.9American Airlines7.2JetBlue7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Miami to New YorkAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Miami to New YorkFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Miami to New York according to KAYAK users.
