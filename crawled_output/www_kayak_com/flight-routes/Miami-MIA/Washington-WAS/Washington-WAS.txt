The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.For a 69 year old with health problems I had the worse experience, no wheelchair when I entered a lady told me to sit and wait while a gentleman told me I had to walk to the Delta station, which I did. I had a carry on and a bag, and I was traveling with my service dog, which was on his carrier and the lady charged me for my carry on luggage, beside all the waiting cause of the delay, I had to walk to get my luggage cause no wheelchair showed up, I am so disappointed. I will get in touch with the company. I got home at 3:00 am, not good for my health situation.Flight was an hour late, who knows why. It was OK, nothing outstanding.Excellent check-in. Crew was good. Excellent communication from flight deck.Amazing flight! I have never noticed the uniforms of the attendants before in twenty years of flying except today when one female had the most amazing dress on. It was beautifully designed and showed she was in charge. I never dreamed I would google who designed Delta uniforms . The ultimate compliment is when another woman admires your outfit. . I hope your designer puts it on the marketThis had nothing to do with Delta… The flights were on time and flawless. The service was excellent. We purchased seats in (aisle/middle) comfort plus since this was a cross country flight. Unfortunately, the woman seated at the window was 300+ pounds and, as might be expected, covered up about a third of the middle seat also. there was absolutely nothing that Delta could have done about that… I just don’t know what the answer should be. If you purchase a seat, you should should be able to use the entire seat and not just the portion that someone else is not sitting/oozing in. Disappointing…there should be something that could be done….I'm just not sure what solution could be.The worst part was I was NOT allowed in the lounge even though I was holding a first class ticket and have a premium American Express card. I have flown Business or First Class with many airlines. Delta is the ONLY one who does not extend this courtesy to anyone except people who hold the very expensive American Express card. As a result, I won’t fly Delta if I have any other choice.The Dekta Rep that checked us in was great. She's very personable, pleasant, and can tell she enjoys her job.The young man who was our flight attendant in first class was lazy and did not do his job well at all. Never offered drinks upon boarding - actually I take that back... said "are you okay with water" as if I do not want to get you anything else, only passed the snacks around once, got my drink order wrong and then never offered a second round of drinks. He was the worst I have ever seen on Delta and we fly a lot.IAD with the archaic people movers is just a place to be avoided.Overall, it was good. I was seating next to a wonderful lady and did not notice how time flew. ThanksThis is the best united airlines flight that I took. The crew was very friendly and the food was tasty!It is clear that someone knew, and competent, is in charge of food at United Airlines at least for the international flights. I was flying in coach, but the choices of the dinner were excellent. Tasty, and appropriate size. I had the beef, which was a little bit like a shepherds pie, and it was good. Nothing comparable has been served on a United flight in years. It will not be confused with three star food, but it is very good for airline food. Even better was the breakfast choice between a cinnamon roll and a breakfast sandwich. I chose the breakfast sandwich which was absolutely delicious and which I would happily order again at my local Starbucks or Panera. It is clear that someone knew indifferent is in charge of the food and it’s about time.Staff members were not helpful they ignored all calls for an attendant.Terrible. Delayed 7 hours, and cancelled the flight, leaving me stranded and out of pocket $500 for an alternative last minute flightHad one staff that was not pleasant. Seems they are stressed with too many people to care for.I would have liked an opportunity to move to a different seat ( even would have checked in my hand luggage)as I had health issues where I didn't have to clamber over the passenger next to me to for toilet use/ movement [ She was a highly unpleasant neighbor to sit next to]. In addition, I found that my European phone plan had run out of data and so I was not receiving emails from yourselves on airport wifi to be able to check in online and verifications difficult as did not accept the ticket number I had. I asked for an extra blanket but was told there was none. Then I saw other passengers receiving them. I couldn't eat the food and asked for snacks : Stewardess said " on the way" but they did not bring. The best bit was the check in process in Lisbon. Very efficient. However, I did not understand why we had to collect our bags at Washington then go through customs again. It was not explained. I also with my leg and health issue had approximately mile walk to the gate ( which then changed) . There appeared to be no moving walkways or help provided.The attendant were friendly. I suggest you have a medical attendant on board every flight so that in case someone is sick , he/she will help them.We had a very long diversion and our food voucher didn’t work because the restaurants were closedWe will be writing a long, detailed letter to corporate about our awful experience with American airlines.Food was ok, but not as good as I have had before on AA.Pretty good. The food was just mediocre, the boarding and crew were good.It was one of my worst flight ever. First they were changing the gate for at least 4 times, changing from gate D7 to D12 to D44. Considering the size of the Miami Airport, we are talking about long distance and the train at the airport was not working. Then the flight was delayed around one hour. Then finally we boarded into the plane and when everybody was seated, there was an announcement that there is an issue with one of the tire of the plane, so we all had to get out of the plane with our belongings, to replace the tire. So we had around 2.5-hour delayThe delays and cancellations kept me stuck in Miami for an additional 24 hours, and the whole thing seemed extremely disorganizedFlight was late and missed connecting flight. They could have better accommodated, but instead did an overnight and had to arrive the next afternoon.The boarding crew was incredibly helpful getting me on an earlier flightThe flight was delayed leaving Miami. When we arrived in Charlotte, we were unable to park at our scheduled gate. We had to wait another 30-45 minutes before we could park at a different gate. All in all, we were delayed by almost two hours arriving in Charlotte.the pilot that landed this flight in Philadelphia did an amazing job, the weather was absolutely terrible and we landed safely.AA can't control the weather. But the airplane was hot and stuffy while stuck on the runway with a broken entertainment system.I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.Changing the flight time to 6:15 am on the return flight is extremely inconvenient. The flight was okay. It was on time. The crew was friendly. The seats were uncomfortable. All the upsells are annoying, and I would prefer paying a single higher fee and not have to purchase so much extra.The flight was delayed twice with minimal explanation. The terminal and airplane were filthy. The food voucher didn’t even cover a tiny pizza from a kiosk in the terminal. All in all, a pretty miserable experience for a flight to attend a funeralI will use spirit more New clean aircraft Excellent crew ! Quick boarding process !The flight was delayed be over 3 hours. I tried to get a refund for Vivian Kirby and my session kept being stopped. I was NEVER able to finish the prosses...after 2 hours of attempting.For the minimalist experience, it is really a great ride-- feels a little like public transport i guessI didn’t mind being delayed due to weather, but continuing to post (and not update) that we would be delayed until after the flight was already supposed to have taken off was a bit much. In the future, please announce the delay even if the time is still unknown.This gate agents are always so rude! I stopped flirting with spirit years ago for that reason I thought it would change by now. It’s so tacky they try to treat you like a school child i hate itThe flight and boarding process was smooth. Wifi was unavailable and I prepaid for it. Have requested a refundSpirit is a very uncomfortable travel experience. It’s cheap but you are squeezed into the seats like canned meat.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Boarding in Orlando was not good. Giant mob at the gate, should have been lines.My flight was delayed by two hours which made it so that I would miss my layover flight. I stood in line for customer service for over an hour and when I reached the agent she told me to scan a QR code and it'll give me options. I wasn't offered any help, guidance or compensation, only told that I have options but that I had to figure it all out myself. I was refunded part of the trip and had to buy an expensive same day ticket from another airline in order to get home. I will never fly Frontier again.The confirmation # CK8GNW and my name was not recognized/in Frontier system. I was able to check in on Frintier app so i went to the Frontier ticket agent, at time they told me that my name/ confirmation did not show up as a purchased ticket. I had to purchase a new ticket that cost $289.00 one way.The worst. We never made our connection and they did absolutely nothing to help us at the airport.Although an hour and a half early was told by staff at check in they had overbooked and could not check us in for the flight.The crew was delayed because they came on another flight that was delayed due to weather 10pm flight left at 1.30 am The airline made no effort to align alternate crewWorst airline experience. They were rude and kept changing our seats and/or giving our seats away so our family didn’t get to sit with each other. Almost everyone we dealt with at both airports with this airline was rude. The app kept giving us wrong information making things take longer. Dealing with them before TSA can take close to an hour…longer than I’ve ever had to deal with before. Never using this airline again.Delta7.9United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Miami to Washington, D.C.AirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsMiami (MIA)Cabin class types available on flights from Miami to Washington, D.C.Cabin classes available on flights from Miami to Washington, D.C..
