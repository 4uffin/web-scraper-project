Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.If we are going to have to pay for luggage, make it easier to do. Put something on the app during check-in so I don't need to do it at the kiosk. I've done it twice recently and I ended up having to pay at the desk because something went wrong at the kiosk in Tampa.Everything was on time. I was disappointed by the front section female, African American flight attendant. I did not see her name tag or would have identified by name not race. As passengers moved to the bathroom early in flight, she would say with a disdainful tone “I have to say the seat belt light is on” then go back to her book. Better trained flight attendants say something like be careful the seat belt light is on.The price of the tickets isn't matching the flight experience. No matter how long the flight is, you're only getting pretzels. The flight attendants looked unkept and over it.WiFi on the flight was not working. Thus, entertainment options were limited.Flight was awfully bumpy and landing was a bit jolting. I was in the restroom when snacks and drinks were served and was not asked if i wanted any. I had to ask for water finally.Crew was great flight was great baggage claim was a failure. It took over 1 hour for bags to arrive. Poor communication poor effort when I spoke to the supervisor about the delayPlanes are aged. The wifi is unreliable and on many fights, no-existent. The flight attendants were very good.I had a wonderful flight, but the only thing that annoyed me was how crowded TSA was. I still believe airports and all planes work together to bunch everyone together to drive up cost.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.For a 69 year old with health problems I had the worse experience, no wheelchair when I entered a lady told me to sit and wait while a gentleman told me I had to walk to the Delta station, which I did. I had a carry on and a bag, and I was traveling with my service dog, which was on his carrier and the lady charged me for my carry on luggage, beside all the waiting cause of the delay, I had to walk to get my luggage cause no wheelchair showed up, I am so disappointed. I will get in touch with the company. I got home at 3:00 am, not good for my health situation.Flight was an hour late, who knows why. It was OK, nothing outstanding.Excellent check-in. Crew was good. Excellent communication from flight deck.Amazing flight! I have never noticed the uniforms of the attendants before in twenty years of flying except today when one female had the most amazing dress on. It was beautifully designed and showed she was in charge. I never dreamed I would google who designed Delta uniforms . The ultimate compliment is when another woman admires your outfit. . I hope your designer puts it on the marketThis had nothing to do with Delta… The flights were on time and flawless. The service was excellent. We purchased seats in (aisle/middle) comfort plus since this was a cross country flight. Unfortunately, the woman seated at the window was 300+ pounds and, as might be expected, covered up about a third of the middle seat also. there was absolutely nothing that Delta could have done about that… I just don’t know what the answer should be. If you purchase a seat, you should should be able to use the entire seat and not just the portion that someone else is not sitting/oozing in. Disappointing…there should be something that could be done….I'm just not sure what solution could be.Delta is a cut above the others in customer service.The worst part was I was NOT allowed in the lounge even though I was holding a first class ticket and have a premium American Express card. I have flown Business or First Class with many airlines. Delta is the ONLY one who does not extend this courtesy to anyone except people who hold the very expensive American Express card. As a result, I won’t fly Delta if I have any other choice.Simply outstanding. Their new lounge for Delta One customers is a cut above the rest.We will be writing a long, detailed letter to corporate about our awful experience with American airlines.Internet was a bit expensive and did not work ask that week otherwise a good flightRing in first class for an overnight flight, there was no blankets nor pillows for first class customers.Food was ok, but not as good as I have had before on AA.Pretty good. The food was just mediocre, the boarding and crew were good.Flight was delayed. Staff at the gate effectively and proactively communicated about the delay.It was very difficult to stretch my knee out and I am very short. I also had a torn tendon in my knee which made it extra uncomfortable anyways. My husband is 6'2" and I can't imagine him flying in that plane.I wish American Airlines would change the airline industry by loading the plane back to front instead of front to back. Planes would board so much more smoothly and quickly.It was one of my worst flight ever. First they were changing the gate for at least 4 times, changing from gate D7 to D12 to D44. Considering the size of the Miami Airport, we are talking about long distance and the train at the airport was not working. Then the flight was delayed around one hour. Then finally we boarded into the plane and when everybody was seated, there was an announcement that there is an issue with one of the tire of the plane, so we all had to get out of the plane with our belongings, to replace the tire. So we had around 2.5-hour delayI was late from Jacksonville, FL but the limited interaction I had with the Philly crew was great.very difficult boarding process - aggressive passengers not the friendliest crewWiFi was not eorkig (again) And the plane was from 1990 with the screens which were.not touch and most didn’t even work and if lucky could tune in tvIt was great. I had never flown on JetBlue before, but would be very happy to fly with them in the future.The captain gave good announcements and the flight attendants were friendly. The WiFi was pretty good. The plane itself looked very old inside and the seats were very uncomfortable. The screens in the seat backs were the smallest I’ve ever seen. There were so many loud and obnoxious kids on this flight and the parents didn’t do much to try to quiet them down. Some had videos and games on tablets with higher than necessary volume going the whole time.The plane was late to leave.. Internet was lousy. TV was not working. when we arrived, We stayed on the plane for a long time before we got to the gate. It took us a long time to retrieve our luggage because they didn’t know what carousel to send them to. It was a bad experience.There were mutliple delays. There was inconsistent, delayed, and poor communication regarding the delays.Spend hours delayed with no food, water anything sitting on the aieplane with no ability to eat or use the restroom. My entire experience was the absolute worst. I will never fly jet Blue again.It would have been nice if they had offered more than one set of snacksSeats were not too comfortable; it was impossible to locate the underseat power outlet.The check in and boarding process was a bit of a cluster. Two people at the counter to check in, three random lines that nobody knew which was for what, and people kept getting shuffled from one line to another for no apparent reason because then they’d get shuffled back and end up getting out further back in the line than they were originally. I only had to hand my already checked bag over and it took 45 minutes. I was never assigned a seat so when I tried to board I was pulled out of line again while someone had to try to manually assign me a seat. During the flight I got up to go to the bathroom, and there was an attendant in the aisle offering pillows etc and it was a 30 min wait unbuckled standing by the bathrooms because she said I couldn’t go past her. First and last time flying jet blue to be honest.Changing the flight time to 6:15 am on the return flight is extremely inconvenient. The flight was okay. It was on time. The crew was friendly. The seats were uncomfortable. All the upsells are annoying, and I would prefer paying a single higher fee and not have to purchase so much extra.The flight was delayed twice with minimal explanation. The terminal and airplane were filthy. The food voucher didn’t even cover a tiny pizza from a kiosk in the terminal. All in all, a pretty miserable experience for a flight to attend a funeralI will use spirit more New clean aircraft Excellent crew ! Quick boarding process !The flight was delayed be over 3 hours. I tried to get a refund for Vivian Kirby and my session kept being stopped. I was NEVER able to finish the prosses...after 2 hours of attempting.For the minimalist experience, it is really a great ride-- feels a little like public transport i guessI didn’t mind being delayed due to weather, but continuing to post (and not update) that we would be delayed until after the flight was already supposed to have taken off was a bit much. In the future, please announce the delay even if the time is still unknown.This gate agents are always so rude! I stopped flirting with spirit years ago for that reason I thought it would change by now. It’s so tacky they try to treat you like a school child i hate itThe flight and boarding process was smooth. Wifi was unavailable and I prepaid for it. Have requested a refundSpirit is a very uncomfortable travel experience. It’s cheap but you are squeezed into the seats like canned meat.Not great. Seats uncomfortable. Crew a little rude. Amenities like wifi and drinks way too expensive.Southwest8.0Delta7.9American Airlines7.2JetBlue7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Everything you need to know for your flight from Fort Myers to BostonAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsFort Myers (RSW)Boston (BOS)Cabin class types available on flights from Fort Myers to BostonCabin classes available on flights from Fort Myers to Boston.
