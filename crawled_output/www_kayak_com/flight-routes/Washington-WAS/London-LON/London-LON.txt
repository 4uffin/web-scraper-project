Boarding a bit slow due to process. Food was pretty average.8.0 ExcellentTim, Aug 2025IAD - MUCRead more United Airlines reviewsGreat service on board. Boarding a bit slow due to process. Food was pretty average.Very small cramped plane for an international flight. Everything else was good, but it was maybe the smallest comfort-wise I've ever been on for longer than 3-4 hours and the trip was 7.5Flight was delayed 3 hours. No food and drink vouchers was provided. They offered a mini pretzel bag and water .Staff was rude. Didn’t give water for 2 hours. Worst serviceWas on time until within 1 hour of flight-how does that happen? Staff very friendly.I liked the choice of lemon ginger tea. I think stewardesses can be more considerate of older people needs.Although the flight was delayed the crew and the flight itself were very good. Couldn't fault anything and after the disappointment of being abandoned in the US by BA it was a welcome relief to travel with UnitedWe were given vouchers we couldn’t use with a 5.5 hour delayI fly UAL 7-8 times per year. This flight was not up to snuff because it boarded very late "due to unexpected delays in restocking the plane" and yet Flight Aware showed the plane had landed some 10 hours earlier--so I think they could have planned accordingly. The FA's were nice but harried. The video system had to be rebooted 3-4 times. The food service was rather abrupt; they forgot my row and when I asked for my meal, they brought it with some impatience. Overall, the flight was fine, but the little details made it feel somewhat mundane and hurried.Liked fold flat bed. Didn’t like having no window. Didn’t like poor choice of food and being served dinner very late, hours after take off of a 7:40pm flight. Servers not friendly. Food horrible in business class.Handling our luggage was the biggest issue - they lost it and we got it almost 3 days later. Really threw off the beginning of our trip and we really had to change our itinerary accordingly.Seat was hard and uncomfortable and the temperature too warm and uncomfortable.Worst airline I’ve ever flown. Delayed 5.5 hrs, missed connecting flight, and missed an entire day of vacation. Zero customer serviceEverything sucked. No food, one small glass of water, a tiny coffee, 5.5 hour delay with no customer service. Would never recommend flying them.The crew was wonderful at check in, the gate and on board. Felt the luggage had more room than the passengers. The seats were smaller than most domestic U.S. airlines. I'm only 5'2" and I had little legroom. There were only 2 bathrooms in coach. Needed more. The flight was very smooth but not the most comfortable.There was no lounge at Boston for us to use. Typically flying first class overseas comes with lounge privileges. The seats did not recline even a little. My headset only worked on one side. I felt like I was flying on Ryan Air, not Icelandic Air.The flight was delayed and as a consequence we missed our connecting flight. Were stuck for another 6h in Reykyavik. Appreciated that we got a generous food voucher at least. Would have liked to see more information upon arrival including a person waiting for connecting flight travellers and informing already that we will not catch the flight and directing us to the office dealing with the matter; unfortunately that didnt happen and we hence first needed to find out whether flight had indeed left already and then locate the adequate office to help us with booking us on the next connecting flight. Also my suitcase broke and it is not clear whether it is happened on the leg with Iceland Air from DC to Reykyavik or on the leg with Lufthansa from Reykyavik to Frankfurt. Finally, understood that it is a low cost company but at least provision of earplugs for free would have been nice, instead of making them buy.Great experience on Icelandair flight from Newark to Amsterdam by way of Reykjavík. Courteous and professional staff. Food was solid. Service - outstanding. Cabin was a little warm.Good service. No complementary food for international flight. WiFi kinda pricey. Got the job done for the right price.Still one of my favorite airlines, but the entertainment options were a bit lacking. It didn't help that my screen didn't work on one of the legs of the trip.Excellent experience in every way, from ground crew helpfulness, boarding experience, inflight service all the way to modern equipment. My new favorite airline. I wish I could fly with them more often.For a no frills flight this was surprising comfortable. The crew were helpful and nice. The flight was smooth and there were no delays or issues which I haven't had on a flight in a long time. I would definitely fly with them again.The flight was canceled by play less than 24 hours prior to the trip, and I was unable to re-book. Have not received a refund for the trip despite filling out the appropriate form.Was was cancelled less than 24 hours prior to my scheduled departure by PLAY. Despite my attempts to rebook my travel, I encountered significant cost increases that rendered this option unfeasible. In accordance with EC Regulation 261/2004, airlines are required to issue a full refund for cancelled flights within seven days of the scheduled departure if a refund is requested instead of rebooking on another flight. It has been three weeks without a refund or an answerHave not recieved full refund for my flight, which was cancelled less than 24 hours prior to my scheduled departure by PLAY.

In accordance with EC Regulation 261/2004, airlines are required to issue a full refund for cancelled flights within seven days of the scheduled departure if a refund is requested instead of rebooking on another flight. This request was completed three weeks ago an answer or refund.It would have been better to have USB charging ports available on the longer haul Flight that one of 2 hoursWas very good Staff was great. No tv monitors tho. So long flights make it longerThe worst. No free beverages. No entertainment on an overseas flight. Not enough space. Never again.Play is affordable! Only way we fly from the states to Europe. Left late but arrived on timehave screens on backs of chairs...offer free snacks and waterIt was fortunate that the flight arrived in London in accordance with schedule, and the luggage was promptly transferred to the luggage carousel. However, I find it concerning that even minor issues in economy cabins are prevalent within the industry. American Airlines, in particular, appears to have the least legroom and feels more crowded due to the proximity of neighboring passengers. Additionally, the crew’s adherence to protocol is inconsistent. While they may enforce certain rules set by the FAA on a select few individuals, they often overlook numerous violations, such as failing to reset seat recline during landing.Easy and organized getting in and out of the flightWe liked the flight but while we purchased an aisle seat, our seats had a different configuration on this flight. A fellow passenger suggested that the airplane had been changed. Too bad we were not informed and had no chance to modify our seat preferences. We were stuck in the window and middle seats with no chance to walk around and go to the bathroom without disturbing our sleeping fellow passenger.The crew were not very personable. The crew did not serve tea or coffee. The bathroom was not kept clean. Two out of the 5 toilets in the cabin weren't working.It was extremely cold in the back of the plane. The seats are uncomfortable and space very small. Crew was excellent as usual.Check in needed to be in person, not nice. Also I won’t do connections in Charlotte again because you need to go through security again and short connections become a problemIberia lost my bag, said they found it in another country, said they sent it to me, but never did. Went my whole trip without my stuff, but expecting it to show up because that’s what they said would happen. Their communication sucks, their website sucks, and to top it all off, their seats are small and uncomfortable. They’re bad at their jobs and they should feel bad about themselves. Do not even get me started on the flight home. AVOID!I described my experience in the previous window. I didn't realize that there would be another opportunity for this flight. Please look at my response in the previous window.Boarding was 2 1/2 late no explanation Captain said he did not know why, but he rested at home for an extra couple of hours. Food was edible, Nothing more.I liked the comfort of the plane. It was unexpected from past experiences.Horrible… I was downgraded without notice, had to sit in economy and given my back injury was in pain most of the journey. I expect to be reimbursed for this inconvenience and after my return flight home, I never plan to fly with British Airways again.Great crew and food and beverage. Seating tight but not the airline's fault. Will definitely fly BA in future!The seating has become ridiculous… like a contest to see how narrow and short they can be made- forcing anyone over 5’1 to pay more to not be twisting oneself into a pretzel. Really insane- would have thought BA was better than this. Frankly- it cancels out a lot of the positive aspects.flight was delayed from BWI to London - missed my connecting flight & then connecting flight (also British Air) was delayed - food is awful, TV & movie selection is greatSuper tight economy class. My knees were hitting the back of seat in front of me (I'm only 5'6"). My small backpack (sized according to their required dimensions) would not fit under the seat in front of me because there is a box (is that the life jacket?) in the way. Over all, extremely uncomfortable. I forgive the tasteless food, but the tight seating was tortureDidn’t fly with them as someone had cancelled my flightOnline check-in 24 hours in advance something seems not so easy to check in to pick seats and to print a boarding passI like the crew, very welcoming. Food can be better. The seat arms don’t go up so. I could use the empty seat next to mine to relax better. 3hrs delay 😠Boarding was efficient and quick, crew was very attentive, seats were comfortable.Everything was very good!
