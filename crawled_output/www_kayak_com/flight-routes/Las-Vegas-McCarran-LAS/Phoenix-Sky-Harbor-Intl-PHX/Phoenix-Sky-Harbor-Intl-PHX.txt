Staff was outstanding!!10.0 ExcellentG, Sep 2025LAS - ATLRead more Southwest reviewsI wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Only one drink pass through the cabin for a 4 hour flight. Quite rough and bumpy landing.Employees were kind and funny, as always! Flight was late but no announcements were made for people with tight connections to help them transition quickly. No service due to turbulence.The movies using Southwest WiFi kept pausing and I had to restart multiple times.This was a nicer flight - not fully booked and so we were able to spread out.As smooth as you can expect. Some issues with boarding because the previous plane took forever to deplane but overall, a good experience.After a two hour delay, my flight was CANCELLED! No pilot available. Such BS.I miss the screens they used to have for the long flights. I use a Kendal and it doesn’t work well with there WiFi. I tried my cell and the wifi was not good for it either this is the free wifi.Update departure times in a more timely manner. We are not boarding on time if the plane isn’t arriving until after our scheduled departure time.Very friendly and efficient and smooth boarding. We were even way early arriving at my destination. Thank you.The trip was very smooth and they provided great customer serviceWe kept being told that the flight was full and that all overhead compartments were full and therefore had to check in our hand luggage. We were some of the last people to board and noticed that there was still sufficient space in the overhead compartments. We were obliged to check in hand luggage when there was space and so had to wait at luggage retrieval which took a while to then noticed damage to our luggage - not a great experience!The seats were crammed and the guy in front of me wouldn't stop reclining. If AA is cramming extra rows in, they need to take away the reclining in coach. My knees were smashed for 4 1/2 hours and I was very close to confronting the passenger in front of me.What, first class and not even a cup of coffee before landing at 5 am in First Class? Really?I paid for what I got which was cheap, I brought my own entertainment. I knew what to expect, so I could be prepared. If you’re flying economy, check in early like me. I have no problems with my flight, was on time, staff were friendly, and overall good experience.Spirit rescheduled a 4:30 PM flight to 8:52 AM. That's ridiculous and borderline fraud.The terminal crew is so rude cabin crew is extremely rude flight is very goodFlight was late, after my first leg was cancelled altogether causing me to spend $$$ with another carrier. Seating is ridiculously tight, I can't recommend spirit if I cant depend on them to get me there and back on time.Late departure by 1:45min. No explanation why. During boarding inconsistent policing of their baggage rules. Before takeoff and lamdimg strange obsession with window shade and armrest positions. Don't know why they care. 15 min tarmac delay on arrival, they blamed airport congestion but we were the o lh flight waiting, it was clear it was due to poor staff planning (only one ground crew to receive airplanes and multiple arrivals) Got there but was rrally lame the whole trip.One of worst experienc my family have every had with this airline. I was informed my Kayak that my flight was delayed and that my family will not make it to houston for our connecting flight. I contacted Spirit customer service to get my family on a later flight due to the delay in Vagas and them not making their connecting flight. The customer rep keep telling me that the flight from vagas is on time and not delayed. She even make to go to the spirit app on my phone and show me how to look up weather or not the flight was delayed. The app showed "on time" 20 minutes later when my family arrived at the airport for their flight, they were told that the flight was delayed and she will not make her connecting flight. I call spirit airline customer support again that night and spoke to another rep who apologize for his collegue and he told me that my family will receive a credit for this, this was on Saturday I still have not received the credit or an email letting me know when I will be credited for this inconvenience. This is not good business and it need to be fixed.Flight was cancelled. No reason given. No apologies. Next available flight is two days later. Ruined our 4th of July plans.Flight delayed over 3 or 4 hours because no captain to fly plane. I couldn’t make a connection and had to wait 9 hours for another flight. Had to fly red eye flight. SucksWe paid for upgrade seats (3A & 3B) the seats on front and the seats behind us got complimentary water & soda, but we got charged, had to pay for everything. Does not make any sense ?Horrible considering I didn’t go and I bought travel insurance and I didn’t receive a refund.Spirit gets you there; it's no worse than any other aircraft, all things considered. (It's not like everyone else is such a hero). But - holy moses - do they nickel and dime you to absolutely every nickel - I was really expecting to have to pay to use the bathroom. And when the captain comes on with a 5 minute sales pitch about getting "points", that was like something on Bizarro world. Other than that, everyone else was professional and worked hard to get us from point A to point B. I'm not loving all the "self-service" stuff but there it is - just when the machines don't work you don't have anyone to talk to.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.baggage clamed had to wait over a hour and half for all people on my flight it was terribleBoth legs of the flight were changed. The day of the flight and length of the trip.First of all, we never got on the connecting flight to Denver. They delayed our flight for two hours. If we would have gotten on that flight, we would have been stuck in Denver for 13 hours. So we re- routed our flight for a straight through flight to Oklahoma two days later. THEN, they delayed that flight for two hours. After that we were able to finally get on our flight and come home. Frontier Airlines - one of the worst airlines I have ever been on.Flight was delayed one hour. Notification to the crowd waiting near the gate was terrible…announcements were unclear and very hard to hear and therefore understand. Frontier does NOT send texts to notify, only email. The reader board over the gate itself was NEVER updated to indicate the gate had been changed. It’s like a bunch of children are running things.We’ve all seen the YouTube vids of out of control passengers. But this was an instance of a highly aggressive, bully flight attendant. Yelling in the face of a vet with PTSD who was texting their family. And no , we had not yet been instructed to put our phones in airplane mode. My suggestion is that you should pay whatever difference there is in order to avoid Frontier airlines. Additionally, after 3hrs trying to get customer service frontier offered a $25 voucher. I declined. This experience was so traumatic. To be verbally assaulted and abused by a flight attendant that has the power to say “boo” and I miss my flight ( which was to a family member’s funeral ). Frontier is unsafe and I cannot impress enough how much I discourage anyone ( esp those with any kind of disability like PTSD ) flying on Frontier.We had to wait in line over an hour just to check our bags. It's a good thing we were so early to the airport. Only one clerk was working and the line was around the corner and down the hall. No good. I felt bad for her. Not sure how she kept her sanity with all the upset people. Then we get to our gate and there is no seating. Everyone was standing. Then I realize it is not a gate at all, we still have to be shuttled to our airplane. Ugh. Then we were late taking off and missed a window of opportunity before the airport runways were shut down for some reason. (not frontier's fault the runway shut down.) The seats on the airline are crammed and there is no cushion. Never had a tighter seating arrangement while flying. My 6' 4" husband was absolutely miserable the whole time with knees digging in to the seat in front of him. You think you are getting a good deal on a ticket, and then wham! I had to pay 75 dollars for our checked bags and 75 dollars for a carry on. No other airline does that!!! And also, there is a 40 pound weight limit on checked bags... Would have been cheaper flying with another airline, and I would have at least gotten a snack and drink. Was thankful for the tiny cup of water at least.The worst flight of my life. Never will I fly frontier againThe plane was comfortable. The time to board was way too slow and very unorganized! The crew was not as friendly as normally. The was not a single time that they offered water nor anything!!!i was denied boarding, even though i had an assigned seat, checked in on line and was at airport early. Then they refused to fully refund the the fair and replacement fair because they claimed it was "no show/denied boarding". I will never fly this airline againSouthwest8.0American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Las Vegas to Sky Harbor IntlAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying to Las VegasFlight deals from the most popular airlines with KAYAK users flying the routeSpirit Airlines flights from Las Vegas to Phoenix Sky Harbor Intl AirportFrontier flights from Las Vegas to Phoenix Sky Harbor Intl AirportAmerican Airlines flights from Las Vegas to Phoenix Sky Harbor Intl AirportInformation on your arrival and departure airportsLas Vegas (LAS)Sky Harbor Intl (PHX)Cabin class types available on flights to Sky Harbor IntlCabin classes available on flights to Las Vegas.
