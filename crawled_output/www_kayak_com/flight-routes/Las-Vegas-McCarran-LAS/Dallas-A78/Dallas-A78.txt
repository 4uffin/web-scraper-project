Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!Multiple delays and gate changes. Arrived at final destination 6 hours late. All rental cars had been taken.The movies using Southwest WiFi kept pausing and I had to restart multiple times.This was a nicer flight - not fully booked and so we were able to spread out.Everything worked well. Crew was as entertaining as is possible on a plane flight. Southwest still has good legroom:A bit expensive for the overall service; but the flight departed on time and arrived early.What’s best is they have free 2 check in bags. Unlike budget airlines that knocks you off with fees just for you hand carried bagsBoard Milian spokesman with pre boarding , not after A group and without my spouse. Total BS, back to Alaska Airlibes I GO. oner 1.2M miles and 900 flights, and every time I fly SWA I regret it, thos will be last time, I only flew SWA but to time requirements fir a Funeral. NEVER AGAIN SWAThe crew was nice. Boarding sucked. Instead of loading from the back to the front people just sat wherever and you had to wait for them to move to get to a seat. And the flight was 25 minutes delayed.This was a train wreck with the schedule as soon as the delay was announced. The delay originally put us back by 40 minutes from a start time of 10:10AM, then later was revised to be only 27 minutes late. We began boarding only a few minutes late. I don't know what happened but we then left the gate over 45 minutes past our original start time of 10:10. Pilots did a great job of making up time (thank you for that), however upon arrival into the Dallas area, we circled several times, as there was a plane on the runway with mechanical problems, and didn't land and have the door opened until 1:46PM local time. I dashed to my connecting gate, fortunately only 4 gates away, and got there at 1:50PM local time. There were still people in line to board the jet way. The gate attendant made eye contact with me, left the check and station and promptly ushered the remaining people down the jet way, then returned to say the gate was closed and we were denied boarding. She then said I was already re-booked, not even knowing who I was. I did not receive notification of rebooking until 1:58 PM. At the desk we were then told that it was not their fault that our originating flight was late due to the stranded plane, and that the only compensation we could be offered was to be re-booked. I'm sorry, but at Love Field the ONLY airline there is Southwest, so yes, they ARE responsible for this! Also, choosig to deny me boarding even though I was in the queue 10 minutes prior to takeoff was an exceptional instance of very poor customer service. While I may not have many choices of airlines with flights originating from Albuquerque, Southwest is now last on my list!Cramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneThree seats in first class were broken and while they were able to still acommodate us it was looking very touch and go and they had others they could not acommodateFull flight so overhead bin space ran out & bags had to be checked. When you’re in the last boarding group, you might as well expect that. Don’t pay to check bags though because when they run out of space for carry-ons, they check your bag to your destination for free. When traveling with children, no need to pay extra for seats, they will assign seats & have to sit your children with you.American almost always Delays flights from Austin to Dallas and back. I cannot believe they have such poor service on this route. I was about to switch to American from Delta, but they gave me enough reasons not to.There's nothing I liked about it. For first off I scheduled this trip two weeks in advance then they delayed my flight which messed up my whole trip. So I scheduled it for the following weekend thinking there won't be a delay and guess what as soon as I got to the airport we said in the airplane on the tarmac for an hour and a half. Not only was it delayed I missed my connecting flight meaning I had to stay the night at Dallas-Fort Worth airport sleeping on the floor. I will tell you this I will never fly American airlines ever again I have had nothing but horrible experience with them and I just throw money at themHaving to reschedule flights a day later, they loaded by luggage on the wrong plane from Little rock now I have to HOPE they deliver it to where im staying like they said would. International flight crew was very disgruntled and not very friendly.The entertainment package was vast and the selections were very current. Keep updating it was great.Great flight. No issues at all. I still think boarding could be more efficient but otherwise, a good experience.4 hours late, including over +1 hour waiting in plane to take off. Baggage left behind too.Our flight was 1.5 hours delayed. There was no weather for the inbound flight, so I don't understand why. This meant a VERY late arrival and only a quick nap before my morning flight.It was very difficult to stretch my knee out and I am very short. I also had a torn tendon in my knee which made it extra uncomfortable anyways. My husband is 6'2" and I can't imagine him flying in that plane.Delayed flight, so I switched fights to SFO to Phoenix , Phoenix to DSM. Excellent service through American AirlinesSpirit rescheduled a 4:30 PM flight to 8:52 AM. That's ridiculous and borderline fraud.The terminal crew is so rude cabin crew is extremely rude flight is very goodFlight was late, after my first leg was cancelled altogether causing me to spend $$$ with another carrier. Seating is ridiculously tight, I can't recommend spirit if I cant depend on them to get me there and back on time.Late departure by 1:45min. No explanation why. During boarding inconsistent policing of their baggage rules. Before takeoff and lamdimg strange obsession with window shade and armrest positions. Don't know why they care. 15 min tarmac delay on arrival, they blamed airport congestion but we were the o lh flight waiting, it was clear it was due to poor staff planning (only one ground crew to receive airplanes and multiple arrivals) Got there but was rrally lame the whole trip.One of worst experienc my family have every had with this airline. I was informed my Kayak that my flight was delayed and that my family will not make it to houston for our connecting flight. I contacted Spirit customer service to get my family on a later flight due to the delay in Vagas and them not making their connecting flight. The customer rep keep telling me that the flight from vagas is on time and not delayed. She even make to go to the spirit app on my phone and show me how to look up weather or not the flight was delayed. The app showed "on time" 20 minutes later when my family arrived at the airport for their flight, they were told that the flight was delayed and she will not make her connecting flight. I call spirit airline customer support again that night and spoke to another rep who apologize for his collegue and he told me that my family will receive a credit for this, this was on Saturday I still have not received the credit or an email letting me know when I will be credited for this inconvenience. This is not good business and it need to be fixed.Flight was cancelled. No reason given. No apologies. Next available flight is two days later. Ruined our 4th of July plans.Flight delayed over 3 or 4 hours because no captain to fly plane. I couldn’t make a connection and had to wait 9 hours for another flight. Had to fly red eye flight. SucksWe paid for upgrade seats (3A & 3B) the seats on front and the seats behind us got complimentary water & soda, but we got charged, had to pay for everything. Does not make any sense ?Horrible considering I didn’t go and I bought travel insurance and I didn’t receive a refund.Spirit gets you there; it's no worse than any other aircraft, all things considered. (It's not like everyone else is such a hero). But - holy moses - do they nickel and dime you to absolutely every nickel - I was really expecting to have to pay to use the bathroom. And when the captain comes on with a 5 minute sales pitch about getting "points", that was like something on Bizarro world. Other than that, everyone else was professional and worked hard to get us from point A to point B. I'm not loving all the "self-service" stuff but there it is - just when the machines don't work you don't have anyone to talk to.baggage clamed had to wait over a hour and half for all people on my flight it was terribleMy flight was canceled I was promised a reginf still not received.Both legs of the flight were changed. The day of the flight and length of the trip.First of all, we never got on the connecting flight to Denver. They delayed our flight for two hours. If we would have gotten on that flight, we would have been stuck in Denver for 13 hours. So we re- routed our flight for a straight through flight to Oklahoma two days later. THEN, they delayed that flight for two hours. After that we were able to finally get on our flight and come home. Frontier Airlines - one of the worst airlines I have ever been on.The confirmation # CK8GNW and my name was not recognized/in Frontier system. I was able to check in on Frintier app so i went to the Frontier ticket agent, at time they told me that my name/ confirmation did not show up as a purchased ticket. I had to purchase a new ticket that cost $289.00 one way.Worst airline experience. They were rude and kept changing our seats and/or giving our seats away so our family didn’t get to sit with each other. Almost everyone we dealt with at both airports with this airline was rude. The app kept giving us wrong information making things take longer. Dealing with them before TSA can take close to an hour…longer than I’ve ever had to deal with before. Never using this airline again.It was a short flight so no food or entertainment….The worst flight of my life. Never will I fly frontier againThe plane was comfortable. The time to board was way too slow and very unorganized! The crew was not as friendly as normally. The was not a single time that they offered water nor anything!!!This was a full flight and I was in Zone 1, however upon boarding, several other zones went in ahead of me, leaving no overhead cabin space near my seat. This created a challenging disembarkment process.Southwest8.0Delta7.9American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Las Vegas to DallasAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsLas Vegas (LAS)Cabin class types available on flights from Las Vegas to DallasCabin classes available on flights from Las Vegas to Dallas.
