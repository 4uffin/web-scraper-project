As a consequence, I had to spend hours changing flights and hotel reservations to arrange my arrival to Vancouver.No Free Wifi and the flight was a tad late.The plane was clean. They got us to the destination. It was very difficult to hear the announcements at the gate. The person was speaking way too quickly, and the sound system did not carry to all parts of the seating area at the gate. The flight left more than an hour late, which left many of the passengers missing connections.The flights left both airports on schedule. The flight from Idaho Falls to Seattle was a typical commuter trip. The flight from Seattle to Maui was not good: It was too long for a flight in a single-aisle plane and too cramped. I kept asking myself if I would ever visit Maui again if airlines continue to run this long flight like a typical short commuter flight. I am not looking forward to the trip home.The chicken salad was very small, the lettuce was wilted and there was no flavor. The hamburger was excellent.Mid flight we were bothered by a bee. Kind of odd, but a bee allergy made it a bit stressful. Attendants passed by our aisle during service multiple times. Otherwise, it was fine.5 1/2 hour flight with no food service or options is inexcusable.Mostly good. Delayed which in my experience so far happens often with Alaska Airlines. Thank you.Excellent overall, but had to wait 30 months while taxiing. In fact, I’m still on the plane now!We received a check-in reminder the day before the flight, and it listed the flight at a later time. Correct flight number, same seats, etc. for 3 hours later. I called the airline to confirm and they had no record of the email. The info was wrong, and we would have missed our flight if we'd assumed it was correct. I want to know where/how we received this incorrect info.Lounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.De planning was an absolute mess. We were never told that we weren’t at the gate and that we had to go down unstable stairs and then hop on a bus. People were falling, we couldn’t tell who was in charge. Overall terrible communication that ended up leaving a bad impression at the very end of the experience.Check in process was terrible. Lady at counter didn’t know what she was doingDelayed and took off even later than the scheduled delay timeVery accommodating on flight changes when something came up. Definitely felt a notch above other airlines.Had a hard time checking into my flight on my phone because they gave me the wrong confirmation number. Otherwise everything else went well.First class ticket. They ran out of food and I sat hungry watching the others eatThey we able to seat my companion and I next to each other. Plane’s temperature was very cool. Willl be more prepared on return trip.All was good and they were able to seat my travel companion next to me. Thank you.Like the ample leg room. May as well not bother with snacks if it's only a two ounce bag of pretzels. Didn't use the entertainment option. Was there one?What an amazing flight. I haven’t experienced this level of service in a flight in years. This will be the only way to fly to Hawaii for me in the future.Kayak sold me a ticket after check in time. Could not check in. Could not get on flight.Love you guys are so friendly and kind and wonderfulAgents talk too fast over intercom. I know it’s memorized and we’ve all heard it before. Just slow down a little. Stop charging for checked bags. I was pleased to get my bags promptly at each end of my flight.Spirit rescheduled a 4:30 PM flight to 8:52 AM. That's ridiculous and borderline fraud.The terminal crew is so rude cabin crew is extremely rude flight is very goodFlight was late, after my first leg was cancelled altogether causing me to spend $$$ with another carrier. Seating is ridiculously tight, I can't recommend spirit if I cant depend on them to get me there and back on time.Late departure by 1:45min. No explanation why. During boarding inconsistent policing of their baggage rules. Before takeoff and lamdimg strange obsession with window shade and armrest positions. Don't know why they care. 15 min tarmac delay on arrival, they blamed airport congestion but we were the o lh flight waiting, it was clear it was due to poor staff planning (only one ground crew to receive airplanes and multiple arrivals) Got there but was rrally lame the whole trip.One of worst experienc my family have every had with this airline. I was informed my Kayak that my flight was delayed and that my family will not make it to houston for our connecting flight. I contacted Spirit customer service to get my family on a later flight due to the delay in Vagas and them not making their connecting flight. The customer rep keep telling me that the flight from vagas is on time and not delayed. She even make to go to the spirit app on my phone and show me how to look up weather or not the flight was delayed. The app showed "on time" 20 minutes later when my family arrived at the airport for their flight, they were told that the flight was delayed and she will not make her connecting flight. I call spirit airline customer support again that night and spoke to another rep who apologize for his collegue and he told me that my family will receive a credit for this, this was on Saturday I still have not received the credit or an email letting me know when I will be credited for this inconvenience. This is not good business and it need to be fixed.Flight was cancelled. No reason given. No apologies. Next available flight is two days later. Ruined our 4th of July plans.Flight delayed over 3 or 4 hours because no captain to fly plane. I couldn’t make a connection and had to wait 9 hours for another flight. Had to fly red eye flight. SucksWe paid for upgrade seats (3A & 3B) the seats on front and the seats behind us got complimentary water & soda, but we got charged, had to pay for everything. Does not make any sense ?Horrible considering I didn’t go and I bought travel insurance and I didn’t receive a refund.Spirit gets you there; it's no worse than any other aircraft, all things considered. (It's not like everyone else is such a hero). But - holy moses - do they nickel and dime you to absolutely every nickel - I was really expecting to have to pay to use the bathroom. And when the captain comes on with a 5 minute sales pitch about getting "points", that was like something on Bizarro world. Other than that, everyone else was professional and worked hard to get us from point A to point B. I'm not loving all the "self-service" stuff but there it is - just when the machines don't work you don't have anyone to talk to.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Alaska Airlines8.0Delta7.9Hawaiian Airlines7.8Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Las Vegas to SeattleAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Las Vegas to SeattleFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Las Vegas to Seattle according to KAYAK users.
