Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!Very smooth checking in our luggage with a super pleasant SW agent. I enjoyed a fun entertaining movie.First time traveling on Southwest since bag fees were implemented. Usual good service. Just more expensive now.It was a perfect flight in all aspects! Both legs!Boarding process, crew were good. But the seats were so uncomfortable that was all I could focus on. I literally had to sit forward so that all 3 of us could fit in row. I will try to avoid Southwest in the future for any flights over 60 minutes.Great flight, 47 passengers on a 180 seat plane. Stewardess was pleasant and cheerful.Great experience flying Southwest. The crew was really kind and helpful, and very friendly with our toddler.Plane late from DC to Austin 30 minutes. Crew made up much of the time enroute to San Diego.Fine, but how to board on SW versus othrr airlines, is just lame. Goood staff though and all was solid otherwise.The movies using Southwest WiFi kept pausing and I had to restart multiple times.The flight crew was friendly. I tried to adjust my seat online ahead of time but no option existed without additional fees. My friend asked at the gate about a seat change and was able to make it happen. That was great! The flight crew moved a very tall gentleman and his companion which allowed us to have more space which was nice. Overall, good experience. Appreciated the blanket and pillow.I was uncomfortably cold on the plane. Other than that it was uneventful and therefore as enjoyable as a plane ride can be.De planning was an absolute mess. We were never told that we weren’t at the gate and that we had to go down unstable stairs and then hop on a bus. People were falling, we couldn’t tell who was in charge. Overall terrible communication that ended up leaving a bad impression at the very end of the experience.Food was surprisingly good but the WiFi was not greatMy flight was extremely cold. I had a jacket and a cover was left in each seat. The cover was extremely thin and I have a disability, fibromyalgia and arthrithis and AC air is the worst. I closed my vent and my husbands vent and it still was frigid. I asked the attendant if I could get another cover and she quickly almost dismissively and totally unconcerned stating, (I quote) (one per chair) and walked off so quickly that I didn't get a chance to explain to her that I literally have adisability. I didnt want to make a seen so I set on that flight for over 5 hours in pain, joints locking up and extremely uncomfortable. When my fibromyalgia flares up my joints not only ache but they will lock up also and it takes me days to get back to my regular self even though I take medication for it. I felt like it would not have hurt anyone at all for her to just give me an extra cover because I'm sure they have all types of medical issues in people that fly every day.Not a "Delta" issue, but a JFK issue: We booked a connecting flight with 3 1/2 hours between to clearn immigration and customs. Our inbound flight (BCN to JFK) was on the taxiway 45 minutes which ate into our layover time. Immigtration was insanely quick with the CBP MPC app; however, clearing TSA (again, after we were ALREADY cleared in Spain on the inbound international flight) took over 95 minutes. This left us with 10 minutes before boarding the connecting flight (JFK to SAN) to walk to the far end of Terminal 4 and try to find food. We didn't find any food that could promise to serve us in under 10 minutes so we boarded the Delta flight after coming off a plance and an 8-hour flight knowing that we wouldn't be served any food on the next 5 1/2 hour flight. I feel like Delta needs to put pressure on the JFK TSA to open more screening stations (by our count, we saw only 5 scanners open and a line of - as we said - over 90 minutes. The insult is that we WERE ALREADY SCREENED through TSA, but as you come off one flight into the USA, you have to go through the whole process again. It seems like if you have a connecting flight, there should be a way to pass through immigration and customs without needing to return through TSA.There are 4 flights in consecutive gates with about the same departure time. Two flights were boarding at the same time. One was delayed or boarding would be happening at the same time. I am not sure what Delta and LAX need to do to have a better layout at the end of Terminal 25 hours of delay that could've been much shorter if Delta had taken the 1 hour delay they imposed on the flight before boarding to run any of the plane checks required for flight to find the hydraulic issue that required nearly 3 hours to fix. $24 of meal credit buys a sandwich and a soft drink. Poor communication within the terminal about what gate we'd be re-boarding from and when we'd be re-boarding.The entertainment and wifi mostly didn't work on this flight.Terrible entertainment system - kept freezing and audio kept cutting out. Snacks were mediocre at best for a 5 hour flight.Check in was quick and easy during early hours. Flight was on time, and customer services was a plus.I understand that the food on the airplane wouldn’t be fantastic. However, it wasn’t good at all. 😭The flight was comfortable with the exit row and great servicePlane was crowded and even when we hit altitude, the plane was hot, not enough air flow.Ok. Get a different kosher caterer. The food was odd.Wonderful and fast TSA checkpoint. The line was fast and our gate was close byWe tried to upgrade to economy premium but were told this was not possible as we had booked through United Airlines (and Air Canada was operating the flight). This seemed silly given there was ample space in economy premium. Additionally, we had to wait almost 1.5 hours upon arrival to taxi to the gate. Otherwise, the crew were very pleasant and passengers were friendly.Great. Food going from Australia to the US was better than other way around, but still needs improvement in terms of quality and quantity!!!I feel bad, but Swiss airlines is not an airlines I will ever fly again. Their cabins are basic, seats are extremely uncomfortable, crew is a hit or a miss with service. What's worse is how they make you feel they are there to make money and not make your travel needs be met or make your travel a pleasure. They charge for 2nd bags, seat selection and felt like a budget arinines frontier/spirit airline attitude and approach. Their business class is from the early 2000s, basic. Additionally, planes going to India, are old, falling apart and not maintained. Even the crew mentioned this is typical of the airline having older planes going to India. Panels detached and loose or stuck with duct tape, seats scruffed up and dirty, seatbelts roughed up. The scariest thing was when I saw a window panel next to where I was sitting loose and dangling. The crew mentioned it's only cosmetic and assured the integrity of the plane was inspected by the maintenance crew. This is where they confessed about planes going to India being old. I UNFORTUNATELY would NOT recommend Swiss airlines to anyone and will NEVER fly with them again!The ANA crew and their members were all extremely nice and caring. Shout out to the crews for working on Christmas and New Years. Y'all the real MVPCancelled my flight last minute and did not help me rebook. It was a horrible experience.Late departure by 1:45min. No explanation why. During boarding inconsistent policing of their baggage rules. Before takeoff and lamdimg strange obsession with window shade and armrest positions. Don't know why they care. 15 min tarmac delay on arrival, they blamed airport congestion but we were the o lh flight waiting, it was clear it was due to poor staff planning (only one ground crew to receive airplanes and multiple arrivals) Got there but was rrally lame the whole trip.Boarding was a breeze, however, two of the flights that I boarded with Spirit did not have Wi-Fi available.Very good. Nothing more or less than expected. No complaints.My experience with the spirit as a first time it was OK, but the seats need a little cushion, the problem I had the most impacted me was when checking in the scales were so off and wrong. It will tell that you would have more weight, which was not true. The scale was say that it had Thirty Eight Pounds, when get in the labels when we send the luggage into the band. It says that it was overweight. I really really dislike that because the scales are not accurate. If I use Spirit and I have that issue again. That will be my last time flying with the spirit, even though I like so much to service the planes, and everything elsehahaha we are delayed for one hour plus.. but thx we arrived San Diego safeWorst airline ever! The guy weighing my bag had his foot on the metal plate and when I called him out on it, I got this stupid little smirk. La is a scam and so is Spirit Airlines. All the flight attendants looked like they hated our flight just as much as we did.Spirit is awful. Too expensive for what you get. Stop nickel and diming.would be great to get basic water, soda at least and stop charging for carry onsYour crew is a representation of your Standards and Values. The crew from Seattle to LAX, was very disappointing. The crew was more interested in hanging out at the lobby area. Talking, laughing loudly and eating all the snacks. They did not do regular rounds to see if customers needed anything. This was a huge disappointment. I will no longer be flying with your airlines moving forward.I think Frontier was very good at communication. Their app worked very well. Loading was great and the flight was nice and easy.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.Decent clean onboard experience. Okay discount airline experience. Unfortunately, any customer service interactions are difficult and unhelpful. There is no service. Also, a premium seat only gets you premium boarding if you line up first. Once they start general boarding you must go to the back of the line. Not very premiumbaggage clamed had to wait over a hour and half for all people on my flight it was terribleBoth legs of the flight were changed. The day of the flight and length of the trip.First of all, we never got on the connecting flight to Denver. They delayed our flight for two hours. If we would have gotten on that flight, we would have been stuck in Denver for 13 hours. So we re- routed our flight for a straight through flight to Oklahoma two days later. THEN, they delayed that flight for two hours. After that we were able to finally get on our flight and come home. Frontier Airlines - one of the worst airlines I have ever been on.The crew was mostly okay. The flight attendant who answered our questions was curt and unhelpful unfortunately. He seemed upset and I understand having off days.Very bad! No good service delayed my second connection flightThey canceled flight. Hard to believe there was even a plane incoming for us to get onPlane was down graded and I lost my uncharged exit row with more leg room. No mention or offer of refund from podium. Flight attendant was nice to explain this happens often and that I could request a refund via online form submission. I did this and have heard nothing back.Southwest8.0Delta7.9United Airlines7.4Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Las Vegas to Los AngelesAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Las Vegas to Los AngelesFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Las Vegas to Los Angeles according to KAYAK users.
