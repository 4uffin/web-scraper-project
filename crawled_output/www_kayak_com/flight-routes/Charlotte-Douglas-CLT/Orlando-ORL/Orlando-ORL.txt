On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Always good but we must do something about people in rows ahead of you that don't put their seats back up when they are suppose to. And It's rough to not be able to even lean over to get something out of my purse.Flight was delayed, 30+ bags had to be gate checked. Crew were very friendly!this crew didn't care much. bumping carts into seats more times than i care to rememberEverything was fine except the entertainment was not working for half of the flight.Easy boarding with an extremely kind attendant. Seats were spacious and we had 3 seats for 2 people so we could stretch out. Comfortable air flow and very attentive and hospital attendants. Bathrooms and food were the only negative. Bathrooms were so small you could hardly get in and close the door. I don’t think an obese person would fit or a person with a movement disability. Food was the trending food for flights, nonexistent. We spent $40 getting sandwich and snack at airport for our 6 hour flught.I am very bothered by the events today. I can't believe the flight attendants allowed someone to take my seat and made me move. It was embarrassing. I was in the right. The lady just didn't want move. I can't believe delta would allow this to stand and disrespect my rights as a passenger. The lady complained about her leg and that she couldn't move. Firstly somehow she was able to make it to row 24. Not sure how much her leg could have hurt. Secondly, I'm in plenty of pain myself. I just finished chemotherapy a several weeks ago. My body is constantly sore. Yet deltas flight attendants didn't appropriately protect my rights. In the end they found me a seat on the plane but I want to understand how delta can operate this way. They in essence allowed a bully to get their way.Delta is my preferred airline. I've traveled with them for years. On time in most cases, good communication, easy to use app. Most planes are pretty nice. I was on a CRJ 700/900 however, which was pretty badly aged inside and needed a refresh. No infotainment, unreliable wifi, best to download before boarding or bring a book. Food choices are really just snacks on this flight, nice variety but about what you'd expect. Great staff and prompt in departure and early arrival too. Overall quite satisfied.Crew was friendly Love the entertainment in the seat head rest.The WiFi didn't seem as fast as it normally isSat on the ground in Cincinnati for 50 minutes before deplaningOverall fine, but the delay was annoying and the reasons for the delay were not communicated. The crew on board were phenomenal!Boarding was very efficient. Everyone got on board and we got on our way very quickly. It was frustrating that the entertainment app was not functioning properly. I was not able to activate some of the movies offered. The crew on this flight appears to be pretty grumpy. They had no smile on their faces. I felt like they were doing us a favor for being there.Delayed because of weather in Nashville. I think God or some higher power generally has cursed me when it comes to flying out of Charlotte on American. I'm delayed pretty much everytime. We need Team Cobra Kai types to come in and "sweep the leg(s)" of the Charlotte ops people on principle. Don't let the sweet southern rocking chairs fool you, Charlotte is a sinkholeLong 5 hour and 45 min flight and only one drink service and cookie snackNewark airport grounded inbound flight and only announced when the flight was about to start taxing.Terrible. The flight was delayed two hours due to weather. Then when we got on the plane, the first pilot ended up timing out and we had to wait for a second pilot. Second pile came on board and we tax it out. Had to return back to the gate because of an unruly passenger. Then the copilot timed out. Had to wait for new copilot. Also had to wait for maintenance to check for fuel. Then found out the second pilot timed out and we had to wait for a third pilot. Was ready to go and then needed maintenance again for another issue. In the end, it was 2 o’clock in the morning when they announced that the flight couldn’t go because the third pilot and the second copilot had timed out.American Airlines initially postponed the flight. Then they cancelled it an rescheduled us on a flight that would take over 24 hours with multiple stops. They then changed this flight to a reasonable alternative the next day which they later cancelled and replaced with a flight that would take off with an additional 16 hour delay. They blamed weather but I noticed (at 4am) that Delta had direct flights from Charlotte to Detroit. I went on line. Booked it and was in Detroit buy 9am. The interesting thing is they did a similar thing to a family member just 2 days earlier. I don't think I will fly American unless I have to.I was a little disappointed of not having an android charger. Only one it was for an iPhone. I've flown American in the past and had access to one.At least it was a short flight. Greyhound with wings.Crew was great. No entertainment and food and beverage was for purchase only, even waterIt was canceled. The flight wasn’t rescheduled, everyone had to figure out their own new arrangements. They said we would get refunded our original fare and receive an additional $150. We received links for $100 only and they expired before we could activate them.The plane had originated in Las Vegas at 6:30 in the morning and flew to Moline where we boarded. The flight left around 12:30 PM and there were no boxed snacks available and many of the alcoholic beverages were unavailable. I would find it hard to believe that that many of the passengers coming from Las Vegas at 6:30 in the morning, drank and ate that much of the items. I can only come to the conclusion that someone failed to stock the plane for the round-trip. This is a huge revenue failure for the airline and disappointment for the passengers. The flight crew did not seem happy to be there and did not engage with passengers. Allegiant you can do better.They did not let my husband on the plane with our service animal at the last minute. Do NOT fly this airline with a service animal!Tight! Seats are not designed for those of us who wear extra-large clothes.The non-stop flight from Grand Rapids was excellent. I neither expected or needed a budget flight and Allegiant made the trip easy and for an affordable price, Arriving at the Mesa Airport (AZA) is a delight compared to the international airport. For our return flight, we were able to arrive 75 minutes before the flight, return the rental car, check our bag and make it to the gate in plenty of time. That would never happen at most airports.Easiest flights I’ve ever taken. Plane was comfortable without overly crowded seating.Terrible. Still have not received the refund from them. They sent it to some account that I don't even know. Spoke with costumer service and they are unable to help.I didn’t like it at all. I miss my second flight because of the delay on Allegiant Air now I m stuck in MCO.Good, but a bit late on take off after loading. Don't like charging for carry ons!Don't board the plane and have us sit for 2 hours and go nowhere!I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.Wow truly top notch airline Efficient nice snacks courteous staff Fast boarding !My experience with Spirit was good, but the experience with Kayak was not. Based on the Spirit agent Kayak added an additional charge after purchasing the tickets. When I buy the tickets I paid the total amount and I only pay once. This time they added an additional charge because based on Spirit they partially charge the tickets and I still needed to pay a second time. This is not good at all and UnprofessionalSpirit gets such a bad rap. I have never had a bad experience with them and the crew is always friendly and funny. This trip I had knee replacement surgery surgery 10 weeks ago. It is still a little rough to get get from point a to point b. And Spirit was on top of it. When there was a seat available the stewardess asked me if I wanted to move to an open seat so I could elevate my leg on the empty seat? 5 stars all around. They helped me on and helped me off the plane. I can’t say enough about the crew!!One restroom was unavailable/closed on both routes, going to Charlotte and coming back to Detroit a week later.This was the first time I use Spirit Airlines and was pleasantly surprised. It was a last-minute booking and I was happy to see there was availability on your airline for a price that was affordable. The staff was friendly. The only things I thought were missing, were the ability to recline the seats, although I don’t use that very often, and it would’ve been nice to have power access at the seats to plug in my devices.Didn't like size of seats. Found charges for checked luggage and carry on too highPrepaid for 1 bag but my prior airline did not provide it to me in time to check it with Spirit and I could not get my $75 refunded.Plane delayed which seems to be the norm with spirt. Everything is an up charge. I had to pay an additional fee because I was late getting back to my car. Will never fly spirit againI was 2 hr arrive in the airport and 45 min in the line . After take to my turn . The agent tell me I’m later . I can not board . So my vacation was going to the floor . Just for their bad customer service agent in the airline2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.Since you have to pay for overhead bags then they shouldn't be running out of space and asking individuals who paid to remove stuff from the overheadBook with frontier airlines with the mentality that they'll cancel your flight, kick you off and lose your luggage. Anything besides that is a win. Compare prices with other airlines (to include luggage) and if frontier is still worth it, book it but know all of their policies.You get what you pay for nothing essentially but a hard uncomfortable seat that doesn’t recline and kids screaming all around you and chaotic boarding and limited check bag weight allowance when compared to other airlinesNot very good. Paid in excess of $400 for assigned seating for my family and that was not provided. I want that money back.I chose the seats when booked the flight and paid for them. However after checking in I found we were assigned different seats!It was a no frills flight. Would have liked to be able to charge my deviceSeats were extremely uncomfortable and it was very hot on the plane.Since they are a budget airline, I wasn’t expecting too much but they did some things well. They were on time, the plane was clean, boarding was fairly straightforward and the staff was cheerful and friendly. The only downside was comfort. The seats were fairly hard and after a 2 hour flight your rear end is not feeling so great. Maybe a little more cushion in the seats, Frontier!Delta7.9American Airlines7.2Allegiant Air7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Charlotte to OrlandoAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsCharlotte (CLT)Cabin class types available on flights from Charlotte to OrlandoCabin classes available on flights from Charlotte to Orlando.
