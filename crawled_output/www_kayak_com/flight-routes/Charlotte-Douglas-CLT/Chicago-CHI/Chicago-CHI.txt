The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye.

Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.Flight attendant in first class gave poor service (like he didn't want to be there) and food was awful. We sat waiting for gate upon arrival over 45 mins.Weather delay in Chicago?. No sense of urgency to make connection in Chicago for our connecting flight that wasn't delayed. Connection was missed.Overall it was good. I missed my connection but I was put on another flight.Overall a very poor experience - booked premium economy tickets but due to last minute flight delays , all my itinery went for a toss and had to fly economy class with no access to lounge or any compensation by united airlines to make up for the flight delays . i had expected better experience than that from united.United airlines, mediocre at best. No issues , nothing great . Worked for meIt was fine, definitely older planes with no charging or anything. There’s no entertainment set up on board, but it is nice that they allow you to access the in flight entertainment from your phone without having to pay for the Wi-Fi and they do offer free texting.I liked that the flight was nonstop from ORD to CIU for $200 round trip.While the staff was pleasant and helpful, the following observations are for your awareness. There was some delay on the tarmac on take off and landing. The paid lunch/food offerings were limited. Entertainment was only available on WiFi at a cost.The first flight was better in terms of the aircraft.Smooth flight. Boarding was chaotic. Could not hear the gate agent over the intercom. People were lined up in the wrong lines. Groups one and two were told to board through line one and group 3 through line 2. All very confusing. Once in the air, the flight was smooth. There was no entertainment option on this aircraft, even though it was a larger aircraft.Sat on the ground in Cincinnati for 50 minutes before deplaningOverall fine, but the delay was annoying and the reasons for the delay were not communicated. The crew on board were phenomenal!Boarding was very efficient. Everyone got on board and we got on our way very quickly. It was frustrating that the entertainment app was not functioning properly. I was not able to activate some of the movies offered. The crew on this flight appears to be pretty grumpy. They had no smile on their faces. I felt like they were doing us a favor for being there.Delayed because of weather in Nashville. I think God or some higher power generally has cursed me when it comes to flying out of Charlotte on American. I'm delayed pretty much everytime. We need Team Cobra Kai types to come in and "sweep the leg(s)" of the Charlotte ops people on principle. Don't let the sweet southern rocking chairs fool you, Charlotte is a sinkholeLong 5 hour and 45 min flight and only one drink service and cookie snackNewark airport grounded inbound flight and only announced when the flight was about to start taxing.Terrible. The flight was delayed two hours due to weather. Then when we got on the plane, the first pilot ended up timing out and we had to wait for a second pilot. Second pile came on board and we tax it out. Had to return back to the gate because of an unruly passenger. Then the copilot timed out. Had to wait for new copilot. Also had to wait for maintenance to check for fuel. Then found out the second pilot timed out and we had to wait for a third pilot. Was ready to go and then needed maintenance again for another issue. In the end, it was 2 o’clock in the morning when they announced that the flight couldn’t go because the third pilot and the second copilot had timed out.American Airlines initially postponed the flight. Then they cancelled it an rescheduled us on a flight that would take over 24 hours with multiple stops. They then changed this flight to a reasonable alternative the next day which they later cancelled and replaced with a flight that would take off with an additional 16 hour delay. They blamed weather but I noticed (at 4am) that Delta had direct flights from Charlotte to Detroit. I went on line. Booked it and was in Detroit buy 9am. The interesting thing is they did a similar thing to a family member just 2 days earlier. I don't think I will fly American unless I have to.I was a little disappointed of not having an android charger. Only one it was for an iPhone. I've flown American in the past and had access to one.At least it was a short flight. Greyhound with wings.Wow truly top notch airline Efficient nice snacks courteous staff Fast boarding !My experience with Spirit was good, but the experience with Kayak was not. Based on the Spirit agent Kayak added an additional charge after purchasing the tickets. When I buy the tickets I paid the total amount and I only pay once. This time they added an additional charge because based on Spirit they partially charge the tickets and I still needed to pay a second time. This is not good at all and UnprofessionalSpirit gets such a bad rap. I have never had a bad experience with them and the crew is always friendly and funny. This trip I had knee replacement surgery surgery 10 weeks ago. It is still a little rough to get get from point a to point b. And Spirit was on top of it. When there was a seat available the stewardess asked me if I wanted to move to an open seat so I could elevate my leg on the empty seat? 5 stars all around. They helped me on and helped me off the plane. I can’t say enough about the crew!!Just total easy flight experience!! What could you do better..? Hmmm..? There was nothing I can remember. Spirit was a far more comfortable and easy process than American, United & Delta. I'll always look for Spirit and I've told a few people about, since flying this past trip!! I'm a SPIRIT FAN!! Thank You, SPIRIT AIRLINES!! Very, VERY well done, 100%!! See you...SOON!! -Best, Linda R.Spirit is a very uncomfortable travel experience. It’s cheap but you are squeezed into the seats like canned meat.The seat belt was lengthy enough that I did not need an extender. Courteous and helpful flight attendants.As expected. Nothing jumps out at me as bad or wrong, but the flight was fine. No complaints with pilot or crew. The flight left on time and arrived earlier than stated. Overall, I will continue to plan on flying with Spirit.One restroom was unavailable/closed on both routes, going to Charlotte and coming back to Detroit a week later.This was the first time I use Spirit Airlines and was pleasantly surprised. It was a last-minute booking and I was happy to see there was availability on your airline for a price that was affordable. The staff was friendly. The only things I thought were missing, were the ability to recline the seats, although I don’t use that very often, and it would’ve been nice to have power access at the seats to plug in my devices.Horrible considering I didn’t go and I bought travel insurance and I didn’t receive a refund.Seats were new and comfortable. Staff was fine. Missed my connection due to weather -which wasn’t their fault- but got no help at all. Gate staff sent me to customer service, which was and stayed unstaffed. Sign with QR code directed me to call or chat. Chat was useless. Call was returned after an hour. No itinerary offered by Frontier could get me home in less than 30 hours. Rebooked with another airline and got a partial refund that came to about 10 percent of what I paid to get home.Finally a Frontier on time and efficient. I've had problems before with your airline, but this time everything went fine.The experience was good. No frills but I got there safe and sound and on time.Great for the price. No wifi or entertainment, but gate agents and crew were fantastic and we boarded quickly and left on time.sluggish boarding and arrival procedures, fake nice flight attendants, and lots of delays.Disaster. They lied every step of the way. We ended up being delayed due to crew and then allegedly abandoned the flight because of a curfew at LGA. No rebooking to LGA at any reasonable time. No hotel. No meal vouchers. Had to sleep in the airport and fly to Newark instead. Will never fly Frontier again.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.As every law enforcement agency I could imagine surrounded the plane and we didn’t disembark for 2 hours and then had to stick around for another hour to go get our personal belongings after leaving them behind and being bused away from the plane, it was scary and inconvenient. We were given no information as to why this was happening. Lack of communication with passengers was disappointing.After boarding and un-boarding twice over 6+hours, the flight was canceled.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.Southwest8.0United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Charlotte to ChicagoAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsCharlotte (CLT)Cabin class types available on flights from Charlotte to ChicagoCabin classes available on flights from Charlotte to Chicago.
