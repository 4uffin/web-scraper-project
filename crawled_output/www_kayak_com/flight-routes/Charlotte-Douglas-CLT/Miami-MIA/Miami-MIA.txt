The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!10.0 ExcellentG, Sep 2025LAS - ATLRead more Southwest reviewsI wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Always good but we must do something about people in rows ahead of you that don't put their seats back up when they are suppose to. And It's rough to not be able to even lean over to get something out of my purse.Flight was delayed, 30+ bags had to be gate checked. Crew were very friendly!this crew didn't care much. bumping carts into seats more times than i care to rememberEverything was fine except the entertainment was not working for half of the flight.Easy boarding with an extremely kind attendant. Seats were spacious and we had 3 seats for 2 people so we could stretch out. Comfortable air flow and very attentive and hospital attendants. Bathrooms and food were the only negative. Bathrooms were so small you could hardly get in and close the door. I don’t think an obese person would fit or a person with a movement disability. Food was the trending food for flights, nonexistent. We spent $40 getting sandwich and snack at airport for our 6 hour flught.I am very bothered by the events today. I can't believe the flight attendants allowed someone to take my seat and made me move. It was embarrassing. I was in the right. The lady just didn't want move. I can't believe delta would allow this to stand and disrespect my rights as a passenger. The lady complained about her leg and that she couldn't move. Firstly somehow she was able to make it to row 24. Not sure how much her leg could have hurt. Secondly, I'm in plenty of pain myself. I just finished chemotherapy a several weeks ago. My body is constantly sore. Yet deltas flight attendants didn't appropriately protect my rights. In the end they found me a seat on the plane but I want to understand how delta can operate this way. They in essence allowed a bully to get their way.Delta is my preferred airline. I've traveled with them for years. On time in most cases, good communication, easy to use app. Most planes are pretty nice. I was on a CRJ 700/900 however, which was pretty badly aged inside and needed a refresh. No infotainment, unreliable wifi, best to download before boarding or bring a book. Food choices are really just snacks on this flight, nice variety but about what you'd expect. Great staff and prompt in departure and early arrival too. Overall quite satisfied.Crew was friendly Love the entertainment in the seat head rest.The WiFi didn't seem as fast as it normally isWhile waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.This flight never occurred because AA couldn’t get their act together.During service there was a garbage/beverage spill near our seats that never was cleaned up. On a relatively short flight when we’re fortunate enough to actually have in flight movies available, the flight attendants pitching the AADVANTAGE credit card shouldn’t talk for the last 10 minutes of the flight so that we miss the end of the movie.The boarding was pretty easy. However, the first class seats are not lay flat as other airlines (like JetBlue) has and therefore sleeping was a challenge.Would have thought that they would gas up plane before everyone got on boardThe flights were terribly delayed and then cancelled which forced us booking another night at the hotel. Very poor management from American AirlinesCrew was late. Baggage was late. 2hs inside the plane waiting fro de-icing and traffic. A 3:30hs flight ended up being almost 6hs inside the airplane.Checking in at the counter was very disappointing. The lady had a very bad attitude and smart at me. She had no smile, did not greet me by name, or acknowledge me as a valued customer. Poor reflection of the airline.Miami lounges were overcrowded and we were unable to get in. We only had a short time. But the banks are too tight in all American hubsBoarded over an hour late, no communication, the sign just changed, no attendant to answer questions - she disappeared forever (hiding). Small plane and couldn’t hear the overhead nor understand.I never made my flight because of their poor service, as I said in my other review: I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm. My connecting flight was due to leave around 10:10 pm so there is no way I would have made the connection. I went back to the Spirit desk and tried to explain this to a desk agent who didn't understand. Eventually her supervisor came over and explained it. The desk agent was unhelpful and only offered options that would have required getting a hotel overnight. She offered no hotel or meal vouchers and when I said that it seemed my only option was to go to another airline she told me I needed to make a decision because they were closing the desk and would not be back till 3 pm. I went to Delta and had to pay extra but they could help get me back to Orlando. I now have to file a claim against Spirit and I am just glad I paid for insurance. Very unhappy and very poor service.I never made this flight. When I got to the airport I had a message to say that the flight was delayed and would be getting into Fort Lauderdale at 10 pm.

I'm ready for my Spirit flight.Wow truly top notch airline Efficient nice snacks courteous staff Fast boarding !My experience with Spirit was good, but the experience with Kayak was not. Based on the Spirit agent Kayak added an additional charge after purchasing the tickets. When I buy the tickets I paid the total amount and I only pay once. This time they added an additional charge because based on Spirit they partially charge the tickets and I still needed to pay a second time. This is not good at all and UnprofessionalSpirit gets such a bad rap. I have never had a bad experience with them and the crew is always friendly and funny. This trip I had knee replacement surgery surgery 10 weeks ago. It is still a little rough to get get from point a to point b. And Spirit was on top of it. When there was a seat available the stewardess asked me if I wanted to move to an open seat so I could elevate my leg on the empty seat? 5 stars all around. They helped me on and helped me off the plane. I can’t say enough about the crew!!This gate agents are always so rude! I stopped flirting with spirit years ago for that reason I thought it would change by now. It’s so tacky they try to treat you like a school child i hate itThe staff was very sarcastic, the flight was delayed. There was no wi-fi o any type of entertainment. The plane was dirty and we have to wait a long time for the luggage to come out.One restroom was unavailable/closed on both routes, going to Charlotte and coming back to Detroit a week later.Booked through kayak, everything seemed normal but when it came time to go, my flight ticket didn’t exist, so I had to purchase another set of tickets at the airport the day of the flight, for about double. When I reached kayaks customer service, they claimed no responsibility, and pushed me onto another 3rd party booking service, airfare assist, where I have had no luck getting any kind of help or refund. I’ve used kayak many times, but I’ll never again after I’ve been burned by this.I was 2 hr arrive in the airport and 45 min in the line . After take to my turn . The agent tell me I’m later . I can not board . So my vacation was going to the floor . Just for their bad customer service agent in the airline2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.Since you have to pay for overhead bags then they shouldn't be running out of space and asking individuals who paid to remove stuff from the overheadBook with frontier airlines with the mentality that they'll cancel your flight, kick you off and lose your luggage. Anything besides that is a win. Compare prices with other airlines (to include luggage) and if frontier is still worth it, book it but know all of their policies.You get what you pay for nothing essentially but a hard uncomfortable seat that doesn’t recline and kids screaming all around you and chaotic boarding and limited check bag weight allowance when compared to other airlinesNot very good. Paid in excess of $400 for assigned seating for my family and that was not provided. I want that money back.I chose the seats when booked the flight and paid for them. However after checking in I found we were assigned different seats!It was a no frills flight. Would have liked to be able to charge my deviceSeats were extremely uncomfortable and it was very hot on the plane.Since they are a budget airline, I wasn’t expecting too much but they did some things well. They were on time, the plane was clean, boarding was fairly straightforward and the staff was cheerful and friendly. The only downside was comfort. The seats were fairly hard and after a 2 hour flight your rear end is not feeling so great. Maybe a little more cushion in the seats, Frontier!Southwest8.0Delta7.9American Airlines7.2Spirit Airlines6.3Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Charlotte to MiamiAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsCharlotte (CLT)Miami (MIA)Cabin class types available on flights from Charlotte to MiamiCabin classes available on flights from Charlotte to Miami.
