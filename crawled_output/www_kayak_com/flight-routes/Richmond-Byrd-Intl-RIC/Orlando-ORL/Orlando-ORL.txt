The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!10.0 ExcellentG, Sep 2025LAS - ATLRead more Southwest reviewsI wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.They made us board and then deboard due to mechanical issue which delayed the departure by almost 2 hours and we barely made our connecting flight. These quality checks should've been done before boarding not after.Always good but we must do something about people in rows ahead of you that don't put their seats back up when they are suppose to. And It's rough to not be able to even lean over to get something out of my purse.this crew didn't care much. bumping carts into seats more times than i care to rememberEverything was fine except the entertainment was not working for half of the flight.Easy boarding with an extremely kind attendant. Seats were spacious and we had 3 seats for 2 people so we could stretch out. Comfortable air flow and very attentive and hospital attendants. Bathrooms and food were the only negative. Bathrooms were so small you could hardly get in and close the door. I don’t think an obese person would fit or a person with a movement disability. Food was the trending food for flights, nonexistent. We spent $40 getting sandwich and snack at airport for our 6 hour flught.I am very bothered by the events today. I can't believe the flight attendants allowed someone to take my seat and made me move. It was embarrassing. I was in the right. The lady just didn't want move. I can't believe delta would allow this to stand and disrespect my rights as a passenger. The lady complained about her leg and that she couldn't move. Firstly somehow she was able to make it to row 24. Not sure how much her leg could have hurt. Secondly, I'm in plenty of pain myself. I just finished chemotherapy a several weeks ago. My body is constantly sore. Yet deltas flight attendants didn't appropriately protect my rights. In the end they found me a seat on the plane but I want to understand how delta can operate this way. They in essence allowed a bully to get their way.Crew was friendly Love the entertainment in the seat head rest.Other then mechanical/ computer problem and 3.5 hours flight delay the flight was great. I guess that what happened when you fly an old airplane now a day.This was a code share Latam Airlines flight - everything very good except there was no seatback entertainmentDon't waste your money or points on first class. Delta first class is a joke. The seats were rickety, the food was awful, and nothing worked, wifi, my light, the power plug - and it was dirty - the fold out table was gross. For 2-3 hours, tough it out in Economy.Flight was delayed not sure why no explanation given and no apologies either. Otherwise the flight was fineWhile waiting to claim my checked luggage, I discovered the airline had lost it. After a long wait and inquiries, I discovered it was on another flight. Fortunately, the airline finally sent my luggage home.The flight had a delay that made me being in a real rush to take the second flight. The delay was almost for 2 hours. They moved us from gate to gate in 4 times. Once I arrived to Philadelphia, I got to run thorough all the airport, as the train was already closed by that time. So I got sick with asthma for all the running I had to do. And I was the last one to board, when it was almost closed. So irresponsable with the peopleFlight delays numerous times. Everytime we would get close to boarding it would be delayed again. Strung along the entire time.This flight never occurred because AA couldn’t get their act together.5.5 hour delay with no explanation on why, along with no proactive effort to reaccomodate me.During service there was a garbage/beverage spill near our seats that never was cleaned up. On a relatively short flight when we’re fortunate enough to actually have in flight movies available, the flight attendants pitching the AADVANTAGE credit card shouldn’t talk for the last 10 minutes of the flight so that we miss the end of the movie.Waited on the runway for takeoff for 2.5 hours. Air traffic rerouted us. The plane didn't have enough fuel, so had to go back to the gate. Had to wait for a new pilot. Should have landed at 5:22. Didn't land until 9:10. Trash flight.The boarding was pretty easy. However, the first class seats are not lay flat as other airlines (like JetBlue) has and therefore sleeping was a challenge.Everything about the flight was lovely…We left early, arrived early, cabin crew were efficient and helpful. Flight was easy and most pleasant.They have the most inexperienced / rude flight staff I’ve encounteredvery difficult boarding process - aggressive passengers not the friendliest crewWiFi was not eorkig (again) And the plane was from 1990 with the screens which were.not touch and most didn’t even work and if lucky could tune in tvI paid extra for a seat closer to the front. The TV didn’t work at all for the entire flight. Would have been nice to know before I purchased an “upgraded “ seatIt was great. I had never flown on JetBlue before, but would be very happy to fly with them in the future.My JetBlue experience was nice. The flights ran on time, the aircraft was clean and comfortable, and the flight attendants were attentive. My only issue, which is isolated to the low-cost (budget) option at JetBlue, is that the check in process makes the user feel that they have to buy their seats. The seats offered for purchase are upgrades from the budget seats you get (which are essentially the last seats remaining). The interface should not make it feel like you must purchase a seat.I especially liked the lead crew officer. His boarding and safety announcements were made with a bit of novelty and humor. The flight also left the gate 10 minutes early and we landed about 20 minutes early… It was a delightful flight…There were mutliple delays. There was inconsistent, delayed, and poor communication regarding the delays.Communication since no reason or explanation was given for 3 hrs delayExcellent. Although they used to greet me as a mosaic member and provide a free drink, early boarding helps me to keep coming back to JetBlue.My experience with Spirit was good, but the experience with Kayak was not. Based on the Spirit agent Kayak added an additional charge after purchasing the tickets. When I buy the tickets I paid the total amount and I only pay once. This time they added an additional charge because based on Spirit they partially charge the tickets and I still needed to pay a second time. This is not good at all and UnprofessionalSpirit gets such a bad rap. I have never had a bad experience with them and the crew is always friendly and funny. This trip I had knee replacement surgery surgery 10 weeks ago. It is still a little rough to get get from point a to point b. And Spirit was on top of it. When there was a seat available the stewardess asked me if I wanted to move to an open seat so I could elevate my leg on the empty seat? 5 stars all around. They helped me on and helped me off the plane. I can’t say enough about the crew!!It was absolutely awesome. The crew was welcoming to all, not just the first class. They were full of energy. The in-cabin music was an excellent choice, not boring like most airlines. We were ready for takeoff ahead of time. Pilots were great. Smooth takeoff and landing. The plane was beautiful and nicely cleaned. This was truly a fantastic flight. I fly Delta and American all the time. I was apprehensive about Spirit. I will definitely be looking for Spirit first. Thanks for a great experience.Prepaid for 1 bag but my prior airline did not provide it to me in time to check it with Spirit and I could not get my $75 refunded.Plane delayed which seems to be the norm with spirt. Everything is an up charge. I had to pay an additional fee because I was late getting back to my car. Will never fly spirit againIt was horrible. We were not allowed on the flight by spirit staff at the gate during boarding because I had a guitar. The same guitar I had at check in which I paid for and they said I can take it on the plane. We missed our flight, lost our luggage, and had to pay another $900 to rebook flights. Worst travel experience ever and spirit staff are the worst staff ever.The flight attendant spilled ice all down my leg and all over my suede boots and didn’t even apologize or anything. They just gave me a look like “what?!” Incredibly rude and dismissive. I saw them roll their eyes at other guests and even once yell at a lady with a baby.Terrible! They kept postponing and finally canceled our flight. They canceled so late. We had no other options but to drive to a different city and try to find a new flight to get onto our cruise. We still aren’t there yet and might not make it.Seats were comfortable but dont recline at all. Checkin online was easy but didnt provide a gate until last minute. Flight attendants were very unkind, not friendly and didnt go over safety procedures in case of a crash. No free snacks or beverages, not even water.The booking was cancelled the next day. Spirit Airlines refunded Kayak cheapflay the full amount, but I was only refunded half. Costumer service is disgusting. Be careful.
