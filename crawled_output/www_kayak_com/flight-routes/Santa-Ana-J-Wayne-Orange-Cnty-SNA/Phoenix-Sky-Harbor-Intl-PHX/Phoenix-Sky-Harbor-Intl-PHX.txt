Lovely flight attendants and comfortable plane. The second leg left a lot to be desired. The flight attendant was rude when I asked for a Diet Coke, the boarding required quite a long walk and the plane was crammed and uncomfortable.Flight attendant was awful, I felt second hand embarrassment with every one of her interactions with people onboard. She was so incredibly rude every chance she gotI had a horrible and traumatic bullying experience the last time I flew ( frontier). I was incredibly anxious about these flights. However, it was so relaxed, organized and the crew was efficient and polite. It was so refreshing and relaxing.Didn't care for the crowding at the gate area at SEA TAC. Not a fault of the airline.I recently flew with Alaska Airlines on a trip to Oregon and had a very frustrating experience that I hope the airline can learn from. I purchased upgraded seats with extra legroom for my flight, paying the additional fees for the comfort and space. During my trip planning, I called customer service to inquire about their pet travel policies and conditions, as I was considering bringing my dogs. However, I ultimately decided NOT to bring my pets and never authorized or confirmed any pet travel arrangements. Despite this, Alaska Airlines took it upon themselves to change my seat assignment without any notification or contact. When I arrived for my flight, I discovered that my paid upgrade had been downgraded to a regular seat - presumably because they assumed I would be traveling with pets based on my inquiry call. I hope Alaska Airlines will improve their communication processes and ensure that customer inquiries don’t automatically trigger booking changes without explicit customer authorization. Better staff training on distinguishing between inquiries and actual bookings would prevent this type of situation in the future. While I appreciate that the airline tries to accommodate pet travelers, making assumptions and changes without customer consent is poor service that needs to be addressed.Flight was delayed and hour due to tire issue. First flight of the day, this issue should have been discovered prior to boarding.Canceled flight. No communication of this prior. Rescheduled to next day. Our good seats we purchased months ago turned into last row middle. No apology, reason, nor compensation for time and $ spent.I got the last seat on the plane, in the back in the corner against the window, and I paid a competitive price for my ticket several weeks before the flight.OUr pilot was very good and also a good landing in a very gusting Phoenix. Most important.Flight attendant took my carefully folded coat and flung it across the aisle to the bin across the way. Where one of the passengers rescued it for me, because that just wasn’t right!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Delayed flight. Nicest crew member was a SW pilot flying seated next to me who kindly move to seat the final passenger. Flight extra delayed. My cup of refreshment of ginger ale was so packed with ice it was literally 2 sips.No trays in our seats, we sat in first row, purchased a business class fare. Had to hold our drinks and snack in our hands. No plugs for our cell phones. Had to pay for it a drink cocktail each. Seats so uncomfortable.Flight wasn’t even full, but too many carry-ons caused us to run out of bin space. New bag fee has folks who would usually check their bags carrying on. Watching Southwest morph into Spirit/Frontier is so sad to watchSouthwest is Southwest. No frills. If you're luck enough to get a happy crew (we did), then it makes for a nicer flight.It was a perfect flight in all aspects! Both legs!Only one drink pass through the cabin for a 4 hour flight. Quite rough and bumpy landing.Great flight, 47 passengers on a 180 seat plane. Stewardess was pleasant and cheerful.As smooth as you can expect. Some issues with boarding because the previous plane took forever to deplane but overall, a good experience.After a two hour delay, my flight was CANCELLED! No pilot available. Such BS.I miss the screens they used to have for the long flights. I use a Kendal and it doesn’t work well with there WiFi. I tried my cell and the wifi was not good for it either this is the free wifi.Update departure times in a more timely manner. We are not boarding on time if the plane isn’t arriving until after our scheduled departure time.Very friendly and efficient and smooth boarding. We were even way early arriving at my destination. Thank you.The trip was very smooth and they provided great customer serviceWe kept being told that the flight was full and that all overhead compartments were full and therefore had to check in our hand luggage. We were some of the last people to board and noticed that there was still sufficient space in the overhead compartments. We were obliged to check in hand luggage when there was space and so had to wait at luggage retrieval which took a while to then noticed damage to our luggage - not a great experience!The seats were crammed and the guy in front of me wouldn't stop reclining. If AA is cramming extra rows in, they need to take away the reclining in coach. My knees were smashed for 4 1/2 hours and I was very close to confronting the passenger in front of me.What, first class and not even a cup of coffee before landing at 5 am in First Class? Really?I paid for what I got which was cheap, I brought my own entertainment. I knew what to expect, so I could be prepared. If you’re flying economy, check in early like me. I have no problems with my flight, was on time, staff were friendly, and overall good experience.Spirit Airlines was ok but TRAVELHELPDESK, the 3rd party travel agent IS A JOKE! VERY RUDE CUSTOMER AGENTS ont he phone. NO HELP AT ALL. But the airlines was ok.No frills - because you get what you pay for. The crew was amazing!! I had plenty of room to spread out because the flight was half full. Which made it easy to sleep.The staff was very very rude in Las Vegas when boarding the flight. When presenting the boarding ticket. Las Vegas flight, it was hot and stuffy, it smelled really bad.Dear All, I have harassment and accident with the flight attendant . This is my phone to talk 8168073567, please, leave phone message . Regards Emily,Flight was on time but the amount of noise from several children and the kicking of my seat the entire flight was overwhelming.Unbelievable check in horrible. Asked to print tickets at the gate after a delaycheck in at security was a hassle being scanned. Spirit employees were helpful and professional.Had a issue with catching flight due to airline, was unable to board flightI liked how cheap it was but both my flights were delayed heavilyIt was okay delay was long but I made itFlight was delayed one hour. Notification to the crowd waiting near the gate was terrible…announcements were unclear and very hard to hear and therefore understand. Frontier does NOT send texts to notify, only email. The reader board over the gate itself was NEVER updated to indicate the gate had been changed. It’s like a bunch of children are running things.We’ve all seen the YouTube vids of out of control passengers. But this was an instance of a highly aggressive, bully flight attendant. Yelling in the face of a vet with PTSD who was texting their family. And no , we had not yet been instructed to put our phones in airplane mode. My suggestion is that you should pay whatever difference there is in order to avoid Frontier airlines. Additionally, after 3hrs trying to get customer service frontier offered a $25 voucher. I declined. This experience was so traumatic. To be verbally assaulted and abused by a flight attendant that has the power to say “boo” and I miss my flight ( which was to a family member’s funeral ). Frontier is unsafe and I cannot impress enough how much I discourage anyone ( esp those with any kind of disability like PTSD ) flying on Frontier.We had to wait in line over an hour just to check our bags. It's a good thing we were so early to the airport. Only one clerk was working and the line was around the corner and down the hall. No good. I felt bad for her. Not sure how she kept her sanity with all the upset people. Then we get to our gate and there is no seating. Everyone was standing. Then I realize it is not a gate at all, we still have to be shuttled to our airplane. Ugh. Then we were late taking off and missed a window of opportunity before the airport runways were shut down for some reason. (not frontier's fault the runway shut down.) The seats on the airline are crammed and there is no cushion. Never had a tighter seating arrangement while flying. My 6' 4" husband was absolutely miserable the whole time with knees digging in to the seat in front of him. You think you are getting a good deal on a ticket, and then wham! I had to pay 75 dollars for our checked bags and 75 dollars for a carry on. No other airline does that!!! And also, there is a 40 pound weight limit on checked bags... Would have been cheaper flying with another airline, and I would have at least gotten a snack and drink. Was thankful for the tiny cup of water at least.Cancelled flight after I arrived at airport after 75 min drive and parking. Next flight was 4 days in the future. Had to scramble and buy a much more expensive flight on another carrier.I liked the turn-style feature at gate 209B at LAX. Very efficient process. The gate staff also made several, clearly directed announcements so I felt very informed.The seats were awful, hard plastic covered in sheet vinyl. The airline tries to scam you into paying extra to get seat together when the flight wasn’t full. They were going to separate a family with young children but my wife who had a row to herself gave up her seat so the young mom could be with her young boys. I’m never giving this airline my money again.It was a short flight so no food or entertainment….i was denied boarding, even though i had an assigned seat, checked in on line and was at airport early. Then they refused to fully refund the the fair and replacement fair because they claimed it was "no show/denied boarding". I will never fly this airline againFrontier had yet another flight cancellation. Have never made a complete round trip with this airline without at least one leg getting cancelled. Miserable flights - dirty, uncomfortable planes that apparently always have issues since I've had multiple delays and cancellations with them.Flight was delayed 3 times, would have been nice to have received text message instead of email notifications. Frontier app wasn’t even updated accordingly, no gate number disclosed. No agent at front desk of gate to inform of delay.
