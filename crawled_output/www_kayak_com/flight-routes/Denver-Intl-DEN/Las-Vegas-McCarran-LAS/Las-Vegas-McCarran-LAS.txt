No effort was made to provide equal treatment to passengers with overhead bin space. Crew seemed disengaged and unfriendly.The pilot performed the smoothest landing I’ve ever experienced. What a light touch. And I’m an avid traveler!Much better experience than at SeaTac. No one yelled….all nice The microphone was working for boarding….unlike SeaTac BIGGEST BUMMER….GOT SEATED BACK BY THE BATHROOMS AND YOU IT SMELLED THE WHOLE TRIP. A BLESSING….is they … Left the lights and air on until we were unloaded….UNLIKE SEATAC TO ST. LOUIS….THEY TURNED THE LIGHTS AND AIR OFF IN ALMOST 100 degree weather…IT SUCKED!Alaska is the best! I had my own row, complimentary wine, friendly flight attendants, free texting, and early arrival. Coach felt like 1st class. What more could I ask for?Plane seats are comfortable and seemed more roomy than others I have been on. Playing was clean and flight crew friendly. Passengers who have a connecting flight should however be allowed off the plane firstThe flight was good, but your car partner, Wisecars, was worse thane awful. They didn't have an agent nor had they inform me which car rental they were supposed to have issued a voucher.Excellent, I traveled with my adult mom, she was happy for your service, especially, because you helped her with the reel chair. Only a little thing, in the airplane to Boise, the seat was very worn.flights on time, flights that were leaving when scheduled..having the alaska people on the phone and most of all getting rid of the new atmos website it is terrible!!!!!!!!Everything went well with all aspects of the flight. Honestly, if fares continue to compete with SW (which I always used to fly) I will fly Alaska if I can.6 hour flight, just crackers and drinks. No WiFi, no tv, and tight seats. Just like every other airline.As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.WiFi did not work. For as outrageous as these flights cost, when they’re advertised with certain services/ features they should be in working orderFlight wasn’t even full, but too many carry-ons caused us to run out of bin space. New bag fee has folks who would usually check their bags carrying on. Watching Southwest morph into Spirit/Frontier is so sad to watchI would have liked to arrive on time - not 5 hours late!1.5 hour delay, poor service, no compassion from the crew. Terrible experienceVery good. Sad to learn Southwest is going start to charge for bagsOur flight was diverted from being a non-stop to getting within 150 miles and requiring another plane. We heard 4 or 5 different versions from SW as to why we had to stop, then wait for a replacement plane. Five hour delay, weather did not come up as a single excuse.... communication was not clear and well explained. No one really took charge!Great flight staff. Ease of boarding. Overall, very uneventful and easy trip.I really like open seating. I hate that I've heard this is going away. This is one of the unique things that makes Southwest my goto choice.We had a nice flight. Boarding was easy, our seats were comfortable and the on board service was pleasant.Cramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneThree seats in first class were broken and while they were able to still acommodate us it was looking very touch and go and they had others they could not acommodateTerrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..Impressed with the service despite turbulence because of the weather. Both flights arrived before their scheduled times.Great experience…left a bit behind schedule but made up fir that in the air and landed 10 minutes early 😁Electric plugs didn't work. Entertainment system wasn't workingThe design of the light switch on the arm rest is ridiculous.The gate attendant let me walk right by her with a bag too big for the overhead compartmentMy priority checked bag was not loaded on the flight. I had to sit in baggage claim in Las Vegas for 2 1/2 hours waiting for the next flight. All baggage staff were very helpful, tracking showed it as scanned for loading. Nobody told me why it wasn't on my flight.First class felt like economy, seats were horrible, food was horrible, staff inattentiveOverall, it was a good experience. Boarding was good and there was plenty of overhead bin space for everyone’s carryons (even when we boarded toward the end). Only improvement would be to offer trash service more regularly.David went above and beyond to make our flight the best that it could beFrontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.Boarding in Orlando was not good. Giant mob at the gate, should have been lines.The ticketing agents were rude but then we had a great gate agent very nice we had to ride a buss out to where the plane was parked but it was in some back corner of the airport when we got to the plane the captain who was great btw was cleaning the plane because the same rude ticketing agent told them they we not contracted to vacuum the plane. The ride to las Vegas was fine We had a connecting flight to Dallas. The flight was fine but when we arrived in Dallas everyone who flew on any frontier airlines the picked up bags from baggage claim D15 had to wait over a hour for their bags to start we arrived at 11:30pm ish to the gate we didn't leave the baggage clamed till 12:50 am very not happy and i used to fly frontier 4 times a week for work in Denver i will not be using them againI missed a flight because of a delay. I had to buy a new ticket through Southwest.I’m not gonna fly Frontier Airlines because booking is not an option. No water or food is for high price, not equipped for health emergency incompetent crew for emergency services. Cheap airline shows it is cheaper in all service categories. Boarding is the best of all airlines!My flight was delayed by two hours which made it so that I would miss my layover flight. I stood in line for customer service for over an hour and when I reached the agent she told me to scan a QR code and it'll give me options. I wasn't offered any help, guidance or compensation, only told that I have options but that I had to figure it all out myself. I was refunded part of the trip and had to buy an expensive same day ticket from another airline in order to get home. I will never fly Frontier again.Very bad! No good service delayed my second connection flightFrontier is terrible. Paid for exit row, not given exit row, refused to refund fee.2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.Alaska Airlines8.0Southwest8.0Delta7.9United Airlines7.4Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Denver to Las VegasAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Denver to Las VegasFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Denver to Las Vegas according to KAYAK users.
