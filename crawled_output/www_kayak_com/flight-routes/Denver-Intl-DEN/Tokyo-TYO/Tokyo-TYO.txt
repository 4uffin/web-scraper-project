Only the fish entree in the Japanese meal was overcooked and quite dry but everything else was greatGreat first time experience on this airline. Very professional staff and great service.Warm the bread. Movies: better choices to include Chinese movies options or some of the older winners of flim festivalBusiness class on ANA was awesome. There lie flat seats made it easier to sleep on a 12 hour flight. Food was great and service was excellent.The crew was very nice and polite. They made sure everybody got their meal and drinks. Even the economy class had a very adequate leg room for someone that is over 6 foot tall.Overall it was good. Making changes to the reservation on ANA’s website was little challenging. Would like to see those features improved in the future.The flight crew was outstanding. Very cheerful and always respectful. I wish the same could be said about United. The AC wasn't the best on the plane.The seats are uncomfortable. The flight attendants are not pleasant. They do their job, but not with a ray of sunshine and warmth. The food was awful, not what I would expect from an Asian airline. All of the other Asian airlines I have flown have far better food. The food was on par with United airlines food, which is really bad. Maybe ANA should get out of the alliance with United.During booking, I selected the seats so that my wife and I would sit next to each other. However, the airline changed our seats at boarding so that we were seated apart. Very disappointing.Every leg of the flight was late causing us to miss our flight to Okinawa and have to take the next flight out.They closed boarding too early. They made me pay extra to continue flying with them. Their customer service is non-responsive. I used to love Alaska Airlines, but they've definitely regressed.Seattle airport terminal was a nightmare to navigate. Coming g off a cruise boat etc. Lack of convient Restrooms a major issue. Once able to get to boarding Alaska Air it was good experience.Good. Night flight so tried to sleep most of the time. Very nice crew and smooth flight.Everything was great, your crew is always very pleasant. Your airplanes are always so cold though.They cancelled like the flight at midnight, seven hours before the departure. Terrible.I don’t want to pay extra to choose my seatFlight was smooth, pleasant passengers and crew. Enjoyed the experienceSeaTac airport hottible No signage to tell you where to go Took one and half hour to make to gate after being dropped at airport HORRIBLE LOTS OF yelling at patrons EXTREMELY HORRIBLE AND SCARY!Appreciated the upgrade on the saver ticket. Made the 5 hour flight bearable.The vibe and energy of the Alaska staff on ground in Redmond is some of the best we’ve seen!Lounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The airport was reasonably clean. The boarding process reasonably efficient. The cabin crew was efficient, polite but not that friendly. The food quality was unremarkable and the choices were awful . There was either a so so chicken dish or a “ vegetarian “ option which was really cheap carbohydrates drowned in cheese. Signing onto i flight wifi was not straightforward. Overall it was a very average experienceThe staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPassengers need to check in big baggage instead of bringing on the plane. That cause inconvenience for everyone. Otherwise flight was good.Perfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.The food was terrible especially for a 15 hour international flight. The crew was unpleasant as well.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Quick check in. Everything went smooth. I don't know what can be done about airline food.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Terrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..Impressed with the service despite turbulence because of the weather. Both flights arrived before their scheduled times.Great experience…left a bit behind schedule but made up fir that in the air and landed 10 minutes early 😁The seat and leg room was not good. The food and beverage service was good.For economy, it was very good. Staff was great, they even let some of us change seats for more leg room... Put an empty seat between us which was fantastic for a 12hr flight. Onboard entertainment was excellent, I think over 200 choices of movies/tv/etc The bad was the barely/nonfunctional wifi that cost either $16.99 or 1700 miles (full flight). It was atrocious... Definitely the worst of the last 3 long haul major airlines I was on the last few months.Electric plugs didn't work. Entertainment system wasn't workingThe design of the light switch on the arm rest is ridiculous.The gate attendant let me walk right by her with a bag too big for the overhead compartmentSeats were comfortable. It’s was so cold and very uncomfortable. I paid 2000 miles for wifi service that was choppy the whole flight. Would like to be reimbursed for my miles Food was so disappointing. Three cold and terrible meals for $3000 round trip. This needs to be better.Very good - being handicap it was very hard for me in a center aisle bulkhead seat that Zi was assigned think it was 29-G as I had a hard time opening the entertainment screen and tray table. 30-G would have maid it easier. I was assign 29-G as it was the only handicap seat without being charged even though I was handicap (disability)Not to out myself as both a child at heart and kind of a terrible person, but the Pokémon safety video was the first time I watched an airplane safety video in like a decade. It was ADORABLE!! A great way to encourage attention from young and old alike.Seamless! Long but the seat back entertainment kept us all busy the whole time! Meals were excellent! Crew fantastic! Very attentive!We had a very long delay. First the inbound flight took a while, then maintenance, they “fixed it” to then do boarding and leave the gate, and waste a lot of time to have to go back to the gate and eventually deplane. Had to wait for a new aircraft, wait for a gate, and do the whole thing again. Instead of leaving at 9:50am we left until past 1. I could’ve not woken up at 5am, or spend some more time with my family if they gave more grace period of time between flights to give some time in case of any issues. But they have to make all and every dollar possibleComfortable seats and movies entertainment available. Better experience than the flight from Toronto to Denver.It was delayed by almost 90 minutes and that messed up our plans but it was beyond UA’s control that is what we heardThe whole experience what excellent, from Anjou at the ticket counter to the attendants on the flight. Although it was an older plane, it was a very good flight. One of the best flights I have had on Air Canada!Terrible experience. Flight was delayed then canceled. They had no clue how to rebook us. Had to wait in line to take to a gate agent for 2 hours. Absolutely terrible from start to finish.Most expensive flight… and they are trying to pinch more and more money out of you. Baggage, snacks, pillows, headphones… — so many airlines do far better than this… surely a national airline can do better?Economy middle seat was so narrow that I could not sit back comfortably with passengers on either side of me. Over the 9-hour flight, with my body slightly twisted most of that time, my previously-healthy left knee became very painful, even though I got up to walk multiple times. The knee is still painful 3 weeks later. Otherwise, it was a nice flight, but I was crippled over my entire vacation.Overcharged by either United or Air Canada.
