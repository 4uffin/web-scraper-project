Honestly, if fares continue to compete with SW (which I always used to fly) I will fly Alaska if I can.Don’t cancel the flight, had to spend a whole day sitting in the airport.They closed boarding too early. They made me pay extra to continue flying with them. Their customer service is non-responsive. I used to love Alaska Airlines, but they've definitely regressed.My flight was delayed 2 hours which led me to lose my connection. As a consequence, I had to spend hours changing flights and hotel reservations to arrange my arrival to Vancouver.No Free Wifi and the flight was a tad late.The plane was clean. They got us to the destination. It was very difficult to hear the announcements at the gate. The person was speaking way too quickly, and the sound system did not carry to all parts of the seating area at the gate. The flight left more than an hour late, which left many of the passengers missing connections.The flights left both airports on schedule. The flight from Idaho Falls to Seattle was a typical commuter trip. The flight from Seattle to Maui was not good: It was too long for a flight in a single-aisle plane and too cramped. I kept asking myself if I would ever visit Maui again if airlines continue to run this long flight like a typical short commuter flight. I am not looking forward to the trip home.The chicken salad was very small, the lettuce was wilted and there was no flavor. The hamburger was excellent.Mid flight we were bothered by a bee. Kind of odd, but a bee allergy made it a bit stressful. Attendants passed by our aisle during service multiple times. Otherwise, it was fine.5 1/2 hour flight with no food service or options is inexcusable.Cramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.Mechanic delay in addition to a 2 hour change in takeoff time was frustrating.The seats got pretty uncomfortable pretty fast. The armrests are bigger than on other planes, so I had less room in the actual seat. My butt hurt by the end of the flight. :/ comfort was the primary issue. The crew were fantastic!We got surprised and switched to Alaska airline. Dirtiest tray and seats I have ever board on and we travel all the time. Help desk would not help by chat as I'm disabled to get my sets assigned tell me call Hawaiian air. I call Hawaiian air was told the flights RT are by Alaska. Make it short, worse flights of our life.Would have been better if the flight went out as scheduled and we’d have been kept informed. Rescheduling the connecting flight out of Portland was especially difficult.Very accommodating on flight changes when something came up. Definitely felt a notch above other airlines.Had a hard time checking into my flight on my phone because they gave me the wrong confirmation number. Otherwise everything else went well.First class ticket. They ran out of food and I sat hungry watching the others eatThey we able to seat my companion and I next to each other. Plane’s temperature was very cool. Willl be more prepared on return trip.All was good and they were able to seat my travel companion next to me. Thank you.Like the ample leg room. May as well not bother with snacks if it's only a two ounce bag of pretzels. Didn't use the entertainment option. Was there one?What an amazing flight. I haven’t experienced this level of service in a flight in years. This will be the only way to fly to Hawaii for me in the future.Kayak sold me a ticket after check in time. Could not check in. Could not get on flight.Terrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..it was so bad. I tried to board my flight from vancouver to saskatoon. And to my surprise they did not board me cause the flight was changed and no email was send to me. and on my boarding pass which i got from seattle says different flight. I did not knew anyone from Vancouver, air canada crew was rude, i asked for today flight but they were rude and i had early morning dental appointment in saskatoon. I was so much in pain and my whole day is wasted today. and i suffered alot. They did provide me hotel but they did not provide me any food. I am really really disappointed first time had so bad experience with air canada. I may think twice to book it again. If i can get any reply or any composition that would be great. ThanksImpressed with the service despite turbulence because of the weather. Both flights arrived before their scheduled times.Great experience…left a bit behind schedule but made up fir that in the air and landed 10 minutes early 😁Electric plugs didn't work. Entertainment system wasn't workingThe design of the light switch on the arm rest is ridiculous.leg space better than expected. two washrooms for one plane isn't enough.The gate attendant let me walk right by her with a bag too big for the overhead compartmentThe seats on this flight were almost roomy enough to be the basic amount needed for human existence. I think my favorite part of this flight was it landed at an A gate, which was the most palatial part of Sea-Tac I've ever seen - a massive improvement from the S gates.Overall, it was a good experience. Boarding was good and there was plenty of overhead bin space for everyone’s carryons (even when we boarded toward the end). Only improvement would be to offer trash service more regularly.Frontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.I’m not gonna fly Frontier Airlines because booking is not an option. No water or food is for high price, not equipped for health emergency incompetent crew for emergency services. Cheap airline shows it is cheaper in all service categories. Boarding is the best of all airlines!Very bad! No good service delayed my second connection flightFrontier is terrible. Paid for exit row, not given exit row, refused to refund fee.2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.The worst. We never made our connection and they did absolutely nothing to help us at the airport.I never got to experience the flight because they delayed my first flight and I missed this one. Then Frontier didn't want to help me rebook a flight to get me to my final destination.The Boarding process in Denver was chaotic, and since the line was so long, we were lined up very far from the gate. If there were any announcements from the gate staff, we didn't hear them. The flight attendants were spectacular. The only negative part of the flight was sitting by a 2 1/2 year old who was unruly and unfortunately had parents that matched his behaviors. Also, the restaurants in Denver on the E concourse, they didn't have food (passengers could only order 1 item on the entire menu) or the restaurants had 12-14 people waiting for orders to be prepared and another 6 people waiting to order. If you have a layover in Denver and need to grab food, be prepared to visit the shops with pre-packaged sandwiches, or you can visit another concourse but it may take a while to transit throughout the airport.Everything went as planned. Crew was great. Seats were still not that comfortable.Alaska Airlines8.0Delta7.9Hawaiian Airlines7.8United Airlines7.4Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Denver to SeattleAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Denver to SeattleFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Denver to Seattle according to KAYAK users.
