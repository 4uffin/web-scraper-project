For as outrageous as these flights cost, when they’re advertised with certain services/ features they should be in working orderI would have liked to arrive on time - not 5 hours late!1.5 hour delay, poor service, no compassion from the crew. Terrible experienceOur flight was diverted from being a non-stop to getting within 150 miles and requiring another plane. We heard 4 or 5 different versions from SW as to why we had to stop, then wait for a replacement plane. Five hour delay, weather did not come up as a single excuse.... communication was not clear and well explained. No one really took charge!I really like open seating. I hate that I've heard this is going away. This is one of the unique things that makes Southwest my goto choice.Multiple delays and gate changes. Arrived at final destination 6 hours late. All rental cars had been taken.The movies using Southwest WiFi kept pausing and I had to restart multiple times.First, my flight was a usual flight nothing exceptional or unexpected. Over all it was a normal, good flight! Second, your questionaire is wholly lacking in the proper options to which one can answer a question. Often on short flights, there is no food let alone entertainment so why isn't that reflected in your questionaire? A simple "not applicable" would cover that issue appropriately but no, your form arbitrarily enters an answer based on the initial assessment which normally isn't factual. Until you provide an accurate means of assessing flights, I'll no longer be completing of these unimpressive and misleading assessements. Thank you!Easy to book and to get check in and get on and off.It seems as though the provisions are even less. Although SWA used to be an economy Airline, that isn't really the case anymore. I paid over $700. for a round trip to Denver and I could have flown just about any airline for the price. The drinks are now in a 6-ounce cup and with ice I'm sure a can would fill more than 2 cups. However, I am very proud of SWA for using paper rather than continuing to contribute to the millions of plastic cups being used each day. I've thought of this fr many years and am so glad to see it come to fruition, if not by only SWA so far.Terrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..Impressed with the service despite turbulence because of the weather. Both flights arrived before their scheduled times.Great experience…left a bit behind schedule but made up fir that in the air and landed 10 minutes early 😁Electric plugs didn't work. Entertainment system wasn't workingThe design of the light switch on the arm rest is ridiculous.The gate attendant let me walk right by her with a bag too big for the overhead compartmentOverall, it was a good experience. Boarding was good and there was plenty of overhead bin space for everyone’s carryons (even when we boarded toward the end). Only improvement would be to offer trash service more regularly.David went above and beyond to make our flight the best that it could beNo food service almost missed because of first flight delaysHad a hard time finding my assigned seat. No attendants to assist.Full flight so overhead bin space ran out & bags had to be checked. When you’re in the last boarding group, you might as well expect that. Don’t pay to check bags though because when they run out of space for carry-ons, they check your bag to your destination for free. When traveling with children, no need to pay extra for seats, they will assign seats & have to sit your children with you.American almost always Delays flights from Austin to Dallas and back. I cannot believe they have such poor service on this route. I was about to switch to American from Delta, but they gave me enough reasons not to.There's nothing I liked about it. For first off I scheduled this trip two weeks in advance then they delayed my flight which messed up my whole trip. So I scheduled it for the following weekend thinking there won't be a delay and guess what as soon as I got to the airport we said in the airplane on the tarmac for an hour and a half. Not only was it delayed I missed my connecting flight meaning I had to stay the night at Dallas-Fort Worth airport sleeping on the floor. I will tell you this I will never fly American airlines ever again I have had nothing but horrible experience with them and I just throw money at themDon’t know they cancelled the flight day before I was to leave. They sent a email at 9:00 pm at night saying they cancelled. That is the smooth way to say we don’t want your business! I think they didn’t have enough people booking so they cancelled the flight! It’s all about the money anymore there is no honesty in business.Having to reschedule flights a day later, they loaded by luggage on the wrong plane from Little rock now I have to HOPE they deliver it to where im staying like they said would. International flight crew was very disgruntled and not very friendly.The entertainment package was vast and the selections were very current. Keep updating it was great.Great flight. No issues at all. I still think boarding could be more efficient but otherwise, a good experience.4 hours late, including over +1 hour waiting in plane to take off. Baggage left behind too.Our flight was 1.5 hours delayed. There was no weather for the inbound flight, so I don't understand why. This meant a VERY late arrival and only a quick nap before my morning flight.It was very difficult to stretch my knee out and I am very short. I also had a torn tendon in my knee which made it extra uncomfortable anyways. My husband is 6'2" and I can't imagine him flying in that plane.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.baggage clamed had to wait over a hour and half for all people on my flight it was terribleI’m not gonna fly Frontier Airlines because booking is not an option. No water or food is for high price, not equipped for health emergency incompetent crew for emergency services. Cheap airline shows it is cheaper in all service categories. Boarding is the best of all airlines!Very bad! No good service delayed my second connection flightThe confirmation # CK8GNW and my name was not recognized/in Frontier system. I was able to check in on Frintier app so i went to the Frontier ticket agent, at time they told me that my name/ confirmation did not show up as a purchased ticket. I had to purchase a new ticket that cost $289.00 one way.Frontier is terrible. Paid for exit row, not given exit row, refused to refund fee.2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.The worst. We never made our connection and they did absolutely nothing to help us at the airport.I never got to experience the flight because they delayed my first flight and I missed this one. Then Frontier didn't want to help me rebook a flight to get me to my final destination.The Boarding process in Denver was chaotic, and since the line was so long, we were lined up very far from the gate. If there were any announcements from the gate staff, we didn't hear them. The flight attendants were spectacular. The only negative part of the flight was sitting by a 2 1/2 year old who was unruly and unfortunately had parents that matched his behaviors. Also, the restaurants in Denver on the E concourse, they didn't have food (passengers could only order 1 item on the entire menu) or the restaurants had 12-14 people waiting for orders to be prepared and another 6 people waiting to order. If you have a layover in Denver and need to grab food, be prepared to visit the shops with pre-packaged sandwiches, or you can visit another concourse but it may take a while to transit throughout the airport.Southwest8.0United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Denver to DallasAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsDenver (DEN)Cabin class types available on flights from Denver to DallasCabin classes available on flights from Denver to Dallas.
