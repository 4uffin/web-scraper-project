I had my own row, complimentary wine, friendly flight attendants, free texting, and early arrival. Coach felt like 1st class. What more could I ask for?The flight was good, but your car partner, Wisecars, was worse thane awful. They didn't have an agent nor had they inform me which car rental they were supposed to have issued a voucher.Good. Night flight so tried to sleep most of the time. Very nice crew and smooth flight.The first leg of the trip was excellent. Lovely flight attendants and comfortable plane. The second leg left a lot to be desired. The flight attendant was rude when I asked for a Diet Coke, the boarding required quite a long walk and the plane was crammed and uncomfortable.Planes were on time. Pilot kept everyone updated. Crew was friendly and helpfulYou no longer give receipts for baggage at the counter. And it is next to impossible to get it on your webpage. Spent 20 min trying and gave up... I need receipt to submit for reimbursement and don't have time to waste on your poor webpage Disappointing .....The flight attendants were unkempt and show no customer service skills. They avoided eye contact. There were no smiles and they were dismissive and snarky.Complete flight rebooked and 6 hours delayed. Zero accountability from the airline or Kayak for the issues and I’m injured which is why I opted to pay more to fly than drive because it’s painful to sit or stand too long. What was supposed to be a 3ish hour travel day turned into a 9 hour excruciatingly painful experience that has left me in worse pain than when I initially started.It was a good flight, short so there was no food or water serviceChecking in very confusing compared to Hawaiian Airlines - much simpler! Front checking in at airport can improve. Hawaiian service always gives the extra mile, with a smile. Alaska can use and spread the Aloha Spirit. Mahalo nui loa Thank you 🤙I wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.Amazing all female crew, including the pilot. Great flight attendants and smooth trip. Food was good. Boarding the plane from back to front would have made things significantly smoother. Took forever to wait for people to clear the alley. A little extra leg room would be nice also. Please thank your flight crew!The flight was great. But the problem is we actually booked a flight with Hawaiian Airlines. We even received a Hawaiian Airlines confirmation number. So this made it really difficult to check in the online. So I had to call Hawaiian Airlines to get our Alaskan Airlines confirmation code to check in. Also weren’t told we were flying on Alaskan, but once we got on the plane, everything went well!We decided to take our mom on vacation but we were worried how well she will do on the flight, she's a senior and required special accommodations such as transport chair since she can't stand for long periods. To our surprise my whole family was given priority boarding, my mom was given chair, we were not standing in line and were given seats in good area next to our mom. A+ experience!I understand that both Hawaiian and Alaskan are in the process of merging but I could not get real-time flight info or access my boarding pass on either appWe got surprised and switched to Alaska airline. Dirtiest tray and seats I have ever board on and we travel all the time. Help desk would not help by chat as I'm disabled to get my sets assigned tell me call Hawaiian air. I call Hawaiian air was told the flights RT are by Alaska. Make it short, worse flights of our life.Would have been better if the flight went out as scheduled and we’d have been kept informed. Rescheduling the connecting flight out of Portland was especially difficult.Very accommodating on flight changes when something came up. Definitely felt a notch above other airlines.Had a hard time checking into my flight on my phone because they gave me the wrong confirmation number. Otherwise everything else went well.First class ticket. They ran out of food and I sat hungry watching the others eatThey we able to seat my companion and I next to each other. Plane’s temperature was very cool. Willl be more prepared on return trip.Terrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..Impressed with the service despite turbulence because of the weather. Both flights arrived before their scheduled times.Great experience…left a bit behind schedule but made up fir that in the air and landed 10 minutes early 😁Electric plugs didn't work. Entertainment system wasn't workingThe design of the light switch on the arm rest is ridiculous.The gate attendant let me walk right by her with a bag too big for the overhead compartmentOverall, it was a good experience. Boarding was good and there was plenty of overhead bin space for everyone’s carryons (even when we boarded toward the end). Only improvement would be to offer trash service more regularly.David went above and beyond to make our flight the best that it could beNo food service almost missed because of first flight delaysHad a hard time finding my assigned seat. No attendants to assist.Frontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.The delay was ridiculous because nary a word escaped from the gate attendant regarding our flight status. It was a complete joke.I’m not gonna fly Frontier Airlines because booking is not an option. No water or food is for high price, not equipped for health emergency incompetent crew for emergency services. Cheap airline shows it is cheaper in all service categories. Boarding is the best of all airlines!Very bad! No good service delayed my second connection flightFrontier is terrible. Paid for exit row, not given exit row, refused to refund fee.2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.The worst. We never made our connection and they did absolutely nothing to help us at the airport.I never got to experience the flight because they delayed my first flight and I missed this one. Then Frontier didn't want to help me rebook a flight to get me to my final destination.The Boarding process in Denver was chaotic, and since the line was so long, we were lined up very far from the gate. If there were any announcements from the gate staff, we didn't hear them. The flight attendants were spectacular. The only negative part of the flight was sitting by a 2 1/2 year old who was unruly and unfortunately had parents that matched his behaviors. Also, the restaurants in Denver on the E concourse, they didn't have food (passengers could only order 1 item on the entire menu) or the restaurants had 12-14 people waiting for orders to be prepared and another 6 people waiting to order. If you have a layover in Denver and need to grab food, be prepared to visit the shops with pre-packaged sandwiches, or you can visit another concourse but it may take a while to transit throughout the airport.Alaska Airlines8.0Southwest8.0Hawaiian Airlines7.8United Airlines7.4Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Denver to PortlandAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Denver to PortlandFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Denver to Portland according to KAYAK users.
