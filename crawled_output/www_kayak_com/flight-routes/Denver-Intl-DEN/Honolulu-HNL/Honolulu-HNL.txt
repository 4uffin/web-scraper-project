We had to ask for water on second pass as we were going to be missed again.Terrible. Would never fly again. Took them several hours to prepare the plane and and reached my destination 4 hours late.Terrible. 4 hour flight delay and seats were so tiny and cramp that I had no where to put my legs.Our boarding was delayed due to two flat tires, but I appreciate the focus on safety. I also appreciated the additional offerings for drinks which never happened before except on Hawaiian Airlines. The hospitality is fantastic! Glad I upgraded to premium seats for the extra leg room as I was getting frustrated when the person in front of me was very restless and kept shifting. Otherwise, it was a fantastic experience.Had to sit and wait to get off the plane for closeto a hour. My son also flying to a different destination that day also had like a 2.5 hr delayTickets we booked together in January became two different connecting flights. VERY PISSED a about this and a terrible start to our bucket list vacationCould not check in online - had to get boarding passes at the ticket counter and our daughter got bumped off our connecting flight. NOT OK!I needed more space to sleep on an overnight flight.Our flight time was drastically changed which caused us to lose a day of vacationWonderful respectful staff for a short flight late at night...lots of considerations all met!I wish they had movie screens in the headrests. The seats are much improved, more legroom and recently renovated. Bathroom was clean. Staff was outstanding!!As always, the entire Southwest experience was wonderful, from online booking to flight to baggage retrieval. Very grateful.The weather could have been better. There was a 40 minute ATC delay in SFO because of marine fog and a micro cell storm delayed landing and take-off at Nashville. The gate was changed 5 minutes from boarding from gate B3 to gate C23 at Nashville airport.After being assaulted by a flight attendant I was then brushed off as oh well because he long braids didn’t mean to whip me in the eye. I have filed complaints and will see. But like any other issue I’ve had with kayak involved it’s been trash. Last time I’ll be using your appAC sub par. WiFi not working correctly. Ac sucked. Seats very narrow.Near 4 hour flight with only 1 service. Had to use call button to request water. Internet and power not working until into flight. Internet would stop working during flight.Southwest's seats are the least comfortable I have ever sat in.The cabin was quiet for the redeye flight. The area was clean. The staff was great. The 787 Max was in good condition. Drawbacks were that the seat widths were tight for some passengers. The seat padding was at best average and for a long flight uncomfortable.Southwest like most American domestic airlines, is a mediocre airline. But it is among the cheapest. Oh well.My flight was delayed 50 minutes and we were rushed to board to then sit for 15 minutes until the pilot arrived. Unacceptable since we could have waited to board. Also the delayed flight was updated AFTER we boarded to more than the 10 minutes as originally stated.Cramped seating for me. Luckily it wasn’t a long flightLounge in Lagos is terrible, food on board from Lagos to Atlanta was horrible. Only bright spot the cabin crew were awesome.The staff and the boarding procedure were all amazing . The one flight was not equipped with WIFI which now adays seems odd. All in all the experience was goodPerfect flight both ways. On time, courteous staff, plane comfortable and cool. Best domestic flights I’ve had in awhile.Really low quality food especially for an international flight. The crew also was surprisingly unpleasant except couple of ladies. I know we were not in first class but that’s no reason to treat customers as less.Flight delayed for two and half hours and then canceled altogether due to mechanical issues. No mechanic onsite to fix so had to send one from LAX.Crew was good. The reservation got mixed up and they didn't have my TSA number. I am also a Silver Medallion and wasn't able to use Sky Priority.Delta made it easy, comfortable and timely. The crew was fantastic.This route with Delta always has delays or is cancelled. Aircrafts seem smaller and older. I fly Delta quite a bit - haven’t had issues with the international flights. But this route has always been the troublesome oneThree seats in first class were broken and while they were able to still acommodate us it was looking very touch and go and they had others they could not acommodateTerrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..Impressed with the service despite turbulence because of the weather. Both flights arrived before their scheduled times.Great experience…left a bit behind schedule but made up fir that in the air and landed 10 minutes early 😁Boarding seemed to be organized bedlam. For what ever reason, preboarding took longer than 20 minutes. Made the plane 20 minutes late taking off. Luckily we arrived on time. Flight crew seemed very friendly. Only slight turbulence.The personnel were professional and friendly. The Boeing 737 Max 9 is too claustrophobic and was very warm at both airport gates, and still warm in the air.Electric plugs didn't work. Entertainment system wasn't workingThe design of the light switch on the arm rest is ridiculous.The gate attendant let me walk right by her with a bag too big for the overhead compartmentWell, this is my second flight from THE first one that I took and this one was from Manila to Guam. The flight was comfortable. I did end up in first class. However, I had to fight for it a little bit, but when I went to Guam, I had to stay an extra night there, which was accommodated by united Which I'm pleased for that. The only thing that I have to say is when a situation happens with a cancelation. And you got first class guests very important that you accommodate and make sure that they have their flights before everybody else does, because we pay big money for the service and it is not cheap also. Take note There are things that we have planned as well. So this kind of damaged the tail end of my vacation, which I lost out in $2500 worth of car rentals hotel fair in Honolulu, Hawaii. I'm really hoping that I can be reimbursed at least that money from the insurance that I have on the trip through united. I will be submitting that in as well. When I'm back in the United States, because I'm currently in Guam. Staying good night. I'm waiting for my next flight out. For tomorrow morning..Overall, it was a good experience. Boarding was good and there was plenty of overhead bin space for everyone’s carryons (even when we boarded toward the end). Only improvement would be to offer trash service more regularly.They only offered water for Group 6. Awful announcements from the Crew. Couldn't understand a single word. Barely came by for the trash afterwards. Man, I love water for a premium flight. Wow. Water in a cup.Flight from Dallas to OKC was good, but my trip was interrupted due to a delayed flight from Austin to DFW, which happens all the time. I frequently miss my connection from DFW and American can never seem to make this work!Because the plane was 90 degrees F, they would not let us board. I wish they had, because it meant we were delayed. It's Texas, of course it's hot. We would have survived.Wish they had the seat-back video screens for watching movies or playing games.Full flight so overhead bin space ran out & bags had to be checked. When you’re in the last boarding group, you might as well expect that. Don’t pay to check bags though because when they run out of space for carry-ons, they check your bag to your destination for free. When traveling with children, no need to pay extra for seats, they will assign seats & have to sit your children with you.The seats in economy were appeared to be quite thin and lack sufficient cushioning to be comfortable. Perhaps it was my seating position but the plane seemed notably load.Very good but wish they had the seat-back video screens for movies & gamesMost things were ok but the main problem was the cabin staff; they were very abrupt and not very friendly. They were busy and often rushed, snatching drinks off people before finished and bossing them about.American almost always Delays flights from Austin to Dallas and back. I cannot believe they have such poor service on this route. I was about to switch to American from Delta, but they gave me enough reasons not to.Lost bag and 2 days no word leaving for cruise no clothes or stuffAlaska Airlines8.0Southwest8.0Delta7.9United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Everything you need to know for your flight from Denver to HonoluluAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsInformation on your arrival and departure airportsDenver (DEN)Honolulu (HNL)Cabin class types available on flights from Denver to HonoluluCabin classes available on flights from Denver to Honolulu.
