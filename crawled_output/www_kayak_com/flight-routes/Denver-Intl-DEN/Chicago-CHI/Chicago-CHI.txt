For as outrageous as these flights cost, when they’re advertised with certain services/ features they should be in working orderWorst experience I had on Southwest. Still better than most, but the seating was barely tolerable.It was okay. The plane was delayed from earlier in the day, but they kept updating the departure time, sometimes later, sometimes earlier. That was stressful. Once we finally got on and took off, it was fine. I was supposed to have a connection in Chicago to Los Angeles, and the time for so late I was rebooked to arrive in LA 3 hours late. The departure time to Chicago later became early enough to have taken my original connection and arrive earlier but that wasn't an option.Everything was on time. I was disappointed by the front section female, African American flight attendant. I did not see her name tag or would have identified by name not race. As passengers moved to the bathroom early in flight, she would say with a disdainful tone “I have to say the seat belt light is on” then go back to her book. Better trained flight attendants say something like be careful the seat belt light is on.I would have liked to arrive on time - not 5 hours late!1.5 hour delay, poor service, no compassion from the crew. Terrible experienceOur flight was diverted from being a non-stop to getting within 150 miles and requiring another plane. We heard 4 or 5 different versions from SW as to why we had to stop, then wait for a replacement plane. Five hour delay, weather did not come up as a single excuse.... communication was not clear and well explained. No one really took charge!Flight was awfully bumpy and landing was a bit jolting. I was in the restroom when snacks and drinks were served and was not asked if i wanted any. I had to ask for water finally.I really like open seating. I hate that I've heard this is going away. This is one of the unique things that makes Southwest my goto choice.It seems as though the provisions are even less. Although SWA used to be an economy Airline, that isn't really the case anymore. I paid over $700. for a round trip to Denver and I could have flown just about any airline for the price. The drinks are now in a 6-ounce cup and with ice I'm sure a can would fill more than 2 cups. However, I am very proud of SWA for using paper rather than continuing to contribute to the millions of plastic cups being used each day. I've thought of this fr many years and am so glad to see it come to fruition, if not by only SWA so far.Terrible. They wouldn't allow me on my flight on the 14th..Impressed with the service despite turbulence because of the weather. Both flights arrived before their scheduled times.Great experience…left a bit behind schedule but made up fir that in the air and landed 10 minutes early 😁Electric plugs didn't work. Entertainment system wasn't workingThe design of the light switch on the arm rest is ridiculous.The gate attendant let me walk right by her with a bag too big for the overhead compartmentOverall poor for me I paid extra for seats with leg room and my regional flights exit row seats have less leg room then the others that's money that could have been saved and on my final flight home the flights air was not operating it was unbearably hot in the cabin I will be contacting United and filing a DOT complaintOverall, it was a good experience. Boarding was good and there was plenty of overhead bin space for everyone’s carryons (even when we boarded toward the end). Only improvement would be to offer trash service more regularly.David went above and beyond to make our flight the best that it could beNo food service almost missed because of first flight delaysExcellent - explanations were clear staff was nice and flight was comfortableLost bag and 2 days no word leaving for cruise no clothes or stuffDon’t know they cancelled the flight day before I was to leave. They sent a email at 9:00 pm at night saying they cancelled. That is the smooth way to say we don’t want your business! I think they didn’t have enough people booking so they cancelled the flight! It’s all about the money anymore there is no honesty in business.Any flight to ORD after about 2pm this summer has been challenging. Flight was delayed getting in (coming from ORD) and that led to it not leaving before a ground stop due to lightening before they could fuel the plane, and so forth. They made up some time but we were still late in arriving at ORD, and that led to missed connections.Food was ok, but not as good as I have had before on AA.Pretty good. The food was just mediocre, the boarding and crew were good.My flight got switched and my prepaid bag didnt transfer over properly so I paid to check ANOTHER BAG. I was placed in a middle seat and it was just miserable. At least it was a bulkhead row so I had legroom. The flight just never seem3d to endWas not able to watch most shows on the entertainment site. They would not loadOn Wednesday, July 30 we were in mid flight from Manchester to Charlotte and we turned around because the right engine was malfunctioning. That was the last flight out of Manchester that night. I was rebooked for Thursday, which became a weather event Friday. There were no seats left on the flight from Manchester to Charlotte. Consequently I didn’t leave Manchester until Saturday morning and we flew to Chicago so to say the least my scheduled flight and return to Iowa was three days off and it messed with my business schedule. Consequently cash flow. I would like some sort of acknowledgment of this event.Dreadful experience. Our flight was delayed more than 8 hours due to a maintenance issue and the assistance from rebooking was poor. I was travelling with a bad knee and needed assistance waited in one place more than 3 hours before someone came with a wheelchair. The woman next to me was a 91 year old great grandmother who had waited more than 4 hours. There were moments of support from the staff but it appeared as they were going against the direction of management. It was apathy, lack of ownership and dismissive responses with small moments of kindness and understanding typically from grey haired, female, veteran staff..Frontier is the Walmart of airlines. Frontier has removed adjustability and comfort from their seats to make the flight lighter and save gas. This makes it impossible to sleep on their flights. Their customer service is abysmal. Once, I bought a drink on the plane, and they swiped my credit card on the plane to pay for it. Then I got three weeks of daily notices from my bank telling me they tried to charge the wrong card number over and over again. I tried to call them, but they removed the ability to actually talk to someone that can resolve such a problem from their company to cut corners. The only way to talk to someone in person is to go to the check-in counter at the airport (40 minutes drive from my house). Eventually their system gave up on trying to charge the card, after 21 days of repeated tries. They don't pad their prices even a little to handle customer service issues like missed flights. They also have a blanket policy preventing helping you reschedule a missed flight if their system says you "cancelled" your own flight online. This is a major problem because their website is broken on mobile devices, the only web browser you have at the airport when their gate staff tell you that you have to reschedule your own missed flight online because they can't help you. I tried to reschedule my flight on my android device and instead, their website crashed and "cancelled" my missed flight. When I got to the counter, the agent argued with me for 5 minutes insisting that I intentionally cancelled my own flight (implying I had to buy another flight). She missed the point: the problem was that I could not buy another flight because their website is broken. I left to avoid more conflict with the "customer service" agent. I tried to redress my issue with their only other "customer service" chanel available: the contact form on their website. The response I got was more of the same: you cancelled your own flight, according to our website / computer records, therefore we won't help you. I was trying to explain the problem with their broken website that cost me hundreds of dollars by crashing / malfunctioning and resulting in a cancelled flight, but they only had deaf ears for this problem. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never buy another Frontier flight again, because it is a risky, painful move that I will likely regret often.What I expected, nickeled and dined and a frontier flight attendant loudly complained about her job and lack of communication as she headed to the gate on her cell phone. Not professional.Severe turbulence. Captain never came on to reassure passengers after things settled down.I’m not gonna fly Frontier Airlines because booking is not an option. No water or food is for high price, not equipped for health emergency incompetent crew for emergency services. Cheap airline shows it is cheaper in all service categories. Boarding is the best of all airlines!We were delayed three times ,and that destroyed my plans, and reservationsVery bad! No good service delayed my second connection flightFrontier is terrible. Paid for exit row, not given exit row, refused to refund fee.2 hour delay due to late plane, wrong size plane causing overbooking, and people getting off and on the plane after boarding was completed.The worst. We never made our connection and they did absolutely nothing to help us at the airport.I never got to experience the flight because they delayed my first flight and I missed this one. Then Frontier didn't want to help me rebook a flight to get me to my final destination.Southwest8.0United Airlines7.4American Airlines7.2Frontier5.8Everything you need to know for your flight from Denver to ChicagoAirlinesAirportsCabin classComplete your tripDirect FlightsFlights to other citiesOriginsOther airportsReturn flight dealsOther airlines flying from Denver to ChicagoFlights from the other most popular airlines that fly from Denver to Chicago according to KAYAK users.
