Stick to trusted brands with strong customer service records (like ACE, Enterprise, Hertz, etc.) even if the price is slightly higher — it’s worth it for peace of mind. Check Reviews First! Always read the recent reviews for the exact location you are renting from — not just the overall company. Watch out for Upsell Tactics! Some locations will claim they “ran out” of your car class to upsell you. Insist on what you booked or ask for a free upgrade if they can’t honor it. They should either upgrade you for free or honor the same rate — not extort you for more money. Know your rights. Beware of Hidden Fees like when they try to tack on extra insurance, “transfer fees,” or other made-up charges. Know what you agreed to pay and stand your ground.Verified travelerMar 2025Absolutely confirm with the rental car company whether or not you’ll be forced to accept their insurance policy. Bring a copy of your insurance policy deck page or have it on your phone. And whatever vehicle you rent, be sure to understand all its features and don’t mistake side mirror blindspot warning lights for blinker signals like I did. They mean practically the opposite thing. If they’re on or flashing, it means there’s someone in your blind spot. Check the fuel gauge before you leave the lot and if it is below what you think it should be or you are not willing to ignore any shortfall, take a photo of it and show it to the rental company, perhaps for a discount, if you feel it’s worth it.Verified travelerMar 2025Renting a small vehicle will be to your advantage because of the tight parking in the city at this time of year. Check out the car for previous dings and damage to protect yourself.OlusApr 2025Try to find reliable rental companies and before you rent make sure they are operating inside of airport.Verified travelerApr 2025Rent from the on airport rentals and do not rent in advance due to payments not being refundableVerified travelerMay 2025Rent from a reputable company and check for ALL the expenses that will be attached to your rental.Verified travelerMar 2025Book from the rental companies on site at the airport, otherwise susceptible to bait and switch.DavidApr 2025Traffic is heavy around the airport, fuel is easy to find.Verified travelerMar 2025Don’t pack car before starting it and making sure no maintenance issues. If issues, have a lot of patience because Budget customer service is horribleVerified travelerMay 2025Watch out for huge mandatory insurance charges that aren’t quoted in the original booking price.Verified travelerDec 2024Car wiz wants 300k in insurance and most people don’t have that so you will pay extra at the counter. Video and take pics of the car before hand for security purposes.AncaJan 2025Be careful when you see a low price!! Read carefully what the expect from you.Verified travelerJan 2025Rent at airport if possible.Verified travelerFeb 2025Never go offsite make sure your car rental companies at the airport once they get you offsite they can play games they feel they got you at that point. This is the second time this has happened to us different companies both in Florida one Miami one Fort Lauderdale. The other company was called horsepowerVerified travelerJan 2025Rent from an agency at the airport terminal. Do not go offsite and especially not CarWiz.Verified travelerSep 2024We booked with Budget and were even offered an upgrade. They were on-airport while CarWize was off-airport, which would have made a big difference for us at the time of night we were to arrive. Very happy with Budget thank you!!Verified travelerSep 2024I would advise anyone to use your own insurance and fill up the tank yourself. It’ll save you a little bit of money.Verified travelerNov 2024Tell the customer that they need proof of insurance before booking and get people who speak English on site to support.Verified travelerNov 2024Have all of your insurance information printed before arriving. Check to make sure there is a return shuttle for early flightsDanielNov 2024Use your own insurance...more well known names are more likely to be at airportpaulSep 2024allow time for the rental car shuttle and paperwork at the counterPeterNov 2024Shop around for a good price before bookingVerified travelerOct 2024Use budget or sixt or any company major company. The super cheap rentals are NOT worth it and end up not being as good a deal anywayGwendalynJul 2024We renting from budget and it was a better experience. I would recommend renting from know brands and making sure they have a service counter at the actual air port instead of just a phone number.Verified travelerJun 2024We booked the SunPass and are glad we did. It covered all of our toll costs and enabled us to utilize the express lanes.Verified travelerAug 2024Fuel was not full tank as it said in the contract paperwork. No one near picking up car to validate and no time to waste for us. But everything fixed later with phone call to customer service. While returning to airport, the shuttle was packed and took time for everyone to get seated. Next time I’ll keep in mind for extra time. We were rushing.AlanAug 2024As I said, people need to know that you need your insurance card and the declarations page from your insurance company. My advise is to decline the toll coverage and use the "no toll roads' option on Google Maps. Otherwise, the cost of the tolls option is unreasonably expensive.JordanJun 2024If you’re in a rush and not traveling through terminal 1 and your car is off site, just Uber to your car rental instead of using the shuttlesDanAug 2024Make sure you read and understand the’fine print’ when you try to rent in Florida, as a Florida resident!!!Verified travelerJun 2024Make sure you know exactly how to get to car rental location before arriving.Verified travelerApr 2024Sometimes it's better to rent from the neighborhood if you can. You not only support the community but you also save time by not standing in long lines at the airport.Verified travelerMar 2024We rented an SUV It was perfect for 4 adults and our luggage. We got the sun pass for toll roads. Definitely recommend going that route.Verified travelerMar 2024If you do “offsite” rental cars keep in mind you will pay less but don’t be in a hurry bc it will take longer. That’s the trade off. Also have your insurance details (including coverages) ready for the agent for it to go smoothly.Verified travelerApr 2024Call car rental desk and inquire about insurance requirements. Unless you have one of the top 5 national insurers, expect hefty add-on insurance at time of pick up. Rental car was cheaper than Uber for our group.Verified travelerApr 2024Next time we disembark at Port Everglades and need a car for the day, we’ll just rent one from the airport and look for one that has a shuttle from Port Everglades.MarkMar 2024There is a shuttle bus to/from terminal to car rental location so if you are a 1st timer at airport renting a car that would have been nice to knowVerified travelerApr 2024Make sure you get the toll pass if you're driving on any toll roads. There is no way to pay otherwise.Verified travelerApr 2024make sure that if your flight is delayed to super late, that you contact your rental car company in advanceVerified travelerApr 2024Cars are scratched, go around and mark carefully before leaving. Ignore upsells for tolls, insurance, and upgradesVerified travelerMar 2024If you’re coming in early keep in mind that don’t clean cars till 6 am so bewareWillardMay 2024Don’t forget to bring your SunPass, or pay for one when you get here.ValeriaApr 2024Read all the fine printVerified travelerJan 2024My daughter said; as a new driver herself, learn about the one way streets as we do not have many one way streets. I looked it as we didn't get lost. Keep your eyes on the road because there are lots of beautiful things to look at, including the ocean views.Verified travelerJan 2024Driving in FLL is good and easy91ardakFeb 2024Make clear insurance policy requirements to rent the car.Verified travelerJan 2024Keep the speed limit , there are cops everywhere!Verified travelerDec 2023Avoid these smaller rental car agencies that tend to lure you in with low advertised prices but then hit you with a ton of fees. The larger and more reputable agencies will ultimately cost you less and you will have a MUCH better experience.Verified travelerSep 2023Yo tome el toll pass por día....pero es mejor el ilimitado ya que hoy en día los peajes son muchos!!!Verified travelerSep 2023Lots of traffic, not really any down time!MatthewNov 2023Florida drivers are aggressive. If you drive the speed limit, stay in right lane.markJun 2023If you are going to be on the highways, toll roads and express lanes do not take cash. The tolls are levied with license plate readers or transponders. I would recommend getting this service as express lanes and toll roads are common in South Florida.LisaJul 2023We drove to Orlando and back, the 450 mile cap was just enough. We did the pre-pay toll option which saved us some money.Verified travelerJun 2023Use your membership cards for car rentals to avoid waiting in line and watch for extra charges being added to your bill.Verified travelerJul 2023Driving in Fort Lauderdale is a pleasure, Miami has much more traffic.

Lots of cars going a LOT faster than the traffic (which is already about 10 over the limit) combined with plenty of cars going well below the traffic. It's the mixing of south florida youthful energy with south florida retirement community on the roads.markJun 2023Pay with a visa or MasterCard and then only get the insurance that will cover the Credit Card deductible - $4.99 a day. If you do not use the turnpike or express lanes, do not get the toll coverage - which is $14.99 a day.Verified travelerAug 2023Driving is ok in Fort Lauderdale; pay attention to all street signs. Some areas have red light cameras which is fine. Stay out of the express lanes if you don't have the SunPass. Drive safe.AshleyJul 2023Make sure to ask if they have capability of having a different drop off location from the pick up siteVerified travelerJun 2023Check the cars in and out, use your phone lantern if it is night time.MichaelJun 2023People drive crazy in Florida, either too slow or too fast.Verified travelerJul 2023Watch out for the cops and be vigilantAmirMay 2023Make sure you are renting from the airport location and not downtown if you're flying in. And consider purchasing or bringing a toll road tag with you to avoid ridiculous extra charges if you're planning to drive toll roads and don't want to pay a ridiculous premium to either get the tag from the rental company or to get the toll billed by mail.Verified travelerMay 2023Advise future Tesla car clients that they can only charged in a Tesla Super charge station. The car adaptor does not fit the regular charge station.Verified travelerMay 2023You have to take a shuttle (sometimes 2 depending on the rental car company) from the airport.ShellyMay 2023Having more options available would be niceVerified travelerMay 2023Driving in fort Lauderdale is easy.LindaMay 2023Sixt has GREAT value, however the off site office is very LAXEDVerified travelerMay 2023Drive carefully in South Florida since most drivers are careless.KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in Fort LauderdaleFort Lauderdale is city that revolves around relaxation and simplicity, which is only magnified when you decide to give yourself the freedom of renting a car. Fort Lauderdale has beautiful beaches that provide an array of activities and opportunities to enjoy the glorious Florida sunshine. Take the opportunity to drive west to the UNESCO World Heritage site, Everglades National Park, and appreciate the subtropical environment overflowing with fauna and native animals.Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport has plenty of major rental companies to choose from, conveniently all located together in their Rental Car Center. If you're arriving in Terminal 1, simply walk across the pedestrian bridge toward Concourse B and you'll arrive at the Rental Car Center. If you arrive at either Terminal 2, 3, or 4, there's a shuttle bus that takes you directly to the Rental Car Center. Fort Lauderdale is situated only 21 miles north of Miami; this is an alternative flight destination that may be more convenient and affordable, as it is a larger airport.There are certain highways nearby Fort Lauderdale with tolls, including the Florida Turnpike, Alligator Alley (1-75), and Bee Line Expressway. Be careful to plan your driving route accordingly and ensure that toll payment conditions are clearly outlined in your rental agreement.

During the evening rush hour, the I-95 Highway is the most likely to experience congestion and cause delays. Warm and sunny weather is common and cars will flock to the beaches along the coastline, so be mindful of this and give yourself extra time to reach your destination on a hot day.One of the great perks of Fort Lauderdale car rentals is that they allow you to explore much more than the local beaches. For example, Disneyworld in Orlando is about a 3h drive northwest. If you’d prefer to check out the space shuttle at Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, head north along the coast from Fort Lauderdale for about 3 h.

If you continue driving south from Miami for another 45 mins or so, you’ll reach the Florida Keys.Public parking garages and public beach parking as well as parking lots and on-street parking are the main parking options in Fort Lauderdale.

Turns out at the desk, after you’ve checked out, they hand me a folded invoice with a surprise additional charge of $91. When I questioned this they said it is a mandatory liability insurance charge. I was furious this was not included anywhere in the quote when booking the car. That charge is triple the actual cost of the daily rental. Why would ACE/Kayak not include that insurance charge, that makes up the bulk of charges, in the booking process when they include all the other mandatory fees? This is deceitful and predatory, and I was forced to pay more than double the price Kayak quoted. I’ve reached out to ACE and of course they haven’t offered any apologies or refunds.

However, since then my reports to Alamo have gone unanswered. The policy is they aren’t responsible for unattended items… no surprise there. But their lack of interest in rooting out an employee who so plainly stole a significant amount of money is… disheartening. Had my concern been escalated at the time, the employee could have been caught red-handed and the money even potentially returned. Instead, I’ve heard nothing from Alamo. I’ve left website, messaging, phone, and customer service chat complaints. No response. No response to my requests they view camera footage and the log of who was in the vehicle. At this point I’m frustrated that this hasn’t been addressed. If they aren’t going to return the money (because they didn’t take the time to speak to their employees) they should at least police them when reports of theft are made.

This is hands down the WORST rental car experience I’ve ever had. I’ve rented from many companies before (Hertz, Avis, Enterprise) without a single issue. But Priceless Car Rental in Fort Lauderdale is on a different level of fraud, deception, and disrespect. I booked a car for $140 and thought I was getting a fair deal. Big mistake. The moment I arrived, the nightmare began. The agent at the counter was rude, aggressive, and manipulative. She forced me into paying for an insurance plan of $39.99 per day, insisting it was mandatory. I asked her multiple times if I could decline since my credit card covers rentals, and she lied to my face: “No insurance, no car.” Later, I discovered their own website clearly says the insurance is OPTIONAL. That is pure fraud. Then came the toll scam. They added $19.99 per day for tolls—and just like the insurance, it was mandatory. I asked if I could use my own SunPass (which every local has and works perfectly fine) and the answer was a blunt “No.” In other words, you’re forced to pay them an outrageous toll fee whether you want it or not. Nobody in Florida spends $20 a day on tolls. This is an absolute rip-off. And if you try to use your own insurance (I have Progressive), they demand a ridiculous $2,000 deposit. On top of that, they charged my card an extra $500. When I asked about the refund, they told me it would take 30 BUSINESS DAYS. Thirty days! Are they going to pay me interest on the money they’re holding hostage? That is insane. A rental that was supposed to cost $140 ended up being over $800. That’s not a rental—it’s robbery. And here’s another huge red flag: when you arrive, you’ll notice they have tons of cars sitting there, even on a busy holiday weekend. You know why? Because smart travelers already know this place is garbage. If a rental car company has a parking lot full of cars when every other company is sold out, that tells you everything. Let’s be clear: • Their cars are junk, old and poorly maintained. • Their customer service is hostile and unprofessional. • Their policies are deceptive, designed to trick and trap people. • They prey on travelers who are tired, vulnerable, and desperate for a car. This company should not even be in business. What they’re doing is dishonest, predatory, and borderline criminal. ⚠️ DO NOT RENT FROM PRICELESS CAR RENTAL. I will never set foot in this place again, and I will make it my mission to warn as many people as possible. Save yourself the stress, the money, and the frustration. Go anywhere else. Priceless Car Rental Fort Lauderdale is a disgrace to the industry.2.0 PoorBob, Jun 2025Intermediate SUVNothing - nothing but a big scam.

For this price, I could have gotten a nicer car, with a reputable company, and felt so much better about my first-time renting a car in another state.4.0 MediocreAnonymous, May 2025CompactHidden fees, namely "Loss of use" charge of $55 that was unavoidable despite my reading the Terms & Conditions.6.0 OkayGuy, Mar 2025CompactThey overcharged a LOST RENTAL ASSURANCE of 40$ per day, never seen this before.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Feb 2025CompactA lot of hidden fees, the car was dirty.

Our flight didn't arrive until 5pm but given that we had prepaid for our desired vehicle, it seemed logical they would have one there for us. During my flight I get a notice that they canceled car reservation since had not picked up yet, even though it was prepaid! Upon landing, the main phone number would not provide me a phone number for the specific pickup location, said that they would not refund my money, and that i needed to go to the location to see in any car was available for me, at additional costs to me. So we had to leave the airport, unsure if we had a rental car, get to the car agency, and they only have SUVs available for TWICE the price of the car we had reserved! So we are stranded if we dont agree to the additional price. Very much a "Bait and Switch". Remember, we had PAID UP FRONT, there was no risk of them loosing rental money by holding our reserved car for us.2.0 PoorAmanda, Jul 2024MinivanPlease please please save yourself from a rental hell. Stick with one of the big names at the airport rental place. Not the bus outside of the airport to save a few dollars. We needed a minivan and they were the only ones to have one - so we took a chance and it was the absolute worst. They have no one working so everything took sooooo so long. They want to charge you for everything and only verbally talk you through it at a speed in which you can’t understand. Then when you try and ask clarifying questions, they just get annoyed as if you should have heard it the first time. They literally have like 2 people there and had a line of so many people for over an hour. Also, we live on the opposite side of the state of Florida and thought we had unlimited miles…. Nope. They said if you live within the state you only get 50 a day because of Uber/doordash etc. Clearly I didn’t go on vacation with 3 small children and click the extra 4-5 places in order to see that living in Florida voids the unlimited, so then we were forced to pay overage amounts bc we drove to key west and back.

I knew it had to be too good to be true. It ended up costing over $325. Quite a big difference. They said they didn’t except my insurance that was $25 per day. There was a daily fuel surcharge but I was responsible for the fuel. I had to pre pay tolls at $20 per day. Plus other odd fees. There was also a $1000 hold on my credit card on top of the charge It is NOT at the airport. It is off site and you have to take 2 buses to get there. The worst part was, there was no one at the business to return the car. The doors were open but there were no employees. 3pm. Thankfully we left 3 hours before our flight. We waited over 30 minutes. No one. We finally got ahold of their Miami office. They had me turn the keys in to a guy out side who work for the car rental next door. She refused to give me proof of return or a receipt for over an hour. I had to trust she would email it. I had to catch a plane. Not to mention 2 buses to get back to the terminal. It was an awful experience. It ruined my trip. The fact you offer this as an option is shameful. It’s a scam.2.0 PoorSteve, Feb 2024IntermediateI'll never go back to them. All well-known rental car companies typically ask who your insurance company is and you tell them and thats that. In my case Travelllers. This was not enough. They wanted proof, so I called my insurance company and they emailed me my insurance card. This was still not enough either, they wanted the declarations page, so I called again and had that e-mailed which worked. Super inconvenient and the guy behind the counter had the personality of a brick, his English was poor, spoke so fast one could not understand what he was saying and he did not really care about making the experience a pleasant one. I overheard the clients at the counter next to me mention the words, Mickey Mouse company, so I was not the only one disapproving of renting here. Car was ok for the money and clean enough. I wanted to extend and called both numbers on their contract. all 4 times I tried I was placed on hold, and the call was dropped within 5 seconds of being placed on hold, as if it was intentional. So I emailed and asked if an extension was possible at the same rate I had of $15.00 per day. They came back with $50.00 per day and I decided to return the car. I guess that's their prerogative but I chose to return the car and be done with them rather than extend. I'll never use these guys again and the impression I got was that they did not care about future happy clients at all2.0 PoorAnonymous, Dec 2023Intermediate SUVThe rental location is not at the airport, so you need to take 2 different shuttles to get the car. The shuttle that takes you from the rental car center at FLL to the actual rental company location is unmarked and only shows up maybe every 30 min. When you arrive, the process to rent the car is difficult and they require proof of insurance yet they don’t tell you this in advance. Also, there is no local contact phone number for the company. The only number provided is an international number.

What is advertised online is not what you will pay. They force you to take their insurance even if you have full coverage with your credit card and with your personal car insurance. If you don't take their insurance they will just tell you that you can't rent and free to leave when you are already way out of the airport and have all your luggages around. The car is dirty and full of stains. They also say they will put a 300$ hold but in reality they will charge you 300$ on your credit card which they say will refund after 7 days! So that's already a lie to begin with. There is no hold and you end up dishing out and extra 300$ out of nowhere that you won't get right away once you return the car. Hotels put hold and release the hold after. Advantage charged us an extra 300$ The workers there don't really care. They also tell you to get the toll pass which is around 20$ USD every day because you will need it. They said going to FLL to Miami, you have no choice but to pass to a toll way.
