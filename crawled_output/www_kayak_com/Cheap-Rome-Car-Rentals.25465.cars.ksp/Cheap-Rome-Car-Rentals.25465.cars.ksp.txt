While driving, you should constantly watch for white pedestrian lines on the road. Additionally, it’s advisable to avoid Via Tiburtina, which connects Tivoli and Rome, as it is notorious for accidents. Another road to be cautious of is Via Cristoforo Colombo, along with Via Casilina. These three roads have the highest number of accidents in the capital each year and are considered among the most dangerous in Rome.Explore the beauty of the Italian landscape with a rental car and discover all that Rome and its surrounding areas have to offer. The coastline is just about 40 minutes away by car, and the scenic Riserva Naturale della Marcigliana, located north of the city, is definitely worth a visit, being only about half an hour away by car.Rome operates a ZTL (Zona a Traffico Limitato), which stands for "limited traffic zone". These zones are implemented to reduce congestion and pollution in major Italian cities, especially during peak times. Be cautious not to enter a ZTL, as they are monitored by cameras, and fines will be issued for unauthorized access. Check with your rental car provider for details, and make sure you know where you can drive. If your hotel is in the city center, you may be eligible for a pass to reach it. Alternatively, consider parking in a suburban garage and using public transportation to access the city center.Rome is an ancient city, and its streets are often narrow, making navigation challenging for those accustomed to wider roads. Vespas are common in the capital and are known for zipping through alleys quickly, so be sure to drive attentively.Unless your hotel includes parking, it is not advisable to search for a parking space in the city, as they are difficult to find and often reserved for locals. Instead, opt for a P+R facility outside the city center near a metro station, such as P+R Battistini, P+R Valle Aurelia, or P+R Laurentina. At approximately $2.25 per 12 hours, these options are also very cost-effective. While parking lots closer to the Old Town are available, they can cost up to $45 per day, making them a much more expensive alternative.Speed limits, unless otherwise indicated, are 31 mph in residential areas, 68 mph on countryside highways and 80 mph on freeways. Always adhere to the speed limits as the Italian police are very strict with speed regulation and fines can be high. Speed cameras are also commonly used in Italy.When driving a rental car in Rome, it's important to be aware of the speed limits in different areas. In urban areas, the speed limit is 31 mph. Secondary roads outside the city have a speed limit of 55 mph, while main roads outside Rome allow speeds of up to 68 mph. On highways, the speed limit is 80 mph on weekdays and 68 mph on weekends. If you're heading to a destination or tourist site and choose to use toll roads for a quicker trip, make sure to stay within the speed limit of 90 mph.25% of our users found rental cars in Rome for $16 or lessEconomy rental cars in Rome are around 72% cheaper than other car types, on averageSee more tipsFAQs about renting a car in RomeWhat type of car is recommended for driving in Rome?As the streets in Rome are very narrow and parking lots are difficult to find, consider opting for a smaller car like a Mini or a Fiat 500.

There were grease prints and footprints all throughout the car. There was a lollipop stick and an empty bag.4.0 MediocreEdson, Jun 2024EconomyThe biggest problem booking through Kayak was that even though my car reservation was “confirmed”, when I got to the Hertz desk they said that it is a third party app so they did not have that reservation and only had a more expensive car to offer me for those dates. Because we were on a tight schedule, we couldn’t shop around last minute and ultimately had to take the more expensive car. Bad experience booking through Kayak and ultimately blame Hertz for also allowing themselves to be listed on third party websites without this guarantee.10.0 WonderfulAnonymous, Nov 2023Compact SUVThe best!2.0 PoorAnonymous, Nov 2023Full-sizetz ek . hyBack1 out of 5NextCentauro10.0WonderfulCleanliness10.0Comfort10.0Pick-up/Drop-off10.0Value for money10.0One location in RomeShow locationsCar rental locationsLocations in RomeParkingo, Via Luigi Bandini+39 06 8366 4029Monday07:00 - 23:59Tuesday07:00 - 23:59Wednesday07:00 - 23:59Thursday07:00 - 23:59Friday07:00 - 23:59Saturday07:00 - 23:59Sunday07:00 - 23:59FiltersWonderful (0)Very good (0)Good (0)Okay (0)Fair (0)Mediocre (0)Poor (0)No reviews availableThrifty10.0WonderfulRead 1 reviewCleanliness10.0Comfort10.0Pick-up/Drop-off10.0Value for money10.021 locations in RomeShow locationsCar rental locationsLocations in Rome- Via Del Tintoretto, 400+39 06 503 4581Monday14:30 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Tuesday14:30 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Wednesday14:30 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Thursday08:30 - 13:0014:30 - 18:00Friday08:30 - 13:0014:30 - 18:00Saturday08:30 - 13:0030/A Via SardegnaOpening times not availableCentro Commerciale Ronzetti+39 06 9014 8006Monday14:30 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Tuesday14:30 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Wednesday14:30 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Thursday14:30 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Friday14:30 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Saturday08:30 - 13:00Circonv.

The pickup process and the staff in Rome was fantastic, but the drop off process in Florence was a nightmare! When we drove into Florence, we arrived at the address we were provided both by the Alamo staff in Rome and in our rental agreement. The office was in a terrible location and was not open despite arriving during listed business hours. Since the office was closed, we had to take the rental car to our hotel and pay to valet park it overnight. When we went to return the rental car at the listed opening time the next morning, we waited in a line at the provided address, only to get to the front and be immediately directed to a parking garage that was NOT listed on the rental return agreement without the staff doing anything to acknowledge and process the return. We were provided unclear instructions on where the return garage was that did not take into account current road closures. Due to needlessly waiting in line at the return location provided by Alamo in the rental agreement, the return process not being initiated in the system upon our arrival at the provided location, and the delay in finding the return garage, we arrived at the garage 15 minutes after our return time and charged for an entire extra day. Had we had clear instructions on where to return the vehicle, we would have had a much better experience.8.0 Very goodHaroldo, Oct 2023IntermediateAlamo is my favorite choice all over.Budget5.7FairRead 14 reviewsCleanliness7.5Comfort7.1Pick-up/Drop-off6.3Value for money6.110 locations in RomeBudget reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in RomeAeroporto Roma CiampinoMonday08:00 - 19:00Tuesday08:00 - 19:00Wednesday08:00 - 19:00Thursday08:00 - 19:00Friday08:00 - 19:00Saturday08:00 - 19:00Sunday08:00 - 19:00Circonv Gianicolense 53+39 06 5830 3377Monday14:30 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Tuesday14:30 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Wednesday14:30 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Thursday14:30 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Friday14:30 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Saturday08:30 - 13:00Pickup Corso Di Francia 141+39 06 9761 9590Monday08:00 - 19:0014:30 - 18:00Tuesday08:00 - 19:0014:30 - 18:00Wednesday08:00 - 19:0014:30 - 18:00Thursday08:00 - 19:0014:30 - 18:00Friday14:30 - 18:0008:00 - 19:00Saturday08:00 - 19:00Roma Lido Di Ostia+39 06 561 2795Monday08:30 - 13:0016:15 - 18:00Tuesday08:30 - 13:0016:15 - 18:00Wednesday16:15 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Thursday08:30 - 13:00Friday16:15 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Termini Rw: Via Giolitti 34+39 06 481 4373Monday08:00 - 19:00Tuesday08:00 - 19:00Wednesday08:00 - 19:00Thursday08:00 - 19:00Friday08:00 - 19:00Saturday08:00 - 19:00Sunday08:00 - 19:00Tiburtina Railway Station+39 320 456 8652Monday08:30 - 13:0014:30 - 18:00Tuesday08:30 - 13:0014:30 - 18:00Wednesday08:30 - 13:0014:30 - 18:00Thursday14:30 - 18:0008:30 - 13:00Friday08:30 - 13:0014:30 - 18:00Saturday08:30 - 13:00Via Baldo D Ubaldi 116Monday08:00 - 19:00Tuesday08:00 - 19:00Wednesday08:00 - 19:00Thursday08:00 - 19:00Friday08:00 - 19:00Saturday08:00 - 19:00Via Laurentina 677+39 348 973 7002Monday08:00 - 19:00Tuesday08:00 - 19:00Wednesday08:00 - 19:00Thursday08:00 - 19:00Friday08:00 - 19:00Via Sant'alessandro 7+39 324 900 8475Opening times not availableVia Sardegna 38 AMonday08:00 - 19:00Tuesday08:00 - 19:00Wednesday08:00 - 19:00Thursday08:00 - 19:00Friday08:00 - 19:00Saturday08:00 - 19:00FiltersReviews10.0 WonderfulAnonymous, Apr 2025MiniWonderful2.0 PoorAnonymous, Oct 2024Intermediate SUVThis operation is a scam.

The agent at budget City Centre tried to tell me that I didn’t order the vehicle and reserved online, then proceeded to tell me that the vehicle doesn’t exist in Italy. The car was dented and wasn’t not recorded at the time of pickup. Thankfully, I did a full vehicle wall around before taking the vehicle from budget. When I dropped the car off at Budget Airport, the agents were better and I explained the situation with the pickup. They confirmed that the original vehicle I ordered is available in Italy and they had chosen to not have it onsite for pickup. They also asked about the dent, which I showed the video to prove it was there at pickup. They stated that the first agent at pickup never recorded it, but because of the proof I wouldn’t be charged. This was such a bad experience given that I ordered a Van to fit 8 people and they gave me an SUV that fit 7, with no room for luggage. Because of this experience, I will never use Budget again and will tell everyone I know to avoid it as well.6.0 OkayAmer, Sep 2024CompactEveryone was friendly. No issues there, and I really enjoyed my experiences with the employees directly. No air conditioning, in a heat wave, made the long wait for pickup exhausting.

If your flight is delayed by more than that, they’ll cancel your reservation and make you pay the full charge with insurance to retrieve your booking. IDP also required for foreign travellers not in the EU. Generally nice, but a lot of “nothing I can do it’s the ststem” from the staff. Shuttle comes really slow/late.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jan 2025EconomyThe pickup/dropoff part was a disaster. I waited at the FCO airport for “the shuttle” for over an hour, during which time I asked the airport info people where to find the shuttle and they couldn’t help, nor were we able to reach the rental office by phone. So I finally just decided to take a taxi to the office, which was an additional 40.00 euros that SurPrice refused to reimburse me for. Then I waited almost another hour in line at the office just to get my reserved car. The clerk barely spoke English and was rude. They did a terrible job of explaining the rental agreement and failed to give me any kind of print-out or email. Also, the vehicle was only 3/4 full, even though they told me “full to full”. I didn’t have time to go back into the office to argue with them, so I took pictures and left thinking maybe they would credit me when I returned the vehicle. I was wrong. When I dropped off the vehicle, it was basically the same experience which almost caused me to miss my return flight. In retrospect, I wish I would have just paid more for a car rental office located in the airport terminal.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Dec 2024EconomyThey tried to charge me again for insurance and upped the cost I had prepaid by 4X. Avoid this place like the plague!2.0 Poorarnoldandalicia, Oct 2024EconomyMake sure you have an international drivers license with you, because Surprise will not rent a car to you if you don’t unless you pay for very expensive daily insurance through them. Even though they refused to rent the car, they still charged us the full rental price. The directions for getting the shuttle at the airport were very vague and so finding the shuttle took us over an hour of asking people where to get it (no one knew) and what the shuttle looked like. The whole ordeal was a nightmare2.0 PoorAnonymous, Oct 2024MiniTerrible customer service. Smoking on work6.0 OkayAnonymous, Oct 2024EconomyI found out from a taxi driver that the wrong address was listed on my car rental booking confirmation and there was no information about a shuttle/transportation to the location listed as the airport when it was actually somewhere else. I had to pay a taxi driver to bring me to a different address that a free shuttle should have. Beside that, the car worked great and wasn't very clean but otherwise highly functional. No mechanical issues and I was able to catch the shuttle back.NOLEGGIARE 5.2FairRead 2 reviewsCleanliness8.4Comfort7.2Pick-up/Drop-off5.6Value for money6.87 locations in Romefrom$34/dayNOLEGGIARE reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in RomeLargo Guido Mazzoni, 1 – Roma+39 347 749 1690Opening times not availableRoma Termini Train Station, Via Giovanni Giolitti 16+39 348 533 0898Opening times not availableVIA Collatina CO Info Point of Shopping Center Roma EST+39 345 118 1209Opening times not availableVia Ormisda, 5+39 06 4543 6433Opening times not availableVia Pontina+39 342 106 9478Opening times not availableVia Vincenzo Renieri 16+39 342 514 3680Opening times not availablec/o multipiano B- A.
