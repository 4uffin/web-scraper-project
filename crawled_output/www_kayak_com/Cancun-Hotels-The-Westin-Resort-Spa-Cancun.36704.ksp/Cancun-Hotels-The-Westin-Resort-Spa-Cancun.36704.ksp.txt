The dresser drawers in the room were falling apart; the cleanliness (dust etc) could be better. The staff was a little slow but extremely friendly.3.9PoorAnonymous, Oct 2021No Mexican beers available and they made a horrible margarita!!!! Everything (food and drinks) was super overloaded with sugar. Wait staff was lovely! No Guacamole either. Super far away from any shops or restaurants and the hotel got us a taxi that charged us $22 to take us a mile and a half away. Thumbs down.4.0MediocreAlan, Aug 2020Pros (+) breakfast was so goog, the 5-7 alsoCons (-) The room is so humid, smell not good......we change the room....it was the same problem ouach!!!8.8Very goodMelanie, May 2018Pros (+) We liked the location and ambiance. Beautiful surroundings and polite, friendly staff.Cons (-) IThe food leaves room for improvement. The lobster was gristly ang the items on the breakfast buffet were cold.

The beach and the viewCons (-) In normal times, this is probably a good hotel. But at the moment the hotel is undergoing renovations. Lots of workers and dirt around the hotel. Parking is far away. Some of the hotel restaurants are closed. Most of the pools are closed. It is not pleasant to go on holiday in this situation. Wait for the renovations to end. Unfortonetly we didn't know all of this when we did our reservation .9.7WonderfulDeborah, Jul 2017Pros (+) Sandy, great to swim in beach that's even has a lifeguard. Cozy beds and cool AC in rooms.

Overall great place.Cons (-) Noise from present renovations and bathrooms near beach/ pool could use more frequent service.5.7FairAnonymous, Apr 2017Pros (+) Friendly staffCons (-) This place must be 30 years old. It's in definite need of a refurb. Worn and dirty carpets make the hallways look drab, the stucco and tiles in the guest rooms make the place feel cold and unfriendly. They are refurbishing the lobby, so that's a good start. The food needs a good look at, too, breakfast that was meant to be hot was cold, other items where presented as if they were left from the day...Read more9.4WonderfulMark, Mar 2017Pros (+) BeachesCons (-) Breakfast too expensiveShowing 1-10 of 4240 reviews12345...424The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What are the dining options at The Westin Resort & Spa, Cancun?Guests can dine at the Palmar Market, Sea and Stones Restaurant, and Arena Sports Bar, offering a variety of delicious food and drinks.What activities are available for guests at The Westin Resort & Spa, Cancun?Guests can take part in activities such as bowling, hiking, sailing, water skiing, kayaking, and snorkeling, ensuring an active and enjoyable stay.Are there any concerns about the hotel's customer service?While some guests have expressed concerns about the customer service, many others have praised the staff for being extremely nice and helpful.What are the highlights of the hotel's location?The resort is located at the quieter end of the beach near to an area where swimming is safer on windier days, offering a stunning view and sunrise.What are the common complaints about the hotel's facilities?Some guests have mentioned concerns about the hotel's facilities, including loud construction, pushy timeshare offers, and the need for bathroom facilities in certain areas.The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.Book a Room with a ViewSeveral guests mentioned that the views from the rooms were spectacular.
