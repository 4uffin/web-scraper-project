I thought I’d only stay in the city for a year or two, but I promptly fell in love with the desert.
To this day, I still relish the dusty, technicolor sunsets, the exceptionally friendly people, and the vibrant, ever-changing scene for food, activities, and exploration. As a local travel writer and natural wanderlust, I’ve made it my mission to see and do as much as possible in Phoenix. That includes checking out the local hotel scene, which is noteworthy for several reasons.
The Phoenix metro – which includes Scottsdale, Tempe, and Paradise Valley – is a hub for world-class resorts, cool high-rise hotels, and trendy boutique stays. I’ve been lucky enough to visit and stay at many of them, and I consider these the best of the best hotels in Phoenix.Rise UptownRank #1$72-$397/night400 West Camelback RoadFor one of the best hotels in Phoenix that won’t break the bank, I recommend booking a stay at the very trendy Rise...Learn moreFor one of the best hotels in Phoenix that won’t break the bank, I recommend booking a stay at the very trendy Rise Uptown. It’s conveniently located in the Uptown area, which is about 15 minutes from the center of downtown Phoenix. Not only is this modern Phoenix hotel impeccably appointed – fun photo ops abound – but I love that it routinely offers fun events and activities for both hotel guests and locals to enjoy.You can also catch some sunshine at the hotel’s rooftop bar complete with pool and loungers. Other fun details include the hotel’s Modern-Southwest decor, large rooms and suites with private balconies, in-room record players, and an on-site popsicle stand. Being centrally located, it’s near some cool attractions like the Japanese Friendship Garden, the Phoenix Art Museum, and even a few hiking trails at Papago Park and Piestewa Peak.Check pricesCheck pricesKimpton Hotel Palomar PhoenixRank #2$136-$966/night2 East JeffersonOne thing that I love about this hotel is that it’s located right in the center of downtown Phoenix – it’s part of...Learn moreOne thing that I love about this hotel is that it’s located right in the center of downtown Phoenix – it’s part of the Cityscape complex – which puts you in the middle of the action. Key attractions like the Phoenix Symphony Hall, sports arenas, Footprint Center, Orpheum Theater, and the Phoenix Convention Center, as well as loads of cool restaurants and other attractions, are literal steps away from the hotel’s front door. (For food and drink, I’m particularly obsessed with Wren & Wolf, Coabana, and Bitter & Twisted).There are even a couple of on-site restaurants, including the Eden rooftop bar, as well as Blue Hound, which knows how to whip up a mean Old Fashioned and has a tasty lunch and dinner menu (definitely try the lobster mac and cheese). I especially like that the rooms of this high-rise hotel offer gorgeous city views, and I’m a fan of the large seating areas, funky wall art and chic updated bathrooms.Check pricesCheck pricesRoyal Palms Resort and SpaRank #3$198-$1,060/night5200 East Camelback RoadFrom the very second I stepped onto its intimate campus, the Royal Palms took my breath away. The historic hotel was...Learn moreFrom the very second I stepped onto its intimate campus, the Royal Palms took my breath away. The historic hotel was originally a 3500 hundred square foot homestead, erected in the late 1920s and was converted into a 15-guest casita in 1947. Since then, its cozy atmosphere and Spanish Revival architecture have been transformed and expanded into a 120-room inn that still feels as intimate and welcoming as ever.The spacious rooms are luxurious and traditional versus overly snazzy or modern, and there’s something magical about all the hidden gems tucked throughout the winding campus. Take a load off in the Hacienda-style courtyard, which features the majestic backdrop of Camelback Mountain, or swing by the oval-shaped pool complete with cabanas and food service.The desert landscaping also makes this one of the best hotels in Phoenix thanks to giant mature agave, vibrant bougainvillea, swaying palm trees, and towering saguaros.Check pricesCheck pricesArizona Biltmore, LXR Hotels & ResortsRank #4$153-$1,595/night2400 East Missouri AvenueOld-school glamor fused with modern amenities is exactly what you’ll get at the Arizona Biltmore, an iconic hotel in...Learn moreOld-school glamor fused with modern amenities is exactly what you’ll get at the Arizona Biltmore, an iconic hotel in Phoenix erected in 1929. This is one of those hotels that’s so cool you’ll want to stop by even if you’re not planning on staying overnight, which is exactly what the locals do when looking for a hip place to kick back.Inside, you’ll find ornate furnishings and an impressive gold leaf ceiling, which is the second largest gold leaf ceiling in the world after the Taj Mahal. Though the hotel isn’t tall, it’s anything but small. It’s got over 700 guestrooms, which wrap around a massive campus complete with seven pools, two golf courses, restaurants, and bars, and a wow-worthy spa.I highly recommend splurging on a service while you’re there and carving out some time to sit outside next to a flickering fire pit to enjoy great weather and a tasty drink.

It’s...Learn moreEstablished in 1959, Mountain Shadows Resort is another iconic, Phoenix-area hotel with a longstanding history. It’s technically located in Scottsdale’s Paradise Valley – a quick 10 to 15-minute drive from Phoenix – where it sits beautifully against both Camelback Mountain and Mummy Mountain.This is one of my favorite fancy hotels in Phoenix because of the unbeatable views. Also, if you enjoy retro flair then this hotel will definitely satisfy. The layout is interesting in that the rooms all face the interior pool, which was a classic “motel-esque” design back in the ‘50s and ‘60s.Inside, you’ll find a communal sunken room with a central retro fireplace and Hearth 61, which serves impressive high-end food. This is one of my favorite hotel restaurants in the valley for its food quality, vibes, and views.Check pricesCheck pricesFound Re PhoenixRank #6$82-$491/night1100 North Central AvenueIf you like the idea of being close to downtown but don’t want to stay right in the middle of all the buzz, opt for...Learn moreIf you like the idea of being close to downtown but don’t want to stay right in the middle of all the buzz, opt for FOUND:RE. This contemporary boutique hotel is located in central Phoenix about 10 minutes north of downtown proper. Along with the snazzy loft-style rooms, city views, outdoor pool, and urban-chic aesthetic, the lower level of this hotel features a rotating art gallery and the Match Market & Bar.This casual eatery offers both grab-and-go food and sit-down meals in a trendy atmosphere and is one of my favorite spots to drop by for dinner or a late-night drink with friends. The hotel is also conveniently close to a range of attractions and restaurants.Roosevelt Row – which boasts tons of vibey restaurants, breweries, and bars – is only a 10-minute walk away, and it’s also walkable from Barcoa Agaveria, the iconic Matt’s Big Breakfast, and Cobra Arcade Bar.Check pricesCheck pricesJW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge Resort & SpaRank #7$250-$2,362/night5350 East Marriott DriveThis is my top pick for anyone looking for the best hotel in North Phoenix.

Its prestigious AAA four-diamond award was well-earned thanks to its luxurious atmosphere, perfectly manicured campus, assortment of restaurants, an indulgent spa and top-notch service.If you’re a golfer, the resort also boasts an impressive championship-level course for you to happily putt. Alternatively, pamper yourself with a little self-care moment at the resort’s Revive Spa, which offers a robust range of massages, facials and salon services.Even if you don’t book a spa service, the rooms feel like a treat in and of themselves thanks to plush bedding, balconies with desert views and sophisticated furnishings and art. For restaurants, I’m a big fan of Tia Carmen, which boasts a creative menu full of delicious Southwestern fare a la celebrity chef Angelo Sosa.Check pricesCheck pricesGraduate by Hilton TempeRank #8$79-$539/night225 East Apache BoulevardIf you want to stay closer to Arizona State University or prefer to spend your time in the southeastern part of the...Learn moreIf you want to stay closer to Arizona State University or prefer to spend your time in the southeastern part of the valley metro, I recommend booking at The Graduate Tempe. It’s located within five minutes of the campus, and you can walk to the bustling Mill Avenue District which features a lineup of cool eateries and bars (FYI: This part of town is popular with college students come nighttime).My favorite part about the hotel is the highly customized interior decor, which reflects the locale and is an absolute delight from top to bottom. The hotel has some seriously groovy Southwestern vibes complete with colorful textiles, funky art, unique furniture, and ASU Sun Devil decor.Its 140 rooms offer everything you need in a cozy stay, and there’s even an outdoor pool for year-round splashing, as well as a full-fledged bowling alley and bikes available for rent.Check pricesCheck pricesJW Marriott Scottsdale Camelback Inn Resort & SpaRank #9$248-$3,168/night5402 East Lincoln DriveAlso located in Paradise Valley, Camelback Inn & Resort is one of the best hotels to stay in Phoenix, with...Learn moreAlso located in Paradise Valley, Camelback Inn & Resort is one of the best hotels to stay in Phoenix, with Southwestern flair and luxurious, pueblo-style accommodations. The rooms are exquisite, too, thanks to a neutral wood and cream color palette and beautiful views.On-site, guests have access to heated outdoor pools, stunning garden terraces, and winding desert trails. Admittedly, The Spa at Camelback Inn is one of my favorite features. It’s an impressive 32,000-square-foot facility ripe with pools, saunas, steam baths and of course therapeutic services like massage and facials.Golfers will appreciate the Camelback Golf Club, which boasts two 18-hole championship courses along with several other courses. As for food, you’ve got a handful to pick from on-site restaurants to choose from. Rita’s Cantina & Bar is a local favorite with a chic but casual atmosphere, while Lincoln’s Steakhouse & Bar offers traditional, high-end steakhouse fare.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Camby, Autograph CollectionRank #10$137-$617/night2401 East Camelback RoadOne of the luxury hotels in Phoenix, the Camby is an Autograph Collection hotel located in Midtown Phoenix, which is...Learn moreOne of the luxury hotels in Phoenix, the Camby is an Autograph Collection hotel located in Midtown Phoenix, which is known for its upscale shopping and restaurants. This hotel is one of my top picks because it offers a super fun retreat that strays from the typical stuffy hotel aesthetic. On site, there’s a snazzy rooftop pool with bar service, a 24/7 fitness center, and Artizen, a sophisticated restaurant with American fare infused with Southwestern flavors.Along with Biltmore Fashion Park, the hotel’s next to some of the valley’s best restaurants – and some of my personal favorites – including True Food Kitchen, The Henry, The Gladly, and Steak44. The central location of The Camby makes this hotel super convenient for exploring all corners of the metro, including Old Town Scottsdale, downtown Phoenix, Arcadia and Tempe.I recommend checking out the Heard Museum, Desert Botanical Garden, Camelback Mountain and the Musical Instrument Museum.Check pricesCheck pricesBooking InsightsKAYAK’s insights for hotels in PhoenixDiscover seasonal trends, ideal booking windows, and other data-driven tips to plan your stay in Phoenix with confidence.How much does a hotel cost in Phoenix?The average price of a double room in Phoenix is $221 per night.
