Buckle up, and let's make your Orlando adventure a smooth and enjoyable ride!Licensing and mandatory paperwork to rent a car in OrlandoYou must have a valid driver’s license from your home state to rent a car in Orlando. While the state of Florida only requires a...Learn moreYou must have a valid driver’s license from your home state to rent a car in Orlando. While the state of Florida only requires a driver’s license from your native country to drive in Florida, international drivers might want to check their car rental company’s policy regarding international drivers just in case. Most car rental companies require drivers to be at least 21, while many have a minimum age requirement of 25 years old. A credit card in the driver’s name is typically required for security purposes and many do not accept cash or debit card deposits. You will also need proof of insurance or to buy insurance through the rental company to ensure you have financial responsibility for any potential damages that may happen during the rental period. Lastly, it is common for rental companies to run a brief driving history check to ensure the renter has a clean driving record.Types of cars available to rent in OrlandoOrlando is a popular tourist destination that offers a variety of car rental options to suit the needs of every traveler. Major rental companies –...Learn moreOrlando is a popular tourist destination that offers a variety of car rental options to suit the needs of every traveler. Major rental companies – like Enterprise, Hertz, and Avis – offer everything from compact and economical models, ideal for city travel, to full-size sedans and SUVs that provide extra space for families or groups. More adventurous travelers might consider a 4×4 or a convertible to enjoy Florida’s sun. For environmentally conscious travelers, some rental companies even provide hybrid or electric vehicles. Remember, booking ahead – especially during peak tourist season – ensures you get the vehicle that best suits your needs and budget.Where to rent a car at the Orlando AirportThe primary spot to rent a car is at the Orlando International...Learn moreThe primary spot to rent a car is at the Orlando International Airport where you’ll find numerous rental companies, like Enterprise, Hertz, Avis, and Budget, in the Ground Transportation area. This is a convenient option if you’re flying into the city. Alternatively, major car rental agencies have locations throughout the city in popular tourist areas, like Downtown Orlando, International Dive, Kissimmee, and near Walt Disney World. Certain area hotels even offer car rental services on-site for guests.What to know about toll roads in OrlandoOrlando has an extensive network of ten toll roads that connect various destinations throughout the city and beyond. Unless you want to add...Learn moreOrlando has an extensive network of ten toll roads that connect various destinations throughout the city and beyond. Unless you want to add significant time to your travels, you will likely use at least one of the toll roads during your trip. For example, the typical drive from the airport to Disney World’s Epcot is 25 minutes using tolls and 50 minutes without using them, while the typical drive from Disney Springs to Cocoa Beach is 70 minutes using toll roads and 110 minutes without them.
Companies frequently charge up to $4.95 per day for transponder rentals, which means that during a ten-day vacation you could spend $50 for just the ability to pay the tolls. In addition to this, toll roads typically charge people paying with a transponder the cash rate – the highest possible toll rate – for each toll.
If you know you will be doing a lot of driving, consider getting a Visitor Toll Pass. The Visitor Toll Pass is a simple solution for anyone renting a vehicle at Orlando International Airport, enabling you to pay road tolls electronically. The free transponder tag that you can hang from your rental car’s front mirror allows you to bypass the rental car toll devices and pay tolls on your own. You can get the Visitor Toll Pass by downloading the app or visiting the toll pass vending kiosk at the airport. Once you have the pass, be sure to decline the rental car toll transponder option on your rental contract.Parking your rental car in OrlandoParking in Downtown Orlando is straightforward.

Some street parking is free, while metered spots generally cost $2 per hour. Parking garages usually impose a flat rate of approximately $10-$15 per day.
Parking fees at most theme parks can range from $25 to $50 per day; however, many of them provide complimentary shuttle buses to transport visitors to and from their hotels. Self-parking is free at some resorts and hotels, while others charge for the service. It’s worth noting that parking in residential neighborhoods may require a permit, so be sure to check local signage. Using a parking app can be a convenient way to find and pay for parking in Orlando.Seasonal driving tips for OrlandoDuring Central Florida’s wet season (June through October), it is not uncommon to experience afternoon rain showers almost every day. When driving...Learn moreDuring Central Florida’s wet season (June through October), it is not uncommon to experience afternoon rain showers almost every day. When driving in Orlando during rainfall, maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front as roads can get slippery, so be sure to reduce your vehicle’s grip and increase stopping distances. Avoid sudden braking and use your headlights to increase visibility. If the rain is extremely heavy, it may be safer to pull over and wait until the downpour eases.Booking InsightsGood to knowMost popular agencyMost popular car typeAverage priceGood dealRent-A-WreckStandard$17/day$14/dayKAYAK’s insights & trends for Orlando car rentalsCheck out the latest trends and booking tips to rent a car in Orlando with confidence.How far in advance should you book a rental car in Orlando?You should book your rental car in Orlando around 7 days before your trip in order to get a below-average price.What is the cheapest car rental company in Orlando?In the past 72 hours, the cheapest rental cars were found at Easy Rentals LLC ($4.90/day), Right Cars ($4.97/day) and Advantage ($5.82/day).

Call to confirm final rates prior to travel.Verified travelerNov 2024It's a good idea to get the EZ Pass for the tolls.donSep 2024The only thing I would suggest is to review the route you will be traveling. I was told that all the tolls were paid automatically so I needed to get the sun pass. The tolls that I ended up going through all had cash lane options, but that isn’t the case everywhere. I spent $30 to pay my $8 in tolls, that was in addition to actually paying the tolls.Verified travelerNov 2024use the Florida Travel pass instead of paying for the EZPass, it's way cheaper. Don't let them bully you into extra insurance you don't need. Double check if they add an extra drive to your invoice without clearly explaining the charges.LoisSep 2024Most all rentals will cost the same. Choose a car or rental located already in the airport. Often even a rental that looks low in price is usually a gimmick and far from airport.RobertSep 2024If you have a SunPass, make sure you can use it with your rental. I had to drive through all of the toll booths so it wouldn’t trigger the rental cars toll reader.AllanNov 2024Go with one of the better known rental brands.

We always use a credit card that covers the car insurance so we don't have to take out extra insurance. And we NEVER rent an Economy - too small! Unless you plan to stay in Disney and never leave, you will definitely need a rental in Orlando; it's huge and spread outVerified travelerAug 2024The best and affordable rental car company is FOX. They have many vehicles to choose from at a fraction of the cost. I particularly like renting trucks for the space and comfort. Just be sure to return on full fuel to avoid additional charges.RobertAug 2024Book from one of the quality vendors located at the airport. You’ll pay a little more and it’s way worth it.Verified travelerAug 2024Rent for well known place in the same airport, avoid long waiting lines, long shuttle and extra fees.Verified travelerJun 2024Go with the transponder if you are planning on doing quite a bit of driving.Verified travelerJun 2024Stick with a major brand you can pick up on-site at the airport.ElizabethAug 2024Book ahead of time if possible. Customer service was good!Verified travelerAug 2024You don't need the toll pass, there is a cash lane and they do give change. It may be $1 more for cash but unless you're using the toll roads frequently, just pay cash.ChristinaJun 2024Just reminder, USave is outside of airport. Must take a shuttle. We made the mistake of not reading that and walked most of terminal before looking up details.Verified travelerJul 2024Do it with time and be flexible when picking up, more than likely there will be a line since Orlando is a high tourist city.Verified travelerJul 2024Expect a shortage of cars and long lines in Orlando. Consider Turo due to one price not changing and guarantee a carVerified travelerJul 2024Make sure your rental company located within the airport otherwise make sure that are open for the time you are arrivingMerlynJun 2024When booking with company outside of airport be ready for long shuttle waits when picking up and dropping offVerified travelerJul 2024Get the toll pass or else you will have to pay tons of toll feesVerified travelerJul 2024Do it with time and be flexible at pick up, Orlando is always busy.Verified travelerJul 2024Allot time for picking up vehicle, it could take up to 2 hours.Verified travelerJun 2024Try to book rentals available at airport.

Wasn't aware of that. I guess with Surprice you will always need to travel with a copy of your insurance policy, unless you want to have to buy theirs.Verified travelerMay 2024Bring your auto insurance policy ID so that you don't have to buy additional coverage. They seem inflexible on adjusting any price after the fact, so make sure you confirm the rates in the rental agreement issued match what you had in your original reservation.DamonApr 2024$14/day is not $14/day. Bring quarters for tolls unless you’ll be using more than $11/day in tolls. Cheap rentals make their money on insurance and other options. I have no idea how to get around the agency requiring their insurance, so...Verified travelerMay 2024If you don’t mind an extra few minutes of driving you can easily avoid the Tollway. Sunpass charges like $15 a DAY. For us it wasn’t worth almost $100 when we knew most of the time our car would be sitting at Disney.Verified travelerMar 2024Choose your rental car options carefully. In the future I might use a car share like Turo In the future. I would also consider ordering a visitors toll pass ahead of travels because Orlando has a lot of toll roads.Verified travelerMar 2024Traffic is slow with lots of construction, give yourself extra time . Make sure you are getting the car you book , not every spot has all the available vehicles.Verified travelerMay 2024Book in advance, watch out for holiday season, they will put a hold on your credit card without telling you so check it out.Verified travelerMar 2024Double check pick up and drop off locations.

Pay a bit more and rent at the airport.mustafaApr 2024Book rental car on the airport. Avoid renting off propertyVerified travelerMar 2024Make sure you know how the toll system worksVerified travelerMar 2024It’s easier to get the toll system pass.SarahMay 2024Call them in advance and ask what kind of insurance they require. Many of the vigger companies dont have insurance requirements, but these smaller, cheaper ones do. They then require you to pay outrageous fees for their "additional coverage."Verified travelerMay 2024Orlando has a million toll roads. Get the toll pass if you will be daily driving in and around Orlando. Also double check your car check out receipt. They will intentionally lie about the fuel level on there.BradMar 2024The gas station convenience store across the street from WallyPark and Advantage Car Rental on Butler Road sold regular unleaded more than $2.00 per gallon more than average prices on the area. Plan ahead and don’t go there!Verified travelerApr 2024Be sure you're renting from the airport, and be aware that about half the companies operating out of the airport are scams. The prices look low, but that's because they all tack on mandatory surcharges.Verified travelerMar 2024Deal directly with the rental car company and not use consolidator services. The price may look low but they will catch you in some other way and jack the price up tremendously.ALLENFeb 2024Yes, new comers to the Orlando area usally take the easiest route from the airport to the Orlando attractions.I find it the best way out of the airport would be to take 528 east to exit 16 staying to the right at the split at the exit off of 528 on to 417 to 535 and 536 which is a very short drive instead of route 4 which can be very congested at times.Verified travelerJan 2024If it's an extended stay with lots of toll roads, buy a temp pass at the first gas station you see for $10-15 and it will auto-charge your card the toll charge. Way cheaper than the rental company.Verified travelerJan 2024Rent from those that have a proper booth in airport terminal. Saves u time and also inconvenience. Price wise its similar after all the add ons.Verified travelerJan 2024Advantage has good prices and service.

Florida drivers are very aggressive. Routinely driving 15-20 miles an hour over.Verified travelerJan 2024It is classic Orlando. Busy at times with some bottlenecks near the Apopka-Vineland exits.Verified travelerFeb 2024Spend an extra dollar or two and use the toll roads.Verified travelerFeb 2024Easy driving and navigating, but lots of trafficVerified travelerFeb 2024There are tolls on almost every road.Verified travelerDec 2023Hopefully they have a refundable rentalVerified travelerNov 2023Renting in Orlando: I prefer the off-property car rental places such as Advantage Car Rental at the MCO Airport. Access is easy and you will avoid the poorly designed and crazy-busy on-property traffic pattern. Local Driving: When you drive on I-4, just realize that you will be stuck in heavy traffic going west toward Lakeland or Tampa or east toward downtown Orlando - often stopped or crawling - for 20 to 30 minutes. Stay in the middle lanes(s) when possible. Once this thinking is kinda built into your travel estimate, you're good! Drivers aren't generally as aggressive as, say, Boston Rt 128 or Florida East Coast I-95 drivers, yet there are LOTS of them! There is always quite a bit of traffic on I-4. Polk Parkway, John Young Parkway, and other alternative routes are usually good for travel and busy but not maniacal.Verified travelerOct 2023For UK residents I have only one tip. Remember although they do have rules of driving similar to the "highway code" in the USA, the first rule seems to be "ignore all the other rules". Drive carefully! Lol.BrennaOct 2023Book through Kayak, prices are the best. Traffic can get busy on the roads leading into Disney so make sure you keep your car with some extra gas in the tank.Verified travelerSep 2023Yes.

For Germans/Europeans: be reminded that there is no law in the US to drive on the right lane if possible, so everyone can use every lane at any speed. Be aware of your surrounding, especially on your right. Also, be aware of forks that split the lane so always read the signs above.Verified travelerSep 2023Don’t use York. Also, it may be a lot easier to use one of the companies on site, rather than the ones needing a shuttle. However, if the shuttle worked and actually picked them up, it may not be so bad.Verified travelerSep 2023Know the rules. Especially turning right on a red light. I already knew this from years ago. But would be useful to inform renters when picking upChristosNov 2023think about tolls- how much will you use them? to avoid unnecessary prepaying maximum daily rate if a care rental employee pushes youHaroonSep 2023Text for pick up and wait inside.

However the quality of their cars might not be as great. Hertz gave me an incredibly hard time and I suspected a lot of aggression and racism from the employee who was helping me with my reserved rental.

After the car return I was charged for some services I didn't agree, even after being explicit with the company not to add services besides the one already included in the original reservation. Got in contact with the company afterwards to complain and was told that they had some small letters on the contract that allow them to proceed this way. Very bad experience and would not recoment the company.2.0 PoorAnonymous, May 2025Premium SUVWould not allow me to cancel prior to my trip and as a result made it a huge problem while renting the car I actually wanted. Would not recommend Kayak ever.2.0 PoorAndrew, Feb 2025First car had issues with phone connectability so I asked to change (before leaving pickup area) and that was begrudgingly done. Asked to add pre-pay fuel at exit which is where we have always been told to and was told they couldn't and that I had to call to arrange. Call cost me a lot due to international chargers on my phone. When I called they refused to do so because I had already collected which meant I had to mess around filling up at near an airport with hard to find fuel options. Wasn't advised of the change, if there is one or it may just have been an employee that couldn't be bothered. Very unhelpful on phone.2.0 PoorCasy, Jan 2025Supplier choiceThe price I was quoted when I reserved the car was much less than I ended up paying. Also I was told that extending the rental another day would be $30 and I turned out to be $71. When I called to question this, I was told it was a “miscommunication.” This is untrue. The car was nice but it had low air in one tire and I had to stop and top it up, even though I only had the car for two days. I won’t be renting with Avis again.6.0 OkayRohan, Jan 2025Intermediate SUVIt took 30 minutes to pick up the car as there was only one person at that location.

I waited for over 2-hours in the evening. A second employee arrived just as I reached the front of the line. The car’s engine light was on when I picked it up, and when I asked the garage attendant about swapping a vehicle, they said we’d have to go to the desk inside the terminal again - my family and I could not even think about spending more time trying to get on the road so we just drove away with the engine light on in our original vehicle. The fastbreak account option seemed like it may be a good solution to skipping the lineup, but the booking had to be made through that account and I didn’t know about it until it was too late.

I just came back from the car rental location after wasting two hours for 3 family members (including a 6 year old) and wasting money on uber rides because this was a fraudulent booking because they told me (a) the reservation does NOT including liability insurance without which it is illegal to drive in all states, (b) I needed to additionally pay $15+ per day for toll e-responder (which is mandatory because many tool locations no longer have cash lanes), and (c) after I agreed to pay both these additional costs which almost doubled the original price for me, and signed a more than dozen pages of agreements, the person at the counter offered me a car which had dents/damage at three location and suggested I videotape the car fully before leaving so that I am liable for damage. I have never rented a car where I video tape everything and made plans to fight off such scams. I asked the person at the counter to cancel everything, and we took an uber to our hotel. Can Kayak help me get a refund for my original booking and stop these bait and switch prepaid scams? Just to reiterate, I entered my credit card info at Kayak when I purchased this booking.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jul 2024Economywill NEVER rent with them againAce5.4FairRead 123 reviewsCleanliness6.1Comfort6.2Pick-up/Drop-off5.7Value for money5.7One location in Orlandofrom$47/dayAce reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Orlando7855 North Frontage Road+1 407 588 0018Monday00:00 - 23:59Tuesday00:00 - 23:59Wednesday00:00 - 23:59Thursday00:00 - 23:59Friday00:00 - 23:59Saturday00:00 - 23:59Sunday00:00 - 23:59FiltersShow reviews that mentioncar availablecar was cleanget the carshuttle from the airportfriendly staffcar insurancegreat pricecar was dirtynever rentShow moreReviews8.0 Very goodAnonymous, Jun 2025Full-sizeEnded up needing a last minute rental after an evening flight into Orlando. I couldn’t find anything available anywhere but luckily my teenager found Ace available through Kayak and saved the day. The wait for shuttle pickup was so long we weren’t even sure it was coming but this was my first time waiting on a shuttle from the airport to rental place so maybe that’s normal. We ended up getting a Lyft from the airport to Ace which was an extra expense but it was probably a good thing because when the shuttle came there were lots of people and the line was even longer. The line when I arrived, prior to the shuttle that I would have been on was long and moved kind of slowly. However, my time at the counter was quick, easy and pleasant. The car itself was great, no issues there at all. Drop off was a breeze but did have a 10 min wait for the shuttle to the airport which was fine. Overall, I felt Ace was a good value and good service and I’m extremely grateful for the last minute availability! For me personally though, I think I’d rather pay more to rent from the airport for the convenience of it instead of shuttling back and forth especially with kids in tow.2.0 PoorChristian, Apr 2025CompactBefore I rent with them I call to make sure that I was able to do what I want before rent. I use your page as a third party, you guys make me pay for insurance in advance wich was not accepted in ACE and they couldn't rent me the car after I call to make sure and I was given wrong info. Now I'm trying to get my money back from insurance and no one to talk to in KAYAK or the third party insurance company that u guys selected for me. This insurance thing with u guys is a scam and ridiculous negotiation I'm doing everything In my power because you guys ste gonna return my money.

The gentleman who helped me at the counter when I picked up was great. Friendly, kind service, and understanding of my situation--but the person who checked the car as I left was terrible. He didn't speak to me at all, was on the phone with someone the entire time, didn't assist me in any way. When I rent from other brands, they always ask if there's anything they can do to help me--directions, reminders about features of the car, etc... this guy just talked to whichever person on his phone and moved a truck out of the way without telling me that I was good to go or anything. I hesitated, and he gestured at me to leave. When I arrived back, the lady who helped check the car back in was courteous and kind. I wish the one man hadn't left such a bad impression, because then I could've given everyone a 5 over all.6.0 OkayAnjelle, Oct 2024StandardAce service provider was great!

The reason I booked this rental with Dollar via KAYAK was specifically because pricing was competitive and seemed better than most other options. I booked this more than 3 months prior to our trip. Once I arrived at the Dollar rental desk, I was told that my reservation was for a 7 passenger minivan. Despite me showing emails with the reservation details showing the rate I paid and showing the type of vehicle, Dollar refused to honor the reservation. I ultimately was charged more than $500 extra for the upgrade and additional fees for the full size van, and I definitely could have booked it for cheaper than that back when I originally reserved the vehicle. I got screwed because of a communication breakdown between Dollar rental car and their online booking agent (KAYAK) and Dollar refused to accept any accountability for it…the question is, will Kayak take any responsibility2.0 PoorAnonymous, Nov 2024CompactI would never rent from dollar again.

Their website, along with the confirmation email stated a "Total Cost" of $111.72. When I picked up the car, the agent presented me with "additional local costs" amounting to an additional $71.18. This included an unheard of "Pickup Fee" for $10.00 and "Dropoff Fee" for $10.00. I have never been charged these from any rental agency, anywhere in the world prior to this. None of these "additional local" charges were listed anywhere before pickup. The contract stated "Total Cost" of $111.72, and that's what I expected. In addition, the $250.00 "security deposit" has not been refunded or credited to my credit card as of yet. I have tried all morning to reach the agency to inquire about this. They answered only after about 30 minutes of putting me on hold. The representative could not give me any reasonable answers about the additional charges, but said the security deposit would take 5-10 business days. I will monitor that. Please remove Global Car Rental from your list of agencies.

I will never use this company again and strongly recommend others do not! I will be getting a refund!4.0 MediocreAnonymous, May 2024IntermediateIt took awhile for the shuttle bus to get to the airport for pickup. My insurance provides coverage for rental cars. Unknown to me, they require a copy of my insurance policy to 'verify' that I have that coverage, or else I have to buy their insurance coverage. My flight was delayed and I got to their facility about 8pm. She said I was supposed to have picked up my car by noon and would 'have to see if they still have a car available and if they could verify that my original rental fees were still available". They decided to let me have the car. It is dark outside and they have the black vehicle out in a dark area where I am supposed to inspect it for any damage. I brought the card back in to her where I marked that I didn't see any obvious damage, but trying to see any surface scratches or scrubs was impossible. She said, 'you didn't write the mileage down''. I said the rental agency normally does that. I went back out and got the mileage. At this point I was frustrated and really needed to get on the road as I had a 1.5 hour drive to get where I had to go and be up for a very early meeting. I have never gotten a rental that didn't have a full tank of gas, EVER. About 10 minutes down the road it started to rain and I was trying to figure out the wipers. I then noticed it only had a 1/2 tank of gas!! When I got back I mentioned this to the lady behind the counter. She said it was my problem because I was supposed to inspect the car before taking it.

No effort was made to make me aware of this policy prior to arriving. By then you’ve taken the shuttle way outside the airport; and your basically stuck with a huge bill you weren’t planning on.

Everything must be dealt with before, both the price, requirements and documentation and when the client pays, the business is closed, and it is criminal that we cleinyes are surprised when we arrive for what we buy or lease.
