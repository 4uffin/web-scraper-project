A very short walk to the Warfield - my reason for being there - and an equally short walk from BART, so flying into SFO and getting to the hotel in less than an hour and for $11. Hard to beat!6.0OkaySuleman, May 2022Cleanliness10WonderfulAnonymous, Aug 2019Pros (+) Breakfast very simple, tea/coffee and muffins.Cons (-) It's petite, but great!5.4FairAnonymous, Oct 2018Pros (+) Staff and location great!Cons (-) Had loud protestors outside and had very small bathroom with black mold. Phone did not work. No pen or paper. Lights did not function properly. No AC No black out curtains2.0PoorAnonymous, Apr 2018Pros (+) NothingCons (-) I would not advertise this establishment as a hotel. There were bugs. It smelled bad.8.2Very goodAnonymous, Mar 2018Pros (+) Value for the money. Clean facilities and comfortable room. Good and reliable Wi-Fi. Central location very accessible by BART and Muni close to shops, tourist attractions and restaurants.Cons (-) Noise from alley at night or early morning, hotel staff is aware and provides ear plugs in your room but not really helpful. There was a strong smell of weed on my bathroom at night don't know where it was coming from but had to turn on extractor and close bathroom door and turn on ceiling fan and open room door to air out smell.6.0OkayAnonymous, Jan 2018Pros (+) Overall, it was clean and good downtowns location.Cons (-) Room had a musty smell and the walls are pretty thin, hence bery noisy- I guess that is why they give you ear plugs.8.0Very goodAnonymous, Dec 2017Pros (+) The location was excellent, the price very affordable, and the staff was very kind. The rooms were very clean and cared for by attentive staff.Cons (-) The orientation of the bed was awkward, along with the pillows being very uncomfortable which impacted my sleep. The room got uncomfortably hot, but was held in check by an adequate fan. The bathroom was incredibly tiny and awkward.7.1GoodAnonymous, Aug 2017Pros (+) Very clean rooms staff came everyday and restocked. Staff was nice and friendly.Cons (-) No bathroom or shower in your room. No sink in the bathroom in the hallway. You have to wash your hands in your room which is kinda gross touching handles. We didn't know that before we stayed. And room are no bigger then 7 feet by 7 feet. Clean but so small. And breakfast is literally a muffin. With nothing else in your room even a fridge I would have liked a breakfast.8.5Very goodMatthew, Feb 2017Pros (+) Great location near Downtown BART stations and Moscone Center.Cons (-) The room that I had this time had the sink located outside of the bathroom, near the bed and desk.Showing 1-10 of 3126 reviews12345...313The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What amenities does the hotel offer?The hotel offers daily housekeeping, valet parking, valet laundry services, free breakfasts, and free use of the nearby Marriott Spa and Fitness Center, among other services.What are the common concerns about the rooms?Some guests mentioned that the rooms were small and lacked air conditioning.
