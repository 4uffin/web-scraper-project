Having said that, you simply can't beat the convenience of having your own ride, especially when pressed for time or when traveling with children. A rental affords you the freedom to stop wherever and whenever you like, and in a place with so many natural wonders and hidden gems, we're sure you'll agree it's worth every last peso.Learn moreRequirements for renting a car in CancúnTo rent a vehicle in Cancún, you must have a valid driver’s license from your home country, a passport, and a major credit card.

The options range from economy and mid-size autos to minivans and full-size SUVs. An economy car will serve you well for city driving and squeezing into tight parking spaces.

In most cases, your insurance policy at home does not cover driving a vehicle in Mexico. If asked at the counter if you want to add extra coverage, keep in mind that major credit cards provide some form of collision damage protection. Call your credit card issuer to ask specifically what the coverage entails. Some companies in Cancún run promotions that include complementary theft coverage, but it normally comes at an additional cost.Driving in the city: what you should knowUnder a new law, both drivers and passengers are required to use seatbelts in Mexico The speed limit on federal roads is about 65-70 mph and...Learn moreUnder a new law, both drivers and passengers are required to use seatbelts in Mexico The speed limit on federal roads is about 65-70 mph and it’s around 45 mph in the city’s hotel zone. Do not exceed 25 mph when driving through busy pedestrian areas. If stopped by traffic police, remain calm and politely ask why you’ve been pulled over. Most officers will let you off with a warning, however, some bad apples may try to shake you down for a bribe, which is illegal. They usually give up if they see you jotting down their name and badge number. Whenever possible, avoid heading into the hotel zone during rush hour between 7:00 am-9:00 am and 5:00 pm-7:00 pm.Parking your rental car in CancúnParking in and around downtown’s busy Parque de las Palapas can prove difficult at times, otherwise, you should have no problems finding...Learn moreParking in and around downtown’s busy Parque de las Palapas can prove difficult at times, otherwise, you should have no problems finding spots throughout most of the Centro.

For electric vehicles, you’ll find charging stations at the airport and various points throughout the hotel zone, including Golf Puerto Cancún, Fiesta Americana, and Live Aqua.Seasonal driving tipsFor the most part, Cancún has sunny weather year-round, so visibility is rarely a problem.

We paid for a 7 seater Dodge Journey new model. We got there and they said they have no 7 seater and gave us two rly old model Chevy car it was either that or a 5 seater. Okay we’ll make it work plus they added like $300 on Imsurance.. so on our trip we get a flat tire my husband fixes it so be it when we go to return the car we tell them and they charge us $200 for a tire that I cannot even exagérate the spare tire and other tires are all the same so $200 for a freaking tire that we couldn’t help popped on us while driving. So I am livid never in my life of renting cars are we made to pay for something that we had no control over. My mother has issues with the car rental too. We will never rent a car in Mexico again or from this company. Worst service we have gotten. The only reason we paid for the tire was bc we didn’t want to miss our flight and had to get to the airport.2.0 PoorAnonymous, May 2021Pros:We cancelled the rental car.

Or loose your flight2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jan 2025Passenger vanI had an extremely disappointing experience with America Car Rental and would not recommend their services to anyone. When we arrived to pick up our car, the vehicle we had reserved—an automatic—was not available. The only option they had was a manual car, which was not what we booked or needed. On top of that, they refused to accept our Canadian insurance, even though it provides coverage internationally. This left us with no choice but to leave a staggering $5,000 USD deposit, which was highly stressful and unnecessary. The worst part of the experience was when we returned the car. Despite bringing it back in perfect condition, we were charged an outrageous $220 for "excess cleaning" because there was some sand inside from our beach trip. This level of charge for something as minor as a little sand is absurd and feels like a blatant money grab. Overall, this was the worst car rental experience I’ve ever had. I will not be using America Car Rental again and strongly advise others to avoid this company. Save yourself the hassle, stress, and unnecessary charges.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Dec 2024CompactThey never had a car for us!!!!! We were told to wait from 11(our pick up time) and they were supposedly looking for cars…finally after almost two hours we were told it’s better to go rent from another agency or wait till 3 or later and maybe they will have a car for us.. there maybe about 20 more people waiting and coming from the airport with no cars at all. ITS A SCAM!!!!! We ended up going back to the airport , which was a 15 minute ride since they were off location and not directly at the airport and renting from another company The people who work there were chatting and laughing and the clients were getting angry and mad.

The car was not ready and we had to wait 15 minutes for it.2.0 PoorDavid, Mar 2022We arrived in the terminal at the MEX desk at 13:00 but were told to return to the desk once our luggage had been collected. When we returned we then had to wait for another group to decide whether they wanted to use MEX. We then had to wait for the shuttle to arrive and go via the International terminal before finally getting to the Car Hire station. Waited 15mins before being seen to then be told that the car had been released because we had not presented ourselves at the station, not at the desk in the arrivals/baggage hall, at 1pm. Terminal staff should have alerted us to the fact as they were shown the booking details at the desk. According to the agent the car was released at 3pm. We had arrived at the car rental kiosk by 3pm. We were given the options of a) paying an extra $342 for a larger vehicle which was at the car hire station; b) wait a MINIMUM of 90 minutes until a car of the grade we had booked turned up; c) go to another company. The justification given was that all conditions were stated in the booking email. Conditions WERE stated but didn’t fully relate to the experience at the airport. Having chosen to take the larger vehicle, all paperwork was completed by 15:29 but the vehicle was not actually presented until 1550. The condition of the car was reasonable, one of the wind mirror covers was missing, but overall we would be extremely reluctant to use MEX by CAS ever again.8.0 Very goodRobert, Jan 2022We went for the cheap and cheerful option and this was spot on.

When I couldn't produce this (as we were in Mexico at the time) they said I had to pay for their insurance. When we brought the car back, they tried to charge us for fuel and for damage.

They try and scam you for 90 minutes to buy more insurance after they make you wait in line for 25 minutes. Our family of 7 waited outside during this entire time and finally when we went to walk away they made headroom of not totally taking us over for the week. The rate is good online but beware and then there is a whole joke of a return too! run!4.0 MediocreBrazilian jiu jitsu, Dec 2020Pros:The staff was friendly but they always try to sell something that i did not ask for and I do not need, even after you decline the offer the keep pushing things like hotes, packages and the car insurance which is 3x the price of the rental car.Cons:The drop off was pretty bad. The free shuttle drop us off in the wrong terminal and left such in a hurry that when I try to talk to the driver to take me to the right terminal he had already left and we almost lost our fly.Infinity Car Rental2.9PoorRead 14 reviewsCleanliness4.3Comfort3.3Pick-up/Drop-off3.2Value for money2.7One location in CancúnInfinity Car Rental reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in CancúnParque Logistico, SM 301 MZ 8 LT 8 Bodega 33-A+52 998 886 3145Opening times not availableFiltersReviews2.0 PoorRob, Jan 2025Intermediate SUVDo not rent from Infiniti car rental. Literally the worst rental experience I've ever had anywhere in the world. It's not located in the airport as listed on the site. You have to download WhatsApp, message them, and then they come and find you. Then you wait for their shuttle and then they take you to their sketchy place down an industrial road on the outskirts of the airport 15 minutes away. Once there they do the bait and switch tactic which is 100 bucks for the rental but it was 400 for insurance and that was after me chiseling them down from 500. By this point you have no choice but to rent from them because you're in the middle of nowhere. As if thatwasn't bad enough, the rental car itself was the biggest Chinese POS. The brakes pulsated heavily, there were scratches and rust dimples on the car even though it had 30,000 km on it. They gave it to me with one bar showing on the gas meter, and said it had to be returned the same way. They basically want you to overfill it because they're cheap. Besides that the car transmission was like a wind up car, the headlights weren't adjusted so they pointed straight down and I had to use my highbeams the whole time, junk. Junk. Junk. I hope everyone reads this review and runs as far as they can from this rental car company.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Sep 2024Intermediate SUVNever and never again. After a trip of 20 hours with 3 kids you want to get to your hotel. The pick up took long and when we came there we needed to pay 5 times more then what we booked for and if we didn’t pay we did not get the car. They you are with 3 kids who are tried and want to sleep. Then you get a car what you did not order. Ordered a jeep renegade or similar what do we get a toyota avanza family car what everyday popped up that it needed service. They did not had something else. So no never and never again.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jun 2024Passenger vanI had to pay additional $80! for insurance (rental price was 125$!), ridiculous!! They wanted me to give a van (12pax) 10+years old, even left front light and indicator didn’t work. Than they gave me a new van (7pax) - the pickup took me more than 4h and the owner only offer to reimburse the fare difference of $20, nothing else and even the $20 they want a Mexican account to transfer in pesos (360mx), they never did until today. First & last time I booked through KAYAK.4.0 MediocreJose, Mar 2024Intermediate SUVThere was too much added prices to finale price2.0 PoorAnonymous, Mar 2024Intermediate SUVThey took the money and they never show up to pick us up from aireport.

It's a scam.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Feb 2024Intermediate SUVThe pick up experience was atrocious. From beginning to end it lasted over two hours. The vehicle I had rented was not available for me or any of the other guests that were there. Instead, they were offering little cars instead of the SUV promised. (in fact I did not see this particular model of car anywhere in Cancun so I doubt they have it in the first place). I was met with the most horrible customer service from the rental car agent, Angel. He was arrogant and condescending. Raising his voice at me, and being just simply mean for no reason. I’ll never forget his rudeness and his desire to make my experience as bad as possible. The only positive note is that after completely insisting on a taller car due to driving around my elderly parents, he gave in and gave me a small SUV that they had. This car was mechanically damaged but in the end, it did what I needed it to do.
