I was impressed with thoughtful in-room amenities like the high-tech air purifier and complimentary pool slippers.And while the hotel is not located directly on the beach, there’s an hourly hotel shuttle that whisks you to the beach where access to two beach chairs and a beach umbrella await.Check pricesCheck pricesConrad Fort Lauderdale BeachRank #2$295-$1,145/night551 North Fort Lauderdale Beach BoulevardThis 290-room all-suite condo resort pays tribute to Fort Lauderdale’s celebrated waterways and yachting industry....Learn moreThis 290-room all-suite condo resort pays tribute to Fort Lauderdale’s celebrated waterways and yachting industry.

The resort is only 3 miles from the boulevard.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Kimpton Shorebreak Fort Lauderdale Beach ResortRank #7$134-$593/night2900 Riomar StreetLocated a few blocks from Fort Lauderdale Beach, this Kimpton resort exhibit’s the hospitality brand’s distinctive,...Learn moreLocated a few blocks from Fort Lauderdale Beach, this Kimpton resort exhibit’s the hospitality brand’s distinctive, design-forward aesthetic with a zen-like coastal flare.

The building’s curved silhouette, fresh white materials, and clean contemporary lines designed by architect Kobi Karp are inspired by the city’s yachting heritage, winding waterways, and lively streets.The hotel’s ocean sun deck overlooks the ocean across the street and is home to two horizon-edge pools and the hotel’s glossy restaurant. Serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, the hotel’s restaurant – Evelyn’s – has a nautical interior design and serves eastern Mediterranean meets coastal cuisine.I highly recommend the luxurious spa offers treatments like the Signature Ebb & Flow Massage that employs harmonic healing sound bowls, aromatic oils, and a combination of Swedish massage and Thai stretching techniques.Check pricesCheck pricesCambria Hotel Fort Lauderdale BeachRank #10$110-$439/night2231 North Ocean BoulevardThis is one of the newest properties on Fort Lauderdale beach and offers an affordable option on the strip.
