They didn’t have cars for around 15 people who came on time for their reservations. They refused to take responsibility and snapped at us for getting upset. We had ever right to be. We made reservations and paid ahead of time. They told us they had no cars. There were none in any location in all of the city. How a car company whose sole business is focused on renting and reserving cars could operate this way is beyond me. Absolute clowns. Their initial solution was to tell people to wait and “see” for up to 3 hours if a car would become available. That’s insane. I ended up having to go book a car at an airport in New Jersey for double the price. Horrible. I’ll never trust Hertz again.10.0 WonderfulAnonymous, Jul 2025CompactPerfect! Couldn’t be better.

I was trying to be helpful, but I couldn’t guarantee I could return an electric car charged, so I avoided the electric managers choice option, but they still tried to give me one. I had to pay more to get a non-electric car, when I could’ve paid the same if I had just picked a specific gas car originally. Also the return was really weird. Someone without any hertz clothing or ID tried to have me give him the keys in White Plains.Back1 out of 86NextBudget5.9FairRead 411 reviewsCleanliness6.7Comfort6.8Pick-up/Drop-off5.8Value for money6.18 locations in New YorkShow locationsBudget reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in New York142 East 31st Street+1 212 661 5906Monday07:00 - 23:00Tuesday07:00 - 23:00Wednesday07:00 - 23:00Thursday07:00 - 23:00Friday07:00 - 23:00Saturday07:00 - 23:00Sunday07:00 - 23:00220 East 9th Street+1 212 477 7180Monday07:00 - 23:00Tuesday07:00 - 23:00Wednesday07:00 - 23:00Thursday07:00 - 23:00Friday07:00 - 23:00Saturday07:00 - 23:00Sunday07:00 - 23:00222 East 44th Street+1 646 559 6552Monday07:00 - 23:00Tuesday07:00 - 23:00Wednesday07:00 - 23:00Thursday07:00 - 23:00Friday07:00 - 23:00Saturday07:00 - 23:00Sunday07:00 - 23:00300 East 87th Street+1 212 289 3920Monday07:00 - 23:00Tuesday07:00 - 23:00Wednesday07:00 - 23:00Thursday07:00 - 23:00Friday07:00 - 23:00Saturday07:00 - 23:00Sunday07:00 - 23:00304 West 49th Street+1 212 397 4375Monday07:00 - 23:00Tuesday07:00 - 23:00Wednesday07:00 - 23:00Thursday07:00 - 23:00Friday07:00 - 23:00Saturday07:00 - 23:00Sunday07:00 - 23:00331 West 58th Street+1 212 444 7310Monday07:00 - 23:00Tuesday07:00 - 23:00Wednesday07:00 - 23:00Thursday07:00 - 23:00Friday07:00 - 23:00Saturday07:00 - 23:00Sunday07:00 - 23:0088-08 23rd Avenue+1 718 639 6400Monday06:00 - 23:00Tuesday06:00 - 23:00Wednesday06:00 - 23:00Thursday06:00 - 23:00Friday06:00 - 23:00Saturday06:00 - 23:00Sunday06:00 - 23:00Building 305 Federal Circle+1 718 656 1890Monday05:30 - 23:30Tuesday05:30 - 23:30Wednesday05:30 - 23:30Thursday05:30 - 23:30Friday05:30 - 23:30Saturday05:30 - 23:30Sunday05:30 - 23:30FiltersWonderful (91)Very good (54)Good (4)Okay (37)Fair (8)Mediocre (54)Poor (163)Show reviews that mentioncar was cleancar availableget the carreturned the carfriendly staffpick up and dropcar smelledcustomer servicecar was dirtynever rentnext dayShow moreReviews2.0 PoorTaylor, Sep 2025Supplier choiceThere was a 2-hour line to pickup the car when we got to the airport. I had to cancel the reservation and book with Alamo (which, along with the 4 other car rental agencies, had a short line) to make our event on time. The Alamo agent told me that Budget does this every day, by offering low teaser rates without disclosing that you'll have to wait 2-hours+ to pick up the vehicle.

This was after a 10 hour flight from Rome. Then we got to drive 3 hours in the rain through NYC traffic. Avoid this place like the plague. The inefficiency of this place makes the DMV seem like a dream vacation. Employees were totally inept at their jobs. Sometimes only one would work at a time with a line out the door. Conversations at the window were taking forever. Cars were not ready. Some were unavailable. So so bad. Trenton Airport drop off was a complete 180. Parked the car. Have them my keys and left. He asked how my trip was. I asked him if he’d ever been to the JFK location. He cringed. He knew.
