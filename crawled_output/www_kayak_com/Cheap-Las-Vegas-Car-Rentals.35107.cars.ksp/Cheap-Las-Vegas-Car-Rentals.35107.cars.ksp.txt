You can drive to the nation’s first and largest National Recreation Area, Lake Mead, in under an hour. The first National Park Service monument dedicated to Ice Age fossil preservation, Tule Springs, is just 30 minutes north of the resorts.

You can drive to the nation’s first and largest National Recreation Area, Lake Mead, in under an hour. The first National Park Service monument dedicated to Ice Age fossil preservation, Tule Springs, is just 30 minutes north of the resorts.
Red Rock and Valley of Fire are both easy drives, too, and more and more people are visiting Las Vegas for outdoor sports. You can get to many of these places on organized tours that will pick you up right at your hotel. But if you want to keep your own schedule, and even see multiple places in a day, you’ll want to rent a car.Licensing and mandatory paperwork to rent a car in Las VegasDrivers from the US, US territories and Canada need a valid driver’s license and a credit card to rent in Las Vegas. The license needs to be valid...Learn moreDrivers from the US, US territories and Canada need a valid driver’s license and a credit card to rent in Las Vegas. The license needs to be valid for the whole period of your rental and can’t be a digital license. International visitors coming from non-English-speaking countries whose languages are written in the Latin alphabet (like Spanish, German, and Italian) should carry an International Driver’s Permit along with their license. Travelers whose licenses are printed in a non-Latin-based alphabet must carry an IDP for translation along with their license. But it’s important to note that car companies won’t rent to you with only an IDP, since it’s not a substitute.Types of cars available for rent in Las VegasRental prices have historically been relatively low in Vegas since the market for rentals is huge and competitive. All the major rental companies...Learn moreRental prices have historically been relatively low in Vegas since the market for rentals is huge and competitive. All the major rental companies are here, as well as smaller regional players. Typically, SUVs are popular, so expect to pay a premium, if you can find them. If you want to get behind the wheel of your dream car, Las Vegas is your city. Multiple car rental agencies rent exotic cars like McLarens, Ferraris, and Lamborghinis in town, and you can even rent a Rolls Royce Cullinan (the SUV version of the Phantom). Many will drop off your ride at your hotel; some national agencies rent exotics right from the airport; and some will rent to you for as few as four hours—just long enough to impress a date.Where to rent a car in Las Vegas AirportIf you’re budget-minded, choosing where to rent a car in Las Vegas may require a little math. On the one hand, there’s a huge, dedicated car...Learn moreIf you’re budget-minded, choosing where to rent a car in Las Vegas may require a little math. On the one hand, there’s a huge, dedicated car rental building just a couple of miles from the airport served by free shuttles and it’s open 24/7. Its rates are often lower than anything you can rent from your hotel. Here’s the catch: You’ll pay airport-specific fees like a concession recovery fee and customer facility charge, and that’s on top of the 10% state government surcharge, sales tax for car rentals of over 8%, an additional 2% Clark County rental tax and a flat $4 per day consumer facility charge. You can get out of the state government charge and facility charge by going off-property – but your daily rates might be higher. The fees and surcharges in casinos can be even higher, without the competitive airport rates.Driving your Las Vegas rental car out of stateMost rental car companies don’t restrict driving across state lines, and some will impose a one-way fee if you’re dropping off in another state....Learn moreMost rental car companies don’t restrict driving across state lines, and some will impose a one-way fee if you’re dropping off in another state. Still, check car companies’ policies on rentals. For instance, some companies have territorial restrictions and allow you to take the car only to Arizona, California, and Utah.What to know about car insurance in Las VegasYou should always carry ample insurance, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you need to buy it from car rental agencies. Rental car companies do...Learn moreYou should always carry ample insurance, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you need to buy it from car rental agencies. Rental car companies do provide minimum required liability coverage of $25,000 in bodily injury and $20,000 in property damage coverage. But if you already carry a car insurance policy with collision or comprehensive coverage (which pays to replace or repair your rental car) or higher liability than Nevada’s minimum, that will cover you in a rental car. You might also already have coverage through the credit card you used to book the car, health insurance, travel insurance, a personal injury policy, home insurance or an umbrella policy.
It pays to look at your own coverage before you get to the rental counter. Rental agencies sell collision or loss damage waivers, which can be a good idea if you don’t have a credit card with rental car coverage, or even if you have it through your car insurance but don’t want your premium to rise if you’ve caused an accident. Like the majority of states, Nevada is a fault state, which means the at-fault driver picks up the tab.

Unlike the good...Learn moreHotel casinos have toyed with charging for parking over the years, adding it and then taking away charges when guests complained. Unlike the good old days when even valet parking was free, most hotels now charge for it – some up to $40. Some hotels provide free parking for loyal guests with a player card. In other words, it’s a mixed bag and charges seem to change on a dime. It’s best to check with your hotel directly before you arrive. Off the Strip, parking is plentiful and generally free.Fuel and gas stations in Las VegasNevada and all the states near and touching the West Coast have some of the highest fuel prices in the country, and there’s no remedy for that...Learn moreNevada and all the states near and touching the West Coast have some of the highest fuel prices in the country, and there’s no remedy for that except renting a fuel-efficient, smaller car. However, as in most tourist-heavy cities, you’re likely to find the lowest prices away from the resort corridor and in residential neighborhoods. You can save on gas if you’re a member of big box stores like Costco and Sam’s Club, which discount their fuel for cardholders.When to get a rental car in Las VegasThe rental car industry, like the hotel industry, uses dynamic rental pricing; in other words, on holidays, during a huge convention or trade...Learn moreThe rental car industry, like the hotel industry, uses dynamic rental pricing; in other words, on holidays, during a huge convention or trade show, or other event, prices will almost inevitably skyrocket. So, just like for hotels, you might want to look at the city’s convention calendar while you’re planning your trip, especially if your dates are flexible.Booking InsightsGood to knowMost popular agencyMost popular car typeAverage priceGood dealAceStandard$50/day$40/dayKAYAK’s insights & trends for Las Vegas car rentalsCheck out the latest trends and booking tips to rent a car in Las Vegas with confidence.How far in advance should you book a rental car in Las Vegas?You should book your rental car in Las Vegas around 7 days before your trip in order to get a below-average price.What is the cheapest car rental company in Las Vegas?In the past 72 hours, the cheapest rental cars were found at Easirent ($7.84/day), Hertz ($14.33/day) and Fox ($20.36/day).

For example, at some intersections, a flashing yellow left arrow indicates that you are allowed to turn left, but only after yielding to pedestrians or other traffic. After the flashing yellow, the signal may change to a solid green or solid yellow light. A solid green light is a standard left turn signal, while a solid yellow light means that a red light is imminent. Additionally, Interstate 15 is known for frequent traffic jams and accidents, often due to unclear road signs, constant road construction, heavy tourist traffic, and intoxicated driving. Be sure to pay extra attention when driving on I-15.Finding parking for cheap car rentals in Las Vegas can be tricky depending on where you go. If you're traveling around the Las Vegas Strip in the evening, keep an eye out for free parking spots on some streets after 6:00 p.m. If you can't find any, consider going to one of the parking garages. Typically, hotels offer free parking to guests; otherwise, it can range from $1 to $20. To avoid the hassle of searching for a spot, especially on busy weekend nights, it’s advisable to splurge a bit on valet service—don’t forget to tip the valet as well.No visit to Las Vegas is complete without a trip to the Strip.

Congestion can become quite severe during the morning rush (from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.) and in the afternoon (from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.). On weekends, after 4:00 p.m., there is also a separate tourist rush that fills the streets again. For standard workweek traffic, I-15 and US 95 should be avoided if possible, as they are two of the most heavily impacted highways during rush hour.Although the Las Vegas Strip offers plenty of entertainment, the areas outside the city center also provide many outdoor activities, making it important to find affordable car rentals in Las Vegas.

We had to scramble, make another reservation with Enterprise, settle for a lesser car (but it was still nice) and then pay a taxi to shuttle us, with luggage, to a different Enterprise Car Rental location. Needless to say, I need Kayak to reimburse me for the reservation because a participating vendor of Kayak never communicated with us that there location closes by noon on Saturday in a city that doesn’t begin to come alive until noon ore 1:00.

Office was closed at 5pm. Sixt refused to refund me at first, then tried to subject me to a $200 cancelation fee because of their mistake, which was almost the entire rental price. They refused to put a manager on the phone after the customer service agent said that was my only option. What a joke, never going back.

Thanks again!10.0 WonderfulAnonymous, Feb 2025MinivanSimple easy booking and get the car without line up. Easy drop off n go. Very good service8.0 Very goodAndrea, Oct 2024Standard SUVI would recommend a much clearer description of where the car is picked up and dropped off. In Vegas the rental car desk and vehicles were parked at the airport which is what I thought. However, Sixt is NOT on site in Salt Lake. That was a big issue and was not clear when I booked. I might have chose a different rental company if I’d known this. Also, since we were renting for 6 weeks this added extra taxes and a two invoice system that was not invoiced properly. Basically, the car was great but the admin side was not. Trying to speak to someone live on the phone to correct the incorrect invoicing was frustrating and took hours. There was an employee in Salt Lake I wanted to mention (The Austin) who went out of his way to help us. He explained the two invoice system, apologized for the confusion since we had driven all the way to the airport to be told it was offsite.

Everything relating to the reservation indicated I was getting a Hyundai Accent or similar. When I arrived at the pickup location (that I had to Uber to from the airport) I was told they don't have that kind of vehicle at that location and all they had was a Jeep Compass. I chose my vehicle based on unlimited mileage and MPG. The Jeep has an estimated highway MPG of 32 and the Hyundai has an estimated highway MPG of 41 - the 9 MPG difference cost me an estimated $35 more in gas purchased. Additionally, not being accustomed to driving a larger vehicle made it uncomfortable when maneuvering. If I had known what Budget was going to stick me with, I would have selected a different rental car company.2.0 PoorAna, Jul 2025CompactI was not informed that the location closed early. It’s Las Vegas and most places are open 24 hours. When my flight arrived and we got to the pick up location, it was closed.

I ended up renting with another company and was unable to get the Budget vehicle that I had previously reserved.6.0 OkayMichael, Jul 2025Supplier choicePick up was very poor.

The woman asked me a few questions, she put me on a very brief hold, she had a tow truck on its way to pick up the vehicle. He was there in less than 30 minutes and gave me a ride to the nearest airport. He escorted me to the counter and spoke with manager. He left and I got a replacement vehicle and I was on my way in 20 minutes. I was so impressed with the efficiency and no hassles. This entire process was less than 2 hours including drive time.

Two days before travel I called the Las Vegas thrifty to confirm again. Imagine the surprise when I arrived to find that I was assigned a minivan instead of the Ford transit I had booked and was told I could not rent it there and return it in Salt Lake City without paying an additional $800. The nice lady showed me the booking and it was the code for a minivan. A minivan is not equivalent to the Transit. I had seven adults and luggage which I why I rented such an expensive vehicle through this site.

Apparently they are not fast, and they were short staffed, and had no backup plan, so they were catastrophically slow.

I did not have a US telephone number which meant that they couldn’t send me a verification text message. They insisted I walk to a gas station and buy a SIM card which is totally unacceptable. I ended up buying an eSIM with a digital US phone number only to then be told it won’t work.

Car smelled like wet dog. We stopped at an auto parts store and purchased some air sanitizer to help get rid of the smell. My friends were getting nauseous because of it. And we could not use the A/C because it made it worse. Luckily we didn’t have to drive far when we were in the car.6.0 OkayAnonymous, Nov 2023Supplier choice$500 deposit on credit card required. Only allowed to go to specific states. Was not aware of either of these when making booking. Facility was dirty and run down. Chipped, dirty tile, sloppy paint job. Customer service was poor. Employee was difficult to understand because he was speaking so quickly. Had to ask him to repeat himself 3-4 times during the basic conversation. I selected “rental agency’s choice” for my car. They told me I would be in a minivan then tried to upsell me to a Nissan versa. I declined. They gave me the keys and sent me outside without telling me where the car was. Told me to hit the lock button and find it myself. Went looking for my mini van. There wasn’t one in the parking lot. Came back inside and the employee pointed towards the corner of the lot where I saw a versa. At this point I realized they’d given me a versa and never had a mini van available. It had only been offered in an attempt to upsell. The car had scrapes on the bumper. It smelled like cigarette smoke and the windshield was visibility dirty. They also sent an extremely confusing series of charges and invoices after I returned the rental. Ended up having to pay $90 for gas. It also appeared I’d been charged $400 but they were actually returning the deposit. Got two separate charges for the gas so maybe they charged me twice. I tried calling them multiple times but their automated line say to email. I emailed this morning and haven’t heard back yet. I will not be renting from this agency again. They were the cheapest but everything about it felt very sketchy and unprofessional. I’ll pay 20% more to avoid dealing with this company again. I was especially nervous about renting a car that came with scratches and a cigarette smoke smell because I didn’t want to be charged for the prior renter’s infraction. The bigger agencies would never send a car out like that.10.0 WonderfulAnonymous, Oct 2023MinivanIt was so nice10.0 WonderfulAnonymous, Sep 2023MinivanGood experiencePayless5.7FairRead 65 reviewsCleanliness7.1Comfort7.0Pick-up/Drop-off5.8Value for money6.3One location in Las Vegasfrom$44/dayPayless reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Las Vegas7135 Gilespie Street+1 702 531 1569Monday00:00 - 23:5905:00 - 23:59Tuesday00:00 - 23:5905:00 - 23:59Wednesday05:00 - 23:5900:00 - 23:59Thursday00:00 - 23:5905:00 - 23:59Friday00:00 - 23:5905:00 - 23:59Saturday00:00 - 23:5905:00 - 23:59Sunday05:00 - 23:5900:00 - 23:59FiltersReviews2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jun 2024LuxuryHave the car we ordered clean and ready2.0 PoorRyan, Apr 2024IntermediateLate flight got in at 1am.
