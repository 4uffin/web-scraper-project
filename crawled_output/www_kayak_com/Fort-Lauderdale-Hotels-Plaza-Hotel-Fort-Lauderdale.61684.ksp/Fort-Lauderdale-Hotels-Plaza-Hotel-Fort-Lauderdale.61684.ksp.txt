It is a relatively short 9.3 miles from the center of Fort Lauderdale and only 8.8 miles from Lauderdale Beach. This gives guests access to a wide range of activities and attractions.
However, there may be no need to leave the property at all. The fitness center can help guests stay in shape and there is even a hair salon at which guests can spruce up their doo. Inside, there is an arcade for hours of fun for young and old alike, and outside lie tennis courts for some one-on-one exercise.
The rooms feature convenient coffee makers and free Wi-Fi. Children who are less than 17 years old are able to stay for free if they are accompanied by an adult. The atmosphere is similarly welcoming, focusing on relaxation while sprinkling the experience with a touch of style. Rooms look out to the gorgeously kept grounds and the lines and architectural choices are simple, yet comfortable.
Beau Alexander’s Bar and Grill provides the food. Delectable offerings including naturally raised meats and fresh produce abound. There is also a buffet option for guests to get what they want—and all they want of it. A visit to South Florida would not be complete without a relaxing cocktail, and Beau Alexander’s Bar and Grill has a nice selection for a variety of tastes.
The local area benefits from the Plaza Hotel Fort Lauderdale as much as the hotel benefits from the gifts of the area. It serves as a perfect launch point for exploring Fort Lauderdale while providing just enough space for some extra relaxation.
