While driving within the city can be a nuisance, thanks to Seattle’s unpredictable traffic, apps like Google Maps and Waze can help you plan around rush hours or accidents.

While driving within the city can be a nuisance, thanks to Seattle’s unpredictable traffic, apps like Google Maps and Waze can help you plan around rush hours or accidents. And once you get out of the city, the car allows you to find your own private trail in the Cascade Foothills, take a day trip to Mt. Rainier, or hop a ferry to the small towns or national park on the Olympic Peninsula.What you need to rent a car in SeattleBy law, you can use a valid driver’s license from any country to rent a car in Seattle, though if it is in a foreign language, you may need a...Learn moreBy law, you can use a valid driver’s license from any country to rent a car in Seattle, though if it is in a foreign language, you may need a translation or International Driver’s Permit as well. Individual rental companies may have more restrictive policies, though, so it’s best to check ahead of time.
The law also requires renters to be at least 21 years of age, though some agencies require renters to be 25 or charge an extra fee for those under 25.
Most rental car companies will not accept cash payment, and require either a credit or debit card, on which they may put a security hold – if you are tight on funds, make sure you know how much they might freeze. You do not need to have personal auto insurance to rent a car, but if you don’t have it, make sure to purchase adequate insurance from the rental agency to protect you in case of an accident.What kind of car to rent in SeattleWith Seattle’s bad traffic and difficult parking, a small car is best for in-city driving. However, if you plan to head into the mountains, you...Learn moreWith Seattle’s bad traffic and difficult parking, a small car is best for in-city driving. However, if you plan to head into the mountains, you will want something bigger and heavier to get to hiking trailheads, campsites, or ski areas. In winter, you will need to either carry chains (and know how to install them) or have a four-wheel-drive vehicle to drive over any of the mountain passes east of the city. Most rental car agencies carry many smaller cars and only a few larger ones, so make sure to reserve and confirm if you need anything bigger than standard size.Where to rent a car in SeattleMost major rental car agencies have an office just outside Learn moreMost major rental car agencies have an office just outside Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA). To get to them, you follow signs to rental car shuttles, which pick up frequently between the main airport building and the parking garage. If you’ll need a car throughout your trip or are staying somewhere with affordable parking, renting at the airport would be the easiest way.
If you are staying at a Downtown or Capitol Hill hotel, where parking can be as expensive (or more) as the daily car rental fee, you may want to wait and rent from a rental agency Downtown just for the time you really need a car.Taking a rental car out of SeattleIf you plan to head into the mountains or across the border to Canada, make sure to double-check with your rental car company. Most permit cars to...Learn moreIf you plan to head into the mountains or across the border to Canada, make sure to double-check with your rental car company. Most permit cars to cross the border, but some may require extra paperwork. Few rental cars allow for off-road driving, so if you plan to get out into the wilds of Mt. Rainier National Park or onto the beaches of the Olympic Peninsula, make sure you know where you can or can’t go.What you should know about driving in SeattleSeattle drivers mostly take heat from outsiders for their passive (and sometimes passive-aggressive) driving: They rarely use their horns, will...Learn moreSeattle drivers mostly take heat from outsiders for their passive (and sometimes passive-aggressive) driving: They rarely use their horns, will almost always let someone in, and sometimes forget to take their turn at a four-way stop.
That makes it pretty easy for a newcomer to make their way around the city, especially since they will likely need to rely on that kindness when the one-way streets and random left-hand exits from the freeway trip them up. A friendly wave always helps, though.
Washington has very strict safety laws, including that every passenger wear a seatbelt, and that driving a car with a minor not belted has particularly severe consequences for the driver. Children under 4’9” are required to use a booster-style car seat and children under age two must be in a rear-facing car seat.
The speed limit on city streets, unless otherwise posted, is 25 mph. Watch out for school zones, which bring it down to 20 mph and are often monitored by a camera that automatically sends hefty tickets – and yes, the rental car company will pass that cost on to you. All local toll booths are also operated by camera, so expect to receive a bill for those from the rental car company.What to know about parking in SeattleIn outer neighborhoods, parking tends to be easy to find and mostly free. However, in Downtown, Capitol Hill, Fremont, Ballard, the...Learn moreIn outer neighborhoods, parking tends to be easy to find and mostly free. However, in Downtown, Capitol Hill, Fremont, Ballard, the Chinatown-International District, and other popular destination neighborhoods, parking is very limited. If you can find street parking, it may be limited to an hour or two and cost $1 to $5 per hour. You can either pay at the kiosks on each street or by using the PayByPhone app and entering the location number. Private lots in most busy areas charge slightly more than street parking but are generally easier to park in and don’t have time limits. Hotels generally charge $20-50 for parking, depending on location, season, and if they are valet or self-park.How to get gas in SeattleGas stations dot nearly every neighborhood, though they are scarcer in dense neighborhoods, like Downtown.

All gas stations are self-serve, and you can either pay with a credit card right at the pump or go inside to pay cash. Outside the city, freeway exits with gas stations are usually well-marked. Make sure to fill the tank before returning the car to avoid paying a huge markup to the rental agency.Seasonal driving tips for SeattleIt rarely snows in the city, but if it does, do not try to drive. The freeze-thaw cycle of snow in a marine climate combined with the steep roads...Learn moreIt rarely snows in the city, but if it does, do not try to drive. The freeze-thaw cycle of snow in a marine climate combined with the steep roads turns Seattle into a downhill ice-skating rink – only cars don’t have razor-sharp blades. The city pretty much shuts down with significant snowfall, so you won’t have anywhere to go anyway. Even if you consider yourself an expert snow driver from your winter on Canada’s Ice Road, you do not want to be on Seattle streets in the snow because nobody else out there will be.Booking InsightsGood to knowMost popular agencyMost popular car typeAverage priceGood dealDollarStandard$58/day$48/dayKAYAK’s insights & trends for Seattle car rentalsCheck out the latest trends and booking tips to rent a car in Seattle with confidence.How far in advance should you book a rental car in Seattle?You should book your rental car in Seattle around 2 days before your trip in order to get a below-average price.What is the cheapest car rental company in Seattle?In the past 72 hours, the cheapest rental cars were found at Fox ($15.19/day), Thrifty ($17.42/day) and Hertz ($26.46/day).

Your auto insurance company likely covers the rental car and if it doesn’t your credit card might. Check before you purchase extra insurance from the agency. So many extra fees! Try to rent outside the airport if you can.krrishJul 2023Please take your full insurance its better to be get paid some bucks before rather than regret after and believe me its really worth it because if you are going in the group and if the car is under your name they step back for money if anything happens even your are not drivingVerified travelerJul 2023Seattle traffic is bad but not as bad as we had heard.

They don’t show as default route options in Google Maps or Apple Maps.Verified travelerAug 2023I learned to drive in Houston.

If you’re flying into Seattle, downtown is only a 13-mile drive away. Once you land, finding the car rental office is a breeze. You can use the 24-hour shuttle buses or head to the passenger pick-up areas in the main terminal, located outside baggage claim at the north or south ends.When visiting the beautiful city of Seattle, it’s important to be aware of Washington state’s seatbelt laws before heading out in a rental car. For children, any child up to the age of two must ride in a secured rear-facing car seat. Children between the ages of two and four must use a car seat with a harness. Children over four years old need to use a booster seat until they are at least 4'9" tall. It is recommended that children over 13 ride in the back seat. All passengers in a vehicle are required to wear a seatbelt while the vehicle is in motion.As a new driver in the city, you need to be aware of Seattle’s often busy and one-way streets. When driving on residential streets, keep your eyes on the road as two lanes often merge into one. It’s also important to remember that pedestrians expect you to stop for them at crosswalks. Fortunately, local drivers tend to be considerate; however, as this is a busy city, you may need to navigate a few tricky situations, including narrow streets, hills, and rainy weather.If you’re not in a rush to explore Seattle, you won’t be as affected by the slow traffic that can build up on some of the busier streets, particularly in the metropolitan areas. The best time to avoid driving around Seattle is later in the week, especially on Fridays. During the morning rush hour, between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., traffic will be heavier going into Seattle. In the evening, between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., traffic is heavier leaving Seattle. Thankfully, Seattle has several traffic cameras positioned around its roads, helping you monitor the freeway and other congested intersections.Since Seattle is in Washington state and close to the Canadian border, people renting cars in Seattle often wonder if they can take the vehicle into Canada. Most major car rental companies in Seattle do allow this, but it's important to inform your rental company of your plans so they can provide you with a Canadian non-resident insurance card. While some rental companies may allow one-way rentals to Canada, it’s best to confirm this with your rental company in advance.One of the reasons many people visit Seattle is for the great annual events that take place here. Since many of these events are not located in the heart of Seattle, renting a car is a convenient option.

In April, many people travel to Seattle to enjoy the Tulip Festival, and in early July, many visit the south side of Seattle for the Fourth of July festival by the water.Ready to rent a car for your trip to Seattle?

We book a bmw suv, but he was going to give me a 4 doors sedan, a much smaller car. His excuse was that they didn’t have the suv I booked. He said I either get a smaller car or he would cancel my reservation. I asked him if I could talk to his manager but he was rude and waked away. He walked back 5 minutes later and said he checked but there was still no suv. He sternly said if I didn’t like the smaller car, he would cancel my reservation and stated I had no other options. I once again said if he didn’t give me the suv I booked I would report him to kayak since he wouldn’t let me talk to his manager. He then realized I wouldn’t give in so he finally gave me the suv I booked. His excuse was that the car wasn’t available earlier. However, he also gave me the option earlier if I wanted the suv, I would have to pay more. The car was obviously there the entire time but he didn’t want to honor my reservation.

They called and left a message the day before telling me to call before I went to the office because they did not have any cars and did not know if they would have any cars the following morning either. I called and was informed that they still did not have any cars, and did not know when they would get any, despite knowing that cars were available at the airport. So my option was to wait until they had cars with no timeline attached, or go directly to the airport. The reason I chose that office is because it was close to where I was going to be and if I went to the airport, I might as well have stayed there all day as I had a flight that night. The whole reason for getting a car was to have transportation and enjoy Seattle for a day before my flight home.
