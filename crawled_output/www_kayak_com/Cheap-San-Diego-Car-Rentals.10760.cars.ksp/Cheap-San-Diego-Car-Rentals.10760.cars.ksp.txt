We took the Rental Shuttle from airport to Avis only to find out our car was at a different Avis location for pick upTrenardJul 2025Verify the car rental facility is ACTUALLY at the airportVerified travelerAug 2025Make sure the rental is for San Diego not Tijuana.saApr 2025I recommend a mid-size or larger vehicle, much easier to merge onto Freeways with a bigger engine. Check gas prices before re-fuelling, there can be a big price variance.Verified travelerApr 2025Double check that your rental company is at the rental terminal if you are arriving through San Diego international! There is a free shuttle from the airport to the rental area.EvelineMay 2025Be aware that not all the rental car companies at the airport are located at the rental car station. For some like U Save you two to then request a second pickup. Even calling in can be difficult. This will add to your delays and travel time, possibly not worth the savings.Verified travelerApr 2025There are no gas stations on the way to the airport so top up early and leave yourself time to check the car in — response can be slow.Verified travelerApr 2025Plan time accordingly. You have to wait for an uber to pick you up from airport. Lines upon arrival/departure. Shuttle back that comes every 30-40 min.Verified travelerApr 2025If you’re trying to book at the airport for convenience, double check that the rental company is at the San Diego Rental Car Facility and not off site.Verified travelerMar 2025With current fuel prices at $4-6 per gallon, economy is bestVerified travelerMay 2025Make sure the company has vehicles before renting through third partyVerified travelerApr 2025Use someone else. If you absolutely need to rent from them, make sure you can arrive before they close and also make sure you have an old school credit card where the credit card number is visible on the card (no Apple Card, no mobile payments). Without that, they will not rent to you. Stupid.ShawnDec 2024Check out the Turo app. There was a lot of options at decent prices. We paid ~50 a day for a Honda CR-V. The only issue is that you have to go to where the vehicle is located (usually at someone's house).Verified travelerFeb 2025Use a national brand if you are in a hurry. The off,offsite ones can take time.KonstantinJan 2025Rent from big well-known companies and look at their reviews and Ratings Before you rent.ChristineJan 2025Make sure they actual have a car for the day of your bookingVerified travelerJan 2025go early in morning if pissible. no lineVerified travelerNov 2024For convenience, get a rental at the airport, don't use this company. For the price, it was the best price for a rental vehicle there was but getting there, is a difficult transition.Verified travelerSep 2024Pay attention to parking signs, look out for one ways, and give yourself enough time to go to each place.Verified travelerSep 2024In San Diego, a midsize sedan or a small suv. Bigger can be difficult to find parking.Verified travelerOct 2024Book at least two days ahead so you can use a kioskVerified travelerOct 2024Call the rental company directly to make sure they have cars available.Verified travelerSep 2024If you can, rent from a place not at the airport to save money on the airport tax/fees (38%!). Look over your receipt very carefully - Payless employees will try to scam you.Verified travelerJun 2024EVs are great in SD (at least Teslas). Lots of superchargers and if you charge after midnight, it's pretty cheap. Even drove to and around LA for a day and then back. Cost about $25 total - that's about the same as 5 gallons of gas for a lot of driving. $9 to top off at a charger near the Santa Monica Pier, and then $16 at a supercharger back in SD.DougJun 2024Prepare to wait — and possibly settle for less — to get their very discounted price. BTW, be advised SD car rentals add 35% Port Tax after/on top of advertised pricing.Verified travelerJul 2024Make sure your rental location is not near the Mexico border if you are flying into the San Diego International Airport.MatthewJun 2024Make sure to double-check the location if expecting a rental close to the airport.Verified travelerJul 2024Make sure you book your car from the airport rental center.Verified travelerAug 2024Make sure the hertz you pick up from isn’t closed.Cheryl LynnApr 2024Use your own insurance and get a small cer to save!Verified travelerApr 2024I would like to know any extra charges that would be tacked on upfront, not when I get handed the bill. Also If going to Mexico (Ensenada) Do I need insurance for Mexico and the United States or just Mexico? I was charged for both. Also If I don't go through an Airport should I get charged for it? And if I'm only using the car in Mexico should I get all of the charges for use in California or the USA?ColinMar 2024If you have proof of liability insurance with your own insurance provider, you can save some money. If you don't have documented proof, then you have to purchase.BenjaminMay 2024Make sure that the online site you rent through schedules your pick-up @ the location you want. You cannot assume that the address is the right location!!Verified travelerMar 2024Be sure to verify the car you are getting. We arrived and only choice was mini van and we reserved SUV.Verified travelerApr 2024Make sure the rental car company is located at the rental car shuttle drop off not a different location.AngieApr 2024Go hybrid. Where we stayed didn't have a lot of charging options, plan aheadTonyApr 2024All rental cars are off site so plan accordingly.Verified travelerDec 2023Try to rent directly from the Company. Sometimes they have way better offers!Verified travelerDec 2023Close to the trolley. Very convenient.Verified travelerDec 2023Everyone was really really nice!!Verified travelerFeb 2024This location is about a 10 minute Uber ride from the airport. Thought it was at the airport when we booked. Was not a big issue, but something to keep in mind.Verified travelerJan 2024I learned to drive in San Diego. I am always surprised when I return to see the average speed everyone drives gets faster than previous visits. 15 mph over limit now.RicardoDec 2023Airport rentals come with an extra fee. Rent from non-airport location if possible.Verified travelerDec 2023Not sure how I feel about the car renting business right now.JanetDec 2023Don’t feel you have to upgrade just because the sales person at the desk tells you you need to. He’s just trying to upsell you and there’s no reason for it.PattiNov 2023Driving in San Diego is a breeze with a GPS. Avoid the major highways during rush hour and you’ll have no issues. All of the main attractions were within a short driving distance from our Airport- Harbor Island hotel Rent from a a major company - AVOID U-Save. It did save some $ but not worth the aggravation.Verified travelerOct 2023If you have car insurance then it most likely have rental car coverage. Dont bother buying extra insurance from the rental agencies. Always best to call your car ins company and check about the coverage then if the rental co tries to pile this on you have some knowledge to deny it.EnmanuelNov 2023Go to Avis, they are greatGaryNov 2023Make sure your rental company allows you to drive out of the area. Payless only lets you drive in SoCal, so I had to change to Thrifty at the last minute since I was doing a road trip to Colorado. Turn-in at San Diego is really easy for all rental agencies. The new car rental facility is really nice.KathleenSep 2023A little crazy compared to the midwest. Use navigation tools, with voice, and know that a slight right sometimes means a 360 degree turn. Also it will tell you to stay in the far right lane and 2 seconds later there are 2 new lanes on the right.Verified travelerOct 2023Park where you have plenty of room. My car was damaged in s hot and run while at a restaurant. Driving was fairly easy when using Google maps. Would not suggest going without proper map or directions.Verified travelerOct 2023Parking is limited in many areas and there may be charges for parking at hotels and restaurants, etc.Verified travelerOct 2023Make sure you don’t get charged overVerified travelerOct 2023Rent in advance and don't take no for an answer since most rental companies don't want to honour online rentalsMarkAug 2023Driving in San Diego is difficult only in that freeway traffic signage comes up quickly as the road are curvy....especially if the older highways.

We rented a car from Fox after the Economy disaster and that went very smooth.KatherineJul 2023I was not driving during rush hour so it was very easy.

There is one toll road in San Diego, the State Route 125, also known as the South Bay Expressway. You should know this before you find yourself driving along it. It’s possible to pay with the FasTrak system. You can check beforehand with your agency if this feature is available for your cheap car rentals in San Diego. Nonetheless, it’s also possible to pay with cash or a credit card at the toll booth, or within four days using the Pay-by-Plate option which has an extra processing fee.Although traffic is manageable, roads are usually fairly busy throughout San Diego, so avoid rush hours both in the morning (between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m.) and afternoon (between 4:00 and 6:00 pm) if you don't want to be stuck in traffic for longer than needed. Freeways along the coast also get pretty packed on weekends, especially the I-5.Driving around San Diego is the most convenient and comfortable way of getting to know all corners of the region, as the freeway system is fairly easy to navigate and traffic is manageable (aside from during rush hour). Because public transportation services are unreliable in the city, staying mobile by renting a car is the best option. It is also ideal for travelers looking to explore other destinations outside the city, such as the wine country of nearby Temecula, or those who want to embark on a road trip along the California coast.Although the freeway system isn't generally complicated, always have a map or a GPS on hand to help you. When driving downtown, beware of tourists or other reckless drivers who may be too used to driving in the city. If you’re interested in hopping across the border to Mexico, make sure you talk to your rental agency, as they may need to provide specific documentation, such as car insurance that is also valid in the neighboring country. But if your plan includes a day trip to Tijuana, it's easier to just park your car on the U.S. side of the border and walk across.All the big car rental agencies can be found in the San Diego International Airport (SAN), at the Consolidated Rental Car Center just outside the airport.

The Rental Car Center is located right off the Pacific Highway, adjacent to the San Diego International Airport (SAN). Nonetheless, the airport offers a free shuttle service to get you from your drop-off location to your departure terminal.

In the state of California, you’re able to make a right-hand turn on red.

But when I booked, I paid 85$ as quoted and when I got to the counter to pick up the car, I was charged another 200$ that would cover 150$ as a "return fee" that was not disclosed anywhere because I was picking the car up at San Diego and returning it in Phoenix. I don't mind paying a fee as long as it is disclosed ahead of time and I can fully make the decision to rent or not, by comparing with other services. The counter representative only explained that it would be refunded once the car was returned. I returned it the same it was rented, (Sat 5 of sept) and the money has not been refunded (as of 9/9 9:29am). Maybe I have to wait a little longer to get the refund but there was a lack of clarity from the representative to explain where in the contract that I was to sign, it stated that it was going to be refunded. I asked how I could be assured that the money was going to be refunded and the only response was that it would. The one thing I will praise was the car attendant that received the car in Sky harbor airport in Phoenix, I did not get his name but he was very helpful, and guided me out of the rental area at 11pm. Very kind of him. For safety, I will write to Fox to let them know that as I was braking in the winding downhill road towards Phoenix, the car wheel was trembling and I had to descend at less than 50mph to be able to keep the car stable, probably an issue with tire balance. Crossing my fingers I get the refund, but this should not be the case.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jul 2024Full-sizeMy flight was cancelled/delayed and Fox would not honor my reservation when I arrived.

Apparently there is a small municipal airport near the border with Tijuana and there is a Hertz car rental location there which came up in my search. Since I would not have expected this type of option to come up in my search parameters, I did not think there was a need to check the address of the rental location. A mistake I will never make again. However, I also will never be using Kayak or Hertz again. I will not be using Hertz mainly because the person at the rental counter in the actual San Diego airport location was not willing to help me other than to indicate that I was at the wrong location and that I should go to that other location if I would like my rental car.8.0 Very goodAdam, Jun 2024IntermediateOlder used car.

During the 3 day rental the hubcap fell off. Discovered it was barely attached and previously broken. Spent several hours of my vacation repairing the hubcap with epoxy and then was worried it would fall off again and I would have to pay some exorbitant amount for the repair. Learned a lesson for sure never to use Payless again.Ace3.9PoorRead 8 reviewsCleanliness4.8Comfort4.5Pick-up/Drop-off3.8Value for money4.12 locations in San DiegoAce reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in San Diego1002 West Juniper Street+1 619 323 3100Monday08:00 - 18:00Tuesday08:00 - 18:00Wednesday08:00 - 18:00Thursday08:00 - 18:00Friday08:00 - 18:00Saturday08:00 - 18:00Sunday08:00 - 18:002745 Otay Pacific Drive+1 619 591 9150Monday09:00 - 12:00Tuesday09:00 - 12:00Wednesday09:00 - 12:00Thursday09:00 - 12:00Friday09:00 - 12:00Saturday09:00 - 12:00Sunday09:00 - 12:00FiltersReviews2.0 PoorAnonymous, Dec 2020Pros:Nothing at all.Cons:To know that when you reserve through a third party, the companies do not abide by the contracts and the customers end up paying more for the product.

Their pickup location is so far that it took an hour to get to the rental counter. First a bus to the rental area, but since then a second pickup for which I waited 15 minutes. Definitely can't maximize. The car also was a cheaper non major brand with uncomfortable seats. The upside was the car didn't smell. If you're going to use an offsite (not at the airport rental section due to space limitations) I recommend NuCar (though check mileage) I used them before and they're friendlier. The problem is that on a short trip you lose an hour on pickup and need to plan to arrive at airport an hour earlier. I also felt this company had little flexibility (say to change the car if needed, that weren't time consuming) and confusing pickup systems. The counter guy read the policies clearly but fast like a robot.2.0 PoorSuzanne, May 2025EconomyU-Save Car Rental at San Diego Airport was a frustrating experience. Located off-site, it requires a shuttle pickup from the car rental center, but contacting them was nearly impossible. I called eight times, only to be routed through a confusing, multi-prompt system in LA. When I finally reached the San Diego line, it went to voicemail every time. No one answered, and I never got picked up. Forced to find another option, I rented from a different agency. Poor communication and unreliable service make U-Save a risky choice.2.0 PoorDamion, Feb 2025EconomyThey didn't have a car available so I had to rent from another carrier.
