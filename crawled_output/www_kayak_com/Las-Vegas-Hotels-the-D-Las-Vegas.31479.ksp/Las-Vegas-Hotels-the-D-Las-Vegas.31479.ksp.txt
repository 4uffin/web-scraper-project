I prefer old town Vegas over the strip. So for the location it suits me fine8.2Very goodLaura, Jun 2020Pros (+) Location was greatCons (-) Our toilet broke twice while we were there. First time I requested a new room to avoid this. They sent technicians up to fix it and they did fix it... but it did the same thing again the next night at 1am. Techs dame up and ended up replacing a part. I would have preferred to just move rooms the first time, but the customer service re said they have to have a tech come up and check it out first......Read more8.0Very goodJoe, Feb 2020Pros (+) Location ...but it was a double edged sword..

The hotel pool was nice though it does need shade and it should stay open past 7 PM.Cons (-) The showers seem to have mildew. The carpets turned to the bottoms of my white socks nearly black. In the past year it seems that housekeeping does not do as attentive a job as my last visit. They were hand and butt imprints on the window from the last guest.9.1WonderfulMathew, Jun 2019Pros (+) Loved the king bed and sofa suite; loved the location; loved the coffee stop just off the elevators in the casino. Loved easy access to the hotel from Fremont Street.Cons (-) I didn't know there was a fitness center or business center to print my boarding pass. They should promote that more.7.7GoodAnonymous, Jun 2019Cons (-) Very noisy on Fremont. Hall smelled like pot quite often but that was not hotel fault.
