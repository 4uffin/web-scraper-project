Following the trip, my son realized he had left his beloved toy in the hotel room. We called to let them know and they assured us they would look and would update us either way.8.0Very goodChris, May 2021Pros (+) Close to alot of dining options, outdoor pool. Close to most Disney attractions. Plenty of back lot parking.Cons (-) Heavy traffic area. Front desk staffing seemed nonexistent at times. Traveled in Feb 2021.5.4FairBonnie, Apr 2019Cons (-) Toilet was broken; Fridge was cool-could not get it cold; staff was mixed - some good - some not-so-much; breakfast was poor in coffee cafe - but very good in restaurant. Based on some staff responses- I will not return. Service and service recovery was poor.5.7FairAnonymous, Feb 2018Pros (+) The overall hotel seemed nice and the staff was friendlyCons (-) The room was smelly and had a gross feel to it. The bathroom shower had mold on the ceiling. The beds were also uncomfortable. If I was paying $200+ a night then I would be upset but paid $135. This is rated as a 4 star hotel and I would barely rate it as a 3 star.5.1FairAnonymous, Jan 2018Pros (+) on the plus side: lobby is stylish and comfortable; real creamer pods with in-room coffee; free wifiCons (-) But the negatives made this a pass in the future: Self-parking in a standard lot: $15. The “Delta” remodel stops at the lobby — rooms are decade-old Residence Inn. And pool was in the shade ALL day. Disappointing.9.7WonderfulAnonymous, Nov 2017Pros (+) Everything that I look for was there. Clean room, quick check in, attentive staff. I asked for towels and within five minutes someone was knocking at the door. Usually it seems to take other places a good while. We ordered room service for myself and three kids. Fast good and decent prices. I will definitely stay again.Cons (-) It was a little noisy being close to a main road but Not enough to keep you awake.8.0Very goodAnonymous, Mar 2017Pros (+) Loved the common areas and the beds were comfortable.Cons (-) The guest rooms were not in line with the rest of the hotel. Felt very basic while the common areas and outlets were a bit more upscale. When the A/C was off the room had a weird smell.8.8Very goodAnonymous, Apr 2016Pros (+) The check-in was quick and simple. Friendly staff! Great location! Nice comfortable beds!Cons (-) Had to pay for breakfast and parking.
