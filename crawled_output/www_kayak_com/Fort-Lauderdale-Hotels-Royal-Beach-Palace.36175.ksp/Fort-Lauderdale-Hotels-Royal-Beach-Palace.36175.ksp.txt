Dmitrii the bar tender was amazing with great service and bar tricks. So much funCons (-) Nothing the hotel can help but the street out front very busy and loud. Lots of cars showing off.2.0PoorAnonymous, Dec 2017Pros (+) Not really anythingCons (-) Very dirty room. Dust and mold growing from the air conditioner vents, dust literally all over the room, mold growing on walls right by our heads on the bed, sticky bathroom, dead bugs all over, mold smell, stained blood/brown stuff on sheets. Disgusting hotel. never would recommend. Will warn everyone I know not to go here.5.1FairAnonymous, Nov 2017Pros (+) The housekeeping staff works hard to keep this place clean.Cons (-) The front desk people seemed to be in chaos all the time. It’s an old hotel on a very busy street, so bring earplugs to sleep at night. The air conditioning needs repair. Let's say this, you get what you pay for.8.0Very goodNestor, Nov 2017Pros (+) Look of the place you can tell they've spent some money on remodeling so the place looks good.Cons (-) Parking was very limited, no breakfast included, internet was very poor unacceptable and unusable to do any real work we had to go to the Dunkin donuts down the street.6.0OkayAnonymous, Aug 2017Cons (-) Property ran out of room type that was reserved. Multiple buildings that are not connected, required walking in rain to and from lobby. Advertises "partial beach view" for rooms that are across a four-lane road with high rise hotels and condos in between property and beach.10WonderfulAnonymous, May 2017Pros (+) My husband and I booked the honeymoon suite for one night. The room was very clean and the jacuzzi was great! The bed was very comfy. I loved that the premises has multiple pools. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. We had a very enjoyable time here!Cons (-) South Florida water can be a bit weird in a jacuzzi situation, not the hotels fault though!7.4GoodAnonymous, Apr 2017Pros (+) Good location. Clear that this hotel from the 1960s or 1970s recently underwent an update which was nicely done.Cons (-) Nicely renovated room, needed a new shower head though. No idea why that wasn't replace when room was updated.6.8OkayAnonymous, Dec 2016Pros (+) Room was well done inside. Good proximity to grocery store. Outside bar was very popularCons (-) Location wasn't close to any sights/attractions. Wasn't clear how to access beach. Looked more like a motel outside.9.4WonderfulAnonymous, Dec 2016Pros (+) We had a jaccuzzi in our honeymoon suite. The room was clean and smelled fresh. The staff was very friendly and we could use all of the 4 pool areas.Showing 1-10 of 4229 reviews12345...423The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What are the room amenities like?The hotel features newly renovated deluxe rooms and suites with cozy beds dressed with luxurious linens and feather pillows, private bathrooms, balconies, wardrobes, high-speed internet, refrigerators, microwaves, and writing desks.What can I expect from the hotel's dining options?The hotel features a restaurant and bar indoors, offering guests even more places to unwind.
