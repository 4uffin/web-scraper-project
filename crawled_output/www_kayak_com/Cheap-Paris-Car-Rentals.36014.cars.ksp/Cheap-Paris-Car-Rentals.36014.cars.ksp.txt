But the city’s strategic position in the northern part of France puts you within a quick drive of other scenic stretches of the country, like Normandy, as well as other countries entirely, like Belgium.
And for those who enjoy city driving, you can’t get much better than cruising down iconic boulevards like the Champs-Élysées, around squares like Place de la Concorde, and past monuments like the Arc de Triomphe. Car rental companies are located throughout the city, as well as at train stations and in the airports, and most of the rental agencies are open on Sundays and holidays, so you can pick up a car whenever you need it—even if it’s last-minute.What you need to rent a carSimilar to the U.S., you’ll need to have a valid driver’s license, an ID or passport, and a credit card in your ﻿name for a deposit and...Learn moreSimilar to the U.S., you’ll need to have a valid driver’s license, an ID or passport, and a credit card in your ﻿name for a deposit and incidentals.

Electric vehicles can be a great way to save on gas, and you’ll find charging stations throughout the city.Where to get a rental car in ParisYou can rent a car at both airports (Charles de...Learn moreYou can rent a car at both airports (Charles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly) and agencies are open from the first to the last flight.

Keep in mind this usually ups the fee, especially if you’re returning the car in a different country. Be sure to check to see if your car insurance includes the same level of coverage if you leave the country.

Often, rental companies include some sort of minimum protection, or you can add on extras like collision protection. If your credit card includes car insurance, you may have to deny the car rental company’s insurance so yours kicks in. As with any city, cars can get bumped or scratched while parked on the street or in a garage, and paint jobs can be pricey, so better to be on the safe side with insurance.What to know about driving in ParisIn the city, the average speed limit is 30 km/h (19 mph), but in some spots, it’s 50 km/h (30 mph).

Always give way to traffic on the right, and cars already in a roundabout have the right of way. While cyclists should be following the same rules of the road, they often weave in and out of traffic, so keep an eye out for bikes and crossing pedestrians.Where to park in ParisStreet parking is tough to find, but if you do get lucky and score a spot, you’ll have to pay for parking Monday through Saturday from 9 am to 8...Learn moreStreet parking is tough to find, but if you do get lucky and score a spot, you’ll have to pay for parking Monday through Saturday from 9 am to 8 pm and you’re limited to two hours.

I highly recommend not getting a car that's to big as trying to navigate down town traffic can be hard for most.Verified travelerJun 2024Be very careful. Always check carefully the second and third pages of the rental. Unlimited miles, for example, is not a given. Also check country charges, they add those on top and no one tells you until you arrive, not listed in the contract you get online.JordanAug 2024Be very careful that you know where to return the car. The address of the rental agency online rarely matches the physical location.Verified travelerJul 2024the smaller the better (easier to park); third party liability insurance is typically included.Verified travelerMay 2024Rent a small car if you can. If able, getting an electric car may be beneficial if only staying in the city because you can park for free and free overnight in the charging stations. Then will keep charging you even when the car if fully charged though so keep that in mind. If driving outside of the city and through countryside I would recommend not doing electric because it can be inconvenient and time-costing to find stations.Verified travelerApr 2024Get a small car for Paris parking, a little larger for more comfort on trips. French and European drivers are much superior to most American drivers so don’t be intimidated. 😉Verified travelerMay 2024The roadside assistance is only during office hours of the rental location. Speed limits are strictly enforced and there's only a 10 percent leeway. Highway speeds can drop 20km/h within a kilometers distance be vigilant. Stay out of the city!!! You will waste a lot of time in stand still traffic.LaurelSep 2023It was fun to drive through France. As an American, this trip reiterated to me that most of the time it’s better to take a train. It’s usually faster and less expensive (unlike in the U.S.). The tolls I paid were probably close to €100 each way and parking is often quite expensive. Also, lookout for the signs that indicate a camera speed trap, they are common. I would stick to the speed limit! Next time I want a road trip, I’ll plan more time and instead of paying tolls, I’ll avoid the toll ways and try taking the country roads for a longer but more pleasant ride. Use the toll money to pay for a hotel in a countryside place instead! However, I appreciate that there is inventive to take the more environmentally friendly option.Verified travelerOct 2023No need to show up early; your car won't be ready. It would also be nice to know that you can drop your car at any location when returning. This was a huge help as we took the car on the east end of downtown Paris, and returned it at the airport.MarkSep 2023Be carful following Apple Maps in Paris - our routed us through the pedestrian area of the Louvre. Other than that, Paris is no more difficult than driving in Chicago or New York.Verified travelerSep 2023I left immediately from Paris.Verified travelerJun 2023When you buy gas, the gas stations bill your credit card for the gas and another charge as a hold of some sort. At first, I thought we were being defrauded, it the charges came off once the payment was made by the credit card company. Paris is a tough place to drive and gas is expensive. Driving in the ritual areas of France is great and the scenery is spectacular.Verified travelerJul 2023Rent from a company that actually cares about their customers and does not our source support to a third party.AlbertAug 2023driving in paris and around france was great.

It would be good to be prepared for this. It added to our driving time. Also, it would be helpful to know where there are gas stations that stay open late near the car drop offchristianMay 2023Embrace the chaos.

Which is to say that the price YOU gave us did NOT include insurance. The fact that insurance isa going to cost another E700 should be included in your website or theirs. The only alternative offered to us was to take ALL the risk, or pay what we paid (E700) - leaving a E2,500 per event excess, or pay a further E400 (total E1,100) for comprehensive cover.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jun 2024IntermediateUnfortunately, a bad rental with hidden costs exceeding the original offered price by a factor of 10.

The car was comfortable but the most important part which is the maintenance was not secured properly this is why i am not satisfied as I had to change my whole plan for the day to avoid being stuck hundred of km away from the drop off spot.Back1 out of 1NextThrifty7.0GoodRead 2 reviewsCleanliness7.8Comfort7.5Pick-up/Drop-off6.7Value for money7.014 locations in ParisShow locationsThrifty reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Paris2 Av Porte De Saint-cloud+33 1 46 51 12 31Monday08:00 - 19:0013:00 - 17:00Tuesday08:00 - 19:0013:00 - 17:00Wednesday13:00 - 17:0008:00 - 19:00Thursday13:00 - 17:0008:00 - 19:00Friday13:00 - 17:0008:00 - 19:00Saturday08:30 - 20:002 Rue De Compiegne+33 1 55 31 93 21Monday07:00 - 18:00Tuesday07:00 - 18:00Wednesday07:00 - 18:00Thursday07:00 - 18:00Friday07:00 - 18:00Saturday08:00 - 19:00Sunday08:00 - 19:002 Rue Du 8 Mai 1945+33 1 42 05 50 43Monday08:00 - 19:00Tuesday08:00 - 19:00Wednesday08:00 - 19:00Thursday08:00 - 19:00Friday08:00 - 19:00Saturday08:00 - 19:0021 Avenue Emile Zola+33 1 45 77 77 10Monday09:00 - 18:00Tuesday09:00 - 18:00Wednesday09:00 - 18:00Thursday09:00 - 18:00Friday09:00 - 18:00Saturday09:00 - 18:0027 Place St Ferdinand+33 825 85 38 53Monday08:00 - 19:0014:00 - 20:00Tuesday08:00 - 19:0014:00 - 20:00Wednesday14:00 - 20:0008:00 - 19:00Thursday08:00 - 19:0014:00 - 20:00Friday14:00 - 20:0008:00 - 19:00Saturday08:00 - 19:0014:00 - 20:00352 Rue Lecourbe+33 1 45 54 32 73Monday07:30 - 21:00Tuesday07:30 - 21:00Wednesday07:30 - 21:00Thursday07:30 - 21:00Friday07:30 - 21:00Saturday07:30 - 21:00Sunday08:00 - 19:0045 Avenue Du Maine+33 820 00 90 50Monday07:00 - 18:00Tuesday07:00 - 18:00Wednesday07:00 - 18:00Thursday07:00 - 18:00Friday07:00 - 18:00Saturday07:00 - 18:00Sunday08:00 - 19:0050 Boulevard St Michel+33 1 71 18 17 40Monday14:00 - 20:0008:00 - 19:00Tuesday14:00 - 20:0008:00 - 19:00Wednesday08:00 - 19:0014:00 - 20:00Thursday14:00 - 20:0008:00 - 19:00Friday08:00 - 19:0014:00 - 20:00Saturday08:00 - 19:0099 Rue Rivoli+33 1 47 03 49 12Monday08:00 - 19:0014:00 - 20:00Tuesday08:00 - 19:0014:00 - 20:00Wednesday08:00 - 19:0014:00 - 20:00Thursday14:00 - 20:0008:00 - 19:00Friday14:00 - 20:0008:00 - 19:00Saturday14:00 - 20:0008:00 - 19:00Aeroport Charles De Gaulle+33 825 88 97 55Monday06:00 - 23:00Tuesday06:00 - 23:00Wednesday06:00 - 23:00Thursday06:00 - 23:00Friday06:00 - 23:00Saturday06:00 - 23:00Sunday06:00 - 23:00Place D'italie+33 1 73 16 71 00Monday09:00 - 18:00Tuesday09:00 - 18:00Wednesday09:00 - 18:00Thursday09:00 - 18:00Friday09:00 - 18:00Rtn:urbis 56 Quai De La Rapee+33 825 80 28 01Monday07:00 - 18:00Tuesday07:00 - 18:00Wednesday07:00 - 18:00Thursday07:00 - 18:00Friday07:00 - 18:00Saturday08:00 - 19:00Sunday08:00 - 19:00Terminal 2-3+33 825 88 92 65Monday07:00 - 18:00Tuesday07:00 - 18:00Wednesday07:00 - 18:00Thursday07:00 - 18:00Friday07:00 - 18:00Saturday07:00 - 18:00Sunday07:00 - 18:00Terminal 2f+33 825 88 97 55Monday06:00 - 23:00Tuesday06:00 - 23:00Wednesday06:00 - 23:00Thursday06:00 - 23:00Friday06:00 - 23:00Saturday06:00 - 23:00Sunday06:00 - 23:00FiltersWonderful (0)Very good (0)Good (0)Okay (0)Fair (0)Mediocre (0)Poor (2)Reviews2.0 PoorJordan, Aug 2024CompactWhen we picked up the car, the gas tank was red / very nearly empty. It was expensive to fill up the entire tank before we started our trip, and not normal procedure to lend a car to customer that has no gas.2.0 PoorElie, May 2024CompactI went to the car rental office on Saturday morning to pick up the car, but they were closed. After waiting outside for an hour, they called to apologize for not informing me earlier and directed me to another branch 40 minutes away. When I arrived, I waited another 50 minutes, and when it was finally my turn, the agent told me he wasn't aware of my booking and that I would need to wait another hour for a car with the specifications I had reserved. Frustrated, I left and canceled my weekend plans.

All of their inventory was already out on loan. I had to wait for approximately 2 and a half hours in a stuffy subterranean Enterprise office in the Gare de Lyon, Paris without proper customer seating nor ventilation. The rental location was extremely hard to find due to a lack of signage and location instructions at the train station. Finally, when I did obtain my vehicle it was a much larger SUV then requested and it could barely make it through the narrow driveways in the subterrainian parking lot. The car arrived filthy with two of the logo letters dangling from the back tailgate. The employees were nice to me and did what they could do to help by getting the vehicle cleaned quickly and finding an office chair in the garage for me to sit in while I waited for the car to come back in “clean” condition. The drop off at Charles de Gaulle airport was simple and efficient.4.0 MediocreRicacrdo, Feb 2024CommercialBasically I reserved an automatic electric car, they gave me a manual diesel car and had no other options for me, who doesn’t posses a manual car license. They supposedly added my partner (who has a manual car license) as an additional driver in the contract “for free” but ended up charging the fee in my credit card. Je suis vraiment dégoûté, c’est que 10€ mais déjà ils nous ont pas donné la voiture avec les caractéristiques réservés et payées.10.0 WonderfulDavid, May 2021Pros:Staff were friendly.Cons:Car had a bit of an alignment problem, veered to the right.
