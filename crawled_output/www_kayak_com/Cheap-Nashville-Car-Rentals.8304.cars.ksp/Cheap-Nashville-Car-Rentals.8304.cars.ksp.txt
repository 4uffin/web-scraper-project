The rate for the period was over double of what was posted once I checked out. As a note, I now accept the insurance coverage by the car rental agency as I relied on my own (very comprehensive) insurance in the past and last year was hit by another driver and spent 10 months trying to rectify and even though the accident was deemed at no fault to myself, I paid over $1000 in auxilary fees to the rental company based on the contract, even though my company paid for coverage. THIS DRIVES UP THE RATE CONSIDERABLY...be advised!Verified travelerFeb 2024Driving in Nashville was super easy. There’s lots of places to park but lots get a bit pricey.

With this above said, this was my worst car experience I’ve had with any rental company. This vehicle was not safe to be driven. It has a lot of mechanical issues with over 70,000 miles. This is not normally a problem for a Toyota, but it is clearly evident that this vehicle has not been maintained for the last year. The sticker on the windshield leads me to believe the oil has not been changed for over 30,000 miles. The tires are going bald and the car needs new brakes. The alignment is off kilter and the steering wheel had to be turned 20-30 degrees to the left in order to keep the car straight. I have already attempted to contact dollar on this matter because this was the first time I felt unsafe driving a car that was not mine. Aside from that the vehicle was fuel efficient and if they fix the car, it should last many more years.2.0 PoorHillary, Jun 2025Intermediate SUVI arrived with my reservation and they had no cars.2.0 PoorMatthew, Jun 2025Supplier choiceThey didn't have my car and the only person there told me to just look around and find a car.

The car was almost brand new and the whole process was simple and easy. Their website was a little difficult to maneuver because I kept getting the information in a different language. I ended up calling a very nice gentleman to change my pickup time and he took care of it all within a couple of minutes!! When we returned the car, there was a very nice young man that made that process a breeze! I would definitely recommend this company because it did seem to be a little cheaper and everyone that I met was very nice and helpful!Back1 out of 2NextAdvantage6.4OkayCleanliness6.9Comfort6.7Pick-up/Drop-off5.9Value for money6.3One location in NashvilleCar rental locationsLocations in Nashville1 Terminal Dr #405+1 615 275 2619Monday06:00 - 23:59Tuesday06:00 - 23:59Wednesday06:00 - 23:59Thursday06:00 - 23:59Friday06:00 - 23:59Saturday06:00 - 23:59Sunday06:00 - 23:59FiltersNo reviews availableThrifty6.1OkayRead 38 reviewsCleanliness7.0Comfort6.7Pick-up/Drop-off6.1Value for money6.22 locations in NashvilleThrifty reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Nashville1 Terminal Drive+1 877 283 0898Monday06:00 - 23:59Tuesday06:00 - 23:59Wednesday06:00 - 23:59Thursday06:00 - 23:59Friday06:00 - 23:59Saturday06:00 - 23:59Sunday06:00 - 23:593100 Charlotte Avenue+1 615 327 5453Monday08:00 - 13:00Tuesday08:00 - 13:00Wednesday08:00 - 13:00Thursday08:00 - 13:00Friday08:00 - 13:00FiltersReviews2.0 PoorJay, Nov 2024Supplier choiceAustin manager screamed at me when disputing extra charges.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Oct 2024Standard SUVThe first car had drugs, some white powder substance. I only found one individual baggie but that was enough. It took a while to get exchanged. I did get another SUV and got it home to realize the key fob was slowly dying. Over the course of four days, it got to the point where I couldn’t lock or unlock the vehicle and it wouldn’t recognize the key fob while driving. I had to exchange it. I take it an hour back to the airport. They try to put another battery in it and that doesn’t work. So it’s something computer related with the fob. They say, “No problem, we will exchange it.” Great! I got another vehicle and it worked out. However, when I turned in the final vehicle I got a bill for a transfer fee and a few other fees I already paid with the original purchase. The problems here are, the drugs cost me a lot of time and they weren’t even going to compensate me at all. They ended up just giving me a voucher. The key fob issue was a huge inconvenience because I was going camping so I got the car very early so I could pack based on the vehicle I got. I did that. I packed everything. I was ready to go and couldn’t lock or unlock the car. I can’t go on a camping trip with something like that! It’s not safe or reasonable. It delayed my trip by about five hours. I had to unpack the SUV and repack it, with no help from the rental car company. The worst part was they charged me for a transfer but not until I returned the final vehicle.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Apr 2024Compact SUVThere were no cars available when we got there at 8.

But at that location, I was told I'd have to pick up a car at the airport - a time-wasting hassle. There, they couldn't honor my reserved car, requiring a new reservation for ~$50 more. Directions from the airport desk to the pick-up location were confusing. Then, canceling my first reservation was another confusing, time-wasting hassle requiring several calls. Once I finally got to it, the car itself was fine and my drive went smoothly - just a little more tired...2.0 PoorAnonymous, Mar 2024Supplier choiceHUGE FAIL Worst experience ever. The desk agent at BNA did not properly advise me on the time it would take to charge the car, knowing full well I was doing a point to point reservation. Sometime during the first night the car was parked, I lost over 100 miles in range leaving me a sitting duck in a very rural location. Instead of enjoying my time on my vacation, I wasted hours looking for charging stations and wasting energy on stress due to range anxiety. I should have been advised about the length of time it would take to charge the car from near empty to fill enough to complete my journey. The cord going to a 110 outlet would take 59 hours to charge (!). It took 9 hours on the charging station that I finally found. It was in the back of a a very dark parking lot. Not safe. Not fun. This charging need became my #1 priority this trip INSTEAD of spending precious time with my daughter. There was more time spent informing me that should not wash the EV than on providing sound advice on taking care of the car so it was ready for its job. This rental was a disaster and you should not rent EVs to point to point customers. Be like Hertz and sell the fleet.
