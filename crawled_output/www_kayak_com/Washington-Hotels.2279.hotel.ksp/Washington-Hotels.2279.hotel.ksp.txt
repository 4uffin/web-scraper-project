For centuries, the city has been hosting visiting politicians, foreign dignitaries, and illustrious personalities. Perhaps the most famous – possessing long-rooted histories winding back to the city’s earliest days – are filled with sumptuous architectural details, antique furniture, and stories of the past.
Visitors are often surprised to discover that many of D.C.’s hotels aren’t just for the history or politics buffs. Many exude a more contemporary vibe, incorporating modern architecture, cool furnishings, quirky décor touches, and forward-thinking elements, such as community space for locals and visitors alike.
Here are 10 of the best hotels in Washington, D.C., from beautifully classic to homey and intimate to out-on-a-limb progressive for travelers on various budgets.The Hay - AdamsRank #1$376-$2,550/night800 16th Street NorthwestAs ornate as a Victorian wedding cake yet intimate as a private mansion, the venerable Hay-Adams on Lafayette Square...Learn moreAs ornate as a Victorian wedding cake yet intimate as a private mansion, the venerable Hay-Adams on Lafayette Square has been considered one of the best hotels in Washington, D.C., since opening in 1928. I love walking through its grandiose doors, entering a world of Old World elegance: stately columns, rich wood paneling, and chandeliers.Anyone who enters follows in the footsteps of presidents and other luminaries – even the Obamas lived here before Barack’s inauguration in 2009. The 145 luxe rooms and suites are done in elegant neutrals, carved plaster ceilings, and toile fabrics, complete with marble bathrooms; if money is no object, I’d try to snag one with a balcony overlooking the White House.Of special note, Off the Record, in the basement, is the place to experience D.C.’s political vibe: Caricatures of politicians hang on the walls, as journalists lie in wait for the latest scoop.Check pricesCheck pricesTabard InnRank #2$75-$446/night1739 North Street NorthwestTucked away on a quiet side street near Dupont Circle, the 35-room Tabard was established in 1922 by entrepreneur...Learn moreTucked away on a quiet side street near Dupont Circle, the 35-room Tabard was established in 1922 by entrepreneur Marie Willoughby Rogers, making it the city’s oldest hotel owned by a woman. Occupying three historic, 19th-century brick townhouses, its warren of creaky-floored rooms, eclectic antiques, and both vintage and local artwork exemplify its bygone vibe.Each of its 35 guest rooms is uniquely decorated, adorned with flowery curtains, vintage sofas, and hardwood floors – some also share bathrooms, which is part of its charm. I know one couple that ended up moving to a different hotel because there’s no TV – their loss.Here it’s all about settling into the historic house experience: sitting in front of the cozy lobby’s roaring fire, sipping a hot buttered rum; or lolling away a summer afternoon with lemonade on the garden patio. A reputable farm-to-table restaurant serves lunch and dinner; when I worked at nearby National Geographic, this was the go-to place for business lunches, and it’s still one of my favorite restaurants in town.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Jefferson, Washington, DCRank #3$407-$4,052/night1200 16th Street NWOpened in 1955 in a luxury apartment block dating from 1923, this small-but-grand Beaux-Arts gem, just a few blocks...Learn moreOpened in 1955 in a luxury apartment block dating from 1923, this small-but-grand Beaux-Arts gem, just a few blocks from the White House, possesses hints of the eponymous third president throughout. I love everything about this hotel, but my favorite space is probably the stately Book Room, where reproductions of Thomas Jefferson’s personal library are showcased.99 meticulously renovated rooms are elegantly modern, with white walls, picture-frame molding, and dark wood furnishings, plus state-of-the-art technology like charging stations on the desks, and iPads. The Presidential and First Lady suites are all-out opulent; the former features five Juliette balconies with breathtaking city views.The Greenhouse is one of my favorite special-night restaurants, where Executive Chef Fabio Salvatore works his magic in Spanish-inspired steak and seafood dishes served beneath a historic skylight (if short rib is on the menu, order it). Quill, inspired by Jefferson’s parlor, is the upscale bar offering signature cocktails (with frequent innovations); you’ll often find me here after work.Check pricesCheck pricesWillard Intercontinental Washington By IHGRank #4$267-$3,057/night1401 Pennsylvania Avenue NorthwestThis Beaux-Arts beauty, over-the-top opulent with its marble pillars, ornate sculptural decorations, and regal...Learn moreThis Beaux-Arts beauty, over-the-top opulent with its marble pillars, ornate sculptural decorations, and regal lobby, has sat just a block from the White House since 1818. Ever since, presidents, celebrities, and international dignitaries have walked through its doors, making it the center of D.C.’s political and social scene – and indisputably one of D.C.’s best hotels.The term “lobbyist,” in fact, was coined here in the 1870s, when people wanting to plead their cases discovered President Grant liked to hang out in the lobby to smoke his cigar. I love to just sit here and take it all in, though Christmas is best, when it’s decked out in all its holiday finery. The elegantly traditional guest rooms, with state-of-the-art technology, are surprisingly large for D.C., starting at 425 square feet.Federal-style furnishings, with striped wallpaper and gilded accents, add to the aristocratic charm. Don’t miss high tea in Peacock Alley or sipping a Mint Julep in the historic Round Robin Bar, founded in 1847 – and yes, the bar is round; it’s been dubbed the “Oval Office of Bars.”Check pricesCheck pricesThe Line Hotel DCRank #5$131-$1,085/night1770 Euclid Street NorthwestOnce an early 20th-century church, this unique boutique hotel nightlife-popping Adams Morgan is ideal for those who...Learn moreOnce an early 20th-century church, this unique boutique hotel nightlife-popping Adams Morgan is ideal for those who want to stay among the locals and feel at home away from home. Arched ceilings, stained-glass windows, and second-floor terraces in the lobby belie the building’s original purpose – once when I was having dinner there, I noticed the massive chandelier is even made from old organ pieces.220 small rooms blend vintage and contemporary styles with hardwood floors, original art by local women artists, mid-century-style brass beds, and surprising pops of color (and old-school radios); no two are ever the same.Topping it off, the LINE is a foodie hotspot, showcasing locally sourced, Chesapeake-inspired dishes at No Goodbyes restaurant, another one of my favorite D.C. restaurants. The unique thing here is that you can choose your dining space: the restaurant itself, the bar, the communal lobby, or the coffee shop, depending on your mood.Check pricesCheck pricesKimpton George Hotel By IHGRank #6$124-$841/night15 East Street NorthwestThe first president reigns supreme in this fun and funky boutique hotel in Washington, D.C., near Union Station, a...Learn moreThe first president reigns supreme in this fun and funky boutique hotel in Washington, D.C., near Union Station, a short walk from the U.S. Capitol. George Washington’s handwritten inaugural address papers walls and pop-portraits adorn the lobby and hallways. But that is not what makes it one of the best hotels in Washington.The 139 guest rooms, painted in Continental blue, are spacious, with the Washington theme continued: military-style brass buttons adorn throw pillows, and flourishing script wallpaper flash parts of his inaugural address on the walls.And yet, this is a Kimpton first, offering all of the things I love about it: yoga mats in the guest rooms, a complimentary hosted wine hour, and bikes to explore the surrounding Capitol Hill neighborhood. Its signature Bistro Bis restaurant is a local go-to for contemporary French cuisine; don’t leave without tasting the apple tart.Check pricesCheck pricesHotel HiveRank #7$28-$457/night2224 F Street NorthwestD.C.’s first micro hotel, Hotel Hive in Foggy Bottom is all about comfort in a small space. It’s set in a historic...Learn moreD.C.’s first micro hotel, Hotel Hive in Foggy Bottom is all about comfort in a small space. It’s set in a historic building, showcasing exposed brick walls, rustic beams, and murals by local artists throughout. The 83 guest rooms measure only 125 to 250 square feet, but you’re as cozy as a bee in its hive with unique decor in each one.What I really love about this hotel is the variety of different spaces to hang out – it’s not at all about staying in your room. There’s a cafe/cocktail lounge on the first floor that feels like a cool Washingtonian’s living room; it offers locally sourced Compass Coffee and some seriously innovative cocktails. At the &pizza Shop you can craft your own pie and eat it in the indoor seating area, the private courtyard, or on the front patio.Check pricesCheck pricesRosewood Washington DCRank #8$474-$1,904/night1050 31st Street NorthwestPerched on the picturesque Chesapeake & Ohio Canal in Georgetown, this hidden-away boutique hotel exudes...Learn morePerched on the picturesque Chesapeake & Ohio Canal in Georgetown, this hidden-away boutique hotel exudes refined, understated elegance. Everything is immaculately designed, from the lobby’s parquet floors – repurposed from a French chateau – to the library’s 15-foot marble fireplace to Hermès leather drawer pulls in each guest room. And the service is immaculate, starting with your personal assistant taking care of check-in for you.You’ll immediately feel right at home in your posh accommodations, 55 spacious guest rooms featuring custom wood furnishings, modern original artwork, hardwood floors, and marble bathrooms. The rooftop bar has an indoor–outdoor infinite pool (heated, so you can swim even in winter) and views of the Washington Monument, though some prefer the swanky Rye Bar, serving rare spirits.The Grill Room offers upscale, chef-driven international cuisine; its outdoor tables overlook the canal in one of the prettiest dining settings around.Check pricesCheck pricesCanopy by Hilton Washington D.C - The WharfRank #9$143-$1,177/night975 7th Street SouthwestThe Hilton Canopy may be a chain hotel, but it has one of the city’s buzziest locations.

You’ll find it at the Wharf, a newish neighborhood down on the Potomac River that to me always feels like getting away on vacation (and yet the National Mall is an easy, several-block walk away). Here there’s all kinds of fun activities, including live music, pop-up shops, and lively restaurants (crab cakes at Hank’s Oyster Bar are to die for).One of the biggest draws is the Anthem, an acoustically advanced music hall that opened in 2017 with the Foo Fighters (yes, I was there). You can also rent kayaks and paddle around, take the free dingy across the water to Hains Point for a scenic stroll (or run), and enjoy any number of seasonal events, including fireworks and all-day festivals.Check pricesCheck pricesBooking InsightsKAYAK’s insights for hotels in Washington, D.C.Discover seasonal trends, ideal booking windows, and other data-driven tips to plan your stay in Washington, D.C. with confidence.How much does a hotel cost in Washington, D.C.?The average price of a double room in Washington, D.C. is $278 per night.
