With beautiful beaches and the inland stretching out seemingly infinitely, a car is definitely a must to get from A to B in this region. Make the most of your holiday and reach any beach with its wonderfully clear blue water or a stunning golf course conveniently and in comfort.Punta Cana International Airport is plopped amidst the region’s heart and is only a few minutes from many popular destinations.

By car, it will take a maximum of half an hour to get to the northern side of the region, where most hotels are located.Driving in Punta Cana can be a bit of a challenge for first-time visitors, as many street regulations appear to be considered suggestions rather than rules.

I made a reservation with Routes Car & Truck Rentals well in advance, trusting that they would provide the vehicle I needed. However, at the last minute, they informed me that no vehicle was available, leaving me stranded without transportation. This is completely unacceptable and shows a total lack of professionalism and respect for customers. If a company cannot honor its reservations, it has no business operating in the rental industry. Their poor planning and lack of accountability caused me significant stress and inconvenience. I would never recommend Routes Car & Truck Rentals to anyone—avoid this unreliable company at all costs2.0 PoorAnonymous, Mar 2025EconomyThis rental car never happen, we were frustated & helpless in the middle of the night, lot of people talking to us as they know we need car service badly, we were scared and panicking because of their aggresiveness, Routes doesnt have car available, customer service from kayak or priceline cant help either. I am in Punta Cana for only 4 days, took the cab for $35usd as finally routes promise That we have the car next day, still didnt happen. 2 days already gone. Now takes forever to process the refund. Imagine arranging schedule from work to take this off, scheduling kids at home before leaving, and this is what we get, Hearing apology & get refund is not going to compensate us.2.0 PoorAng, Feb 2025Compact SUVI had to wait several hours after arriving to the rental center for an available vehicle, of which I had to find my own way to this offsite airport location because there was no shuttle or information available. Then my car that I was offered was not the car I booked. It was a compact car, not a compact SUV. It had a broken tail light, was dirty and the wire port was not working. I then returned the vehicle the following day to swap it with an available compact SUV. After two days, this vehicle had a check engine light come on and was making weird noises, along with front left headlight that was not working. I retuned back to the rental center a third time to report this and swapped it yet again for another vehicle due to concerns for safety. This took a lot of my time and effort that should not have happened.2.0 PoorHarry, Feb 2025EconomyThey should not be renting out cars with expired tags,got pulled over by the police and issued a ticket for expired tags10.0 WonderfulRodrigue, Oct 2024CompactExcellentBack1 out of 11NextAvis10.0WonderfulCleanliness10.0Comfort10.0Pick-up/Drop-off10.0Value for money10.0One location in Punta CanaShow locationsCar rental locationsLocations in Punta CanaBarcelo Ave Km 6.5, Bavaro+1 809 688 1354Monday08:00 - 18:00Tuesday08:00 - 18:00Wednesday08:00 - 18:00Thursday08:00 - 18:00Friday08:00 - 18:00Saturday08:00 - 18:00Sunday08:00 - 18:00FiltersWonderful (0)Very good (0)Good (0)Okay (0)Fair (0)Mediocre (0)Poor (0)No reviews availableAlamo6.5OkayRead 4 reviewsCleanliness7.1Comfort6.3Pick-up/Drop-off6.5Value for money6.13 locations in Punta CanaShow locationsAlamo reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Punta CanaAvenida Barcelo+1 809 466 1083Monday08:00 - 18:00Tuesday08:00 - 18:00Wednesday08:00 - 18:00Thursday08:00 - 18:00Friday08:00 - 18:00Saturday08:00 - 18:00Sunday08:00 - 18:00Bavaro Punta Cana Intl Airport+1 809 959 0434Monday08:00 - 18:00Tuesday08:00 - 18:00Wednesday08:00 - 18:00Thursday08:00 - 18:00Friday08:00 - 18:00Saturday08:00 - 18:00Sunday08:00 - 18:00Voulevard Turistico Del Este+1 809 562 1444 ext. 3548Monday00:00 - 23:59Tuesday00:00 - 23:59Wednesday00:00 - 23:59Thursday00:00 - 23:59Friday00:00 - 23:59Saturday00:00 - 23:59Sunday00:00 - 23:59FiltersWonderful (2)Very good (0)Good (0)Okay (0)Fair (0)Mediocre (0)Poor (2)Reviews2.0 PoorRebecca, Dec 2023Supplier choiceWhen I got to the counter there was nobody there so another company tried to call them and nobody answered.
