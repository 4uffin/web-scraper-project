I fly into DCA regularly and have never had a bad experience with them. They also stay open latest in the event that your flight is delayed. Also, DCA is a small airport, and I prefer the brief walk outside to the rental car counter (there are signs--go toward the south/metro exit) over the shuttle, in fair weather.Jean-LouisOct 2023Get an EZ-pass if you plan to use the toll roads.

It's illegal to operate your rental with a BAC of over 0.08%. All occupants in the rental must wear a seat belt at all times. If you have children under four years old in the vehicle, ensure they are secured in an appropriate booster or child seat in the rear seat. Moreover, ensure you yield the right-of-way whenever you hear an emergency vehicle, such as a police car or ambulance, approaching. Turn on your headlights 30 minutes before sunset and off 30 minutes before sunrise.If you're in Washington, D.C. during the winter, rent a four-wheel-drive vehicle suitable for snowy terrain. Expect dark skies and icy conditions as temperatures can drop very low. Make sure your vehicle is equipped with a brush to remove ice from your windows and non-freezing washer fluid. Drive slowly in winter, and always keep your headlights on due to the poor visibility when it’s snowing.

Less than 18 hours prior to my picking up the van, I received a call from Budget saying the location I had reserved from does not ever carry vans since their garage cannot accommodate vans! Their location was advertising vans, I reserved from the location! How was it that I am only hearing about it so late!? I went back and sure enough even as of today that location is advertising vans!! She told me one other Budget location has a van, she wouldn’t call that location to switch our reservation, I had to call myself. I spent over an hour trying to get through to the second location. They had one van but it would cost me 6 times more! The van cost went from $200 to over $800!!!! I think they do this on purpose because at that point I was desperate for a van! I only had a few hours to find another van! When I asked the first lady why she is telling me so late? She had the audacity to tell me I still had a few hours left in the day to find a van! I didn’t have anytime at all, so much else going on that day, that’s why I made reservations a month in advance!! I will never ever use Budget!2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jan 2025Passenger van12 passenge van I reserved wasn’t available. Said it would be available three hours after schedule reservation then it wasn’t. The woman at the counter was lovely and it wasn’t her fault but Customer line is worthless. Never answered. Just terrible service.6.0 OkayAnonymous, Jul 2024Intermediate SUVGreat vehicle at a fairly reasonable price. Getting the vehicle wasn’t bad. Dropping it off was difficult. It was an urban location inside a parking garage. Signage was poor. Not enough designated spaces were available. Finally had to park in a non- designated spot after repeatedly circling, hoping something would open up.2.0 PoorMax, Jun 2024Intermediate SUVAbominable. Firstly, they closed the pick up location for the day before my pick up time, leaving me stranded. Then they told me to pick up from another location but in modifying the reservation they mistakenly put same drop off as pick up when original drop off was in NY. When I brought this up they said that a one way fee of $200 would then apply if I have a different drop off. After three hours on the phone I was finally able to sort it out by sending them the original contract showing that my drop off was always meant to be NY. Still, I had to close the contract with the one way fee in it, and I’m told in 7 days they will reverse the charge to honor the original agreed upon rate.

They do confirm reservations even when no cars are actually available. They process the payment right away, and will not reverse the transaction/refund.

Never, ever..2.0 PoorWes, Apr 2025Supplier choiceI rented an EV, but upon arrival I learned that all Hertz’s chargers were broken and the car’s battery was almost dead, so I had to pay substantially more for a different car. After dropping off the car in pristine condition, I soon learned that a $60 cleaning fee was added (despite the attendant confirming that there would be no additional fees).

Pickup and the laziness and rudeness from thrifty employees Got a car from garage felt like a dungeon. Guy didn’t even show me my car just told me to grab 1 of 2 black cars. I even asked her inspect it with me and he said he don’t do that. So I did best I could do to look at car in the poor lit area with no lights so I took off 4 hours later after coming back outside I notice a dent and body damage underneath passenger door on right side you wouldn’t be able to see in that garage. Thrifty customer service sucks to call and tell them this I eventually told the ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE with thrifty and made a case number with them regarding this Son of telling her what happened and everything that I drove a car literally from the garage to a place 30 miles away, walked that side and saw this damage I brought the car back the next day and told him about this and he said I had to do a report through Hertz so I told Hertz then they said there was a damaged before and I should’ve inspected it better This wasn’t my fault. I didn’t cause this damage. It was some employee inside the garage either when they drop the car off or took it somebody in there did it. Somebody needs to look at the video inside the garage of this car especially then look at the video before I left and see when I pulled out there’s gonna be damage on that car The employees there are lazy and incompetent and just sorry people at the Washington DC thrifty place. Somebody needs to tell management and corporate about thrifty through Hertz and how lazy and sorry their employees are Somebody inside that area with thrifty or somebody that took that car before I got it and place that car somebody calls that damage to that car and it was not me. I will never ever go through kayak again or third-party to get another vehicle. I’d rather go to enterprise or some other company y’all start party also help me as an electrical car. I didn’t want an electrical car. I wanted a gas car. I’ll never go through y’all’s company ever again. This was the worst experience that I’ve ever had.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Apr 2025CompactThe Thrifty staff at pickup were super rude, ignored us at the desk, and were very rude when asking for a deposit card and extra $200 payments tot take the rental we already paid for. They were not at all kind or helpful in explaining the process and were annoyed that we were even there. They were not all al helpful when our rental blew a flat tire and wanted to charge us $700 to toe us back to the airport. The tow would not take us to our air B&B to get our belongings which is 2 hours from the airport. They would only tow us back to the airport to miss the entire friends wedding so we can exchange the car and drive all the way back to our rental house to pick up our belongings. The car did not have a spare tire or my roadside items. 0/10 would not rent with Thrifty again.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Apr 2025Compact SUV$60 was added to the bill than another $40 at drop off for a total of just over $100 extra in hidden charges by Thrifty.

Their procedure was that I should wait on the floor with 20 plus other people. I eventually got a car with another company. Could not cancel my "reservation" or "rental" with Thrifty. Not looking forward to continuing to have to fight to not pay for the product (rental car) that they could not and did not provide.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Aug 2024Full-size SUVBad. At pickup, they directed me to a car, and as I was leaving, they told me I was in the wrong car (even though I went to the exact space, and model car). They then switched me to a smaller car. I didn’t get a chance to look at the car though until after I drove off because they switched me in the exit line. So I had to turn back around and ask for the model size bigger. The guy didn’t believe me when I said the car was the wrong model size. Luckily, a manager confirmed I was right and switched me to a bigger model. However, that car stunk of smoke so I asked for a different one. They finally placed me in a minivan. Not ideal, but fine. Of course, as I was leaving, I was again stopped and told I was in the wrong car and had to tell the story over again. At return, the guy just yelled to me to leave the keys and they’d send a receipt. It’s been over 12 hours, and still no receipt or confirmation of drop off.Kyte8.7Very good3 locations in Washington, D.C.Car rental locationsLocations in Washington, D.C.1050 Connecticut Ave NWOpening times not available50 Massachusetts Ave Ne Space Z213Opening times not available50 Massachusetts Ave NeOpening times not availableFiltersNo reviews availableEasirent4.5MediocreOne location in Washington, D.C.Car rental locationsLocations in Washington, D.C.Ronald Reagan Washington National AirportOpening times not availableFiltersNo reviews availableElita Rent A Car4.0Mediocre2 locations in Washington, D.C.Car rental locationsLocations in Washington, D.C.Washington Airport Ronald Reagan National DCA+1 703 838 1666Opening times not availableWashington Dulles Intl Airport IAD+1 703 661 6387Opening times not availableFiltersNo reviews availableFLIZZR7.4GoodOne location in Washington, D.C.Car rental locationsLocations in Washington, D.C.23320 Autopilot Dr, Dulles, 20166-7705, VA, VirginiaOpening times not availableFiltersNo reviews availablekeddy by Europcar6.1OkayOne location in Washington, D.C.Car rental locationsLocations in Washington, D.C.2600 Jefferson Davis Hwy, Washington Reagan Airport+1 703 838 1666Opening times not availableFiltersNo reviews availableFree2Move5.2Fair11 locations in Washington, D.C.Car rental locationsLocations in Washington, D.C.100, M Street SE, Suite 525+1 201 555 5555Opening times not available1625, P St NwOpening times not available227, Harry Thomas Way NEOpening times not available2550, Benning Rd NEOpening times not available355, water ST SEOpening times not available4326 Wisconsin Ave NW, Wisconsin Ave NWOpening times not available48th St, NW &, W St NW, Washington, DCOpening times not available50, Massachusetts Ave. NE+1 818 966 3327Opening times not available705, G street Southwest+1 844 543 7332Opening times not availableGood Hope Rd SEOpening times not availableLogan Cir NWOpening times not availableFiltersNo reviews availableArow Enterprises Corp.No score available yet3 locations in Washington, D.C.Car rental locationsLocations in Washington, D.C.1100 4th St Sw, Washington+1 202 554 8100Monday00:00 - 23:59Tuesday00:00 - 23:59Wednesday00:00 - 23:59Thursday00:00 - 23:59Friday00:00 - 23:59Saturday00:00 - 23:59Sunday00:00 - 23:593700 10th St Ne, Washington+1 202 635 1104Monday00:00 - 23:59Tuesday00:00 - 23:59Wednesday00:00 - 23:59Thursday00:00 - 23:59Friday00:00 - 23:59Saturday00:00 - 23:59Sunday00:00 - 23:595013 Georgia Ave Nw, Washington+1 202 451 2148Monday00:00 - 23:59Tuesday00:00 - 23:59Wednesday00:00 - 23:59Thursday00:00 - 23:59Friday00:00 - 23:59Saturday00:00 - 23:59Sunday00:00 - 23:59FiltersNo reviews availableSunnycarsNo score available yet2 locations in Washington, D.C.Car rental locationsLocations in Washington, D.C.2500 National Avenue Garage AOpening times not available99 H St NeOpening times not availableFiltersNo reviews availableAdvance Car And Truck RentalNo score available yetOne location in Washington, D.C.Car rental locationsLocations in Washington, D.C.2600 Jefferson Davis Hwy, Arlington+1 703 838 1666Opening times not availableFiltersNo reviews availableEagle Rent A CarNo score available yetOne location in Washington, D.C.Car rental locationsLocations in Washington, D.C.435 S.
