The rental company will say they (the booking agency) will deny your claim and suggest you choose their local insurance coverage instead (which was cheaper)LeanneMar 2025Do not book a mystery car, they will give you a car knowingly that will not work for most of the parking areas on Waikiki. It’s all about whatever incentives the agents are given to push people into gas, insurance and vehicle upgrades. Do not buy into the gas package.AustinJan 2025Car rentals are near terminal 2 baggage claim 65 or soVerified travelerNov 2024The pickup desk opens at 8am, Would should up a bit before 8am to get ahead of the line.

Call ahead to make sure the rental company isn't incompetent. In other words, make sure they understand the definition of reservation and that they actually are going to reserve the vehicle class you select. 2. Double check that the rate you are paying includes all taxes/fees/surcharges/etc. Call them ahead of time if you have to, that way you don't show up and have to shell out more money. 3. Not sure the possibility of this, nor whether you'll have time, but if the car is dirty or has an ant infestation, ask them to clean it before driving it off the lot or ask for a different car.TerraAug 2024Book a compact or small truck/suv. The Dodge Ram was way too big. Really inconvenient for parking and narrow roadways on Oahu. Does provide a lot of space if you need it. I also suggest checking the vehicle for damage and documenting it when you pick up and when you drop off. They will hold you responsible for every little thing even if you didn't do it... so take the time to take the photos! Seriously!Verified travelerAug 2024Before renting a car.

Freeway limits typically range from 55 to 60 mph. Due to Honolulu's often narrow and winding highways, high-speed driving is not recommended. On certain roads, even 30 mph can be considered excessive. Be cautious of the 35-mph S-curve on the H-1 Interstate heading eastbound, between exits 18 and 19, and watch out for speed enforcement, as officers frequently patrol in unmarked police cars.One of the most popular attractions in the neighboring city of Aiea is the Aiea Loop Trail. Many Honolulu residents and visitors head there on weekends to relax and recharge for the week ahead. Renting a car in Honolulu is a convenient way to access attractions like this. The trail is just 22 minutes from Honolulu's city center, about 11 miles away. With a rental car, you can also explore other exciting destinations in Aiea, such as Pearl Harbor and the Keāiwa Heiau State Recreation Area.As a visitor to Honolulu, it’s best to steer clear of driving in the Waikiki Beach area, as it is the main tourist hotspot and naturally very busy. Driving around the town is similar to navigating through a city, so you can expect slow traffic and lots of pedestrians. You should also embrace the 'spirit of Aloha,' as locals are very relaxed when it comes to driving on Hawaiian roads. Drivers should remember to be polite, make space for merging cars, and thank other road users. Also, unless there’s an emergency, avoid using your horn.Rush hour in Honolulu starts early, with busy weekday traffic occurring from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. In the afternoon, rush hour lasts from 3:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., when drivers are heading outbound. Try to avoid driving your car on the surface streets of downtown Honolulu and Waikiki, as these areas tend to be congested. You should also steer clear of the H-1 and H-2 interstates, as well as Nimitz Highway/Ala Moana Boulevard, as traffic is heavy on these routes.Ready to rent a car for your vacation in Honolulu? If you're traveling to Honolulu International Airport (HNL), you'll find a wide range of car rental options, both on-site and off-site. To rent a car directly from the airport, head to the rental offices, conveniently located next to the baggage claim area in Terminal 1. Alternatively, booking desks are located on the ground level of Terminal 2 in the Parking Garage. On the ground level, you'll also find a car rental shuttle stop in designated areas along the center median, just outside the baggage claim areas.If you want the independence that comes with having your own set of wheels, avoid the slower public transport and less-safe mopeds by renting a car in Honolulu. Park along the coast to experience the natural beauty of Waikiki Beach, or take a road trip to the heights of Diamond Head volcanic crater for a unique view of Honolulu.Honolulu is known for having some of the most expensive parking rates in the country. As expected, parking can be challenging in the tourist-heavy areas of Waikiki Beach. However, savvy drivers can take advantage of a few free parking spots. For instance, you can park all day at Ala Moana, Waikiki Shell, and the Ala Wai Canal area, where free, unlimited streetside parking is available. Additionally, Honolulu offers 50 parking lots and garages, with rates starting as low as $8 per day.25% of our users found rental cars in Honolulu for $38 or lessSupplier choice rental cars in Honolulu are around 33% cheaper than other car types, on averageSee more tipsFAQs about renting a car in HonoluluWhat type of car is recommended for driving in Honolulu?Honolulu is renowned for attracting outdoor enthusiasts.

Interface is needlessly complicated with a bunch of switches that are different than other vehicles. That’s confusing. The so-called removable top is actually only two parts. It’s a tee top, but the roof doesn’t come off over the backseats or the way back. Doors slam hard and lack resistance. I will never rent another Jeep unless I absolutely need offloading capability because this made a terrible car to drive around in.Back1 out of 23NextEnterprise Rent-A-Car8.2Very goodRead 58 reviewsCleanliness8.5Comfort8.6Pick-up/Drop-off7.9Value for money8.015 locations in HonoluluShow locationsEnterprise Rent-A-Car reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Honolulu1221 Kapiolani Blvd+1 808 591 1449Monday07:30 - 17:00Tuesday07:30 - 17:00Wednesday07:30 - 17:00Thursday07:30 - 17:00Friday07:30 - 17:00Saturday00:00 - 00:00Sunday00:00 - 00:001314 N King St+1 808 599 2677Monday00:00 - 00:00Tuesday00:00 - 00:00Wednesday00:00 - 00:00Thursday00:00 - 00:00Friday00:00 - 00:00Saturday00:00 - 00:00Sunday00:00 - 00:001778 Ala Moana Blvd Ste 202+1 808 979 2600Monday07:30 - 17:00Tuesday07:30 - 17:00Wednesday07:30 - 17:00Thursday07:30 - 17:00Friday07:30 - 17:00Saturday08:00 - 12:00Sunday08:00 - 12:001951 E West Rd Rm 118+1 808 943 1807Monday00:00 - 00:00Tuesday00:00 - 00:00Wednesday00:00 - 00:00Thursday00:00 - 00:00Friday00:00 - 00:00Saturday00:00 - 00:00Sunday00:00 - 00:002005 Kalia Rd+1 808 955 3757Monday08:00 - 12:00Tuesday08:00 - 12:00Wednesday08:00 - 12:00Thursday08:00 - 12:00Friday08:00 - 12:00Saturday08:00 - 12:00Sunday08:00 - 12:00201 Beach Walk+1 808 489 9133Monday07:00 - 12:00Tuesday07:00 - 12:00Wednesday07:00 - 12:00Thursday07:00 - 12:00Friday07:00 - 12:00Saturday07:00 - 12:00Sunday07:00 - 12:002169 Kalia Rd+1 808 923 2065Monday00:00 - 00:00Tuesday00:00 - 00:00Wednesday00:00 - 00:00Thursday00:00 - 00:00Friday00:00 - 00:00Saturday00:00 - 00:00Sunday00:00 - 00:002255 Kuiho Ave, 7+1 808 973 7200Opening times not available229 Paoakalani AveOpening times not available2500 Kuhio Ave+1 808 450 2747Monday00:00 - 00:00Tuesday00:00 - 00:00Wednesday00:00 - 00:00Thursday00:00 - 00:00Friday00:00 - 00:00Saturday00:00 - 00:00Sunday00:00 - 00:002552 Kalakaua Ave+1 808 926 4149Monday09:00 - 11:00Tuesday09:00 - 11:00Wednesday09:00 - 11:00Thursday09:00 - 11:00Friday09:00 - 11:00Saturday09:00 - 11:00Sunday09:00 - 11:00300 Rodgers Blvd+1 844 913 0737Monday05:00 - 23:00Tuesday05:00 - 23:00Wednesday05:00 - 23:00Thursday05:00 - 23:00Friday05:00 - 23:00Saturday05:00 - 23:00Sunday05:00 - 23:003055 N Nimitz Hwy+1 808 836 7722Monday07:30 - 17:00Tuesday07:30 - 17:00Wednesday07:30 - 17:00Thursday07:30 - 17:00Friday07:30 - 17:00Saturday00:00 - 00:00Sunday00:00 - 00:00445 Seaside Ave., Ste. 3c+1 808 922 0090Monday00:00 - 00:00Tuesday00:00 - 00:00Wednesday00:00 - 00:00Thursday00:00 - 00:00Friday00:00 - 00:00Saturday00:00 - 00:00Sunday00:00 - 00:00677 Ala Moana Blvd+1 808 536 1555Monday00:00 - 00:00Tuesday00:00 - 00:00Wednesday00:00 - 00:00Thursday00:00 - 00:00Friday00:00 - 00:00Saturday00:00 - 00:00Sunday00:00 - 00:00FiltersWonderful (30)Very good (9)Good (0)Okay (5)Fair (3)Mediocre (1)Poor (10)Show reviews that mentionpick up and dropstaff was very helpfulcar availablecar was greatget the carReviews10.0 WonderfulJohn, Jun 2025Full-sizeVery easy rental experience10.0 WonderfulTodd, Jun 2025StandardExcellent management group in Waikiki10.0 WonderfulAnonymous, Aug 2024Premium SUVI love the car a brand new Wagooner with all the bells and whistles.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Aug 2024MinivanSide doors did not open.

Then upon return, I attempted to refuel the vehicle but the gas door would not unlock despite numerous attempts so I was unable to refuel it.
