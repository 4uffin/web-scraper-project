Both check-in and check-out were clunky when the self-check-in tech didn't properly work, and necessitating assistance from staff who were swamped by multiple guests who needed help. Wi-Fi signal was weak and intermittent in most areas of the building. But, the basic room was clean and functional, and that's what I needed most.10WonderfulAnonymous, Aug 2023Hotel location is great and the room was well furnished. The walls are thin and you can hear people in the hallway and other rooms talking.8.0Very goodAnonymous, Jun 2023The rooms are all VERY close together. The end of one hallway has 4 doors side by side which includes the corner rooms that are somehow “bigger” I was told but it was average at best. Older hotel with modern decor and updated-ish bathrooms. Fresh coat of paint with minimal prep work, so it shows a poor job done. AC unit just blew air, was hardly cold. Parking is $45/night which is atrocious but I ...Read more5.1FairMichael, May 2019Pros (+) The staff were very friendly.Cons (-) The room was basically a closet, the fact that it cost almost $250 and another $38 for parking is absolutely absurd. It's also terribly outdated. I would've stayed somewhere else had I known how disappointing and overpriced the room was.9.1WonderfulAnonymous, Dec 2017Pros (+) Bathrooms are tiny. The tub is high which made it difficult for our more senior friends to get into the shower. It was really clean and would be great for business and did offer a good value for a downtown hotel.5.7FairAnonymous, Oct 2017Pros (+) Location.Cons (-) Not even a chair for sitting. Too small a room. Bath faucet needed fixing.9.1WonderfulEllen, Sep 2017Pros (+) The staff at the Executive Hotel Pacific were fantastic. They were helpful with recommendations and with ensuring my husband and I got to the airport on time for our (very early) flight. The room itself was just fine. We are used to smaller hotel rooms like this one, so it wasn't an issue for us at all. The bed was comfy, the room was clean—we had everything we needed. The location can't be beat: ...Cons (-) Because the hotel is old, the rooms aren't as sound proof as I would have liked. We could hear a lot of banging and shuffling in the room next to ours. Thankfully it didn't impact us getting good sleep, but it was something I noticed.Read more4.8MediocreAnonymous, Apr 2017Cons (-) Paper thin walls5.7FairAnonymous, Mar 2017Pros (+) Umbrellas in the lobby. Friendly staff!Cons (-) Tiny rooms, entire facility could use a face lift. Elevators don't stop at floor level so you're either lugging your suitcase up or down a level to get onto the elevator.7.4GoodAnonymous, Nov 2016Pros (+) Location to Century Link Field was good. Good location to other amenities. The bar downstairs was really good.Cons (-) Rooms were small and dated.Showing 1-10 of 2539 reviews12345...254The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What can I expect from the beds at Executive Hotel Pacific?Guests have described the beds at Executive Hotel Pacific as exceptionally comfortable, providing a great night's sleep.Is parking available at Executive Hotel Pacific?Yes, parking is available at Executive Hotel Pacific, but some guests have mentioned that the parking fees are relatively high.How is the food quality at Executive Hotel Pacific?Some guests have enjoyed the complimentary wine offered from 4-6, while others have mentioned that the restaurant's terrace and various nearby dining options provide a range of meal choices.What is the cleanliness like at Executive Hotel Pacific?Guests have described the rooms as clean and comfortable, although a few have mentioned minor issues such as a faint smell of smoke and some mold in the shower.What is the level of customer service like at Executive Hotel Pacific?The staff at Executive Hotel Pacific have been described as very friendly, accommodating, and attentive, providing excellent service and promptly responding to guests' requests.The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.Opt for a Deluxe RoomGuests found the deluxe rooms to be spacious and comfortable for two people, providing a good value for the price.Consider the Complimentary WineGuests appreciated the complimentary wine offered from 4-6, which added to their overall positive experience.Check for Noise IssuesSome guests reported noise issues, so it may be beneficial to inquire about room locations to avoid disturbances.Utilize the Nearby Public TransitThe hotel's proximity to public transit makes it convenient for exploring the city without the need for a car.Be Mindful of Check-in ProcessThe hotel's digital check-in process received mixed feedback, so guests should be prepared for potential challenges and consider alternative check-in methods if needed.Inquire About Room HeatingSome guests experienced issues with room heating, so it may be advisable to confirm the functionality of heating systems before arrival, especially during colder months.Consider Parking AlternativesWhile the hotel offers valet parking, guests may want to explore nearby parking options to compare prices and availability.Take Advantage of Nearby AttractionsThe hotel's location within walking distance of popular attractions like Pike Place Market and the Seattle waterfront makes it convenient for sightseeing and exploring the city.Ask About Room UpgradesInquiring about room upgrades may be worthwhile, as some guests found the standard rooms to be small and encountered issues with amenities like air conditioning.Be Aware of AccessibilityGuests with accessibility needs should confirm the availability of ADA-accessible features and inquire about any potential challenges related to the hotel's layout.Location400 Spring Street, Seattle, WA 98104What's nearbySeattle Public Library-Central Library90 yd5th Avenue Theatre269 ydSeattle Art Museum434 ydWashington State Convention Center0.3 miWaterfront Park0.4 miSeattle Aquarium0.4 miPike Place Market0.5 miGreater Seattle Business Association0.7 miSeattle University0.7 miLumen Field0.8 miT-Mobile Park1.1 miSpace Needle1.2 miPoliciesCheck-in/Check-outCheck in anytime after 4:00 PM, check out anytime before 11:00 AMCancellation/prepaymentCancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.Essential information about Executive Hotel PacificLow seasonHigh seasonAverage price (weeknight)Average price (weekend night)DecemberMarch$190$231Cheapest month to stay with an average 48% drop in price.Most expensive month to stay with an average 95% rise in price.Average Sun - Thu price over the last 2 weeks.Average Fri & Sat price over the last 2 weeks.When to book a room at Executive Hotel PacificPrice per night.
