If you can use Waze or another gps app to avoid tolls, then you're good. They do not allow you to pay for tolls yourself! Either pay for their expensive toll pass or not. This is likely true for many rentals now.Verified travelerAug 2025You get what you pay for!! Make sure the agency is actually AT the airport!! U-SAVE is terrible and everyone I know will be aware of that!BristonApr 2025Use a rental company that lets you go straight to the lot, choose a car, and drive out. I have never had a bad experience with one of those, I have rarely had a good experience with the cheaper options.MichaelApr 2025Use on site airport location. Tampa airport is awesome in every way.Verified travelerMay 2025You need to have car insurance that covers rental cars (and have this info printed out) or pay for the rental company's insurance. You probably don't need to pay for a toll pass unless you're going to Orlando--just set google maps to "avoid tolls" if you're heading to Clearwater/St Pete's beach to avoid the outrageous fees rental companies will charge you for tolls.Verified travelerMar 2025Bring your proof of insurance. If you’re pressed for time, use the airport rental cars instead of the off-airport rentals.Verified travelerApr 2025It you are arriving late at night expect to be in line for 2 hours.Verified travelerMay 2025Go with a rental company attached to the airportEmilyApr 2025Use one of the large car rental companies That are available at the airport. The offsite car rental places took forever to pick up and had horrible service.Verified travelerMay 2025Don’t get the toll pass unless you know you will for sure be crossing the bridge often. We wasted a lot of money getting it.JamesMar 2025Stick with the big brand name rental companies and do not be fooled by the supposedly cheaper prices offered by the other off site companies.Verified travelerMay 2025Make sure your car rental is actually at the airport and not offsite scams.MazenNov 2024Rent from a reputable car rental agency. You’ll pay a little bit more but it’s worth not having the hassle, unforeseen charges, comfort and convenience.Verified travelerSep 2024Make sure the car rental agency is on site at the airport because it is more convenientEdSep 2024Shop around. It took a little time, but I got a great price on a good car.PepperSep 2024Ensure that you are aware that you are going through a third party, that the address to the rental car place is accurate and that they will give you a receipt upon return.NathanNov 2024When in Tampa, opt for vehicle selections with more power and reliable, quick braking. The drivers are aggressive and you want to have the tools to avoid a collision.EasyOct 2024For any rental, You have to take a shuttle to get to the car. Leave an extra half hour for pick up.EugeneNov 2024Most drivers in Florida will require a Sun Pass.....if you have a Fast pass, bring it!FrancineJul 2024I would definitely tell them to buy the toll package because there were tolls on every road we went on.PHILAug 2024Stick to the airport rental car locations, not off site rentals, it was confusing to find pickup location, the driver was great, friendly and he helped he return the car after I waited in line for 15 minutes with no one even saying hello or greeting me or anyone else.Verified travelerAug 2024Rent a car at one of the companies directly at the on terminal location where you just need to take the train- not an additional shuttle that may take 5-30 minutes to arrive.RudyJul 2024To research what credit cards can be used for the rental and understand the choices if you use one that is not "accepted or on the approved list"SharonAug 2024Roads are pretty easy to drive in Tampa. If renting a Tesla know that the adapters are not included.Verified travelerJul 2024Read fine print and go with a bigger known companyCraigMar 2024Check your auto insurance coverage before the trip as it may or may not cover a rental. Many times you can avoid additional fees if you have a copy of your coverage.Verified travelerApr 2024There are plenty of rental car companies at the airport and they are all very competitive. Use them, no need to go off site and deal with sub-standard companies.lyndaMar 2024Always good to go with a convertible in Florida! Shop around though, there are so many of them you can find a deal!TimMay 2024Bring your ezpass so you can avoid the plate pass rental. Lots of toll roads here.MMay 2024The rental car counters are NOT by the Ground Transportation / Baggage Claim area as they usually are at most airports. They moved all rental car desks to an entirely offsite location at the newly built parking garage, which requires you to take the terminal shuttle train no matter which terminal you arrive at. This added ~20-30 minutes to my arrival experience overall.ElizabethMay 2024There are shuttles to take you between terminals but it’s a bit of zig zagging if you check bags. I was traveling solo with kids and had to shuttle to get my bags, then shuttle again to get the car. That’s not an Alamo issue but more of an airport heads upVerified travelerMay 2024There are gas stations located close to the airport if you want to fuel up the vehicle on your own. There are a number of toll roads in the area so you may want to consider getting the additional toll coverage.Verified travelerMay 2024i wished i knew about the need to have proof of the details of my insurance coverage in advance of actually picking up the carVerified travelerMar 2024Book at a rental that is in the airport. Request a light colored car. Ask about additional fees and insurance requirements.NikkiApr 2024Rent from a company that has their cars at the airport rental car stop from the airport train system.Verified travelerMar 2024Inquiry about a navigation system ahead of time if that is a convenience that you may find useful.Verified travelerApr 2024Try to book in advanceVerified travelerApr 2024Only rent cars through the big companies that have a presence on airport property. It may cost more but at least you can expect to have a reasonable transaction in an reasonable amount of time. If you still want to go with one of the off-site rental companies just look at their reviews on google maps first. There you will see several negative experiences similar to my own.DallasMar 2024Stay with the big names don't do any of the off-site rentals they are a scam and take way too long. Spend extra money and use the ones inside the airport.Paul-EricMar 2024DO not book online. Call ahead and find out what the final cost of your rental will be. It's a far cry from the advertised $71 per day.Verified travelerMay 2024Reserve more than one company in case you end up in a situation like this. Budget was cheaper but not worth the added hours and hassle!DavidFeb 2024Get the Sunpass with your rental to avoid high toll fees.DavidDec 2023The car rental center is a tram ride away. We had 1 person pick up the car while the other collected the luggage. After picking up the car, we then drove back to the terminal to get the other person and the luggage. All car rentals are at the car rental centerVerified travelerFeb 2024Get the insurance the rental company offers unless you have ironclad proof your company will meet their demands. It's easier.Verified travelerDec 2023Just use the car rental services at the airport.Verified travelerNov 2023Get the Florida Sun Pass if you aren't sure of the tolls on the Florida highways.

Lots of trafficVerified travelerOct 2023Don’t always go for the well known brandsKiranOct 2023Please rent from national agencies such as Hertz Avis Budget Enterprise etc. Local renters impose mileage restrictions and force to buy expensive insurance coverage from them and impose several other charges if you don’t ask them to explain. Lots of rip-off agents. Be very careful.LucindaJun 2023Rent from Avis. It might cost more but they will be there when your flight gets in. They are the only car rental that is staffed after midnight. Europcar/Fox might be cheap but they are horrible if you have any delay, even if uou call to tell them.Verified travelerJun 2023Good area for driving. Set my GPS for avoiding tolls and had no trouble getting around. Expected slowdowns near Clearwater beach we're not too terribleJessicaJul 2023Do it at the airport.

Always lock the vehicle and don't leave any valuables in plain site in the vehicle.Verified travelerMay 2023I would recommend clarifying the Sunpass usage through license plate.Verified travelerMay 2023Don't go with a no-name provider like Green Motion. If they aren't one of the top 10, you think you will save money in the end, but you won't. Stay away from Thrifty/Dollar at TPA unless you are in their preferred program that lets you skip the counter. Good companies, but the lines are inexcusably long and slow moving. And lastly, inspect the vehicle and do not be afraid to ask for a different one if you are dissatisfied with the condition (smell, cleanliness, scratches, etc.).KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in TampaRush hour in Tampa lasts from 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and picks back up again from 3:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. During rush hour, Hillsborough Ave and many of the I-275 exits can become very backed up so it pays to time your trip accordingly.

Staff are upselling to the benefit of the business and not necessarily that of the customer. I was offered a transponder but after closer inspection it would have been cheaper for me to pay for the tolls. This was very disappointing; I recommend better training and customer sensitivity workshops.2.0 PoorMahfuzul, Feb 2024Supplier choiceThe pickup experience was horrendous, took almost 2.5 hours. The initial check-in line was extremely long. Once check-in was completed and instructed to go to lower floor to pickup car, you had to find an employee to put your name on a waitlist. The system was chaotic and unorganized. The entire process took 2.5 hours, I was late to meet friends for lunch and delayed my entire schedule. I was only in town for a night and required me to make alternate arrangements. Lastly, I was billed incorrectly and charged for refueling, even though I returned it at the same level I took the car.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Dec 2023ConvertibleMy experience with the TAMPA AIRPORT DOLLAR RENTAL HAS BEEN UTTERLY DISGUSTING. They put me and my mother in a 2018 Nissan Rogue when here we are a few weeks shy of 2024. When you turned the wheel it made a horrible sound, the charging ports didn't work, the trunk didn't open and when you were at a stop light or idling it would shake and sputter. So I decided to drive 45 minutes back to the airport to get something better. Upon doing so they seemed to be annoyed with me. So after feeling that way I didn't want to complain when the car they exchanged with REEKED LIKE CIGARETTES. Me and my mother decided to just go buy some air fresheners and deal with it. We never mentioned the smell and now I 100% regret it. A few days after returning from Vacation I check my credit card and notice they charged me $400 dollars. I call customer service and am told I was charged that for a "cleaning fee for smoking in the vehicle" so I am now in the process of trying to dispute this charge. I have asked several times to see the notes from the previous person that rented the car to see if it was noted about it smelling like smoke and was told they aren't allowed to give me that information. DISGUSTING SCAMMING COMPANY.8.0 Very goodAnonymous, Nov 2023Compact SUVHad the choice of picking which vehicle I would like to drive. The Nissan Rogue that I was given had 54,000 plus miles and shook when driven above 60 miles per hour. It had a number of door dings which concerned me before I drove off the lot. The attendant was helpful in reassuring me that none of the blemishes identified would register as damage that I caused when returned.Back1 out of 43NextFox6.5OkayRead 239 reviewsCleanliness6.8Comfort6.8Pick-up/Drop-off6.4Value for money6.5One location in TampaShow locationsFox reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Tampa5405 Airport Service Road+1 813 337 0950Monday05:00 - 23:59Tuesday05:00 - 23:59Wednesday05:00 - 23:59Thursday05:00 - 23:59Friday05:00 - 23:59Saturday05:00 - 23:59Sunday05:00 - 23:59FiltersWonderful (64)Very good (39)Good (3)Okay (30)Fair (1)Mediocre (33)Poor (71)Show reviews that mentionget the carcar was dirtycar availablelong linewait timefriendly staffgreat pricenever rentwaited over an hourcustomer serviceShow moreReviews10.0 WonderfulAnonymous, Jul 2024CompactAll the people with whom I interacted were kind and helpful.

Two cars reeked of smoke, one had a smashed in back fender, and the last had sand and trash all over the floor board including 11 used water and soda bottles strewn around the interior of the car. The Avis agents were accommodating in switching cars but it was a terrible experience having to walk back and forth to the counter and car each time. It took over an hour to finally get into a car. They also didn’t escalate to a manager until I asked for one when we pulled the car up to show them all of the trash. The manager was very friendly and helpful. He apologized for the trouble. The return was challenging as well. The signage was poorly done. I parked in one of the designated return spots and followed signs up 8 flights of stairs to the rooftop to find that I had been misdirected. I walked back downstairs and ultimately found the return desk on the ground floor. The agent asked me where I parked and told me I had to move the car the rooftop. I told her the signs directed me to park in the designated spots side the garage which were clearly marked as Avis return spots but she insisted I move and that the car was now late. She said the signs were wrong and need to be removed. When I expressed displeasure with the poor signage and waste of time the agent told me I could call customer service. I had to go back upstairs and drive the car all the way to the top of the garage.

I was in literal tears but had to pay the money and go because I didn’t have time to try to find another car. Everyone I spoke to in the office was furious.

The car they had reserved for me was stuck behind several cars on the lot and inaccessible. Because of this they tried to give me another vehicle in the same class. The replacement they picked had visible damage/dent to the multiple panels, doors, and bumper. I started documenting all the damage in detail and taking pictures, the agent started getting visibly annoyed. He ended up providing me with a different car in the end.

That was not in my paperwork anywhere. Other people were angry in line (which is why the line took so long) because they require to see your insurance declaration page, which no one had. There were people trying to call their insurance agents. The people ahead of me walked away without a car. One man was asked to leave because he was angry that he was not aware of the insurance requirement. I was denied a car, had to take the shuttle back to the airport where my daughter and her baby were waiting for me to pick them up in the rental car.

There was an Extra airport surcharge that was NOT disclosed on the initial pricing for rental. I received email from company, said deposit for car was 250 with major CC, 500 with debit card, and as much as 2000 with FL residence. When requested insurance, stated policy, which was NOT disclosed in email, was that to use own Auto policy, deposit increased to 2000 for rental. Advertised vehicle was Toyota Corolla or similar... Recueved Mitsubishi hatchback... Was minimalist vehicle.

IT WAS A DISASTER! Thank God one of the guys working there took pity on my group since I had my 80 year old parents with me, and managed to find another vehicle for us. It was smaller than what we rented, but at least it was a vehicle. I'm thankful to the employee who bent over backwards to find us a vehicle, but York's policy of re-renting everyone's cars if they are not there within 1-2 hours is CRAZY! Everyone else got screwed.

If I could give it zero stars, I would. I have asked for a refund and had to go with a different rental upon landing in Florida. They tried to take a $3000 deposit even though we already had external insurance. They advertise that they're in the airport which they are not, and they didn't even offer a shuttle - they told us to Uber. Upon looking at reviews, many people said that they kept and wouldn't return the deposits claiming unreal damages. They also tried to do additional toll charges and other random shady things, that they communicated through text. Also, when they asked for the $3000 deposit, and we tried to escalate it since it was completely unheard of, they didn't say anything and changed the contract back to $500 without telling us (to delete the evidence). Terrible, terrible, terrible company. Pay more and go with a reputable service.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Apr 2023EconomyAirport shuttle from airport: Good communication, minimal wait. They called my insurance company to make sure I was covered. I already knew I was, so that was a time waster. Our car 4dr Mercedes was clean however, it was dented in 3-4 places and had a broken headlight cover. Interior smelled like smoke. The car worked and did its job getting around. Passenger window would stick or not work going up it had to be rolled up from the driver side. When I got the car, I told them when I return I will be here around 6:30pm. We can get a shuttle back to the airport correct? I was told yes. Upon returning the car at 6:30pm we were told they were closed (closed but people were still there) and they wouldn’t drive us to the airport. He said his coworker explained they were closed at 6pm and don’t do shuttles after 6pm. Kayak and the rental company promises airport shuttles. We were not given instructions on how to drop the car off if there had been no one there. We were also told our 6:30pm arrival wouldn’t be a problem for a shuttle.

I waited 45mins for a shuttle - every other rental car company had multiple shuttles arrive and depart prior to the Rent-a-wreck shuttle appearing a single time. Once I was finally at the counter, they wouldn’t accept my personal auto insurance from Amica, a very reputable company. Instead they insisted I purchase their liability insurance for $60/day. They couldn’t explain why they wouldn’t accept my insurance. It felt like a bait-and-switch scam. I walked away (as did the other potential customer on the shuttle with me), booked with another company on the spot and Uber-ed over there.

If you’re looking to save money go somewhere else2.0 PoorAndy, May 2025EconomyI'm sure that the cars were fine. What wasn't fine is what looked like a misrepresentation as to where they were located (looked like it was in or adjacent to the terminal and it wasn't) it was a 10 minute bus ride away and the real fun started when you finally got to the counter; they didn't take Amex which was not in the on-line rental agreement and as I didn't have my VISA I wasn't about to let them charge a $2500 deposit to my Debit Card. Then there was a demand for proof of insurance not the normal show your insurance card they wanted to see the declarations page out of your policy. Who carries that around? The final straw was the rental agents themselves or at least the one that waited on me. Face tattoos galore and surly to say the least. Their cars were incredibly cheap but it seemed to be a huge rip off and in disgust I finally got back in the bus back to the terminal and rented a car at Thrifty for 20 times what Rent-A-Wreck was charging. The last thing was that the Rent A Wreck counter had about five names on it and the same 3-4 clerks working it. There were families crying in the parking lot because of the hassle going on inside. It was amazing.

They were on time in shuttling us to and from the airport (since they were off airport location but only minutes away so not inconvenient at all). Both the shuttle and car rental were clean. The registration process was easy and efficient. I would totally use them again HOWEVER, I don’t recall their website stating that the price I paid was just to reserve the car. When we got there they asked for our insurance and if it didn’t state we had 300k on Property Damage Liability (which I never heard a company having this requirement) we had to purchase theirs, no way around that. Although I had purchased extra rental coverage through a third party site which was pointless because this car rental company didn’t accept. So the car that was originally 30$ for the day ended up being almost 110$ after adding the sun pass and additional insurance. We were on a schedule to get our trip moving along smoothly so I just bit the bullet and used their services but this felt like a bait and switch tactic which is why I have a bad review. Too bad because I liked everything else about it. It would’ve just been easier, convenient and cheaper had I just used a well known rental company right inside the airport.2.0 PoorAnonymous, May 2024CompactBad experience.
