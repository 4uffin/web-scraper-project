Well positioned for most things.4.0MediocreCrystal, May 2022The room was small, but at least I didn't get a micro room. I assumed the hotel had parking, but after I booked, I checked their website and it said it was $50 to park at the hotel that I had just booked a room at! So I had to pay for a parking garage blocks away. The lobby is super small, like everything else. No breakfast, did hear someone else being offered a beer when they checked in, not sure...Read more4.0MediocreKimberly, Apr 2022Good location but parking was full and the only lot was several blocks away. It was nice that we were offered a free beer but as someone who is gluten free I couldn’t enjoy it. The room was very tiny. The view was of a dirty building and the noise from the rain at night was so loud I had a hard time sleeping. The toilet was leaking and the bathroom floor was soaked. It felt more like a hostel than...Read more10WonderfulAnonymous, Feb 2020Pros (+) They have these brew and roast meetings in the morning and afternoon and invite the whole hotel down for free coffee and drinks so everyone can meet and mingleCons (-) Something very minor the hotel hadn’t even considers an annoyance to its visitors.

I paid well over $350+ per night. The rooms are very small....New York small! Air conditioners are old window units and obstruct views. We asked for a late checkout because we had a late afternoon flight and before my husband could finish his sentence they flat out said NO! A simple, “I’m sorry sir, we uortunately cannot accommodate a late checkout.” Would have been...Read more6.0OkayAnonymous, Apr 2017Pros (+) The front desk staff and the valets were very friendly.Cons (-) The room size was ridiculous and the bathroom was the size of a closet. They obviously know that the rooms are noisy because they give you a pair of ear plugs on the nightstands.10WonderfulAnonymous, Nov 2016Pros (+) Craft beer everyday from 5-6pm for free and as much as you can drink in an hour.Showing 1-10 of 1755 reviews12345...176The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What are the hotel's room amenities like?The hotel offers rooms with original artwork, Bluetooth clock radios, spacious work stations, flat-screen televisions with premium cable channels, complimentary high-speed WiFi, plush bedding, signature mattress, ambient lighting, individual climate control, and plush bathrobes.
