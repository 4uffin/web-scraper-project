Asu volcano) are all best accessed by road.Japan has an extensive system of toll roads, which can be paid for in many different ways. Besides the regular cash and credit card payment booths, drivers who rent a car in Japan can add an Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) device on to their rental; some companies like Toyota Rent a Car even include them as standard. This allows you to pass through the toll system without paying on the spot. All tolls are added together and paid to the rental company when the car is returned.The law in Japan states that children under 6 must be restrained in an age-appropriate car seat in the rear seats of the vehicle. Car rental agencies generally have baby and child seats for different age categories, which can be booked in advance for an additional fee. Nippon Rent-A-Car, for example, charges approximately ¥540 ($5) per seat per day.While cross-border car rentals are not permitted in Japan, rental agencies have no problem with drivers visiting the different Japanese islands by car ferry. These ferries are a popular way of traveling from island to island but can be quite expensive. In the case of a very long sea journey (e.g., to Rebun or Sado), it may in fact be cheaper to drop off your car at the ferry port and pick up a new one on the other side.25% of our users found rental cars in Japan for $51 or lessEconomy rental cars in Japan are around 37% cheaper than other car types, on averageSee more tipsFAQs about renting a car in JapanHow much does it cost to rent a car in Japan?On average a rental car in Japan costs $58 per day.How can I find car rentals near me in Japan?Take a look at our extensive car rental location map to find the best rental cars near you.Where should I rent a car in Japan?Based on car searches on KAYAK, the most popular cities to rent a car in Japan are Tokyo (30% of total searches of users looking to rent a car in Japan), Okinawa (14%) and Sapporo (13%).How much does it cost to rent a car for a week in Japan?On average a rental car in Japan costs $405 per week ($58 per day).How much does it cost to rent a car long term for a month in Japan?On average a rental car in Japan costs $1,737 per month ($58 per day).What is driving like in Japan?Driving conditions in Japan are generally very good, with roads well maintained and a large network of highways that crisscross the country.
