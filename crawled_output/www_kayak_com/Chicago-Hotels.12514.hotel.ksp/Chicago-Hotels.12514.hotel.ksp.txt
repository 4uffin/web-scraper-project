While most travelers tend to stick to the Magnificent Mile when they come to town, this list embraces stays tucked away in neighborhoods like Hyde Park, Wicker Park, Chinatown, and Fulton Market to push the bounds of what folks imagine their Chicago visit can include. Explore the city’s rich culture beyond deep dish pizza and crosstown baseball rivalries through the eyes of a local with this collection.

Inspired by streamlined Japanese aesthetics and culinary precision at its in-house sushi restaurants, this is one of the most unique hotels in Chicago. The oasis-like feel is carried into every room, and its reservation-required rooftop showcasing stunning skyline views.I highly recommend a dip in the indoor tranquility pool, or enjoy a steam as part of other wellness amenities. With its proximity to West Loop and River North, you’re a short walk from incredible clubs, bars, and restaurants.I recommend dancing at Nights & Weekends or Tribe, taking in a concert at Bottom Lounge or City Winery, or playing vintage arcade games at Emporium Fulton Market.Check pricesCheck pricesSophy Hyde ParkRank #2$201-$632/night1411 East 53rd StreetNestled in Downtown Hyde Park, the Sophy Hotel, one of the luxury hotels in Chicago, offers modern sophistication...Learn moreNestled in Downtown Hyde Park, the Sophy Hotel, one of the luxury hotels in Chicago, offers modern sophistication with a nod to the creative pulse inspiring the next generation of the neighborhood.With common spaces, standard rooms, and deluxe suites that almost double as art galleries, a stay at the Sophy is a feast for the senses.

Get cozy around the firepit on outdoor terrace, The Sanctuary, where cocktails and mocktails are plenty.Once rested and fed, you’re just blocks from favored nightlife haunts like The Promontory, as well as the landmark Frederick C.

Situated just off Archer Avenue, the hotel is close enough to the action but far enough to get a proper rest after inevitably shutting down the nearby karaoke bars – or, my personal favorite, standout craft cocktail lounge Nine Bar – close at 2 a.m.Offering standard amenities including complimentary Wi-Fi, a work desk, and an iron and ironing board, the hotel encourages guests to become part of the neighborhood. Need a bit of guidance? The 24-hour reception staff is there, providing restaurant recommendations and regularly updating a running calendar of local events to partake in, something that makes Jaslin one of my top-rated hotels in Chicago.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Robey, Chicago, a Member of Design HotelsRank #4$170-$859/night2018 West North AvenueFinding its home in what Chicagoans think of when they hear “Flat Iron Building,” formerly known as the Northwest...Learn moreFinding its home in what Chicagoans think of when they hear “Flat Iron Building,” formerly known as the Northwest Tower, The Robey has become more than a hotel – it’s a beloved, local hangout spot for its art deco vibes, stellar brunch, and bars Clever Coyote and The Up Room.With an exclusive 89 rooms, the boutique accommodations are split between 69 tower rooms–inclusive of its top-floor Panorama Suite which boasts a 180-degree view of the city skyline – and 20 Annex Lofts that offer guests more distinctive, warehouse-style sleeping quarters.All guests are invited to enjoy complimentary bikes and several discounts from local businesses to aid them in their self-guided tours around Wicker Park, Bucktown, and beyond.

Fully Instagrammable, from its entry level to second-floor lobby check-in and communal areas, guests are greeted by eclectic, tongue-in-cheek, existentialist works that would’ve inspired even the likes of Andy Warhol.The hotel aims to alleviate some of the overthinking travelers experience when visiting new cities – presenting one, identical style across its 280 rooms – perfect for two adults instead of numerous ones of varying appeal and higher price points. Outfitted with an extra-large bed to share, adjustable, colored mood lights, and blackout blinds, the hotel offers unexpected ways to customize your stay to your liking.Start your day off with a buffet breakfast before crossing the Michigan Avenue bridge to retail heaven or take to the renovated Riverwalk for a different perspective.Check pricesCheck pricesChicago Athletic AssociationRank #6$108-$2,053/night12 South Michigan AvenueThe Chicago Athletic Association is one of those hotels you don’t ever have to leave if you don’t want to.

If that’s not enough to convince you, it also happens to be one of the few hotels that aims to provide luxe pampering for every member of the family – pets included.And if you do happen to be travelling with a four-legged companion (dog, cat, or any non-human bestie as long as they fit in the elevator), the hotel offers pet-friendly accommodations at no additional charge, with no deposit required.Taking care of all its guests’ minds, bodies, and souls, you are invited to enjoy a nightly social hour, reserve time in a sensory meditation pod to align your mental and physical health in the wellness lounge, access a state-of-the-art fitness center, and borrow bikes to traverse downtown.

Guests know they’re experiencing the unparalleled during a Peninsula visit, from fine dining to exclusive access to tickets for Broadway in Chicago performances.Now, kids – or “junior guests” – can relish the same perks with Camp Peninsula.
