It was perfect for our family.Cons (-) Housekeeping didn’t change the sheets regularly and always came by at different times when we actually needed the room. The amenity fee was unwanted since we didn’t want any of the extras and there was no way to opt out. At $25 per day it was a bit much.Showing 1-10 of 1797 reviews12345...180The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What can I expect from the beds at Aston Waikiki Sunset?The beds at Aston Waikiki Sunset are comfortable, providing a good night's sleep for our guests.Is parking available at Aston Waikiki Sunset?Yes, Aston Waikiki Sunset offers free parking, which is a great convenience for our guests.How is the food quality at Aston Waikiki Sunset?Aston Waikiki Sunset does not offer on-site dining, but the rooms feature complete kitchens, allowing guests to prepare their meals and enjoy the convenience of home-cooked food.What is the cleanliness like at Aston Waikiki Sunset?Aston Waikiki Sunset maintains a clean and comfortable environment for our guests, ensuring a pleasant stay.What is the customer service like at Aston Waikiki Sunset?The staff at Aston Waikiki Sunset are friendly and accommodating, providing a warm and welcoming experience for our guests.The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.Opt for a Room with a ViewSeveral guests mentioned that the views from the rooms were spectacular.
