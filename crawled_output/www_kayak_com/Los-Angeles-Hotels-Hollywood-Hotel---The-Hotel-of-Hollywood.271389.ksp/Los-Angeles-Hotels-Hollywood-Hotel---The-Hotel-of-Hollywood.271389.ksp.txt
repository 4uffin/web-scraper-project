The hotel itself is a great value and very clean.Cons (-) The area is a bit schetchy. I would not suggest this location if you wished to be in walking distance from attractions.2.0PoorAnonymous, Mar 2018Pros (+) BreakfastCons (-) Pool not open. They charge for anything and everything, making it feel like Vegas. Difficult to park, deal with mgmt and to utilize hotel features. Pool was closed every time we tried to use it. On paper this hotel looks like a good choice but in reality it is like a cheap motel.7.4GoodAnonymous, Sep 2017Pros (+) Clean, spacious room. Nice little courtyard, pool area was nice as well. Conveniently located near some great food options, a little walk or drive will get you to nearby entertainment options. I would stay here again.Cons (-) Would be nice if parking was included, but like most places in big cities it was an extra $25, but the parking is gated and ensures your car is safe.Showing 1-10 of 2727 reviews12345...273The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What are the hotel's unique amenities?The Hollywood Hotel offers a fitness center with Nautilus machines, a sauna, a gift shop, a meditative atrium garden and fountain, and a pool area surrounded by gardens.
