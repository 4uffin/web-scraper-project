Cleanness of the bed covers bad. My wife and I conclusion were that we will not be subject to that experience never again3.7PoorAnonymous, Oct 2019Pros (+) The staff was friendly and helpful.Cons (-) The first nights room smelled like wet dog and the AC was noisy and kept me up all night. I was able to switch rooms but the new room had a new awful smell all it’s own. There was a ton of shady people hanging around the hotel, pretty sure I watched one drug deal. I never leave reviews but this hotel was so gross and bad that I had to leave one this time. Will never stay there again.3.1PoorDavid, Mar 2019Pros (+) The location, close to the freeway, was good.Cons (-) The room smelled like cheap booze and cigarettes. The room had been updated several times, but you can paint, repaint and paint again only so many times. The facility is very poor by La Quinta standards, and should be torn down. We heard a fight during the night in the parking lot outside our room, and people yelling at other times. We left the next day as soon as the sun rose!5.7FairTim, Sep 2017Pros (+) The bed was by far the best part. It was pretty comfortable. The location was decent. The area wasn't the greatest but it wasn't bad. The tv was nice too.Cons (-) The carpet seemed pretty old and stained. Also the room needs some major updating. Not all the lights worked. The shower head was too low. I'm only 5'5" and i still had to bend over to get wet by the shower. Also the water kept going from scolding hot to cold all while i never touched the knobs. Breakfast would have been nice. We went there about 8:30 expecting food but it was all gone except a li...Read more8.8Very goodAnonymous, Apr 2017Pros (+) convenient location, especially with Dennys, Starbucks & gas station adjacent. comfortable bed breakfast adequateCons (-) Neighborhood is a little rough8.0Very goodAnonymous, Mar 2016Pros (+) Combination of price and qualityCons (-) Homeless people around4.0MediocreAnonymous, Oct 2015Pros (+) The bed was amazingly comfortable. I probably won't stay here again because I prefer hotels over motels (room entrances that lead into an interior hallway rather than the outside) That's my fault for not really checking it out. The staff was very friendly and courteous.Cons (-) The room wasn't cleaned very well each day. The shower head was so low I had to bend over in order for any part of my body above my stomach to get wet. The location of this hotel is not the best. Not someplace I would consider staying if I had kids with me. The tweaked-out hooker knocking on my door at 3 a.m. was a nice touch.Showing 1-10 of 1831 reviews12345...184The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What amenities are available at La Quinta Inn Phoenix Thomas Road?La Quinta Inn Phoenix Thomas Road offers amenities such as an outdoor pool, meeting rooms, room service, laundry facilities, complimentary breakfast, and multilingual staff.What can I expect from the cleanliness of the rooms at La Quinta Inn Phoenix Thomas Road?Guests have reported mixed experiences with cleanliness, with some mentioning clean rooms and others noting issues such as dirty sheets, rusty items, and unclean bathrooms.Are the beds comfortable at La Quinta Inn Phoenix Thomas Road?Guests have provided mixed feedback about the beds, with some finding them comfortable and others mentioning that the rooms were run down and the beds were not up to standard.Is there free parking available at La Quinta Inn Phoenix Thomas Road?Yes, La Quinta Inn Phoenix Thomas Road offers free parking for guests, providing convenience and cost savings during your stay.What is the best time to visit La Quinta Inn Phoenix Thomas Road?The high season at La Quinta Inn Phoenix Thomas Road is in February, while the low season is in April.
