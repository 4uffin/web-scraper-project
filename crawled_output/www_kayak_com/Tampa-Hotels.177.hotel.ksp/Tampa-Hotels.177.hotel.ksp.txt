When it comes to the most atmospheric hotels in my sunny city by the bay, narrowing down my picks to just 10 options can be a bit of a challenge.
For this list, I considered location, first-class amenities that add that extra sparkle to your stay and unexpected perks, whether that’s in the form of a sky-high rooftop bar, a spectacular pool scene buzzing with energy or a hideaway boutique property in a more historic part of town. When it comes to the best hotels in Tampa that come with a true sense of place and style, I’ve got you covered.JW Marriott Tampa Water StreetRank #1$261-$1,619/night510 Water StreetEver since it opened in late 2020, this stylish stay in the buzzing Water Street Tampa district has made a name for...Learn moreEver since it opened in late 2020, this stylish stay in the buzzing Water Street Tampa district has made a name for itself as one of the best hotels in Tampa. I’ve loved watching the JW Marriott Tampa Water Street unveil new openings over recent years.Their latest offering is Tampa’s highest rooftop bar, Beacon, located on the hotel’s 27th floor. It’s my favorite perch in the city for sipping a spicy margarita and sharing a charcuterie tower with friends, all while overlooking the city and water views.Rooms are minimalist and sleek, with luxurious linens and large windows that take in views of Harbour Island across the riverfront. This hotel also has my favorite wellness escape, the Spa by JW, with a rooftop whirlpool and 10 treatment rooms. Plan at least one meal at the ground floor Driftlight Steakhouse, with French brasserie vibes and dishes like gulf shrimp cocktail and wagyu carpaccio.Check pricesCheck pricesAC Hotel by Marriott Tampa AirportRank #2$162-$594/night4020 West Boy Scout BoulevardKeep reading for proof that a hotel stay near a mid-size city’s airport doesn’t have to lack style and substance....Learn moreKeep reading for proof that a hotel stay near a mid-size city’s airport doesn’t have to lack style and substance. The AC Hotel by Marriott Tampa Airport is less than three miles from Tampa’s friendly international airport (my favorite in all of the US).You can easily walk to nearby restaurants like Cooper’s Hawk, and it’s also ideally located for jumping on the Courtney Campbell Causeway to make the 21-mile jaunt west to Clearwater Beach. You’ll also find complimentary shuttle service to and from the airport, making this one of the best hotels in Tampa for convenience.Among other great amenities here you’ll find an outdoor pool that stays open late (till 11pm every day of the week), a modern gym with ellipticals, treadmills and free weights, and the lively AC Lounge, a fun spot to gather before going out that serves up cocktails and tapas.Check pricesCheck pricesHotel HayaRank #3$105-$568/night1412 East 7th AvenueIf you’re in the market for a boutique stay, I’ve got a spot for you.

Located in the heart of Ybor City – Tampa’s Latin quarter and most historic district – Hotel Haya is a gem of a property.This is the place to book if you want to be able to stroll out to bars, restaurants and nightclubs in this part of town. There’s even a free trolley you can ride to downtown Tampa.The 178-room hotel conjures up mid-century Cuba vibes when you’re sipping a cafe con leche and sampling my favorite Cuban sandwich in the city at Cafe Quiquiriqui, just off the lobby. Brunch is epic at the fine dining restaurant, Flor Fina, where friends kickstart the weekend with Cuban Montecristos and mimosas. Don’t miss the courtyard pool scene, with cabanas and pool parties starring top local DJs and pop-up activations.Check pricesCheck pricesTampa Marriott Water StreetRank #4$226-$1,025/night505 Water StreetOne of the things I love most about this hotel, located right along the riverfront in downtown Tampa, is that so...Learn moreOne of the things I love most about this hotel, located right along the riverfront in downtown Tampa, is that so many of the rooms have balconies. Slide open the doors, step outside and take in those glittering water views as you sip your morning coffee.The Tampa Marriott Water Street, which opened in 2000, has a few more years under its belt than its nearby sister property (the JW Marriott Tampa Water Street). But the two hotels complement each other nicely. I find it hard to pick a favorite between them, because they both have the same enviable Water Street Tampa location, at the heart of everything fun in the city.There are some awesome restaurants here too, including top Oaxacan happy hour spot Lona by Chef Richard Sandoval and my oyster-slurping favorite Anchor and Brine, overlooking the riverfront. One of the best hotels in Tampa for food lovers.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Current Hotel, Autograph CollectionRank #5$180-$881/night2545 North Rocky Point DriveI first discovered this hotel when a family member hosted a pre-wedding brunch at its beautiful rooftop shortly...Learn moreI first discovered this hotel when a family member hosted a pre-wedding brunch at its beautiful rooftop shortly after it opened in 2019. The Current Hotel, Autograph Collection might not be located downtown (it’s right near the airport, about 10 miles west of downtown Tampa), but it’s still one of the best hotels in Tampa.You can catch an amazing sunset here – the kind that paints the entire sky sherbet orange and the water purple – between the rooftop and rooms, many of which have water views over Tampa Bay.Rooms are contemporary and clean-lined, with plenty of natural light and crisp white linens and towels. I particularly love the bay views from the rooftop pool. And when you’re ready for beach time, jump on the Courtney Campbell Cause for the 17-mile drive directly west to the powdery sands of Clearwater Beach.Check pricesCheck pricesSeminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino TampaRank #6$251-$1,020/night5223 North Orient RoadThe Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Tampa is just seven miles northeast of downtown.

No place makes me feel more like I’m on a proper staycation in my hometown.For starters, there’s the 245,000 square foot casino, an adult playground that serves up serious Vegas vibes complete with blackjack, live action poker and more. But there’s tons to do for non-gamblers too, from the three on-site swimming pools lined with private cabanas fit for a rockstar to yoga classes and a great fitness center.My favorite spot has to be the music-centric Rock Spa & Salon. It has a hammam ritual room, a co-ed aqua lounge and fully immersive treatments designed to turn your massage into a rhythmic experience.Check pricesCheck pricesEpicurean Hotel, Autograph CollectionRank #7$209-$1,405/night1207 South Howard AvenueSometimes you want to stay in a hotel that’s at the heart of a living, breathing neighborhood full of local people...Learn moreSometimes you want to stay in a hotel that’s at the heart of a living, breathing neighborhood full of local people walking their dogs or pushing strollers. That’s when I’d point you to the ‘hood of Hyde Park, minutes from downtown Tampa, and the Epicurean Hotel, Autograph Collection. The property sits right across the street from the city’s most famous restaurant, Bern’s Steak House. Even if you don’t have a booking, it’s worth popping by in case there’s a last-minute opening.The hotel’s focus on good taste can be seen in thoughtful touches like artisan pantries in each room, which come stocked with local craft beers, and the in-house cooking theater, where James Beard chefs regularly host culinary demos. Cool off at the hotel’s pool or book a fresh fruit scrub at Spa Evangeline.Check pricesCheck pricesHotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by HiltonRank #8$84-$498/night5303 West Kennedy BoulevardAnother goodie within a three-mile drive of the airport and just six miles from downtown, Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry...Learn moreAnother goodie within a three-mile drive of the airport and just six miles from downtown, Hotel Alba Tampa, Tapestry Collection by Hilton is one of the best hotels in Tampa. It also happens to be my personal favorite in the city's lively Westshore District.The hotel’s 222 rooms have plenty of design flair, with luxury linens, hardwood floors and gorgeous tiled bathrooms. The linens on the beds are of the starched white variety – pull the blackout curtains shut before you sleep and settle in for some seriously restorative. When visiting friends stay here, I love to pop by and chill with a cocktail at the pool bar, where you’ll usually find Southern music playing. There are lots of other lovely outdoor nooks scattered around the hotel, where you can hang out or simply enjoy a good book surrounded by tropical greenery and local artworks.Check pricesCheck pricesLe Méridien Tampa, The CourthouseRank #9$145-$653/night601 North Florida AvenueIf you’re looking for one of the most unique hotels in Tampa, this is the place to come.

Le Meridien Tampa, The Courthouse used to be – you guessed it – a place of law and attempted order. It’s easy to picture the hotel in its former courthouse guise thanks to grandiose architectural features that include original oak doors and elegant marble hallways.I always recommend this boutique hotel to friends who don’t want to break the bank but are looking for a stylish and walkable spot close to all of downtown’s highlights, including parks, the Tampa Riverwalk and restaurants, as it’s easily one of the best hotels in Tampa.There are some fun food options here too, including Sal Rosa restaurant, with its nods to Tampa’s Latin American cuisine influences, and a great little gelato spot called Scoops.Check pricesCheck pricesGrand Hyatt Tampa BayRank #10$173-$844/night2900 Bayport DriveIf you love nothing more than a lively, lavish brunch while on vacation, bookmark the Grand Hyatt Tampa Bay. There...Learn moreIf you love nothing more than a lively, lavish brunch while on vacation, bookmark the Grand Hyatt Tampa Bay. There you’ll find Oystercatchers, one of the best brunch spots in the entire city. Overlooking Tampa Bay, it goes to town with its over-the-top Sunday brunch buffet, offering everything from freshly shucked oysters and sushi to carved meats and handmade pastries.The hotel sprawls across 35 waterfront acres lined with mangroves – a real piece of Florida nature right there – yet is just five minutes from the airport. There are two outdoor pools, firepits and even a 9.5-mile-long bayside trail nearby, where you can go for a scenic jog or bike ride. One of the best hotels in Tampa, this is the spot I always suggest friends if they want to be close to the airport and city yet feel a whole world away.Check pricesCheck pricesBooking InsightsKAYAK’s insights for hotels in TampaDiscover seasonal trends, ideal booking windows, and other data-driven tips to plan your stay in Tampa with confidence.How much does a hotel cost in Tampa?The average price of a double room in Tampa is $208 per night.
