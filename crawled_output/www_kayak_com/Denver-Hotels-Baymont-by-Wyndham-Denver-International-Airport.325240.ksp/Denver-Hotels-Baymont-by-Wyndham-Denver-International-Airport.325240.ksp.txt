That is why we picked it. Room was clean. Bed was hard as a rock. AC/heater had a musky odor when turned on. Breakfast could have used an uplift. The variety was good though.

It was very clean, well stocked, good costumer service, and overall good value for your money. However, recently management changed and the Hotel went downhill.Cons (-) We had BUGS in our room. They looked like half roaches half bed bugs. Disgusting. This was unacceptable. They did end up changing our rooms, but all the rooms ended up being poorly stocked (in one room they didn’t put towels), and with suboptimal hygiene. The customer service went from good to horrible. The supervisor was rude and unprofessional. She did not want to be bothered by costumers.9.4WonderfulAnonymous, Nov 2017Pros (+) Peaceful & quite since it’s away from everyone & everything.4.8MediocreAnonymous, Oct 2017Pros (+) LocationCons (-) Few towels and those we had were cheap, thin and small.
