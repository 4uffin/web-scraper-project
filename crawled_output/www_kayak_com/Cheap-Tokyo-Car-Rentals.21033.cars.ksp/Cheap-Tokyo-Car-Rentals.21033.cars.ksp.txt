In such a huge metropolis, taxi prices are significantly higher, so renting a car from Tokyo car rental can be a cost-effective option to explore Japan.

Signs on major roads and highways are in Japanese and English, but you may want to make sure the rental car has a good English navigational system because most rural roads have signage in Japanese.

Stopping at red signs and before crossing railway lines is mandatory, even if there’s no approaching train. Drunk driving is taken very seriously in Japan, so be careful and have a designated sober driver.The Shuto Expressway, also known as the Capital Expressway, is a network of busy roads in Japan, which can be quite congested during rush hour. Surprisingly, the city center has a good flow of traffic most of the time, unless there’s a major concert or event. Depending on your itinerary, keep in mind that Tokyo's rush hour lasts from 7am to 9am and then 5pm to 7pm.All children up to age six in Japan are required to be in rear-facing car seats, while older children may be in booster seats.

Friendly staff and very accommodating to our groups needs.10.0 WonderfulAnonymous, May 2024MiniCouldn't have gone any smoother.8.0 Very goodAnonymous, Apr 2024IntermediateThe pick-up location is NOT at the airport which we thought so we took a taxi to the address provided by Expedia. Unfortunately the address needs to be updated as that address is the old building. Luckily, our taxi driver was willing to speak with the company over the phone to get the new address. They did provide paperwork in English for us to revise. It is only for 1 driver so you cannot switch off no matter how many people you have with you. We also purchased additional insurance for towing, etc in case anything happens. They didn’t speak English there but they did utilize a translation device which helped. Drop off was very easy and the company provided a free shuttle to the airport from the rental location. After this experience, I would definitely recommend not getting a rental car as there is no free public parking anywhere. Definitely use public transits like busses or trains to get where you need to go. It will save more money vs paying for the toll ways and public parking locations.Times6.0OkayCleanliness6.0Comfort6.0Pick-up/Drop-off6.0Value for money6.031 locations in TokyoCar rental locationsLocations in Tokyo1-1-13, Higashi Shin Koiwa, Katsushika-ku+81 356 728 924Opening times not available1-2 Kioi-cho, Chiyoda-ku+81 332 396 870Opening times not available1-2-12-1F, Takadanobaba, Shinjuku-ku+81 332 075 656Opening times not available1-25-17, Komone, Itabashi-ku+81 359 951 180Opening times not available1-5-5 Ebisu Minami, Shibuya-ku+81 357 951 411Opening times not available1-7-2 Otemachi Chiyoda-ku+81 352 015 656Opening times not available170-0013 東京都豊島区東池袋4-25-9 タイムズステーション2F, 2F Times Station, 4-25-9 Higashi Ikebukuro, Toshima-ku, Tokyo, 170-0013, JapanOpening times not available1F South Wing of Terminal 1, 3-3-2 Haneda Airport, Ota-ku, TokyoOpening times not available1st Floor at Matsumoto Building - (1332)+81 425 298 866Monday08:00 - 20:00Tuesday08:00 - 20:00Wednesday08:00 - 20:00Thursday08:00 - 20:00Friday08:00 - 20:00Saturday08:00 - 20:00Sunday08:00 - 20:002-1-1, Funabashi, Setagaya-ku+81 354 901 177Opening times not available2-11-10-101, Minami Shinozaki-machi, Edogawa-ku+81 336 988 686Opening times not available2-12-9 Sasazuka Shibuya-ku Tokyo Tokyo (Tokyo) JapanOpening times not available2-12-9 Sasazuka, Shibuya-ku+81 353 547 474Opening times not available2-18 Himonya, Meguro-ku+81 357 250 212Opening times not available2-6-1, Ishikawa-cho, Ota-ku+81 337 298 686Opening times not available2-8, Shiomi, Edogawa-ku+81 356 355 680Opening times not available3-13-3, Takanawa, Minato-ku+81 354 475 656Opening times not available3-3-3, Haginaka, Ota-ku+81 337 452 822Opening times not available3-92 Senju, Adachi-Ku+81 352 845 353Opening times not available4-1-1 Nakano+81 353 437 891Opening times not available4-25-9, Higashi-Ikebukuro, Toshima-ku+81 359 528 924Opening times not available5-24-20 Nishi-shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo+81 353 045 656Opening times not available5-33-7, Shiba, Minato-ku+81 354 441 190Opening times not availableAt Times AtreOpening times not availableB1F at SHINAGAWA GOOS - (1377)+81 354 475 656Monday08:00 - 20:00Tuesday08:00 - 20:00Wednesday08:00 - 20:00Thursday08:00 - 20:00Friday08:00 - 20:00Saturday08:00 - 20:00Sunday08:00 - 20:00B2F at Times Station Yurakucho Itocia+81 352 228 981Opening times not available東京都世田谷区船橋2-1-1, 2-1-1 FunabashiOpening times not available東京都大田区萩中3-3-3+81 3 3745 2822Opening times not available東京都板橋区小茂根1-25-17, 1-25-17 KomoneOpening times not available東京都渋谷区恵比寿南1-5-5 タイムズアトレ(平面)内, Times AgreOpening times not available江東区潮見2丁目8番地Opening times not availableFiltersNo reviews availableCrq-carrent4.0MediocreCleanliness4.0Comfort4.0Pick-up/Drop-off4.0Value for money4.0One location in TokyoCar rental locationsLocations in Tokyo1-1 Furugome, Narita, Chiba 日本+30 800 848 1072Opening times not availableFiltersNo reviews availableBudget2.0PoorRead 1 reviewCleanliness2.0Comfort2.0Pick-up/Drop-off2.0Value for money2.0One location in Tokyofrom$50/dayBudget reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Tokyo2-6-8 Keihinjima Ota-Ku+81 3 5755 0970Monday08:00 - 20:00Tuesday08:00 - 20:00Wednesday08:00 - 20:00Thursday08:00 - 20:00Friday08:00 - 20:00Saturday08:00 - 20:00Sunday08:00 - 20:00FiltersReviews2.0 PoorAnonymous, May 2021Pros:NothingCons:The policy about cancellation is greedy and unfair.
