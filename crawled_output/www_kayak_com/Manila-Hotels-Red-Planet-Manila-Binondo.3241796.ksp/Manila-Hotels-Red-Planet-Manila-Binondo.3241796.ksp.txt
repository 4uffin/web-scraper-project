To access your floor, you have to scan your room card which is an added security & peace of mind for me. There are computers on the reception area to use free of charge. The decors are modern & hotel is very environmentally conscious.Cons (-) The room is a bit small, if you have a suitcase that opens like a book, you will not have space to walk around. You can’t really spread out your suitcase. Since we only stayed for 2 nights so we managed.Showing 1-10 of 2565 reviews12345...257The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What can I expect from the hotel's amenities?You can expect a range of amenities including a business center, safety deposit box, and key card access, as well as free parking and a 24-hour front desk for your convenience.How is the cleanliness of the hotel?The hotel is known for its clean and comfortable rooms, with guests highlighting the neat and tidy environment and the accommodating staff.Are the beds comfortable?The beds are comfortable and provide a good night's sleep, according to guests who have stayed at the hotel.What is the best time to visit the hotel?The hotel is ideal to visit in December during the high season, offering a very good location and great staff, as mentioned by previous guests.Is parking readily available at the hotel?Yes, the hotel offers free parking, ensuring convenience for guests who are traveling with their own vehicles.The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.Opt for a Room with a ViewSeveral guests mentioned that the views from the rooms were spectacular.
