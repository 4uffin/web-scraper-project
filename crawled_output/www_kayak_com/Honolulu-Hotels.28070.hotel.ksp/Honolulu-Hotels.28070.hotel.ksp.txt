And let me tell you, it sure doesn’t hurt that the beach is one of the quietest in Honolulu. When I visited, I dined at Hau Tree Restaurant’s open-air terrace, sat in a complimentary Peligo beach chair to soak up some vitamin D and worked on my wave-catching skills at Kai Sallas’ on-site surf school.On my list for next time: snorkel the shallow reef, bike through the neighborhood (Electra cruisers are complimentary for guests) and take a sunset yoga class with Diamond Head as my backdrop. Hands down, my favorite thing about this hotel is the bold boho lobby. With its framed artwork collage and repurposed furniture, it’s one of the most photographed in all of Waikiki.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Surfjack Hotel & Swim ClubRank #2$178-$554/night412 Lewers StreetThe Surfjack Hotel & Swim Club, one of the top-rated hotels in Honolulu, is a place your whole crew will dig –...Learn moreThe Surfjack Hotel & Swim Club, one of the top-rated hotels in Honolulu, is a place your whole crew will dig – even your four-legged family members.

Schedule sunset dinner at House Without a Key, an iconic restaurant made famous by an Earl Derr Biggers novel of the same name. Live music and locally-inspired dishes under a 136-year-kiawe tree are sure to make you smile.I noshed on the roasted beet salad, hamachi kama, and the signature steamed onaga (a local fish) along with a heaping side of sweet potato mash made with coconut milk.

Its Spanish-Moorish architecture is inspired by movie star Rudolph Valentino, and the fact that it’s pink – it’s affectionately known by locals as the Pink Palace – makes it stand out in a good way as one of the unique hotels in Honolulu.Choose between rooms in the Mailani Tower, which boast ocean views, and rooms in the Historic Tower, where the rose-tinted quarters are worthy of an Instagram room tour.Start your day by ordering a stack of the famous Pink Palace Pancakes and wind down by making leis (a garland or necklace of flowers given in Hawaii as a token of welcome or farewell), taking hula lessons or signing yourself up for a historical tour to learn about the hotel’s royal ties.

After breakfast at The Veranda (think mochiko waffles and mango pancakes), while away the day in a rocking chair or sign yourself up for a deep-tissue massage and a honey sugar scrub at the Moana Lani Spa.Enjoy daily morning yoga, stand-up paddle boarding, surfing lessons, and guided historical walks.Check pricesCheck pricesWaikiki Beach Marriott Resort & SpaRank #10$192-$2,358/night2552 Kalakaua AvenueThe Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort & Spa is a place the whole family will love and one of the best hotels in...Learn moreThe Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort & Spa is a place the whole family will love and one of the best hotels in Honolulu.

I would suggest if you're planning a visit to Pearl Harbor (and you should) do so well in advance (month +) to secure your free ticket to USS Arizona (the main attractions). It's free, but tickets go FAST. You can do standby, and if time permits on your schedule, you've got a decent chance. We're not big on heat/humidity, but if you love the beach, there's lots of open beach to enjoy. It's an OK food island. We enjoyed the HOMA (art museum); the Bishop was not too exciting, but ok. I would suggest going in months it is cooler as there are some pretty parks. Also a big shopping area with lots of high end shopping options if you're looking to shop.Verified travelerJul 2025Stayed at Ohia Waikiki Studio SuitesWaikiki has the most to do, close to beach.KrishnaJan 2025Stayed at Hyatt Regency Waikiki Beach Resort & SpaWaikiki Trolley is a great value for getting around town.How much is a Honolulu hotel?Here are our most popular & best value hotels4 stars and above3 stars2 stars and belowMost popular #1Alohilani Resort Waikiki Beach$184 per nightMost popular #2Halepuna Waikiki by Halekulani$370 per nightBest value #1Romer House Waikiki$106 per nightBest value #2Aston Waikiki Sunset$113 per nightMost popular #1Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Waikiki$136 per nightMost popular #2Hilton Garden Inn Waikiki Beach$175 per nightBest value #1Ohia Waikiki Studio Suites$94 per nightBest value #2Stay Hotel Waikiki$99 per nightMost popular #1Airport Honolulu Hotel, Trademark Collection by Wyndham$136 per nightMost popular #2Royal Grove Waikiki$101 per nightBest value #1Waikiki Heritage Hotel$85 per nightBest value #2Ewa Hotel Waikiki$92 per nightGood to knowLow seasonHigh seasonAverage price (weeknight)Average price (weekend night)MayMarch$349$374Cheapest month to stay with an average 8% drop in price.Most expensive month to stay with an average 21% rise in price.Average Sun - Thu price over the last 2 weeks.Average Fri & Sat price over the last 2 weeks.KAYAK's top tips for finding Honolulu hotel dealsIf you’re looking for a cheap hotel in Honolulu, you should consider visiting during the low season.
