Just wished they had free parking for guests as overnight parking is $25.2.0PoorAnonymous, Jan 2025Roaches! Everywhere. Checked out in horror around midnight on my first night there, still working on getting my money back for a 3-night reservation. Other cons I could have dealt with had there not been roaches: skeet stains on the sheets, shower curtain an inch too short so entire bathroom will flood if you try to shower (creating an ideal moist habitat for roaches), the carpet was all torn and ...Read more8.0Very goodAnonymous, Dec 2024In general was good. However the website didn’t informe me about the parking price which is really expensive. The guy in the reception was very rude.4.0MediocreAnonymous, Mar 2024The lady who checked us in wasn’t polite!! The first room cable cord was cut and the phone didn’t work. They changed our room but it wasn’t clean . My daughter said we were at a trash hotel for her birthday!! I went to the front desk on the second night to get face towels and the man really gave me one !! Never Again8.2Very goodAnonymous, Sep 2019Pros (+) Location is in walking distance of a lot of great stuff. Just be prepared to deal with the swarms of homeless and you’ll be fine. Breakfast was pretty great actually and goes later than most hotel breakfasts.Cons (-) Parking is a hidden cost. $25/day kind of blind sighted me, but then again, parking is expensive anywhere in this area. Easily dropped $100 in 2 days for Atlanta’s crazy parking fees.8.2Very goodAnonymous, Mar 2018Pros (+) Great location and very friendly staff.Cons (-) Very noisy9.1WonderfulCody, Mar 2018Pros (+) Modern lobby and dining area. Modern room. Outdated bathroom. Nice soaps.Cons (-) Bathroom and outside area between rooms was outdated.8.0Very goodMekko, Jun 2016Pros (+) I liked it here, great location and great service. Since it was under construction it was a lil unappealing but all for the betterCons (-) I do feel like the bathrooms (shower) need to be renovated. It didnt really match the modern appearance of the hotel. And the beds are really hard. Some of the towels and blankets and pillows had stains as well so there are a few things that could be better8.0Very goodAnonymous, May 2016Pros (+) friendly staff breakfastCons (-) outside road noise10WonderfulAnonymous, Mar 2016Pros (+) Everyone was very nice & helpful.Showing 1-10 of 2125 reviews12345...213The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.How is the cleanliness of the hotel?Guests have mentioned that the hotel is clean and well-maintained, with some noting that the rooms were very clean and the staff were on top of business when it came to reservations.What can I expect from the breakfast at the hotel?The breakfast has been described as excellent, with guests mentioning that it was very tasty and that it was a good hot breakfast.
