Right off of Michigan Ave. The beds were comfortable.Cons (-) The hotel needs some updates. The only thing that made it 'Hip and trendy" was the decor. We could see the light from the hallway shining through into our room because the gaps between the walls and the door was ridiculous. It was a built in night light. No information about the hotel was in the room either. Didn't know who to call or where to get anything. Glad we didn't pay more than what we did...Read more10WonderfulAnonymous, Apr 2016Pros (+) Good size for the price. Great king sized bed, good views even on the fourth floor.
