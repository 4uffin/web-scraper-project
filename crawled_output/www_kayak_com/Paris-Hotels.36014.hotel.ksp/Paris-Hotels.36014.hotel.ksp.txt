It is no coincidence that the French capital has topped the list of the most visited cities in the world for several years. As a cradle of architecture and history, it remains a top destination for travelers from around the globe. For me, it is a home base, the place where I was born and where I always return to ground myself between trips to far-flung destinations.
While iconic landmarks like the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, Saint-Germain-des-Prés and Montmartre continue to captivate, I invite you to explore other neighborhoods frequented by locals and insiders. To truly experience the heartbeat of the city and stay like a local, here is my selection of the best hotels in Paris.Saint James ParisRank #1$797-$2,012/night5 Place du Chancelier AdenauerFrom behind a monumental gate, one of the best hotels in Paris is revealed.

Halfway between a bucolic castle and a family home, this private mansion is located just 15 minutes from the Champs-Élysées. Laura Gonzalez has left her mark on the 50 rooms and suites, juggling styles and eras, from 19th-century chinoiserie to Art Nouveau motifs. My favorite is room 112 with a romantic canopy bed. The wellness area also makes the Saint James a unique hotel in Paris, with a gym, Guerlain spa and a 15-meter-long pool. But it is in the bar-library with its 12,000 bound books that the heart of the establishment beats. Bellefeuille, a Michelin-starred restaurant, is also a must-visit at one of the best hotels in Paris.Check pricesCheck pricesBabel BellevilleRank #2$119-$413/night3 Rue LemonFrom its opening, Babel has been a hit.

With 31 rooms, it's situated on a pedestrian street in Belleville, a popular neighborhood whose personality the hotel has fully embraced. In terms of decor, architect Daphné Desjeux weaves a connection with the routes of a fantasized Orient, using natural materials and curated objects. Look out for the monumental fresco by Juliette Seban, an ink interpretation of the Tower of Babel. Between Rue Denoyez with its street art and the energy rituals offered by the hotel, there is no shortage of activities, such as savoring the delights of the restaurant. The kindness of the staff deserves a special mention—they make Babel a unique hotel in Paris.Check pricesCheck pricesMaison Souquet, Hotel & SpaRank #3$370-$862/night10 Rue De BruxellesIt's no coincidence that this address at the foot of Montmartre is one of the highest-rated hotels in Paris—and my...Learn moreIt's no coincidence that this address at the foot of Montmartre is one of the highest-rated hotels in Paris—and my favorite spot for a romantic rendezvous. Designed by Jacques Garcia, it is an ode to the Pigalle neighborhood with its oriental swirls, theatrical armchairs and burgundy velvet. Head to the exclusive basement pool and hammam (entry included in the room fee) for an intimate experience with soft lighting. This hotel has no in-house restaurant, but it does have a fantastic cocktail bar that has contributed to the place's reputation. Note there are only 20 rooms so book early. Check pricesCheck pricesHotel HanaRank #4$344-$1,938/night17 Rue du 4 septembreLocated between the Opéra Garnier and Place de la Bourse, this new 5-star establishment has become one of the best...Learn moreLocated between the Opéra Garnier and Place de la Bourse, this new 5-star establishment has become one of the best hotels in Paris. Elegant and cozy, Hana (meaning "flower" in Japanese) is a fusion of Belle Époque sophistication and Japanese minimalism. The 26 rooms offer breathtaking views of the Parisian rooftops. However, it is the Japanese-inspired details that makes this hotel unique from calligraphy, raku ceramics and iroko wood details.While there are plenty of options for Japanese dining in the neighborhood (close to Rue Sainte-Anne), the hotel's Hanabi restaurant-bar is a safe bet and solidifies its reputation as one of the best hotels in Paris.Check pricesCheck pricesHotel Dame Des ArtsRank #5$141-$1,565/night4 Rue DantonFor those dreaming of a Parisian getaway, here is one of the best hotels in Paris. Located 600 meters from...Learn moreFor those dreaming of a Parisian getaway, here is one of the best hotels in Paris. Located 600 meters from Notre-Dame and Luxembourg Gardens, this 4-star hotel pays tribute to the neighborhood's cinematic tradition. Designer Raphaël Navot channels the Nouvelle Vague in the 109 rooms, some of which feature a balcony with a view of the Eiffel Tower. My top tip: request a room on the 7th or 8th floor. Among the many highlights of the establishment are the restaurant and rooftop with a 360-degree panorama of Paris's most beautiful monuments. Not to mention the gym, arguably the most beautiful in the capital, and in-room cinema screenings complete with popcorn. This new address on the Left Bank is undoubtedly one of the best hotels to stay in Paris.Check pricesCheck pricesHôtel Monsieur AristideRank #6$163-$587/night3 rue Aristide BruantIn the heart of Montmartre, just steps from the bustling Rue des Abbesses, this 25-room hotel will immerse you in...Learn moreIn the heart of Montmartre, just steps from the bustling Rue des Abbesses, this 25-room hotel will immerse you in the grand era of cabarets and Toulouse-Lautrec. As soon as you step inside, you'll be lulled by French songs played on the Wurlitzer jukebox. The rooms, small but very comfortable, are decorated with objects and trinkets found at flea markets, lending them a vintage and upcycled spirit.The outdoor terrace and charming green patio transform into a cinema in the spring. My favorite aspect of Monsieur Aristide is its rich literary program with reading parties, book signings and poetic writing workshops. This places it in the running for the title of the best boutique hotel in Paris.Check pricesCheck pricesChâteau VoltaireRank #7$440-$3,454/night55 Rue Saint-RochIn the 1st arrondissement of the capital, near the Tuileries and the Palais-Royal, this 5-star hotel is one of the...Learn moreIn the 1st arrondissement of the capital, near the Tuileries and the Palais-Royal, this 5-star hotel is one of the most beautiful luxury hotels in Paris. A haunt for the entire fashion world, it is the former headquarters of the brand Zadig & Voltaire. With a unique architecture born from the union of three buildings from the 17th and 18th centuries, its 32 rooms are an ode to sophistication with custom-made headboards, manor-style woodwork, solid oak sconces and artisanal trimmings. The restaurant Émil, with bistro chairs and Art Deco lighting, offers authentic Mediterranean-inspired cuisine. As for the La Coquille d'Or bar, it plays the timeless card with iconic cocktails and a motif that adorns one of the corners of the building. The place to see and be seen in the Saint Honoré district, and one of the best hotels in Paris.Check pricesCheck pricesHotel Rochechouart - Orso HotelsRank #8$109-$745/night55 Boulevard de RochechouartAt the top of Rue des Martyrs, near the Moulin Rouge, this late 1920s establishment has been given a fresh look. It...Learn moreAt the top of Rue des Martyrs, near the Moulin Rouge, this late 1920s establishment has been given a fresh look. It is now one of the best hotels in Paris to experience life like a local. The cozy decor, in a palette of autumnal colors, is credited to Charlotte de Tonnac and Hugo Sauzay, the architect duo behind Festen. The original interiors have been preserved for all 106 rooms, some of which have a view of the Sacré-Cœur. A heavenly sight at nightfall, with subtle lighting and vintage candle holders for a Roaring Twenties spirit. To reach new heights, I recommend having an aperitif on the rooftop before dining at the ground floor brasserie. Night owls can then gather at Mikado, an ultra-cool club underground. Undoubtedly one of the best hotels to stay in Paris for a vibrant nightlife.Check pricesCheck pricesSo/ Paris HotelRank #9$409-$3,413/night10 Rue Agrippa d'AubignéOn the banks of the Seine, to the east of the capital, this luxurious establishment is a declaration of love to the...Learn moreOn the banks of the Seine, to the east of the capital, this luxurious establishment is a declaration of love to the City of Light. In the time of kings, the location corresponded to the Louviers Island, an epicenter of river trade. A significant inspiration for the architectural agency that followed the thread of the river in all the hotel's spaces. While the tulip columns in the lobby, made of concrete and terrazzo, echo the 1910 flood, the 162 rooms and suites have been designed in a color palette representing Paris at night. If your budget allows, book the "So Phare". Its five windows give the impression of being aboard a ship. As the sun sets, head to the top floor to Bonnie, the enchanting restaurant of the establishment, frequented by both Parisians and travelers.

Passionate about...Learn moreDedicated to "wellbeing", this urban sanctuary in South Pigalle reveals an acronym: House of Yoga. Passionate about the discipline, owner Charlotte Gomez de Orozco has incorporated a YUJ studio into the establishment, where I regularly practice in the dark and under infrared light. Sessions are held daily on the first floor, making the place one of the best hotels in Paris for yogis. Relax with one of the holistic treatments offered in one of the 22 rooms, all designed as sanctuaries. On weekends, floral art workshops are offered by Chiaki Kokami, the resident florist who creates her compositions at the entrance of a lobby that breaks all conventions. I always take the opportunity to reserve a table at chef Robert Mendoza's, who offers a five-course gourmet (and vegan!) menu.Check pricesCheck pricesBooking InsightsKAYAK’s insights for hotels in ParisDiscover seasonal trends, ideal booking windows, and other data-driven tips to plan your stay in Paris with confidence.How much does a hotel cost in Paris?The average price of a double room in Paris is $498 per night.

They have become increasingly popular in Paris, and you can find many options in trendy neighborhoods, such as The Hôtel Marais Hôme, Hôtel Bastille, and Hôtel République. They are known for being stylish and are a good option for individuals on a budget.Does late-night noise bother you? If so, try to select hotels located away from the cafes, bars, bistros, and youth hostels. Nightlife is very popular in Paris, particularly in the city center, and many older buildings do not block out noise well. Large hotels, such as Hôtel Plaza Athénée, are certain to provide you with a great night’s sleep.Hotels near the Eiffel Tower are generally very expensive. Don’t be afraid to look for a hotel in the surrounding neighborhood, which is surprisingly quiet and residential. With Paris’ extensive metro and bus system, it is always easy to access the Eiffel Tower, so also consider opting for a more exotic neighborhood, such as the Latin Quarter. The Hotel Cluny Square is a great choice in the area that won’t break the bank.If you are traveling on a budget, consider staying in a hotel that is located on the outskirts of the city, like the Radisson Blu Hotel, Paris-Boulogne. These areas are still easily accessible by the metro, but are less crowded and generally more affordable. Neighborhoods such as the 12th, 15th, and 17th arrondissements are great options, as they are not directly in the city center, but they are still connected by several different metro lines.When choosing a hotel, check to see what public transportation is nearby. If you are looking at cheaper hotels that are away from downtown, but that are also accessible by the RER trains, try to find one located near the traditional metro as well. The RER trains shut down earlier at night than the metro, particularly during the week, and they are often disrupted by strikes and technical difficulties. The Handsome Hotel By Elegancia is located just near Châtelet station and is a perfect compromise.If you’d love to shop while in Paris, you should consider staying at the Secret de Paris - Hotel & Spa because it’s close to several shopping centers.

Some of the Paris hotels with these qualities are the Hotel Molitor Paris - MGallery, the Sofitel Paris Arc de Triomphe, and the Renaissance Paris Republique Hotel.Suppose you're looking to board an early or late flight at the Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport.
