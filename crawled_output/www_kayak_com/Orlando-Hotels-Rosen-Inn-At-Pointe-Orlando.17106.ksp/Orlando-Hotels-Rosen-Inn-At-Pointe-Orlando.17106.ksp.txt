There were roaches in the bathroom. The carpet in the room just looks gross. It was a very uncomfortable stay. This is an old hotel than had an old motel feeling to it. The location was everything. It was very convenient to where I was going on International drive.8.0Very goodDavid, Oct 2022The room was comfortable.8.2Very goodSidney, Aug 2019Pros (+) The cleanliness of the rooms and comfy pillowsCons (-) Check in and check out was very unsatisfactorily9.7WonderfulAnonymous, Mar 2019Pros (+) LocationCons (-) Security in the parking lots.9.4WonderfulAnthony, Jan 2019Pros (+) Great location to the fun of I-Drive and Universal. Efficient, affordable! Its skeleton is a classic 20th century motel with the outdoor walkways which gives it some character, but they've been updated well (albeit with stucco walls). Absolutely comfortable and efficient.Cons (-) I had a used towel left on my dresser, but it may have been used by housecleaning to wipe things down (I hope).10WonderfulAnonymous, Dec 2018Pros (+) Went for a conference, the hotel is within walking distance of the West convention center at less than half the price of the girls which are connected to the center. Comfortable, clean and felt staff.Cons (-) No complaints, great value.8.5Very goodAnonymous, Nov 2018Pros (+) The staff was very nice and everything was convenient. Having a deli open 24 hours and the breakfast buffet was great.Cons (-) The room was a bit stuffy. My allergies kicked it and woke up feeling a little sick. Air filter needs to be cleaned.8.8Very goodAnonymous, May 2018Pros (+) The check in process was easy enough. The room exceeded the expectation that I had for the price I paid. Very beautiful and safe. I will be returning in a month during my next visit.Cons (-) Can’t really think of any6.0OkayAnonymous, May 2018Pros (+) LocationCons (-) Maid knocking on room at 9am each morning to do the room. We just had a big smile on her face when I advised her we were not checking out that day and had a longer reservation. Limited towels and toiletries and not as clean as it used to be.Showing 1-10 of 6958 reviews12345...696The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What dining options are available at the hotel?The hotel offers dining at the Plaza Garden restaurant, which features breakfast and dinner buffets.
