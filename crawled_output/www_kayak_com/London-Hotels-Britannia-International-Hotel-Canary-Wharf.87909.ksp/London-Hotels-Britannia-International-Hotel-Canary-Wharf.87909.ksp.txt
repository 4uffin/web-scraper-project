Unfortunately, I don’t like such places and do not recommend that anyone stays here. The hotel is in very poor shape. Two elevators were broken and the lights to inform you what floor you were on did not work in the fourth - it made for a fun guessing game of when to get off.

That was really about it.Cons (-) > the room I received had no windows and was incredibly stuffy for my stay. > The breakfast was awful and didn't have many vegetarian options like the person who checked me in attested to (I ended up going to the nearby convenience store for premade food. Cheaper and at least adequate). > For a hotel in a business district, wifi for £7 per day per device seems incredibly steep.4.0MediocreGary, Nov 2017Pros (+) LocationCons (-) Online booking implied breakfast included but upon arrival was told out wasn't and was upsold. Restaurant was terrible food. 20 min free Wi-Fi. Room not very nice. Place tired looking. Front of house staff were pleasant and nice.2.8PoorAnonymous, Feb 2017Pros (+) The rooms are fine and food is average.Cons (-) The spa is appalling! The pool has a dirty grime around the edge, the steam room was too hot to use and the sauna was too cool to sweat! You have to pay extra to use the spa and we were fobbed off by staff when we complained. We booked the hotel so that we could visit the spa and we were very disappointed.

Does the trick for a place to crash.Cons (-) Wifi isn't included has to be bought. Outdated furniture.8.5Very goodAnonymous, Jul 2016Pros (+) The location was great. Only a 5-10 minute walk to the Canary Wharf underground station and shopping. The public areas in the hotel were comfortable and you could get food and drink until the early morning hours.Cons (-) The furnishings in the room were a little mediocre and worn. It is possible to do inexpensive and stylish but design is not everyone's strong suit. It would have been nice to have access to the waterfront but the doors were emergency exit/alarmed doors. All in all I would stay there again.2.0PoorAnonymous, Jul 2016Pros (+) Briken AC, stuck in one position. Very tiny single rooms. Dirt. Catch on getting wifi, only 20 min a day are complimentary. Paid hotel support phone call-in line... Unfriendly staff from concierge up to manager, helpless fingerpointing to rules and booking broker.Cons (-) Nothing...?Showing 1-10 of 7138 reviews12345...714The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.Is the hotel in a convenient location for exploring London?Yes, the hotel is conveniently located near the famous business district, many great pubs and restaurants, and offers a breathtaking view of the city's skyline and River Thames.
