Housecleaning service every day. Convenient Internet kiosks for guest to use in the lobby. Free Keurig coffee for you all day in the lobby. Note that the small rooms are hostel-like--there's no room for a table nor a chair. Nor much space to put your toiletries.9.1WonderfulAbigail, Mar 2018Pros (+) Great location, staff friendly and coffee all dayCons (-) Nothing, except futton uncomfortable....6.5OkayAnonymous, Jan 2018Pros (+) Great locationCons (-) Small rooom and bathroom9.4WonderfulAnonymous, Nov 2017Pros (+) The staff was very friendly and helpful. Facilities were clean. Overall, a great value for the money.Cons (-) Wifi was very slow. Don't plan on streaming any video during your stay. And if you have to do any work remotely, and need a good connection, this is probably not the place. Wifi was fine for checking email, and basic web browsing. I ran a speed test and clocked 1MBPS.4.5MediocreAnonymous, Jul 2017Pros (+) The hotel staff were amazing and if you are there for Waikiki beach then the locale is perfect, but...Cons (-) It was very hard to find, as there is nothing labling it and if you rent a car, expect to shell out an additional $20-30 for off site parking, as the hotel's parking is basically non-existant. The room was NOT clean. There was hair ALL across the walls in the bathroom, and not just in the shower. The walls are SUPER thin, so you hear EVERYTHING!

I HATE feeling like a hotel is trying to trick me, as I don't trust them afterwards. Our room was nothing like it was pictured. The mattresses were on the floor, the shower was falling apart, the room had no space to move, and the wifi didn't work.
