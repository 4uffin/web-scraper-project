When driving with young children in this state, they must be in a car seat. The type of car seat depends upon the age of the child. For example, when they are under the age of three, they must be in a full seat.

When renting your car, you should ask the car rental agency about their policy concerning paying tolls. Some agencies will let you purchase or arrange for a toll pass. With a pass, you don't have to worry about having to carry cash or change with you, or stopping at the toll gate. In this case, the tolls will be charged to your credit or debit card.When parking your rental car in Florida, you will always park on the right side of the road. The exception to this rule is when parking on a one-way street. In the state of Florida, you can make a right turn at a red light, after stopping, as long as it is clear. Note that there are some areas where a right-hand turn on red is not allowed. Therefore, you should always look for signs that warn that you can't legally make a right turn on red before you attempt to make a turn.Driving cars on Florida beaches is prohibited in most areas. One exception is that of Daytona Beach and spots on St. Augustine's Beach. Please note that there is a charge of around $20 a day in order to drive in Daytona Beach. Because the sand is soft, not any car can get through this beach. That is why many tourists opt to rent a Jeep with four-wheel drive for added fun and confidence. Other cars that are good for driving on sand include all-terrain trucks and AWD vehicles. If you plan to spend your days on the beach, remember to rent a vehicle with lots of trunk space or a roof rack for beach chairs, surfboards, snorkeling gear or other equipment.25% of our users found rental cars in Florida for $17 or lessMini rental cars in Florida are around 69% cheaper than other car types, on averageSee more tipsFAQs about renting a car in FloridaShould I rent a car in Florida?Many of the beaches in Florida are in small towns with no public transportation system. Renting a car will make it easy to go on a Florida beach road trip. Even in large Florida cities like Jacksonville and Miami, a rental car is essential. This is because many of the popular tourist attractions, such as the Medieval Torture Museum (in St. Augustine) or the East Coast Buffer Water Preserve Area, are on the outskirts of the cities away from the bus or trolley system. In these large Florida cities, with the buses making so many stops along the way, an 18-mile trip can take well over an hour of travel time.What is driving like in Florida?Florida is a pretty flat state with very few mountains and hills. You’ll drive mostly on the highway where the speed limit is 70 mph. On local, residential roads, the speed limit is around 30 mph. In school zones, the speed limit goes down to 20 mph. Note that Florida has four-way stops. When you come to one of these stops, the vehicle that gets to the stop first, goes first.How old do you have to be to rent a car in Florida?To rent a car in Florida, you must be at least 21 years of age. You'll need to show the rental car agent your driver's license with a photo and proof of your age. If you're under the age of 25, note that you may be charged a young driver fee. Additionally, there are certain cars, such as sports cars, that you might not be allowed to rent.Where in Florida can I rent a hybrid or electric car?You'll enjoy excellent fuel economy when you rent a hybrid car for your Florida vacation. Along with being environmentally friendly, these cars feature an automatic engine shut-off for even more fuel savings.
