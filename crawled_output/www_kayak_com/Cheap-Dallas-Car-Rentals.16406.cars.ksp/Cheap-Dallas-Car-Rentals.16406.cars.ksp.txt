Nothing remotely close to the Ford Transit passenger van! I ask the manager and they told me that they never have those on their lot. That Kayak does this all the time. Bait and switch. Had to upgrade to a bigger vehicle because they would not honor the Kayak website deal. Spend an extra $900 on top of the $500 for the Kayak website deal.

The entire rental should have only cost $140 however with the insurance a 3 day rental was over $300. Online insurance as advertised as $18/day but at the terminal it was over $35/day. I will never rent here again.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jun 2024Compact SUVTerrible, after arriving at 4 am, i was prepared to obtain my vehicle only to find out they would not allow me to rent it. My drivers license has expired, however I have the temporary issued one showing my DL has been renewed. They refused to allow a document that‚Äôs been authorized. Fortunately Avis was so wonderful and able to help me. Will never attempt to use them again. You get what you pay for.10.0 WonderfulAnonymous, Jun 2024Compact SUVThe customer care was super nice and experienced!!! She was a great customer care person.2.0 PoorDavid, May 2024Full-sizeThey tried to steal $91 from me. I was told that in order to pay for the toll tag, I need to use the same card. They tried to run the credit card and it came back declined. So I spent the whole trip taking longer routes to avoid tolls. No problem. When I turn the rental in, they charged me $91 dollars for a toll tag, after they already knew it was declined. I never took a toll road, so why are they charging me for it. Been on the phone with them 2 times since I‚Äôve been back and nothing has been rectified.8.0 Very goodAnonymous, May 2024Full-sizeUnexpected transponder charge‚Ä¶10.0 WonderfulAnonymous, May 2024Compact SUVQuick service, clear and efficientNational6.5OkayRead 6 reviewsCleanliness6.5Comfort6.5Pick-up/Drop-off6.5Value for money6.23 locations in DallasNational reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Dallas13239 MontfortOpening times not available2424 E 38th Street+1 833 635 0438Monday00:00 - 01:30Tuesday00:00 - 01:30Wednesday00:00 - 01:30Thursday00:00 - 01:30Friday00:00 - 01:30Saturday00:00 - 01:30Sunday00:00 - 01:307366 Cedar Springs Rd+1 833 635 0434Monday06:00 - 23:00Tuesday06:00 - 23:00Wednesday06:00 - 23:00Thursday06:00 - 23:00Friday06:00 - 23:00Saturday06:00 - 23:00Sunday06:00 - 23:00FiltersReviews10.0 WonderfulVernon, May 2025Compact SUVIt was very clean and professional, quick service no run around2.0 PoorPaul, Apr 2024IntermediateI never got a car. They said that if the reservation was made less than 24 hours before there were no cars available. Get it together.... don't set up your system to allow reservations if there are no cars available. It reminds me of airlines overbooking flights.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jan 2024Full-sizeI was stranded in the Dallas airport, made a reservation for a car, took a shuttle all the way over to the ground transportation area, and I was told there were no cars available, despite confirmation online AND a representative on the phone who assured me it was there.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jan 2024Intermediate SUVWell, I made a reservation and then they said they had no cars.
