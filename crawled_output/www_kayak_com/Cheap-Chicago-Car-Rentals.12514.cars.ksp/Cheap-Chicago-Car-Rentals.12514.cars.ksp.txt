Shuttles run 24/7. The car rentals are all in one place so when you arrive it’s pretty easy to navigate. But good to plan extra time for drop off and pick up.Verified travelerMar 2025Easy check in and drop off in downtown area on Sunday evening - wonderful option for people who don’t feel like driving all the way to the airportVerified travelerMay 2025Consider how much you’ll be driving around the city and outer suburbs. The airport is not centrally located so you will be a good hour away from downtown.Verified travelerApr 2025Check EV charging regulations at public charging spotsJohnFeb 2025Do not get toll pass if going to Indiana, it does not work. They'll try and sell it to you regardless.Verified travelerSep 2024Advice for renting a car in Chicago: (1) If you don’t need a rental, don’t get one. The best experience and cheapest is to use public transport. Also, drivers and buses in Chicago are a bit crazy, especially if you will be in the downtown area. Lastly, the cost to park on any street or lot will add another expense (~$8/per hour on street or $12/hr in a lot). (2) If you do rent a car, smaller cars make work better when it comes to parking. Downtown area (anything that’s not the suburbs) will be street parking or tight parking lots. Also, I only saw charge-up stations (for electric cars) in parking lots, not on the streets. (3) Unless you are a speed racer, I advise to avoid LakeShore Drive at night, on the weekends. There are changes of drag racing. (4) Buses will always jump out into the street. The buses will block intersections and jump into the streets with no-signals. So, if you are next to or behind a bus, wait till they pass. (5) Prepay for lots on SpotHero or another parking apps. Paying through these apps will save you almost $5 extra, per hour & it will secure you a spot.JudiOct 2024Check your own car insurance policy before paying for insurance coverage for rental carVerified travelerAug 2024Use the train at the airport to commute to your rental and checkin from your phone to have your car ready when you arrive.DouglasJul 20244 door sedan would be the best bet.

The car I received had gum stuck to the center console which was gross. After I returned the car, I received a call saying that there’s a “large crack that goes halfway across the windshield.” When I asked again how large the crack was because I didn’t see a crack while driving, the agent said the crack was barely visible. I explained that I did not notice a crack nor did it happen while I was driving. When I dropped the car off at 4:30 PM, the rental place was closed. I truly believe this crack either happened with the last driver and I was not informed about it when I picked the car up. Or it happened after I dropped it off. Despite this, the agent said I’m responsible for it and will need to cover the cost. Very unhappy about that.10.0 WonderfulAnonymous, Dec 2024StandardSuper service.

Their customer service took 45 minutes to answer the phone and the representative was discourteous and condescending. They did a bait and switch with the type of vehicle that I had requested. The vehicle smelled of cigarette smoke, the windshield on the interior was not cleaned. I had to buy a bottle of for breeze and Windex and paper towels to make the car suitable for my trip. I would never ever rent from this company.Cons:They could be honest with their customer, they could train their customer service representatives to be more customer service oriented. And they should give the customer the type of vehicle that they had requested.

I explicitly asked the staff to confirm the return location at Milwaukee will be open at 4-5pm.

I ended up returning at the next closest location which is the Milwaukee airport. Then I get a surprise bill of $450 instead of the negotiated rate of $160 on July 6. I am working to charge back that transaction with the credit card company. Hertz doesn't answer customer service calls anyway.2.0 PoorTom, Mar 2025Intermediate SUVThey added hidden fees and charged me for gas even though I had returned the tank with more than I left it with. You expect to pay a premium with Hertz so that you don’t have to deal with chasing their customer service.
