Stay focusedVerified travelerJan 2024Watch for one way streets that will require you to drive around the block to get access to garage.Verified travelerJan 2024All enterprises close at 5pm. Be mindful when you book your rental.Verified travelerSep 2023Save A LOT by renting downtown, not at the airport. If you haven't been in Boston for a while, be prepared not to have any idea where you are.JohnOct 2023We were for the most part ok using a map on Apple CarPlay. We missed a few turns but overall the traffic was pretty smooth.charles allenNov 2023Make sure you have gps and don't hesitate to useVerified travelerOct 2023To get to the Rental Car Center from the BOS Airport, locate rental cars, take the blue Massport shuttle bus and it will announce Rental Car Center because a lot of us on the bus were not entirely sure where to go to rent our cars. Beware when renting from Thrifty from the Boston Airport.Verified travelerNov 2023Check the quality of your car seat and your child’s fit in the car seat before leaving the lot to pick them up. Bring them with you to pick up the car if possible.AbieNov 2023Give a call to the rental center to see what is actually in their inventory before your trip.Verified travelerOct 2023Plan plenty of time between the airport and rental center.

We enjoyed our time in Boston walking most of the time. On our last day in Boston we used a rental car to drive through New Hampshire and Maine.EddieJul 2023Amazing! Great selection of cars, easy pick up and drop off, VERY CLEAN and in great condition. Best value for a luxury SUV rental we have ever had!stevenJun 2023Get Avis, Budget group as they have 5 or 6 people working booth, so line not long.Verified travelerJul 2023Don’t rent from Avis, we would recommend Hertz.MartinJul 2023If you aren’t familiar with Boston, have your GPS ready. It can be confusing. Also, there are a lot of one way streets, so watch the signs. You always have to be aware of which lane to be in. You might actually have to switch lanes frequently just to drive straight ahead, as lanes that were drive straight lanes turn into turn lanes.Verified travelerJul 2023Give yourself extra time as all rental cars are off property. You have to take a blue rental car bus to the center and then make sure you get on the correct blue bus when returning (as they go to different terminals at Logan).Verified travelerJul 2023The sumner tunnel is closed. So make sure you tell who ever you’re meeting that it will take a little longer.AshishJul 2023To get to rental station from shuttle could take about 30 minutes- to an hour to reach so plan accordinglyVerified travelerAug 2023If you have a preference for electric or gasoline say so upfront.

There is minimal signage and people from Massachusetts drive very differently. When they want to merge they just do. You must be on the defense at all times. There is always traffic too. You do not need a car if staying in the city proper in fact I’d recommend against it. Between the T and Uber and really just walking, you can get everywhere you need to, plus there really isn’t any parking except expensive garages if you’re lucky enough to find one. And if you’re renting from the airport to go elsewhere you’re fine with GPS. But with GPS trying to find something downtown? Good luck. You’ll be stuck in traffic for days and never find what you’re looking for. If you’re renting a car to drive to the cape especially in busy season I hope your flight is very early or late because you will be stuck in traffic for hours as wellVerified travelerMay 2023Parking was the worst. You might as well Uber or bike everywhere. Driving was interesting as I'm used to lanes and there aren't many lanes here; the roads kind of just throw you in there and see who wins lol. The drivers are pretty nice though and easy to flow with. The roads were very clean and in good condition.Verified travelerMay 2023Driving is very challenging in Boston. Many roads that are underground and then have to double back to get on the proper highway. Actually, my Google maps did a reasonable job considering all the underground transportation.Verified travelerMay 2023Be patient! And careful on the dropoff not to take the keys with you when you drop the car, there is a $250 charge for doing that.KAYAK’s top tips for renting a car in BostonBoston has plenty of vibrant nightlife.

However, navigation systems can easily be added to a rental car, which will help you reach further destinations without any problems. Boston’s pedestrians are known to jaywalk, and cyclists often don’t adhere to traffic light regulations, so paying extra attention and double-checking for pedestrians and cyclists while driving is very important.Boston is one of the cities with the worst rush hour traffic in the US, so try to avoid it by traveling to your destination before or after peak times (rush hour is most intense between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. on weekdays). Intersections along Interstate 93 and Route 128 are particularly known for heavy congestion and should be avoided during rush hour if possible, as alternative side roads are also often congested. Additionally, bear in mind that winters in Boston can bring snow and ice, so drive extra carefully.If you are driving through a school zone, you must not exceed 20 mph.

I saw that they upgraded cars not for one but for two customers and I asked if it can be done for me too. I was told to pay for it for no reason. I declined and I told them it is poor customer service to deny one and allow others. Then comes the biggest shock I was told to take another car instead of the one I was shown to try. No explanation again take it or leave it. Since I was running late I took a car and discovered that the back seat was not vaccumed and cleaned. We got wedding party favors and more.

I have been a Hertz customer over 40 years and part of the President’s Circle. When I returned my car in Boston as I was getting on the shuttle bus to catch my flight got text. Damage found on car from AI. I returned to customer service and demanded to see the damage. There was a tiny scratch on one tire rim the customer service person had the look for because he was having a hard time finding it. Said there was nothing they could do because it was the AI machine and not them that picked up the scratch. I said this is great way to lose customers . He said he understood and that they are losing employees as well because they have to deal with all thus AI and nothing they can do. I have to call the 800 number for the AI company but he would put it report that I did not hit anything and did not do the damage. They were charging me $250 for damage plus $125 for admin fee. The next morning I called the 800 number and was told I have to speak to claims. They transferred me. Claims stated there was no report from customer service they could see. If it was put in yesterday it would take 4 business days before they could see the report. I would have to call back. How ridiculous they have machine that can see the tiniest of scratches instantly and create a charge to you. However a report that was created electronically will take 4 days for them to see. They loss this customer and everyone I talk to and do business with.8.0 Very goodSarah, Jul 2025Standard SUVEverything was great except that when I checked in the employee sold me an additional insurance that I thought was a liability deposit that would be returned upon the cars return. She made it seem like it not negotiable but it added $300 on my bill after returning the car yesterday. I don’t think that is fair. You need to clearly state that the additional insurance is not necessary. My personal car insurance would have covered this issue. There was no option on the screen to opt out and I asked several questions about the necessity of this issue. She made it sound like it was a deposit and no negotiation.

Many pre-trip messages insisting that I should check in online to "skip the desk and go straight to the car." Fortunately I didn't do that, because upon arrival, numerous unhappy travelers were turned away at the garage and sent back to the desk to check in. There were physical signs everywhere asking people to check in online and go straight to the garage. Terrible treatment at the desk. The person lied and said, verbatim, "We only have electric cars right now." and asked if I needed instructions on how to find charging stations. I insisted on a gas car and suddenly he was able to make one available--for twice the price we had reserved online! Don't lie to me and say there are not any gas cars then. Bad service in general too. He asked me how to spell my name WHILE actively holding my photo ID, and then later asked "What kind of card is that" after I had paid. (He meant Visa vs. Mastercard, which, again, you have my card. Stop wasting my time.) Car center console was dirty with brown sticky residue.
