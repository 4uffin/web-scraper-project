Additionally, we could not use the AC because the air it blew out smelled like molding clothes and sour feet. There is clearly a bacterial issue in the AC system. The pick up and drop off were fine, and the car drove fine as well.

Waited 45 mins for a car that had oil changed and needed a wash and clean. Car came out still dirty, car had a bad wheel alignment and felt kind of unsecured on highways.

Also, setting up my reservation through Kayak helped make things simple as well.Cons:Nothing! I've used another car rental service nearby in Downtown Atlanta, and frankly this Enterprise offered me fewer issues and a better value for my experience.
