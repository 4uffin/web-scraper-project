The Green Tortoise group built the Seattle and San Francisco hostels around this social and communal ideology and experience. After expanding and refining the entire hostel experience, guests now have free Internet access, communal meals in the self-catering kitchen, private bathrooms, and comforts that make The Green Tortoise a unique place to stay. Located just across from the world-famous Pike Place Market, in the heart of beautiful Seattle, The Green Tortoise is ready to take visitors’ travel experience to new heights.
The Green Tortoise offers co-ed dorms, female dorms, private rooms, and family rooms with queen or twin beds. Each bed has a large storage locker, reading light, fan, four plug electrical outlet, and convenient privacy curtains. Bathrooms are all shared in the hallway but are private and individual units that include a sink, shower, toilet, and a locking door so they are not shared while they’re actually in use. Amenities also include 24-hour reception with no curfew or lockout, free luggage storage, free computer and printer use, available bike rentals, and access to walking tours, city tours, and pub crawls to get the insider views of Seattle.
The Green Tortoise partners with Seattle Free Walking Tours, inspired by the adventures and travels of the tour organization's co-founders. Free tours are a phenomenon throughout a large part of Europe, and it is this organization’s hope to introduce the concept in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.Read more8.6Very good ratingBased on 3,842 verified guest reviewsLatest deals for Green Tortoise Hostel SeattleMon 9/29Tue 9/301 room, 2 guestsStandard roombed type unknown$98nightly with feesShow PricesDouble room1 double bed$66nightly with feesShow Pricesbed type unknown$73nightly with feesShow Pricesbed type unknown$73nightly with feesShow PricesShow 15 more dealsQueen room1 queen bed$75nightly with feesShow Prices1 queen bed$85nightly with feesShow Prices1 queen bed$89nightly with feesShow PricesShow 4 more deals*Total includes estimated local taxes & fees payable on check out.Prices are based on 1 night, including fees but not including taxes.Amenities at Green Tortoise Hostel SeattleFree Wi-FiWi-Fi available in all areasInternetParkingLaundry serviceLaundry facilitiesHairdryerATM on-site24hr front deskSafeBasicsFree Wi-FiWi-Fi available in all areasInternetLinensFanFire extinguisherSmoke alarmsHeatingAir-conditionedTowels/sheets (extra fee)Trash cansServices and conveniencesEarplugsATM on-siteSafety deposit boxEntertainment staffCurrency exchange on-siteKey card access24hr front deskBathroomShared bathroomShowerHairdryerToiletToilet paperToothbrushGeneralLandmark viewLockersCarpetedCity viewPrivacy curtainStorage availableKitchenShared kitchenDishwasherMicrowaveRefrigeratorKitchenAccessibility and suitabilityNon-smoking rooms availableUpper floors accessible by stairsDesignated smoking areaThings to doBoard games/puzzlesEvening entertainmentPool tableHealth and safetyDaily housekeepingSafeCleaning productsLaundryLaundry facilitiesLaundry serviceBedroomReading lightSocket near the bedWorkspaceFax/photocopyingDeskDiningVending machine (drinks)Vending machine (snacks)Parking and transportationParkingMedia and entertainmentShared lounge/TV areaShow all 54 amenitiesReviews of Green Tortoise Hostel Seattle8.6Very good3842 verified ratingsWonderful1839Very good881Good604Okay223Fair164Mediocre54Poor77Summary of reviewsPros (+)"Great staff, good room and bathrooms."in 66 reviewsActivites and FREE BEER!in 18 reviewsSuper helpful staff and fab locationin 260 reviewsCons (-)Bunk bed “mattress” was awful.in 22 reviewsAvoid homeless people aroundin 29 reviewsThe bathrooms were also terrible.in 68 reviewsReviews(10)Q&A(5)Tips(10)Sort by:Most recentShow reviews that mentiongreat locationfriendly stafffree breakfastgreat hostelbathrooms were cleanpike placecurtains for the bedshomeless peopletop bunkacross the streetFiltersAll filtersFiltersReview ratingTraveler typeTime of yearScore by provider8.6/108.6 out of 102006 reviews9.2/109.2 out of 1068 reviews8.8/108.8 out of 1020 reviews8.9/108.9 out of 101 review9.1/109.1 out of 1012 reviewsAll reviews10WonderfulPeter, Feb 2022Pros (+) Great location.
