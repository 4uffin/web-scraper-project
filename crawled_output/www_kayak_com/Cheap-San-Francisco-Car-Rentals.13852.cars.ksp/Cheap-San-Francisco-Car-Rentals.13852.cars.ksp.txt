Felt like I was dealing with a slimy salesman when I picked up the car at SFO. At the end of our rental period, the car (a BMW 4 Series Convertible) broke down due to mechanical issues and wouldn’t start. It took 15 minutes for the “emergency roadside assistance” phone number to be answered. The customer service agents who eventually answered showed no concern or care for our situation! They also implied that I may be responsible for the cost of towing the car. There is no way to reach the SFO rental desk directly; 1-800 numbers only that just ring and ring, even in roadside emergencies. There is a reason other car rental agencies had lines of customers at their desks and Sixt had none! I highly recommend you do NOT rent from this company!8.0 Very goodMisha, Sep 2024Full-sizeGood experience, nice staff! Super modern car that had no problems.
