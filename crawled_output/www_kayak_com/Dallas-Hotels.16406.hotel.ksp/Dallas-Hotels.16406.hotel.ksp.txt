Initially opened in 1956 at The Statler Hilton – an architectural wonder at the time – the hotel has since been meticulously restored to its former glory and offers a variety of room types, including spacious suites with panoramic city views.While many of Dallas’s top hotels are closer to the Uptown neighborhood, The Statler is downtown, something that I find very convenient as it is close to both the Dallas World Aquarium and the historic Deep Ellum neighborhood, among other attractions.Dining options include glitzy steakhouse LVI, casual breakfast spot Overeasy, and underground lounge Bourbon & Banter. What sets The Statler apart is its retro vibe, showcasing original architectural details and a nod to its glamorous past.Check pricesCheck pricesLe Méridien Dallas, The StoneleighRank #7$174-$750/night2927 Maple AvenueOriginally built in 1923, The Stoneleigh, now under the upscale Le Méridien brand, showcases Art Deco architecture...Learn moreOriginally built in 1923, The Stoneleigh, now under the upscale Le Méridien brand, showcases Art Deco architecture and retains its iconic exterior charm.In the heart of Uptown, this hotel, fresh off a multi-million-dollar renovation, captures, in my opinion, the essence of Dallas’ rich heritage through its stylish rooms, particularly the penthouses, and upscale dining that even locals love – head to the popular Perle on Maple, which blends French bistro cuisines with Texas touches. (Don’t miss half-price bottles of wine on Wednesday nights.)The courtyard pool area hosts parties and special events throughout the summer, and the convenient location – walking distance to much of Uptown’s gems – makes this Art Deco stunner the perfect blend of history, luxury, and a prime location.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Westin Dallas DowntownRank #8$146-$893/night1201 Main StreetSituated in the heart of downtown Dallas, The Westin offers contemporary comfort and convenient access to the...Learn moreSituated in the heart of downtown Dallas, The Westin offers contemporary comfort and convenient access to the city’s attractions.

In addition to...Learn moreHotel ZaZa Dallas offers a unique and eclectic experience in Dallas’s vibrant Uptown neighborhood. In addition to being smaller than many competitors, ZaZa is known for its artistic and bohemian-inspired design.What I love is the fact that each room is individually decorated with bold colors and avant-garde furnishings, creating a truly distinctive atmosphere that feels more like you’re staying in your hip, quirky auntie’s house, as opposed to a hotel. As a bonus, ZaZa is home to a trendy pool and all-day hotspot, Dragonfly, known for its fusion cuisine and vibrant ambiance.If you choose to stay by the pool, make sure you choose Cabana Bar on the 7th floor and enjoy not only the view of Downtown Austin and Republic Square Park, but also one of the signature cocktails. I cannot leave without enjoying a Zaza Rita! (If you can handle it, ask for it spicy).Check pricesCheck pricesBooking InsightsKAYAK’s insights for hotels in DallasDiscover seasonal trends, ideal booking windows, and other data-driven tips to plan your stay in Dallas with confidence.How much does a hotel cost in Dallas?The average price of a double room in Dallas is $225 per night.
