If you're focusing on exploring bustling cities like Paris or London or cruising well-maintained highways in countries such as Germany or France, a two-wheel-drive (2WD) vehicle, available from reputable providers like Avis or Hertz, offers excellent fuel efficiency and urban maneuverability. However, if your adventure leads you to rugged terrains like Scotland's Highlands or Norway's fjords, a four-wheel-drive (4WD) rental is essential for stability and traction on unpaved roads.Car rentals in Europe often require strict adherence to child safety regulations, making it essential for parents to travel with appropriate car seats. In many European countries, child seats or restraints are mandatory, mainly under a certain age or height. Parents should check the specific regulations of their destination, as age requirements may vary. For example, in France, children under ten years should be in a car seat adapted to their height and weight. While in Germany, children under 12 should be restrained in a child car seat. Some European car rental companies, like SIXT, may offer the option to rent child seats for added convenience.When renting a car in Europe, it's essential to be prepared for potential border crossings, especially in regions like Austria, where travelers often explore neighboring countries like Germany, Italy, or France. Consider the costs involved such as tolls, vignettes, and international insurance coverage when planning your rental. Documentation requirements typically include a valid driver's license, passport, rental confirmation, and knowledge of visa or entry requirements for each destination. Some rental companies, like Enterprise, offer the advantage of permitting border crossings to all European countries at no additional cost. In contrast, Hertz may restrict travel to certain countries like Bulgaria and Estonia.Car rentals in Europe offer convenience for travelers arriving through airports. Most European airports have car rental facilities readily available for passengers. For instance, when flying into Turin Caselle Airport (TRN) in Italy, several trusted car rental companies offer on-site car rental services. Similarly, Lisbon Airport (LIS) in Portugal provides car rental services through local and international companies. Many of these rental providers offer advance booking options, ensuring you can secure your preferred vehicle that meets your needs as soon as you land.See more tipsFAQs about renting a car in EuropeHow much does it cost to rent a car in Europe?On average a rental car in Europe costs $37 per day.How can I find car rentals near me in Europe?Take a look at our extensive car rental location map to find the best rental cars near you.Where should I rent a car in Europe?Based on car searches on KAYAK, the most popular cities to rent a car in Europe are Rome (5% of total searches of users looking to rent a car in Europe), Milan (5%) and Lisbon (5%).How much does it cost to rent a car for a week in Europe?On average a rental car in Europe costs $256 per week ($37 per day).How much does it cost to rent a car long term for a month in Europe?On average a rental car in Europe costs $1,097 per month ($37 per day).Should I rent a car in Europe?Renting a car in Europe offers numerous advantages over relying solely on public transportation.
