There was ants in my bed and all through out the room. The sheets were not clean. I regret paying for this hotel prior to seeing the room. It's worst than a dorm room. The gym is obsolete. Two machines that barely work and one out of order does not make an outside patio a gym. The entire hotel is just outdated and needs a makeover.

They have an onsite free/ included dvd rental, which was just an unexpected and really nice touch for nights in.Cons (-) Continental breakfast was very...different, chow mein, fried rice, hard boiled eggs, pancakes, and vienna sausage.

Was afraid they were going to be taken home and infest my house.2.0PoorAnonymous, Aug 2016Cons (-) I booked this room through kayak for my 2 workers. They did not forward the booking paperwork to the hotel. The hotel only accepts booking paperwork via fax; needless to say the overseas company who answered my call does not fax to America. They can not take a photo or e-mail of the booking either. Their computers go down until 4 am. So my tired workers tried to check in at 2am, get me up to talk ...Read more4.8MediocreAnonymous, Apr 2016Pros (+) Great neighborhood. Great room.Cons (-) Hidden fee of $15/person for mandatory breakfast. We were told we had no choice, it's mandatory and above and beyond booking price. This is an illegal activity actuall, a bait and switch tactic. We researched a bit and discovered that all the the Aloha Hotels do this - sometimes it's a mandatory breakfast charge, sometimes it's a lounge/newspaper fee. Beware!!!7.7GoodAnonymous, Dec 2015Pros (+) Very little and uncomfy especially when you have a wheelchair child who needs comfy to move around and be happy of its surrounding.
