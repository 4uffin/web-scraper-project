However, it is important for other travelers to know that Avis and other international car rental companies need at least 3-4 days before booking to confirm that they do, in fact, have a car available. We booked a car through Kayak and got a confirmation two days before, only to arrive at the airport and be told that they were completely booked (as were Hertz, Thrifty, and other similar companies) and had no cars we could use. The Avis customer service was unwilling to pay the difference between the rate they confirmed for us and the higher rate a local car rental company offered. In summary, the system of online booking, whether directly with Avis or through a third party like Kayak, does not work in the Philippines if you book a few days before needing the rental.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Feb 2024CompactNo car was ready they told me to wait or 1 hour and 30 mins .poor service dirty office everyone was eating at their table some are napping.
