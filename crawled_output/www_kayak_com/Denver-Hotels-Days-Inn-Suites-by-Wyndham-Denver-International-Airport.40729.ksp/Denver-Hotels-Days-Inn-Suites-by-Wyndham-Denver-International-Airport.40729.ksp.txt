Room 133.7.1GoodAnonymous, Jun 2018Pros (+) It is conveniently located to the airport and it offers a shuttle (shared with three other nearby hotels) that goes to the airport about every 30 minutes. I used this twice, once to arrive and once back, with no issues. The room layout was fine. I had a single comfortable king-size bed, a working TV and a sofa.

shuttle to the airport, and we were on the list for 7:30 am, but when the shuttle arrived at that hour it was full and we couldn't fit in the shuttle, so we had to wait 30 more minutes when we supposed to be on the shuttle at 7:30 am and we got delayed to the flight.Showing 1-10 of 3074 reviews12345...308The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial
