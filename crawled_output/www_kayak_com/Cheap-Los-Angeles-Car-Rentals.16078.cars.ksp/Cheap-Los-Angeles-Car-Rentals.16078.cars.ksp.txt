Without a comprehensive public transport system, getting around its multiple neighborhoods and seeing its many sights can be a challenge, especially seeing as this isn’t a city that people walk around – which is why the best option here is to rent a car as soon as you arrive.
Driving around the city will make you feel like a real Angeleno, though be warned you may well spend much of your time behind the wheel stuck in traffic – LA is famous for its traffic jams, particularly during the morning and evening rush hours. If you can avoid those times, you’ll be fine to go cruising along the endless boulevards or driving along the beachfront, admiring the sparkling Pacific Ocean. Read on for everything you need to know about renting a car in the City of Angels.Mandatory paperwork for renting a car in Los AngelesTo rent a car in Los Angeles, you’ll need to make sure each driver has a valid driving license. Most rental companies are happy to accept...Learn moreTo rent a car in Los Angeles, you’ll need to make sure each driver has a valid driving license. Most rental companies are happy to accept international driving licenses as well as American ones, but it’s always worth double-checking the car rental terms as well. Each rental company has its own rules – some might not be willing to rent to drivers who haven’t held their driving license for 36 months or more, for example.
If you’re traveling from overseas, you will also need to show a valid passport as proof of ID. You’ll also need a credit card so you can pay for the deposit on the car. Don’t have a credit card? Many major car hire agencies will accept debit cards, but some won’t, so it’s best to check in advance. Most car rental companies in LA don’t rent to drivers who are under 21, and many in the city require drivers to be 25 or older – those that rent to younger drivers will often charge higher rates, sometimes known as ‘young driver fees’.Types of cars available for rent in Los AngelesAs a major city with multiple car rental companies, there are many different types of cars you can hire in Los Angeles. The type of car you choose...Learn moreAs a major city with multiple car rental companies, there are many different types of cars you can hire in Los Angeles. The type of car you choose depends on how far you’ll be traveling and how many of you there are. If you’re planning on taking day trips out of the city and spending a lot of time on the freeway, it might be worth investing in an SUV, for extra space and comfort on longer journeys. If you’re mainly planning on driving around the city, you could opt for a smaller car, especially as certain places feature designated parking spaces for compact cars.Where to get a rental car at Los Angeles International AirportIf you’re flying into LAX, be aware that all of the car...Learn moreIf you’re flying into LAX, be aware that all of the car rental companies are off-site and can only be accessed via courtesy shuttles. These shuttles come frequently and are usually easy to find, though navigating your way through the busy airport can be a challenge. The same process can be repeated when you return the car, though make sure to leave plenty of time before your flight, as there can be long lines for drop off at the car rental companies.Car hire road trips in Los AngelesDue to its fairly limited public transit system, renting a car is a great way to get around LA and visit its neighboring cities. Some of the most...Learn moreDue to its fairly limited public transit system, renting a car is a great way to get around LA and visit its neighboring cities. Some of the most popular shorter driving routes from the City of Angels include trips to San Diego (around a two-hour drive), Santa Barbara (around two hours), and Las Vegas (around four hours). Then there’s the famous California drive along the Pacific Coast Highway from Los Angeles to San Francisco, which takes around nine hours and includes many of the Golden State’s most famous sites, including Big Sur. It’s also possible to drive across the border into Mexico, with Tijuana just a two-hour drive away, but bear in mind you will need a valid passport to cross the border. You will also need to check with your rental company to determine if you are allowed to cross international borders.Everything you need to know about car insurance in Los AngelesYou need to have car insurance to drive in Los Angeles, so make sure it’s included in your car rental agreement if you don’t have your own...Learn moreYou need to have car insurance to drive in Los Angeles, so make sure it’s included in your car rental agreement if you don’t have your own personal insurance. Every car rental agency will offer slightly different options when it comes to insurance, so make sure you read the policy thoroughly and get the right insurance to suit your needs. It could also be worth purchasing a Collision Damage Waiver or Loss Damage Waiver to make sure you’re protected if the car gets damaged.Things to know when renting a car in Los AngelesThough there are car hire companies dotted around the city, the largest concentration of them can be found at LAX, so it’s often the easiest...Learn moreThough there are car hire companies dotted around the city, the largest concentration of them can be found at LAX, so it’s often the easiest option to pick up your hire car here before heading into the city (especially as this way you avoid having to pay the cab fare to get into LA). All the major car rental companies are here, so you have a wide variety of rental companies and cars to choose from. If you’re not arriving at LAX, there are still plenty of other places to hire cars in the city – ask about local options at your hotel, where they will be able to point you in the direction of the nearest car rental company.What you need to know about driving in Los AngelesThe City of Angels is infamous for its traffic, particularly during rush hour when the roads and freeways can get gridlocked. It’s best to avoid...Learn moreThe City of Angels is infamous for its traffic, particularly during rush hour when the roads and freeways can get gridlocked. It’s best to avoid driving during this time if you can – on weekdays, rush hour usually runs between 6am-10am and 3.30pm-7pm. Fridays can also be particularly busy on the roads, with locals heading out of town for the weekend.
If you’re planning on using the freeways in LA, look out for the Carpool and High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes. These are lanes that can only be used if there are two or more people in the car and can be a great way to save vital time and avoid congested lanes when driving on the freeway.Parking your rental car in Los AngelesBefore renting your car, it’s worth checking whether the hotel you’re staying in offers free parking.Motels and cheaper hotels often offer free...Learn moreBefore renting your car, it’s worth checking whether the hotel you’re staying in offers free parking.Motels and cheaper hotels often offer free parking, while more upmarket establishments tend to charge extra. Streets in all the commercial areas of Los Angeles are metered, and it’s usually easy enough to find a spot. Many of the residential streets near these areas require parking permits, so make sure you always check the signs for local parking information before leaving your car.Fuel and gas stations in Los AngelesSince most people drive in LA, there’s no shortage of gas stations in the city, and all the big-name gas brands are represented. Most gas stations...Learn moreSince most people drive in LA, there’s no shortage of gas stations in the city, and all the big-name gas brands are represented. Most gas stations are self-serve, where you pump your own gas, and you can usually pay at the pump.
There are around 4,500 public charging electric vehicle stations dotted around the city, making LA the most electric vehicle-friendly city in California. Of these, only around 550 are free charging stations. Motorists can expect to pay around 30 cents per kilowatt hour for level two charging and around 40 cents per kilowatt hour for direct current charging.Booking InsightsGood to knowMost popular agencyMost popular car typeAverage priceGood dealAceStandard$36/day$27/dayKAYAK’s insights & trends for Los Angeles car rentalsCheck out the latest trends and booking tips to rent a car in Los Angeles with confidence.How far in advance should you book a rental car in Los Angeles?You should book your rental car in Los Angeles around 7 days before your trip in order to get a below-average price.What is the cheapest car rental company in Los Angeles?In the past 72 hours, the cheapest rental cars were found at Priceless ($6.88/day), MEXRENTACAR ($8.19/day) and Ace ($12.15/day).

I used enterprise the last time I was in California and had no trouble at all. I purchased their insurance online when I rented and they accepted it. There were no surprises at the counter when I got there or when I dropped it off.Verified travelerJul 2025The car rental place was about a mile away from the airport, Once you are there, they make you go 5 floors up to the office for the rental and 5 floors down to pick up the car. It is a hassle when you have luggage and travel with kids. I recommend people account for the extra time.PaigeJul 2025Call ahead of time to make sure they accept your personal insurance or get ready to pay a high price for the car companies rental insurance.MariaAug 2025Confirm how to get to the rental car office before landing. There are many buses and these companies don't pick up the phone.MagaliJun 2025The is located at the Hyatt Regancy, make sure you look up the address before heading over.Verified travelerAug 2025Make sure you recite confirmation letter directly from the operating companyVerified travelerJul 2025Be prepared for a long wait to pick up. Shuttle ride to the airport when you drop off may be very long. Delayed me by 20-25 mins.Verified travelerApr 2025You have to read the fine print in your booking and call to verify with the rental company, ask about insurance and deposits ahead, and read all the fine print to understand the directions for getting there.Verified travelerMar 2025Even a Small suv that gives you a little lift is helpful. It's always congested in the city or suburbs so plan on extra time. Be alert for motorcycles splitting lanes.MarkusApr 2025Ask for printed contract beforehand to make sure you have cost control and transparencyVerified travelerMay 2025Expect long lines in the pickup that is close to the airport.Verified travelerMay 2025Take photos before and after if the car.Verified travelerApr 2025Give yourself time for possible double shuttle commuteVerified travelerMay 2025Bring proof of your insurance transferability or they will force you to buy their insurance. I would not rent from them. Look elsewhereRandyJan 2025Stick with the top rental agencies. And use your AAA or AARP discount. They are upfront with ALL their fees.Verified travelerFeb 2025I recommend allowing extra time for unexpected traffic to help ensure that you refuel and return the vehicle on time.Verified travelerDec 2024Enterprise is a better option. If you go with an EV, make sure you get info on charging infrastructure. Fast chargers were scarce in our experience and we had to wait in a multicar line for over 30 minutes to get to a charger, then the 48 min charging began. Note: many chargers exist but many are slower low power chargers that take hours. Tesla has more chargers and seem to charge faster than the non-tesla alternatives ut are currently tesla specific.MelJan 2025LAX is just going to take a while to get to a rental car place. Look around at a lot of options to see what's best. Maybe try turo next time.andreFeb 2025Find out how you get from terminal to rental car place. Make sure you have your home insurance cardsMariteJan 2025Read the fine print & booking information. Come prepared w/prerequisite documents.Verified travelerDec 2024At your own risk. Even though they offer cheap rental, be ready for $1000 deposit and have full coverage insurance if you opt out their insurance.Verified travelerOct 2024Use one of the national names - I rent in LA all the time, and they are efficient, all costs are clear from the reservation confirmation and the shuttles arrive and depart regularly. If you use a consolidator who does not tell you the name of the rental agency, I would say, don't take it because you might end up with one of the smaller groups, which are less convenient and far less transparent. The low price is not worth the aggravation of dealing with the smaller rental groups.Verified travelerNov 2024We checked with both our insurance company and credit card benefits coverage to confirm what we needed before we rented. Confirm credit limits and bring insurance card in addition to credit card and drivers license. If paying with debit card, would call rental car office to get specific information prior to arriving. Overall, it was an easy process (complete paperwork ) ---to rent and return.StefanOct 2024The remote car rentals (Ace, Sixt, etc.) are a little harder to get to (two buses), but they drop off directly at the airport when you return the car, so it’s easier than it seems.Verified travelerOct 2024Probably a hybrid car is the best in Los Angeles concerning the slow traffic.Verified travelerOct 2024The economy rental companies are cheap but you must be careful and read all the fine prints.Verified travelerSep 2024plan extra time for the pick up - min 1 hourVerified travelerNov 2024Go with a reputable company that has their own shuttle.KatharineSep 2024BMW CAR If you charge us the double fee for gas, we are so much sad. We learn that we need to buy car insurance in front of the reception desk, but not buy insurance from third part online for our rental car.Verified travelerNov 2024The upsell aggressively at Dollar and other car rental agencies, on insurance etc. Do not fall for it!Verified travelerJun 2024Take the extra time to book from an offsite (away from the the airport) location. Let local people drive you out of and back into the airport. Save your driving for road trips from your hotel. The shuttle is free. Don't worry. If you're kind to the people and your car it will be a great experience. If the extra insurance that they offer you is affordable to you buy it. Otherwise don't worry. It's not a scam to get you to pay for previous dings and scuffs. If you want just call your own insurance before you leave and pay them. You are allowed to decline Aces insurance. Monday morning lineups weren't to bad at the rental office.Verified travelerJul 2024It's a little confusing how to get to the Midway lot. Make sure you take the M (Metro) Line bus which is at the PINK column (NOT the purple column which takes you to the main rental center). The Metro bus will take you to a bus stop where transfer vans are waiting for all the smaller, non recognizable, car rental companies. Jump in the van for Midway, and you'll be at their lot within a few minutes. It's a little convoluted to get to them, but they do a great job in customer service, and their prices are great, so I think it's worth it.Verified travelerJul 2024It's a little confusing how to get to the Midway lot.

Look for rentals that don't charge you extra per mile and will let you use your own car insurance. Also keep in mind many of them will want a credit card (not a debit card) on file, so make sure you bring one!Jamie LeighJul 2024Only rent from the names you know. They may be more costly but in the end you will have your sanity. Figure out or ask how to use the navigation system; if there isn’t one, try to rent one from the car rental company.Verified travelerJun 2024Hybrids or electric cars are great for LA, as we have one of the highest gas prices in the nation and there are tons of electric charging station for every type of car with convenient locations across the city.Verified travelerJul 2024My advice is to find a smaller location near LAX to avoid the long wait, and to avoid renting during a holiday. Overall, I was happy with Budget.Verified travelerJul 2024I think they should shop around and compare the price , service and of course rent a car that accommodates their needs and budgetVerified travelerJul 2024Most rental car places are closed in anaheim on Sunday by 4pm. So if renting to drop off one way from Lax to anaheim, look at dropping off to John Wayne airport which is only 20mins from anaheim. This way you can avoid the parking costs at hotels etc if you don’t need the vehicle during your stay.Verified travelerJun 2024Study the maps and instructions from rental companies. It is hard to navigate a busy transportation hub like LAX. IF you are not familiar, and don’t do your homework, you may face harsh consequences at a terrible time. When you feel vulnerable and isolated in a probably new and unfamiliar place.YuryJul 2024Be prepared to have printed copies of your personal car insurance to prove that you have coverage for the Liability. If you don't have that they will charge you significantly more for the Liability alone. Be prepared to wait in line for at least 30-40 minutes..Verified travelerAug 2024Walk to a lower number terminal at LAX if there’s no room on the shuttle bus (we did this after being passed by two full buses and finally got to board). Don’t book with a rental company you’ve never heard of.Verified travelerJun 2024Make sure you clarify about if they will accept your insurance and if not to know the cost for the one they offer per day, most places do accept itChiAug 2024Do online as much as they can to avoid wasting time for waiting and wasting time and get annoyed by the staff offering you products.Verified travelerAug 2024Look at rental car company ratings before you book and not just the price. The price often coincides with the level of service.Verified travelerJun 2024Be ready for a long wait at the rental car location or arrive at a time when there is low traffic.Verified travelerAug 2024With the price of gas higher than we pay here in Florida, I would suggest a mid size car.Verified travelerJun 2024The Shuttle from the airport take a long time to come by, plan accordingly.JhannaJul 2024Hook directly with car rentals to verify they are directly on propertyVerified travelerJun 2024Get a direct shuttle to and from the airport. Avoid extra transitions.Verified travelerJul 2024Always check the vehicle for the sake of safety of the passengersVerified travelerJun 2024Advise renters to plan ahead of the time for pick up.DarrenJul 2024stay with the ones that have a direct bus from airportVerified travelerJul 2024Don’t buy insurance if you don’t know they accept itVerified travelerJul 2024We caution people from using Hertz rentals. We experienced a “bait and switch” attempt when arranging a rental with Hertz. We booked a car using hertz’s website and left a credit card, but within an hour we were told that the class of car we booked was not available and that we would be upgraded to a larger vehicle at a higher rate. Also there are many small business rental agencies in LA and they may not be open when your flight arrives. We suggest confirming pickup details well in advance of arrival- including options in case of flight delays.Verified travelerJun 2024Din’t believe Hertz’s proposal that you can leave the car at drop-off without confirming everything with an agent. They will sneakily charge you additional expenses if you do not check your receipt and confirm fuel level.DaleMar 2024If you are renting a vehicle in LA be sure to check your insurance coverage ( automobile and credit card) as you can save a lot of money by not having to purchase from a car rental company. Understand if you plan on using any toll roads and get a transponder from the rental company so you don’t rack up an unnecessary expense. Book a vehicle to suit your needs and get something that gets good gas mileage. Gas is around $5 a gallon around LA.Verified travelerMay 2024Use hertz or some other co with fast checkout where you can skip the lineVerified travelerApr 2024Economy rental was very cheap and a great value for the money. However, if time is of essence, look in to going with a more established agency who can pick you up directly from the airpot or Uber to Economy Car Rental's location. That is probably going to be much faster.Verified travelerApr 2024If you’re on a tight budget, Ace appears to be the most cost effective option, just know you’ll pay in time rather than dollars (in most cases). Give yourself plenty of time when renting with this company.Verified travelerApr 2024It is a relatively long and sometimes tricky shuttle commute from the terminals to the garages. The rental lines are usually long. Allocate additional time for getting and returning rentals.JeffreyMar 2024Don't rent too small or too large. You want visibility, but you also need to navigate down residential streets with vehicles parked on both sides.KevinMar 2024If you get the Kia Niro, as we did, make sure that if you go to an EVgo station you choose the CCS connection.Verified travelerMar 2024Use the trusted rental car companies- if the price is too good to be true then there's a reason for it.Verified travelerMar 2024If you’re going to lax, be prepared for a line up. John Wayne drop off was helpful and easy.Verified travelerApr 2024Pick as small a vehicle as is suitable because very large vehicles are difficult to drive and park.Verified travelerMar 2024Look at the times the rental places open and close and plan your flights accordingly.GraemeApr 2024get a rental car from an agency that picks you up directly at the curb.Verified travelerMar 2024Don’t drop the car and leave make sure to get a copy of the receiptVerified travelerMay 2024If you have your own insurance, make sure they accept it.Verified travelerMay 2024Read all the fine print and requirements before bookingVerified travelerMay 2024Call car rental company before making reservationMujeebMar 2024Make sure you confirm about the insurance before renting from any car rental. Even if you pay full insurance, they will still make you buy from them with a higher rate.JustinMar 2024Beware of hidden fees not included in the estimate from online booking sitesJonasFeb 2024Book 2 rental cars; one as a backup. The airport rentals Are open much later than Ace or some of the offsite ones. If you’re flight is delayed, you don’t want to be stuck paying last minute full fare.TYRAJan 2024You definitely need a car in Los Angeles to get around.

Parking in city may be difficult to find depending on where you are but there is always a garage nearby, and quite a few have EV charging capabilities.T2020Feb 2024Read reviews before choosing a rental company , call to confirm if any hidden charges. Make sure get all documentations needed to show them( for example, insurance card) if you don’t want to buy from the rental company.

Leave with time.Verified travelerNov 2023Driving from LAX to Anaheim and back is not a hard drive. There will be traffic in and out of LAX just leave yourself time. If you don’t need to take a turn off or exit for a number of miles /km stay in the middle lanes. If you have multiple people, get in the carpool lanes, just leave enough distance to get over to your exits (2miles/3.5km).Verified travelerOct 2023Choose high name brand rentals, like Budget or Hertz. The cost seems higher but will have better coverage, cars, and a smooth and quick process. Rental companies with lower prices will end up having more hidden fees and issues that will result in similarly priced rentals but with 10x the problems.Verified travelerNov 2023Ace rent a car was great! Be aware that they try to track additional fees and didn't show me the contract until after payment. I tried to cancel and they slashed the price by more than half.Verified travelerSep 2023Tolls, make sure you ask the rental company about tolls we didnt know were they were and cheaper if you pre payVerified travelerSep 2023Get a toll pass and avoid a lot of traffic.

For example, Disneyland is in neighboring Orange County, only about 30 min southeast of downtown LA. If you prefer a nature hike in the desert, consider driving about 2 hours east to Joshua Tree National Park. If you have much more time and want to mix up the hot weather with some cold weather skiing, consider driving to Lake Tahoe in Utah. It’s about 8h 15min away.Those driving in Los Angeles car rentals should be aware of a few road rules specific to Los Angeles. First, the freeways are quite large (up to six lanes) and busy (traffic jams are notorious), so to allow traffic to flow as smoothly as possible, it’s best to avoid the far-right lane unless you plan on taking a nearby exit. Also, make sure to give yourself enough time to get over to the correct lane before exiting. Secondly, most locals only honk for emergencies rather than frustration at the traffic. Lastly, the streets can change names even if you haven’t turned, so it’s best to use a GPS to avoid confusion.Driving in Los Angeles can be challenging due to the city’s infamous traffic. Therefore, as a visitor, you should look out for Carpool and High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes. You'll be able to spot these designated lanes on most of LA’s freeways.

To use these lanes, you must have at least 2 people in the car.On weekdays, rush hour in Los Angeles is between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m..

I have Geico auto insurance and they do NOT cover rentals from Sixt. This means that I MUST utilize Sixt's expensive rental car insurance. I wasted valuable time showing up to rent a the car I reserved from Sixt only to find out from my vehicle insurance company, Geico, that I would not be covered. The Sixt agent was cagey and dodged my questions about insurance coverage for my scheduled rental. PLUS they had none of the cars I had hoped to rent. I will not be using Kayak and DEFINITELY not be using Sixt for any future car rental needs. I wasted so much of my time dealing with this clusterf**k of a scheduled rental. I have a long memory and feel like I got burned by you . I ended up renting directly from Enterprise. Geico does provide insurance for their rentals.2.0 PoorKatharine, Sep 2024Premium SUVBecause of the terrible traffic jam in Los Angeles, I almost missed the plane.

Dropoff was also quick. Only drawback is we waited longer for shuttle at LAX, watching many other car companies go by multiple times, could have been a matter of timing.2.0 PoorBill, Aug 2025IntermediateTerrible.

Clean car, comfortable, quick pick up and drop off. The shuttle was extremely bumpy ride tho4.0 MediocreAnonymous, Dec 2024MinivanPrice was competitive. Drop off in another state was a must which Fox allowed. Pickup wasn’t anything amazing. No instructions to check damages. No explanation on how to start the vehicle. Vehicle was dirty. Could barely understand what the front desk guy was saying. Drop off, no thank you offered or pleasant customer service by the intake person. Shuttle driver was helpful, however made it clear to everyone on the bus that he had to work another shift on Christmas because someone else didn’t show up for the shift. He did apologize about being late but really didn’t need to share that extra info. Overall, decent experience. Probably won’t use Fox again.Back1 out of 6NextMidway6.2OkayRead 488 reviewsCleanliness7.1Comfort6.8Pick-up/Drop-off5.8Value for money6.79 locations in Los AngelesShow locationsMidway reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Los Angeles11231, S.

Just luck I noticed it. Do not rent a car, if you don’t have the car to rent. The way you would want a company to respond would be as follows: “We apologize to inform you that the vehicle class you booked is unavailable - for your rental period. So, we have instead upgraded your rental to the next, higher rental class. We appreciate your business.” That’s it. THAT’s how you handle it. Please see the Jerry Seinfeld episode about rental cars….

Not completely Economy’s fault, but you have to find a bus (which is totally confusing cause the bus that goes to rental cars isn’t it), to a lot to get a shuttle.

Won’t use Kayak or Priceless again.Right Cars3.1PoorRead 7 reviewsCleanliness6.0Comfort6.8Pick-up/Drop-off3.1Value for money4.5One location in Los AngelesRight Cars reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Los AngelesLos Angeles International Airport 8622 Bellanca Ave Suite+1 213 263 4451Monday08:00 - 17:30Tuesday08:00 - 17:30Wednesday08:00 - 17:30Thursday08:00 - 17:30Friday08:00 - 17:30Saturday08:00 - 17:30Sunday08:00 - 17:30FiltersReviews2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jul 2025Intermediate SUVTheir location has changed but I wasn’t notified. I had no way to get to the new location from the airport. There were a lot more fees than I was informed about. The pick up experience was unorganized and confusing. I was going to be charged more for dropping off the car outside of their business hours, and I wouldn’t have a way to get to the airport from there. I had to return it the day before and get a hotel. At least the car itself was fine.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Apr 2025Full-sizeTerrible experience. We spent two hours in the rental car office getting through all the hidden fees and extra charges they have. Requires a $2000 deposit in addition to an extra $25/ day rental fee unless you pay to have their insurance. Lady behind the computer was rude, disrespectful, and combative. The First car they put us in had a flat tire. 2nd car stank like weed and was dirty. 3rd car was dirty, had body damage, and warning lights indicators on the display about safety systems being damaged. Will NEVER rent from this company again. Kayak and Expedia should not offer them as a rental option.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Mar 2025EconomyNo easily accessible pick up instructions. Have to call their shuttle personally-is not among circulating lax shuttles. Pick up address was incorrect in booking email. Car provided had broken tail light and when callling to report and request reassurance we wouldn’t be responsible for preexisting damage was just told to email corporate who still has yet to respond. Tried to upsell on insurance despite having 2 policies2.0 PoorAnonymous, Dec 2024Full-sizeRight Cars is purposefully misleading. They advertise super cheap rental prices and then expect local renters to either pay $2000 deposits if you use your own insurance or a $29.99 a day + $250 no refund deposit. Extraordinarily rude customer service as I noticed when they were speaking to the person infront of me. I would like them removed from your website.Routes Car & Truck Rentals2.0PoorRead 2 reviewsCleanliness5.0Comfort5.0Pick-up/Drop-off2.0Value for money5.0One location in Los Angelesfrom$15/dayRoutes Car & Truck Rentals reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in Los Angeles5280 W Century Blvd ste 135B, Los Angeles, CA ,US+1 310 410 2313Monday00:00 - 00:0008:00 - 17:30Tuesday08:00 - 17:3000:00 - 00:00Wednesday00:00 - 00:0008:00 - 17:30Thursday08:00 - 17:3000:00 - 00:00Friday08:00 - 17:3000:00 - 00:00Saturday00:00 - 00:0008:00 - 17:30Sunday00:00 - 00:0008:00 - 17:30FiltersReviews2.0 PoorAnonymous, Sep 2025Compact SUVWe never got the vehicle and didn’t get a refund.
