When it comes to hotels, you will find everything you need in London.
From grand dames to world-firsts and some of the most exclusive addresses in the world, London is home to a wide selection of stylish (and fun) hotels. Note that though it might cost a little bit more to stay in Central London it will save you money in travel fares. With that in mind, I’ve compiled the best hotels in London, from romantic suites to bank account-busting luxury and family stays.Claridge'sRank #1$142-$3,285/night41 - 43 Brook StreetLondon’s most famous and talked about Mayfair Hotel has welcomed everyone from members of the Royal Family, A-List...Learn moreLondon’s most famous and talked about Mayfair Hotel has welcomed everyone from members of the Royal Family, A-List celebrities, foreign dignitaries, and aristocrats since it first opened its doors in 1812. Staff are always at the very top of their game and service is traditionally old school. The afternoon tea service is legendary, as are the world-famous Fumoir and Claridge’s bars. Rooms are ultra-luxurious and many are the work of celebrity designers from Andre Fu to Boss Studio. It’s a bucket list hotel that has never failed to woo guests with its throwback charm.Check pricesCheck pricesThe SavoyRank #2$182-$3,850/nightStrand, 189The UK’s first “luxury hotel” has been setting high standards since 1889.

Decades on, The Savoy has its fair share of headline restaurants and brilliant bars, the award-winning American Bar and the rather lush River Restaurant to name a few. Home to the Savoy Theatre, it’s a hotel that oozes character and history. It was a firm favorite of Oscar Wilde and Charlie Chaplin, and Hollywood greats from Marilyn Monroe to Elizabeth Taylor have swung by over the years. Rooms are maximalist (the Gucci suite speaks for itself) with comfy beds and roomy tubs, plus the views over the Thames and London Eye are unbeatable.Check pricesCheck pricesThe ConnaughtRank #3$753-$5,102/nightCarlos PlaceThis one is perfect for foodies and families.

The vibe is no-fuss thrills with a design aesthetic that was truly made for the Instagram feed. There are several outposts in the city from the original in Shoreditch to Holborn and White City, but when it comes to wow factor, none beat the hotel’s Southwark outpost. Rooms are cozy, super snug, and some come with views of the nearby landmark The Shard. The jewel in its crown is Seabird, the hotel’s rooftop bar and restaurant. The basque-inspired food is excellent, as are the views.Check pricesCheck pricesMama Shelter LondonRank #5$114-$500/night437 Hackney RoadThe latest design-led hotel concept to hit Bethnal Green is the super cool and affordable Mama Shelter.

If you are looking for a stay that’s different from the rest, this is where to check in. The bedrooms are flat-packed and feature cheeky toiletries and bright velvet pillows on the beds. It’s more of a one-night kind of hotel, hence the absence of a wardrobe or minibar but the hope for the owners is that this will force you to explore the local area. Breakfast is delicious, traditional, and not to be missed.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Culpeper BedroomsRank #6$139-$239/night40 Commercial StreetIf you want to experience a slice of east London, The Culpeper is where it’s at.

Ultra-modern, the spaces attract a cool crowd who love nothing more than to chill on the hotel’s rooftop which boasts spectacular views.
