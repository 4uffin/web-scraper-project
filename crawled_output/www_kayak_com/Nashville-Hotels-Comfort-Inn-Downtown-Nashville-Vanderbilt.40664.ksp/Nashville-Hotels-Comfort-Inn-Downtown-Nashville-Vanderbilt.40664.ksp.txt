Hammering and sawing concrete that early after late nights was not cool, but I did get a "sorry for the inconvenience".6.0Okaypeggy, Oct 2024The staff was accommodating when we asked to switch rooms. Our first room overlooked a pretty dismal back parking lot. Everything was clean but the furnishings were a bit rough. Could use some replacement upholstered chairs and wood cabinetry. The location was very good.10WonderfulAnonymous, Jun 2024The motel staff were very receptive and did everything to make our stay very pleasant. The building itself was well kept and very clean. The breakfast buffet was more than we expected and was delicious. There was always fresh water and ice tea available in the lobby and the market store was very fairly priced. We would definitely recommend stays to our friends and family.5.7FairAnonymous, Apr 2019Cons (-) I thought location was in a little sketchy area , near a freeway and looked rundown. I wouldn’t walk there at night. We just Ubered everyday.They said they were renovating the rooms. Our Room was clean and comfortable. Elevator didn’t work first day but they got it fixed.

Shower. TV.Cons (-) Needs some renovation to cover up the banged up doors. Maybe some new comforters too.10WonderfulAnonymous, Apr 2018Pros (+) Friendly staff, nice rooms, great service, close to nightlifeCons (-) Nothing. This hotel was perfect for my needs.8.0Very goodAnonymous, Jul 2017Pros (+) I loved the king size bed and the location was nice. It was a cheap uber ride to downtown Nashville so it was very convenient!Cons (-) I did not like how low and closed in the bathroom area was. It could use a bit of updating and it's a little claustrophobic but for the money I enjoyed my stay!9.7WonderfulAnonymous, May 2017Pros (+) Check in /out was simple and quick and their continental breakfast was amazing. Rooms and bathrooms were clean.Cons (-) The front portion of the parking lot was a little small and not super easy to maneuver. All in all, it was only the most minor of inconveniences.10WonderfulAnonymous, Dec 2016Pros (+) The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. This hotel is walking distance to Bridgestone Arena and the entertainment on Broadway. The proximity to the highway was a nice touch as well.6.8OkayAnonymous, Jul 2016Pros (+) The Internet was broken and the staff tried to help the best that they could.Cons (-) I asked to speak with someone about the fact that it was out all night when I specifically needed a hotel room with Internet post my surgery. I was told a supervisor would call. Still waiting. I lost a day of work and still have not been contacted to handle the issue.Showing 1-10 of 3933 reviews12345...394The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What dining options are available near the hotel?Guests can enjoy a variety of dining options nearby, including pub food and beverages at Dawg House Saloon, American cuisine at Just Love Coffee & Café, Italian fare at Little Chicago, seafood at Pemrose, and breakfast dishes at Milk and Honey.
