They call it a hotel, but you have to pay for a "suite" to have a bathroom in your room otherwise you share a communal bathroom, which in a pandemic is a joke. In my "suite" there was no tv, no mini fridge, no closet, no dresser, no coffee maker, no nothing - just a bed and a sink in the bedroom, with the toilet and shower in a serrate room. The room was so smal...Read more10WonderfulAnonymous, May 2018Pros (+) Wonderful little hotel for a couple, reasonable pricing. The room was small but perfect for us. Shared bathrooms weren’t a problem!9.4WonderfulAnonymous, Dec 2017Pros (+) Overall best bang for the buck in a long while. I booked this place because I just needed a clean bed on a budget and got more than I needed. The staff from front desk to housekeeping were nice and friendly. I could spend the whole week having drinks and snacks at the cafe if I didn't have other family obligation. I will be back if rooms are available for my next trip.Showing 1-10 of 1305 reviews12345...131The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What are the unique amenities offered at The Society Hotel?The hotel offers a 24-bed bunk room, 38 private rooms and suites at ultra-low rates for the area.
