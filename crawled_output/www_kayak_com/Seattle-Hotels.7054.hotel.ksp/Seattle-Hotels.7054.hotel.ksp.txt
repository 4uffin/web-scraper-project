Many of the major tourist attractions are within walking distance, and for anything further away, the hub-and-spoke public transportation system and access to I-5 make it easy to get there.
Outside Downtown Seattle and its outskirts, options are limited – but the hip, restaurant-blessed Ballard neighborhood has a pair of sibling hotels, and in the University District, a few hotels cater to students, faculty, and their families.Palihotel SeattleRank #1$96-$726/night107 Pine StreetPalihotel, a trendy Los Angeles brand, brings a sense of comfortable cool to Seattle, forgoing some classic hotel...Learn morePalihotel, a trendy Los Angeles brand, brings a sense of comfortable cool to Seattle, forgoing some classic hotel features (like a gym) in favor of usable common spaces and bunk rooms that fit the whole family.The prime location, just across the street from the Pike Place Market, makes for a short walk to the kid-friendly sites along the waterfront, such as the aquarium and Great Wheel.Check pricesCheck pricesFour Seasons Hotel SeattleRank #2$313-$6,809/night99 Union StreetThe Seattle location of this swanky chain comes with a location convenient to the Downtown attractions.

Suites and large rooms with options for extra beds or cribs help keep the family together, and the outdoor pool helps keep kids entertained. The hotel aims to have child-size versions of every amenity, including a “children’s welcome” that makes kids feel special on arrival, and kid-friendly options on the restaurant and spa menus.Check pricesCheck pricesThompson SeattleRank #3$239-$1,484/night110 Stewart StreetPart of Hyatt’s upscale brand, The Thompson’s offers sleek service.

Digital check-in and a 24-hour gym make sure no time is wasted, while the floor-to-ceiling windows looking out onto First Avenue will give you a taste of the city.While the central location makes it easy to pop down to the Pike Place Market for a meal, the creative restaurant and rooftop cocktail bar more than suffice in their own right.Check pricesCheck pricesLotte Hotel SeattleRank #4$252-$1,399/night809 5th AvenueHigh-minded design meets effortless luxury in this Phillipe Starck-designed building.

Mid-century modern furniture, spacious rooms with amazing views, and a century-old Beaux-Arts church as the ballroom set this hotel apart. The location is unique too – it sits closer to the city’s office buildings and the convention center than the touristy waterfront.Check pricesCheck pricescitizenM Seattle South Lake UnionRank #5$99-$707/night201 Westlake Avenue NorthThis European brand gives its crisp, efficient style the Pacific Northwest treatment.

The small rooms, fully controlled by smartphone, cater to folks who plan to spend most of their time elsewhere – but still want a clean, comfortable room.Not unlike the hostel model, CitizenM focuses on creating inviting, social spaces in its bright lobby, with both a bar and a dedicated co-working area, fitting for its location in the middle of South Lake Union’s tech hub.The hotel also contracted with local Native American artists on the exterior murals, which gives it a bit of local feel – and supports the community.Check pricesCheck pricesHotel BallardRank #6$137-$739/night5216 Ballard Ave NWThe suites at the Hotel Ballard bring a romantic feel with fireplaces, elegant soaking tubs, and tufted headboards,...Learn moreThe suites at the Hotel Ballard bring a romantic feel with fireplaces, elegant soaking tubs, and tufted headboards, and all the rooms have upscale modern furnishings. Blackout drapes block any noise from the restaurants along busy Ballard Avenue.Guests get access to the attached Olympic Spa (and, less romantically, the athletic center) for dual pampering. The hotel’s restaurant is also excellent.Note on Sunday mornings, the street outside becomes one of the city’s best farmers markets with plenty of packaged food and crafts on sale.Check pricesCheck pricesThe State HotelRank #7$137-$602/night1501 2nd AvenueFrom behind an eight-story mural by Shepard Fairy, in the center of Downtown, State Hotel immerses guests in Seattle...Learn moreFrom behind an eight-story mural by Shepard Fairy, in the center of Downtown, State Hotel immerses guests in Seattle food culture, taking enormous pride in the Pike Place Market – just a block away. The lobby wallpaper features hand drawings of local seafood, mushrooms, and produce, and the restaurant serves many of the same ingredients in their “Market Fresh” dish. The hotel encourages guests to get out into the market and neighborhood, and guests can bring their meals back to the rooftop deck, which showcases art by a local artist, in addition to the panoramic view of Elliott Bay.Check pricesCheck pricesÄndra Hotel Seattle - MGallery CollectionRank #8$175-$1,848/night2000 4th AvenueBuilt with Scandinavian style in a historic Seattle building, the Andra feels sophisticated and timeless and is the...Learn moreBuilt with Scandinavian style in a historic Seattle building, the Andra feels sophisticated and timeless and is the only hotel in Seattle with a cooking school inside. Though it sat on the edge of Downtown when it opened, the tech boom in South Lake Union means that the neighborhoods now converge here.Now guests at the Andra can take advantage of the dozens of cool restaurants catering to young, food-savvy crowds. But the hotel itself also holds two culinary treasures from the city’s first celebrity chef, Tom Douglas: Lola – one of his oldest and most beloved restaurants, and his cooking school – The Hot Stove Society.Check pricesCheck pricesInn at the MarketRank #9$198-$1,074/night86 Pine StreetSophisticated, modern rooms look out over Elliott Bay from right inside the Pike Place Market, and even the...Learn moreSophisticated, modern rooms look out over Elliott Bay from right inside the Pike Place Market, and even the city-view rooms on the backside get to take in the crisscrossing ferries and sparkling lights reflecting up from the roof deck.High-end touches include Sferra linens and plush bathrobes, and in lieu of a spa, the hotel arranges for in-room massages. The hotel’s three restaurants include the French cuisine at long-running, beloved Café Campagne and Sushi Kashiba, helmed by Seattle sushi pioneer Shiro Kashiba.Check pricesCheck pricesBallard InnRank #10$127-$421/night5300 Ballard Avenue NorthwestIn the heart of Ballard’s lively restaurant district, this small-scale boutique hotel works well on a one-person...Learn moreIn the heart of Ballard’s lively restaurant district, this small-scale boutique hotel works well on a one-person budget and puts guests just steps from shops and bars. Built as a bank in the early 20th century, the hotel trades some amenities (central air conditioning and an elevator) for quaint charm. Note some rooms have a shared bathroom. However, the furniture, décor, and features are all updated and modern, and guests get access to the full athletic club with pool and spa attached to sibling property Hotel Ballard, which is just up the street.Check pricesCheck pricesBooking InsightsKAYAK’s insights for hotels in SeattleDiscover seasonal trends, ideal booking windows, and other data-driven tips to plan your stay in Seattle with confidence.How much does a hotel cost in Seattle?The average price of a double room in Seattle is $228 per night.
