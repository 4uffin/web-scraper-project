There is literally not enough room to open them. You can keep a couple of them under the bed so you can walk around, but there is nowhere for clothes. So I'd not recommend it for couples who aren't traveling light. For a solo traveler with a single small bag, it would be a great option.

The bed was super comfortable, bathroom was a perfect match to the size of the room. The roof top bar is a great place to catch views of the city day or night. The Crimson was a place to grab a quick bite to eat regardless of what meal it was.Cons (-) The shower curtain gets a little friendly if you like your showers hot. Leaving the curtain open a few inches helped at the cost of having a damp floor mat.8.0Very goodCorey, Sep 2018Pros (+) Convenient location, friendly staff, aesthetically pleasingCons (-) Loud air conditioning unit and street noise.9.7WonderfulAnonymous, Mar 2018Pros (+) I love pod hotels, this is my third one (been to both Pod NY). Rooms are "compact" but public areas are always so enjoyable. The coffee bar at Pod DC is really nice, as well as the penthouse lounge which offers comfy seating and beautiful late afternoon light ! Location is perfect for sight seeing, bus to Georgetown is 2 blocks away.10WonderfulAnonymous, Jan 2018Pros (+) The Pod DC was super cute, very well maintained, and obviously recently updated. The room was quite small (like being in a pod!) but you don’t spend much time there anyway, and everything was nicely appointed. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were too, the tv was huge and the bathroom was nicely designed. Definitely not specious, but it really didn’t bother me! I’d stay there again!Showing 1-10 of 4243 reviews12345...425The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What are the dining options available at the hotel?The hotel features three on-site venues for dining and relaxing, including the Crimson Diner, Crimson View, and the Crimson Whiskey Bar.
