Beyond that, the cost to do so would be rather high and you would be much better served to simply travel to other islands by another method, such as plane or boat, and then rent another car when you arrive on that island.One important thing to remember when renting a car in Hawaii is that if you want to rent from a large national chain, your best bet is to do so at the international airports. Once you get away from these areas, the number of rental car choices you have will diminish, plus they will most likely be smaller local chains that may offer a limited variety of cars to rent.While it may seem like a great idea to drive a convertible car, make sure that your car has a top that you can put back up in case of inclement weather. Rainstorms can occur at any time during the year and they often come out of nowhere, so make sure to prepare for that. It is also important to rent a vehicle that has air conditioning because long drives in hot and humid weather can become taxing.25% of our users found rental cars in Hawaii for $38 or lessSupplier choice rental cars in Hawaii are around 32% cheaper than other car types, on averageSee more tipsFAQs about renting a car in HawaiiShould I rent a car in Hawaii?If the reason you want to visit Hawaii is to fly to a major city and then spend your entire trip on a beach in one location, you probably don't need to rent a car. That said, Hawaii offers so much more than just a few tourist destinations that you can explore. The ideal way to do that is to have a car that can take you to all these places. There is amazing scenery, restaurants that are a little bit different and off the beaten path, plus plenty of secluded beaches, parks, waterfalls, and hillsides that are much easier to explore when you have a car of your own.What is driving like in Hawaii?If you are familiar with driving in any state in the United States, then you will not find driving in Hawaii much different. That said, there are still some unique driving tips you need to know about when you drive in Hawaii. For example, you will drive on the right side of the road and speed limits will be in miles per hour. Most roads in Hawaii are in good condition, especially in larger cities, such as Honolulu. It is important to remember that Hawaii is a rather laid-back place and people here drive that way so take care not to speed, or to do things like honking your horn. The fact of the matter is with so much beautiful scenery to see while you drive, there's no reason to speed to get anywhere.How old do you have to be to rent a car in Hawaii?For the most part, rental car companies will expect you to be at least twenty one years old to rent a car. One exception to this is if you want to rent a very high-end car, such as a luxury sedan or a premium SUV. To rent one of these cars, you will most likely need to be at least twenty five years old. Rental car companies generally want you to have a major credit card to rent a car to serve as security. While some may allow you to use a debit card, they will most likely restrict the type of car you can rent, plus they may expect these renters to be at least twenty five years old. There are some rental car companies that will allow a person that is eighteen years older to rent a car so long as they have a credit card, but you will probably find a very limited selection of cars available to rent.How much does it cost to rent a car in Hawaii?On average a rental car in Hawaii costs $48 per day.How can I find car rentals near me in Hawaii?Take a look at our extensive car rental location map to find the best rental cars near you.Where should I rent a car in Hawaii?Based on car searches on KAYAK, the most popular cities to rent a car in Hawaii are Honolulu (30% of total searches of users looking to rent a car in Hawaii), Kahului (29%) and Kailua-Kona (19%).How much does it cost to rent a car for a week in Hawaii?On average a rental car in Hawaii costs $337 per week ($48 per day).How much does it cost to rent a car long term for a month in Hawaii?On average a rental car in Hawaii costs $1,444 per month ($48 per day).See more FAQsCar rental directoryEnterprise Rent-A-Car car rental locations in Hawaii48 LocationsSee all locationsHertz car rental locations in Hawaii26 LocationsSee all locationsDollar car rental locations in Hawaii20 LocationsSee all locationsAvis car rental locations in Hawaii15 LocationsSee all locationsThrifty car rental locations in Hawaii15 LocationsSee all locationsSunnycars car rental locations in Hawaii14 LocationsSee all locationsBudget car rental locations in Hawaii13 LocationsSee all locationsAlamo car rental locations in Hawaii12 LocationsSee all locationsNational car rental locations in Hawaii9 LocationsSee all locationsSixt car rental locations in Hawaii9 LocationsSee all locationsEasirent car rental locations in Hawaii8 LocationsSee all locationsVIPCars Recommendation car rental locations in Hawaii7 LocationsSee all locationsCar rental locations in HawaiiEverything you need to know for your car rental in HawaiiComplete your tripOther destinationsPopular citiesComplete your trip to HawaiiFlights to HawaiiHotels in HawaiiVacations in HawaiiCar rental in other popular destinationsHalifax Car RentalsJoliet Car RentalsAlbuquerque Car RentalsMinneapolis Car RentalsEilat Car RentalsAmsterdam Car RentalsHelena Car RentalsOmaha Car RentalsLondon Car RentalsAnkara Car RentalsMontpellier Car RentalsIstanbul Car RentalsSeaTac Car RentalsDes Moines Car RentalsDurham Car RentalsWilmington Car RentalsRichmond Car RentalsCopenhagen Car RentalsNewark Car RentalsBaltimore Car RentalsBari Car RentalsCar rental locations in HawaiiHonolulu car rentalsKīhei car rentalsLahaina car rentalsKailua-Kona car rentalsKoloa car rentalsWailea car rentalsPrinceville car rentalsWaikoloa Village car rentalsKapaa car rentalsKaanapali car rentalsKapolei car rentalsWaimea (Big Island) car rentalsKahuku car rentalsKailua car rentalsPuako car rentalsLihue car rentalsHilo car rentalsWaianae car rentalsKapalua car rentalsKaunakakai car rentalsKahului car rentalsHana car rentalsEwa Beach car rentalsKaneohe car rentalsPoipu car rentalsAiea car rentalsWailua (Kauai) car rentalsKalāheo car rentalsLanai City car rentalsWahiawā car rentalsWaipahu car rentalsOrlando car rentalsLos Angeles car rentalsDenver car rentalsNew York car rentalsLas Vegas car rentalsPhoenix car rentalsMiami car rentalsTampa car rentalsFort Lauderdale car rentalsChicago car rentalsSan Francisco car rentalsBoston car rentalsSeattle car rentalsHouston car rentalsAtlanta car rentalsSan Diego car rentalsDallas car rentalsWashington, D.C. car rentalsSalt Lake City car rentalsKohala Coast car rentalsNorth Shore Oahu car rentalsThe Big Island car rentalsMaui car rentalsMoloka'i car rentalsKaua'i car rentalsO'ahu car rentalsHaleakala National Park car rentalsKAYAK.comCarsCar rentals in North AmericaCar rentals in the United StatesHawaii car rentalsNot what you’re looking for?
