The rooms were described as outdated and in need of maintenance, and the breakfast options were often considered lacking. Overall, while the setting was praised, the experience was marred by service issues and poor value for the price paid.AI-Generated from customer reviews9.0Location9 out of 108.0Room Size8 out of 105.0Bed Comfort5 out of 103.0Service3 out of 103.0Value for Price3 out of 102.5Cleanliness2.5 out of 10Reviews(9)Q&A(5)Tips(10)Sort by:Most recentShow reviews that mentionpool and beachstaff were friendlygreat locationnice hotelbreakfast buffetrestaurant was very goodfood is not goodwell maintainedocean viewone nightFiltersAll filtersFiltersReview ratingTraveler typeTime of yearScore by provider8.4/108.4 out of 101432 reviews7.8/107.8 out of 1031 reviews8.6/108.6 out of 1011 reviews8.7/108.7 out of 109 reviewsAll reviews4.2MediocreAnonymous, Nov 2018Pros (+) The breakfast was good.Cons (-) The room. Like a motel 6!9.4WonderfulAnonymous, Sep 2017Pros (+) The beach area is wonderful. Very easy to walk and enjoy the beautiful ocean. I have stayed here many times prior and my room was as I expected, large and clean. The new safe was nice to see. The grocery store is a short walk and very convenient to stock up your refrigerator. The lunch wait staff was very kind. I did not have breakfast or dinner here, I always venture out. I will stay here again.9.1WonderfulAnonymous, Aug 2017Cons (-) The hotel caused an unnecessary delay when finalizing the check-out (not informing us after the room had been inspected), but otherwise it was an enjoyable experience in a great location.8.8Very goodAnonymous, May 2017Pros (+) Beautiful facilities. Good restaurants that were reasonably priced. Lovely pool and beach areas.Cons (-) I got a bargain deal, and so got a room facing the street, and it smelled a little of mold. Next time I will splurge and get a higher-priced room.10WonderfulAnonymous, Mar 2017Pros (+) Best place we could have chosen in Cancun for a night relaxing getaway. Everyone at the resort was very nice, a ton of staff (all of which were very nice). it wasn't your typical cancun party hotel - it was very calm, some families, and a lot of europeans/south americans. Our room was great - very clean with a balcony with a sea view (even though we just booked a standard room)! The beach was amaz...Cons (-) Everything was amazing but if I had to say one thing - the room bathrooms are slightly outdated. But we were barely in the room anyways so it doesn't really matter!Read more7.7GoodAnonymous, Mar 2017Pros (+) Facility was nice beautiful. Food was great. Room was spacious.Cons (-) After paying $150 a night they asked for an additional $40 for a third guest. No problem their I guess that was the rule of the hotel. We were in a rush to leave and upon check out they asked us to stay so they could review the room. This in itself was ridiculous. If their was an issue they could bring it up after checkout and then charge the credit card after. After they reviewed the room they th...Read more6.5OkayAnonymous, Feb 2017Pros (+) I love that they have suites with a kitchen because it feels like home and is more flexible.Cons (-) There were bedbugs that ate my dad alive and other customers had the same problem, even though I have stayed here before with no problems. I all also had a booking issue and they were not very helpful. I felt like they felt I was a wealthy American with lots of money so they could take advantage of me. But that is kind-of the overall feeling of the area anyway.10WonderfulAnonymous, Jan 2017Pros (+) Wonderful room and beautiful hotel for a decent price. Would definitely stay there again.8.5Very goodAnonymous, Apr 2016Pros (+) Nice pool and quick access to the beach.Cons (-) Limited and tight parking spaces.Showing 1-10 of 5519 reviews12345...552The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What are the best times to visit the hotel?The hotel is ideal to visit during the low season in April or the high season in May, offering a great location and access to the beach.How is the quality of the beds at the hotel?The beds are clean and comfortable, providing a good night's sleep for guests.Is parking available at the hotel?Yes, the hotel offers free parking and private parking for the convenience of guests.What can guests expect from the food quality at the hotel?While some guests have mentioned average food quality, the hotel offers a variety of dining options including a beach restaurant and breakfast buffet with local and international options.How is the cleanliness and customer service at the hotel?The hotel maintains a very clean environment and provides friendly and helpful staff to ensure a pleasant stay for guests.The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.Opt for a Room with Beach ViewSeveral guests praised the beautiful beach and calm, clear water, making a beach view room a worthwhile choice.Consider Transportation OptionsWhile the hotel is located near attractions, some guests found it far from historical places and adventure parks, so consider booking tours for convenient access.Check Room LocationSome guests recommended requesting a room close to the beach for easy access, as the property is spread out and some rooms may require a short walk to reach the beach.Explore Breakfast OptionsThe breakfast buffet offers a variety of local and international options, including made-to-order items like omelets and chilaquiles, making it a convenient and valuable choice.Request Room UpgradesSome guests were offered upgrades for an additional charge, so consider inquiring about available upgrades upon check-in for a potentially enhanced experience.Consider Noise LevelsRooms facing the road may lack a view but could be quieter, while beach-facing rooms may offer stunning views but could be noisier due to activities on the beach.Take Advantage of Beach AmenitiesThe hotel provides beach chairs and palapas, offering a comfortable and convenient way to enjoy the beach.Plan for DiningWhile some guests enjoyed the breakfast and beach bar offerings, others found the food quality to be lacking, so consider exploring nearby dining options for variety.Inquire About Airport ShuttleCheck with the hotel about shuttle services to and from the airport to potentially simplify transportation arrangements.Manage Expectations for Room FacilitiesSome guests noted that the rooms are clean but may have an older feel, so adjust expectations accordingly for a comfortable stay.LocationBlvd. Kukulcan Km 8.5, 77500 Cancún, Quintana RooWhat's nearbyCancun Convention Center0.4 miHard Rock Cafe Cancun0.4 miCoCo Bongo Cancun0.5 miCancun Golf Club at Pok Ta Pok0.5 miLa Isla Shopping Mall1.9 miKukulcan Plaza2.4 miSpa at The Royal Sands2.7 miPuerto Cancun3.9 miPuerto Juarez4.7 miGran Puerto4.8 miGlorieta del Ceviche4.9 miIberostar Cancun Peninsula Convention Centre5 miPoliciesCheck-in/Check-outCheck in anytime after 3:00 PM, check out anytime before 12:00 PMCancellation/prepaymentCancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.Essential information about Beachscape Kin Ha Villas & SuitesLow seasonHigh seasonAverage price (weeknight)Average price (weekend night)SeptemberDecember$152$113Cheapest month to stay with an average 38% drop in price.Most expensive month to stay with an average 247% rise in price.Average Sun - Thu price over the last 2 weeks.Average Fri & Sat price over the last 2 weeks.When to book a room at Beachscape Kin Ha Villas & SuitesPrice per night.
