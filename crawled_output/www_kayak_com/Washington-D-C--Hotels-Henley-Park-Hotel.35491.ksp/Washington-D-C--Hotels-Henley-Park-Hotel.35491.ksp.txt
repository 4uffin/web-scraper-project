The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. Will definitely be our first choice again if the price is right. Lovely room.Cons (-) Would have enjoyed better towels, a hook in the bathroom and an extra blanket. The air conditioning was a bit difficult to adjust.9.1WonderfulJacquelyn, Feb 2018Pros (+) Conveniently located in downtown DC, easy to walk to most sights, restaurants and entertainment venues. The food was good and the hotel interior was quiet.Cons (-) My only complaint is that the windows really need to be replaced. The up/down casement windows tended to slide down from the top, which let in a draft. Also, they are single-pane, which allow every noise outside into the room, and I was on the 7th floor. Tuesday morning trash pick-up was especially vivid, and a construction project that was a block away sounded like it was next door.10WonderfulAnonymous, Oct 2017Pros (+) The elegance and the staffCons (-) No complaints10WonderfulAnonymous, Jun 2017Pros (+) Great location??Cons (-) ?7.1GoodAnonymous, Oct 2016Pros (+) The hotel is within 4 blocks on the Mt Vernon/Convention Center Metro station. There's a CVS close by for forgotten items and it's on the way to the metro. There's a few places to grab a meal within a one block radius. The staff was very friendly and the room was clean. They have a business center with a printer for printing boarding passes or emails. The TV has a great selection of channels.Cons (-) The toilet was really low, hard for tall people with bad knees. The bed could have been a little more comfortable. The A/C blows on the bed if you don't adjust the levers. There's not enough light by the mirror for makeup, they need to have a movable mirror that you can take to the desk. Only one of the bedside lamps worked. One of the elevators was down, so it sometimes took a long time to get to...Read more9.7WonderfulAnonymous, Sep 2016Pros (+) Pleasant helpful staff, superlative room, great location, overall would visit again10WonderfulAnonymous, Feb 2016Pros (+) Convenient location to my meeting. Staff is very courteous and helpful.Cons (-) Be sure to ask for a quiet room. The traffic on Mass. Ave. side can be heard even on the higher floors.3.4PoorAnonymous, Jan 2016Pros (+) Location...Its a short walk from the Washington Mall.Cons (-) They dont have an AC.They have a heater and if you tell them your room is too hot, they asked us to open a window They gave a loud fan which made noise than cool the room. The room is tiny.The flush in the restroom was inefficient. There is no option to park your own car.The valet service is mandatory and is an additional 45$ per night. No inhome laundry service.
