Everything from the decor to the staff was super welcoming. I would stay there again.Cons (-) The only downside we’re the rooms were a little small. I don’t mind small rooms but with two people it made it a little difficult to navigate around.8.8Very goodAnonymous, Aug 2018Pros (+) Location is perfect. Down town close to all transportation. Price was reasonable. Staff was very pleasant and accommodating.Cons (-) Window in room didn’t open and no air circulation.8.0Very goodAnonymous, Aug 2018Pros (+) Great location - within walking distance of many attractions, like The House of Blue, Chicago Riverwalk, Magnificent Mile, and eateries. Also conveniently located for public transportation - within one block of the "L" System and close to many bus lines. Trendy - not your conventional décor. The tiles in the shower set it apart from molded walls in many hotels. Argan line of toiletries provided. F...Cons (-) Our room was tight. The queen bed pretty much took up the whole space. Not a lot of surface on which to put things. Small closet had only two hangers. My husband did not find the bed comfortable - the mattress was relatively thin and on a platform (instead of box spring).Read more7.4GoodAnonymous, Dec 2017Pros (+) great location, very funky bar and set up on first floor, clean spaces and a fun experience with lots of young travelers visiting chicago so it has a great international feel to it. almost like a high end youth hostel in a wayCons (-) got quite a bit of an attitude with first reception at desk... but next morning, a different person at front desk was terrific. free breakfast doesn't really include many options10WonderfulZachary, Dec 2017Pros (+) The Freehand is a place that my fiance and I visit at least once annual (anniversary) and we decided to come back again!

Very comfortable6.5OkayAnonymous, Feb 2017Pros (+) Staff was sympathetic and helpful. The location and both the restaurant and cafe in the lobby were awesome.Cons (-) They were having a lot of maintenance issues during our stay. Pipes broke in the rooms next to us so the fire escape doors were open. Our heating/cooling system didn't work in our room and the best they could do was give us a fan and some drink tickets. The icing on the cake was being harassed by two bros in the elevator.2.0PoorAnonymous, Nov 2016Cons (-) Being as I did not have a credit card I was NOT allowed to check in and my mother paid for it on line and is now being told she can not get a refundShowing 1-10 of 4852 reviews12345...486The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What dining options are available at Freehand Chicago?Freehand Chicago offers the Broken Shaker, dubbed Chicago’s best hotel bar, serving perfectly-crafted and imaginative cocktails.
