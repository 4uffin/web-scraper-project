As a result, the roads are often very busy, especially around the morning (6 am to 9 am and evening rush hours 4 pm to 7 pm). If you’re driving into central London, the daily congestion charge fee must be paid before you head in. This covers everything within the ring road from Marylebone across to Shoreditch and down to Victoria and more.
Fully electric vehicles and select energy-efficient hybrids are exempt from all low-emission zone charges, so you might be able to save some money in the long run if you choose to rent an electric vehicle.
The rules of the road differ depending on what part of the city your car finds itself in, so it’s well worth planning your route before you set off to avoid any unwanted charges. Why? London councils have the power to enforce all sorts of common offenses, such as no left, right, or U-turns, with traffic cameras.
It’s also worth noting that you drive on the left in the UK, so take plenty of time to adjust to the new rules of the road.The﻿ dos and don’ts of parking your rental car in LondonWhen it comes to finding a spot to park that is relatively close to your destination can be a bit of a challenge.

Make sure you have downloaded prior to your London visit, one of these apps to help you find a parking spot: Appy Parking, Parkopedia, RingGo, and JustPark.
Apart from finding a good parking spot, there are strict rules about where drivers can leave their vehicles and where they can’t. Markings and signs are good indicators.
Apart from Stopping or parking on red routes is prohibited, unless otherwise stated, and any sat nav the car has installed alerts the dos and don’ts along the way. In addition to the red routes, parking on double yellow lines at any time is a big no. Single yellow lines can be parked on at certain times of the day. Parking is allowed on designated dashed white lines, but drivers must follow the rules of the corresponding ‘pay and display signs. Failure to do so will result in you getting a hefty parking ticket.
It’s also worth noting that you cannot park on these lines if they are reserved for permit holders. It is also illegal to park on the pavement in London, and in some London boroughs like Islington or Westminster, those driving diesel vehicles will be charged an extra parking surcharge.
In addition to road markings, several hotels offer valet car parking spaces, and there are several car parks dotted throughout the city if you choose to leave your vehicle parked for the day. Beware, this can be very costly, though, and sometimes work out even higher than what you paid to rent the car in the first place.Where can I get fuel and how much does it cost in London?There are plenty of gas stations dotted throughout the city, especially in suburban areas.

My heavily pregnant wife was very stressed. There were no charger points available nor working when we stopped to charge. We then made it with 8miles left on the battery to the next charging station. We picked up my daughter 2hours late and that created further problems for the family looking after my daughter. They missed their connection to Ireland. The 155miles return journey to Gatwick we only just made again with less than 20miles left on the battery. We were assured the car would travel 255miles on a full charge. But it didnt ! All in all we had an awful experience and a very stressful journey, concerned all the way for my heavily pregnant wife. The girl at budget/Avis desk was Polish and her english language was very poor.

I had to go onto the internet to find out what the buttons on the steering wheel did. Finally on returning the vehicle, I told them that a stone had hit the windscreen and it had a crack. When told that the 'costly' collision damage waiver did not cover the cost of repair, I was dismayed, I was told I should be able to claim on my travel insurance. Subsequently, Hertz have included a bill for 808 pounds for the repair of the windscreen. I shall challenge that as I got a quote of 148 pounds for the same repair. I have told my bank to hold over that payment, whilst the matter is resolve with my travel insurance. None of the paperwork I received from the people at the yard, gave me any indication of the exclusion of damage to a windscreen would not be covered by collision damage waiver.10.0 WonderfulAnonymous, Sep 2024EconomyPickup was great, car was excellent.

We were given a hire vehicle with rim damage and were told not to worry as rim damage is counted as damage. We returned the vehicle the next day and got charged the full bond as there was a scuff on the tire. I asked for photos of the vehicle before I hired it, they couldn’t provide it. As soon as they know you have insurance through a third party they will look for any opportunity to take your full bond. In our case the scuff to the tyre required a spot light for it to be seen. Very disappointing as we picked this company due to stronger reviews to avoid this problem. The most detailed return inspection I have ever witnessed when hiring a vehicle. They are clearly looking for any opportunity to pass on charges for older vehicles to customers. No manager or similar to discuss with and left very frustrated due to the poor customer service. I wouldn’t recommend this hire car company.2.0 PoorAnonymous, Jun 2024IntermediateVery disappointing. The pick up address was closed. Notice on door saying go to another office. No car availability when I got there. I had to wait three hours to get an automatic non-electric vehicle, which is what I booked and needed.

Firstly they forced me to buy collision insurance and didn't accept the coverage provided by my credit card. At the time of booking there was no such requirement and if it was mandatory it should have been told at the time of booking, considering that they are scamming people. Secondly, they don't record all the damages to car and ask renter to record video, I tried to show them few scratches and the guy said record video, later while returning one of the scratch was not clear in video and the guy seems excited to blame me for that scratch luckily I found another video on my phone in which those scratches were evident. Never rent from them and go for known brands. I have already raised complaint to priceline for refund of addition $200 that I had to pay at pick up but they are also not helpful though it is a mistake by both of them.2.0 PoorFrank, Sep 2024CompactPick up was in a scruffy building in a rough area, nowhere near Heathrow or the Tube.

I bought the platinum protection package which protects you from liability in case of scratches or even totaling the car and they’re still try to withhold my deposit of $254. Worst people I’ve ever dealt with.6.0 OkayAnonymous, Sep 2023CompactNegative: On arrival at Heathrow T4, despite what was on my booking from the broker (and what I have since confirmed is posted on the Surprice website), Surprice Heathrow pick-up only covered T2/T3/T5. This meant having to get a train with multiple bags which was very challenging for one person. My AMEX credit card was also not accepted (despite having already been used through the broker booking for part payment of the fee) Additionally, I was informed at the counter that I would need to pay extra to be dropped off at the airport on my departure Lastly, the car was dirty and had clearly not been cleaned. The agent offered to clean the car but I was now running late due to the unexpected trip from T4, etc so had to waive this offer Positive: On returning the car a few days later, I provided my poor experience to a gentleman called Sadan, who was handling the car check-in. He was very attentive and extremely customer focused.

We were told we’d have a 5 person 4 suitcase car. When we put our suitcases in the car we barely fit 3 people. The windshield wipers did not work and we had many days of scary rain. We had to hold them down while driving and it wasn’t safe. The stick shift didn’t work properly and the car pulled badly to the left. We tried many times to call customer service to exchange the car or return it to a different location because we were too scared to drive it. We were never able to get a hold of someone that could help us. One time we spoke to a person and she supposedly gave us an inside line but no one ever answered the line. We had locals try to help us, the two hotels tried but to no avail. We left the car parked at a hotel for 6 days without driving it because we couldn’t get back to where we rented it and we were too scared to drive it. The whole thing was awful and traumatizing. When we returned it we let them know about the difficulties but they didn’t seem to care. I won’t rent from them again. I hope they look it over before renting it out again but I doubt they will as they are so busy.Routes Car & Truck Rentals2.5PoorRead 11 reviewsCleanliness4.3Comfort4.3Pick-up/Drop-off2.9Value for money2.79 locations in Londonfrom$29/dayCar rental locationsLocations in London12 Semley Place Victoria, Next To Victoria Coach Station+44 371 384 5964Monday08:00 - 16:00Tuesday08:00 - 16:00Wednesday08:00 - 16:00Thursday08:00 - 16:00Friday08:00 - 16:00Saturday08:00 - 16:00Sunday00:00 - 23:59136 - 150 Pentonville Road, Kings Cross+44 371 384 5952Monday08:00 - 16:00Tuesday08:00 - 16:00Wednesday08:00 - 16:00Thursday08:00 - 16:00Friday08:00 - 16:00Saturday08:00 - 16:00Sunday00:00 - 23:5968 86 Clapham Road,london, England+44 371 384 5946Opening times not availableCar Rental Village, Coopers End Rd+44 371 384 3419Monday06:00 - 20:00Tuesday06:00 - 20:00Wednesday06:00 - 20:00Thursday06:00 - 20:00Friday06:00 - 20:00Saturday06:00 - 20:00Sunday06:00 - 20:00London City Airport,King George V Dock SilvertownOpening times not availableLondon Gatwick AirportOpening times not availableMulti Storey Car Park, Pancras Road North Road+44 371 384 5962Monday08:00 - 16:00Tuesday08:00 - 16:00Wednesday08:00 - 16:00Thursday08:00 - 16:00Friday08:00 - 16:00Saturday08:00 - 16:00Sunday00:00 - 23:59President Way, Building 250, Car Hire CentreOpening times not availableUnit 6, Jetsave LTD, Sovereign Court, 633 Sipson Rd+44 7367 584241Monday06:00 - 20:00Tuesday06:00 - 20:00Wednesday06:00 - 20:00Thursday06:00 - 20:00Friday06:00 - 20:00Saturday06:00 - 20:00Sunday06:00 - 20:00FiltersNo reviews availableDRIVALIA 2.0PoorRead 1 reviewCleanliness4.0Comfort2.0Pick-up/Drop-off2.0Value for money2.022 locations in LondonDRIVALIA reviewsCar rental locationsLocations in London53 Cornwall Rd+44 20 3657 6054Opening times not availableAPCOA Multi-Story Car Park+44 20 3657 6054Opening times not availableAPCOA Multi-Story Car Park+44 20 3657 6054Opening times not availableCitipark+44 20 3657 6054Opening times not availableCornwall Road, South BankOpening times not availableCumberland GateOpening times not availableCumberland streetOpening times not availableGainsford StreetOpening times not availableHerbrand Street Car Park+44 20 3657 6051Opening times not availableHoliday Inn RCP Car Park BuildingOpening times not availableLondon Stansted Airport+44 1279 215341Opening times not availableQ Park - PIMLICO+44 20 3657 6054Opening times not availableQ Park - Park Lane+44 20 3657 6054Opening times not availableQ Park - Queensway - Bayswater+44 20 3657 6054Opening times not availableQ Park Park LaneOpening times not availableQ Park Pimlico, Cumberland Street+44 20 3657 6054Opening times not availableQ Park Tower Bridge+44 20 3657 6054Opening times not availableQueensway+44 20 3657 6054Opening times not availableRCP Car Park
