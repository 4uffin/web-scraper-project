Bathroom moldy. Floors dirty5.7FairAnonymous, Dec 2017Cons (-) Too noisy!8.2Very goodAaron, Aug 2017Pros (+) I liked the look of the room. By far the best looking Super 8 I've stayed in. Everything in the rooms were new looking and of good quality. Room came with a mini fridge and microwave which was convenient. Included breakfast was nice even if it was very basic. I had low expectations for a Super 8 and this location exceeded those expectations which was a pleasant surprise.Cons (-) The pillows themselves (not the cases) were a bit stained, which was a little gross. A couple items in the room weren't cleaned well (the soap dish for example) The water pressure in the shower was mediocre and the towels were pretty low quality/rough. Breakfast was very basic. Bread, pre-packaged pastries, cereals, and Waffles. We got breakfast near the end and most of the things were running out...Read more9.4WonderfulAnonymous, Jun 2017Pros (+) Hotel was spotless & staff was amazing.Cons (-) My only complaint is the continental breakfast has few options and even fewer heathy choices.8.0Very goodAnonymous, Apr 2016Pros (+) The waffles and the shuttle service as well as the room/tv channelsCons (-) A bit far from the max but luckily the shuttle service takes people to the airport stop and picks them up when you callShowing 1-10 of 808 reviews12345...81The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What can I expect from the hotel's complimentary breakfast?The hotel offers a light breakfast to go, which includes options like oatmeal, bananas, and instant yogurt.
