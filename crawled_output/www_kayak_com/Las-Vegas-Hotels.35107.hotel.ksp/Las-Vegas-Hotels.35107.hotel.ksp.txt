You stay at one near the beach for instance, or that’s in an area of town you like. In many ways, hotels in Las Vegas are the destination. So, where you choose to stay will, in many ways, define your Vegas vacation. The obvious reason for this is the heavily themed nature of the hotels, from the laser beam-topped Egyptian pyramid to the Eiffel Tower to the hotel fronted by a 45-foot-tall lion seemingly plucked from the production logo of an MGM film.
But perhaps the more accurate reason is that these hotels are essentially self-contained cities. The casinos aim to keep you inside, and spending money, so they’re constantly upgrading rooms, adding restaurants and enhancing the shopping experience. You get the idea: once you’re inside your hotel, that may be your Vegas for the week. Here are my ten favorites.Wynn Las VegasRank #1$145-$2,846/night3131 Las Vegas Boulevard SouthHands down the most luxurious hotel in Las Vegas, this is true resort living—and most of its devoted guests don’t...Learn moreHands down the most luxurious hotel in Las Vegas, this is true resort living—and most of its devoted guests don’t leave the hotel while they’re here. Wynn and its sister resort, Encore, look out onto their own par-70 championship golf course – the only one on the Strip.Big, sunlit atriums, lakes and waterfalls, and even dragons guarding century-old pomegranate trees outside the first Michelin-starred Chinese restaurant in North America keep this resort feeling surprising. It’s the largest Forbes Five-Star resort in the world, and from the en-pointe service to the no-details-spared design, you’ll see it at every turn.Check pricesCheck pricesARIA Resort & CasinoRank #2$82-$1,798/night3730 Las Vegas Boulevard SouthOne of the best-located resorts on the Strip, Aria is part of the vast CityCenter complex and is connected by a...Learn moreOne of the best-located resorts on the Strip, Aria is part of the vast CityCenter complex and is connected by a walkway to Park MGM (which looks right out to T-Mobile Arena in its front yard and has the popular Dolby Live concert venue). It is refreshingly modern, with its streamlined design and natural materials inside two sleek glass towers.Its seven SkyVillas and 400 Sky Suites on the top floors of the 50-floor hotel have their own separate entrance, pool, and elevator. Other resorts are just catching on to Aria’s details for tech-savvy travelers like in-room tablets through which you can control the room’s features, order takeout from the hotel, and make spa appointments.Check pricesCheck pricesCaesars Palace - Resort & CasinoRank #3$54-$10,265/night3570 Las Vegas Boulevard SouthThe massive, six-tower Roman-themed hotel on 85 acres of the Las Vegas Strip was built in the 1960s to make its...Learn moreThe massive, six-tower Roman-themed hotel on 85 acres of the Las Vegas Strip was built in the 1960s to make its guests feel like emperors. Like Rome itself, Caesars wasn’t built in a day but continues to expand and revamp, with its Colosseum concert arena, shopping mall (The Forum Shops at Caesars, which has its own Trevi Fountain), a five-acre complex of seven pools, and a huge variety of hotel rooms.This includes the Nobu Hotel which now occupies one of its towers. Everything here is over the top (remember, we’re in Rome), so don’t miss the 50,000-square-foot spa with its Roman bath theme, the largest buffet in the world, and one of the largest nightclubs in Las Vegas – the four-story Omnia. Go large or stay on a budget: there’s a way to do both here.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Venetian Resort Las VegasRank #4$57-$5,471/night3355 Las Vegas Boulevard SouthA massive Palazzo Ducale, complete with Doge’s Palace, sits right on the Strip, with singing gondoliers making their...Learn moreA massive Palazzo Ducale, complete with Doge’s Palace, sits right on the Strip, with singing gondoliers making their way around a canal system. The Venetian Resort is the second largest hotel in the world and with its sister resort, Palazzo, does indeed feel like the entire city of Venice. All the rooms are suites and are among the largest on the Strip.One of its biggest surprises is the massive Canyon Ranch Spa – an entire destination spa resort right in the hotel. Parents will love it because the shop-lined canals of its Grand Canal Shoppes will keep families busy for days, plus it has the best selection of reasonably-priced casual restaurants on the Strip. But you can also treat it as a luxe getaway, lounging at the adults-only Tao Beach pool complex and dining at the many high-end restaurants.Check pricesCheck pricesThe Cosmopolitan of Las VegasRank #5$27-$1,619/night3708 Las Vegas Boulevard SouthThe Cosmopolitan is the slightly zany, cooler younger sibling of the Strip’s megaresorts. A decidedly cool crowd...Learn moreThe Cosmopolitan is the slightly zany, cooler younger sibling of the Strip’s megaresorts. A decidedly cool crowd stays at this cutting-edge art-filled hotel. Some of the features that lure crowds include a three-story chandelier, three levels of bars and lounges, a lobby with streaming LED columns.There’s even a hidden bar and lounge inside a barbershop and a Japanese-inspired ski lodge that serves cocktails until late. In the summer, the Marquee Dayclub and Nightclub provide round-the-clock fun, and in the winter its Boulevard pool turns into an ice rink.Check pricesCheck pricesFour Seasons Hotel Las VegasRank #6$85-$4,124/night3960 Las Vegas Boulevard SouthOne of the city’s most private pool scenes can be found at Four Seasons, which occupies floors 35 to 39 of Mandalay...Learn moreOne of the city’s most private pool scenes can be found at Four Seasons, which occupies floors 35 to 39 of Mandalay Bay. Its poolside restaurant, Veranda, looks out over the pool which, unlike most pools on the Strip, doesn’t accommodate non-guests. The non-gaming hotel has its own porte-cochere, lounge, and spa. On the other hand, it has access to all the family fun of Mandalay Bay, like the sand beach at the Mandalay pool complex. It’s also the closest luxury resort within walking distance of the perpetually packed Allegiant Stadium.Check pricesCheck pricesNoMad Las VegasRank #7$134-$1,281/night3772 South Las Vegas BoulevardAt the NoMad Library restaurant you’ll find yourself sitting in a grand library designed by legendary French...Learn moreAt the NoMad Library restaurant you’ll find yourself sitting in a grand library designed by legendary French designer Jacques Garcia. The soaring walls are filled with the actual 25,000-book collection of philanthropist David Rockefeller. It’s a fine example of what the hotel is all about – whisking you to some imaginary place and time, all on the top four floors of Park MGM. The 239-room boutique is one of the best surprises in Las Vegas, with its own entrance and casino. Its rooms feel like elegant Parisian pieds-a-terre, with standalone baths and views over the strip’s only green space. Stay hidden in your private boutique or come down a few floors and join the party that is now Park MGM.Check pricesCheck pricesCirca Resort & Casino - Adults OnlyRank #8$83-$11,355/night8 Fremont StreetCirca is a glitzy ode to its Glitter Gulch roots – including a fully rehabbed 20-foot-tall neon cowgirl “Vegas...Learn moreCirca is a glitzy ode to its Glitter Gulch roots – including a fully rehabbed 20-foot-tall neon cowgirl “Vegas Vickie”. But the adults-only resort, one of only two in the resort corridor, is better known as a sports fanatic’s paradise and party zone.Its Stadium Swim outdoor pool area faces a 40-foot-high HDTV screen and its three-story amphitheater is the largest sportsbook in the world.This is the best base to explore the Fremont Street Experience and historic Downtown since it opens right onto Fremont. One of the best new steakhouses in the city is Barry’s Downtown Prime, and its Legacy Club, a partly open-air lounge on its 60th floor, has some of the most dramatic views of the mountains.Check pricesCheck pricesBellagioRank #9$33-$2,035/night3600 Las Vegas Boulevard SouthThe Lake Como-themed Bellagio was the priciest resort in the world to build when it opened in 1998, with its...Learn moreThe Lake Como-themed Bellagio was the priciest resort in the world to build when it opened in 1998, with its towering verdigris and glass Art Nouveau-inspired Conservatory and Botanical Garden. It’s also home to nearly nine acres of iconic choreographed dancing fountains and 1200 booming water cannons.Over the years it has settled into landmark status and is now the definition of classic Vegas glamour. The best way to enjoy the dancing fountains is from inside one of its lakeside restaurants, like the terrace at Lago by Julian Serrano or Spago. In the last eight years, Bellagio has renovated all its rooms; most recently, its Lake Como-inspired Spa Tower.Check pricesCheck pricesWaldorf Astoria Las VegasRank #10$138-$9,603/night3752 Las Vegas Boulevard SouthThe Waldorf Astoria is one of the most romantic stays in Vegas.

The lobby entrance seems unassuming—until you realize the actual lobby is the 23rd-floor sky lobby with 17-foot floor-to-ceiling windows and sweeping views of the Strip.This hotel is all about personalized service, from the traditional high tea in the 23rd-floor lounge to personal concierges that wield plenty of power—including in The Shoppes at Crystals, whose private backroom shopping opportunities are legendary. But it’s the hotel’s aquatic deck and two floors devoted to spas and wellness that are the biggest hit with guests.Check pricesCheck pricesBooking InsightsKAYAK’s insights for hotels in Las VegasDiscover seasonal trends, ideal booking windows, and other data-driven tips to plan your stay in Las Vegas with confidence.How much does a hotel cost in Las Vegas?The average price of a double room in Las Vegas is $216 per night.

Also you can avoid the resort fees and still stay close by staying at the Best Western Plus or Marriott. Planet Hollywood has the best of both worlds as there are inexpensive places to eat along the miracle mile. Unfortunately Paris has primarily pretty expensive and some of the resorts in that area are just getting too pricey even by current day inflation standards. As such I would avoid places like Paris, Bellagio, Venetian, Caesars Palace, or the Wynn. Dining options while they are very good they are pretty much over priced at this point considering a burger there will run you close to 30 dollars and you can walk less than half a mile to get a similar quality burger with fries and a drink with less of a crowd for around $10 at the ketchup bar on the miracle mile. You really don't gain much for the money considering resort fees and closet of amenities by staying at Paris or some of the other mentioned Resorts as the room quality elsewhere will be pretty much the same. You are just paying for a premium for the brand at this point I would suggest some of the other hotels listed here and either walking to Paris or the others if you want to check it out or taking the monorail or Uber as you don't have to stay there to play there or still get the same experience. A lot of the places on Fremont street are also stepping up and are much more reasonable.JonathanJul 2025Stayed at Mandalay Bay Resort and CasinoKnow where, on the strip, you most want to visit and book a hotel based on that. - South end of the strip is more themed, family-friendly hotels. the north end is high-end, very posh, designer hotels.
