Beds were okay for one night (we bought sleeping bags after reading all the reviews and i suggest you do the same).Cons (-) Dirty, incredibly loud street noise but you have to keep the window open because it's so hot and stuffy and there's no fan. Black mold in the bathroom. Fine for one night and only if you're used to hostels or traveling on the super cheap.Showing 1-10 of 3454 reviews12345...346The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.What can I expect from the staff at Corbigoe Hotel?Guests have praised the staff for being friendly and helpful, providing a comfortable and quiet environment.Are there any concerns about the cleanliness of the rooms at Corbigoe Hotel?Some guests have expressed concerns about the cleanliness of the rooms, including issues with mould, dirty mattresses, and a damp smell.Is there free parking available at Corbigoe Hotel?Yes, the hotel offers free parking as part of its amenities.What are the best times to visit Corbigoe Hotel?The low season is in March, and the high season is in June, offering different experiences for visitors.How is the food quality at Corbigoe Hotel?The hotel does not provide specific information about food quality in the reviews, but guests have mentioned the convenient location and good value for money.The questions and answers provided in this section are generated by an artificial intelligence model based on a summarization of user hotel reviews and hotel information.See moreThey offer insights and recommendations from previous guests and hotel information to help future visitors enhance their stay at the hotel.Consider Nearby AttractionsThe hotel is within walking distance of several popular attractions, including Tate Britain, John Lewis Department Store, and Westminster Cathedral, making it convenient for sightseeing.Opt for a Room with a ViewSome guests recommended choosing a room with a balcony facing the fountain for spectacular views.Check for Refurbished RoomsThe hotel has recently undergone refurbishment, so consider requesting one of the updated rooms for a more comfortable stay.Be Mindful of SeasonalityIf visiting in March, which is considered the low season, it might be less crowded and more affordable.Verify Room AmenitiesBefore booking, ensure that the room has essential amenities such as Wi-Fi, as some guests reported issues with facilities like hot water and heating.Consider Room SizeSeveral guests mentioned that the rooms are small, so if space is a priority, it's worth considering this aspect before booking.Be Aware of Noise LevelsSome guests reported noise disturbances, so if you are a light sleeper, it may be beneficial to inquire about room locations or noise insulation.Check for Room CleanlinessWhile some guests praised the cleanliness, others reported issues with cleanliness and maintenance, so it's advisable to check recent reviews for updated information.Inquire About HeatingSome guests experienced issues with heating, so it's advisable to confirm the status of heating facilities, especially during colder months.Be Prepared for Basic AccommodationsSeveral guests mentioned that the hotel provides basic accommodations, so it's essential to set realistic expectations.Location101 Belgrave Road, London, SW1V 2BHWhat's nearbyPalace of Westminster0.8 miBuckingham Palace0.8 miBig Ben0.9 miLondon Eye1.2 miWaterloo1.3 miCharing Cross1.3 miCentral London1.3 miTrafalgar Square1.3 miHarrods1.3 miPiccadilly Circus1.4 miLeicester Square1.5 miStrand1.5 miPoliciesCheck-in/Check-outCheck in anytime after 1:30 PM, check out anytime before 10:30 AMCancellation/prepaymentCancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.Essential information about Corbigoe HotelLow seasonHigh seasonAverage price (weeknight)Average price (weekend night)FebruaryMarch$72$79Cheapest month to stay with an average 36% drop in price.Most expensive month to stay with an average 43% rise in price.Average Sun - Thu price over the last 2 weeks.Average Fri & Sat price over the last 2 weeks.When to book a room at Corbigoe HotelPrice per night.
