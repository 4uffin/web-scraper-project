We also noticed that the carpet was damn as well. Probably from all of the moisture. When I did make a complaint about the room the customer service I relieved from the manager was terrible. I will never stay here again and I absolutely do not recommend it to anyone!8.0Very goodAnonymous, May 2016Pros (+) Beds were clean, breakfast was good, every staff member was friendly and smiled at you.Cons (-) The parking pass was $10 extra dollars.
