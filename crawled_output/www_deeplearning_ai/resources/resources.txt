Download Now AI NotesThis is a series of long-form tutorials that supplement what you learned in the Deep Learning Specialization. With interactive visualizations, these tutorials will help you build intuition about foundational deep learning concepts like initializing neural networks and parameter optimization.Get AI NotesInitializing neural networksInitialization can have a significant impact on convergence in training deep neural networks. Simple initialization schemes have been found to accelerate training, but they require some care to avoid common pitfalls. In this post, we'll explain how to initialize neural network parameters effectively.Read moreParameter optimization in neural networksTraining a machine learning model is a matter of closing the gap between the model's predictions and the observed training data labels. But optimizing the model parameters isn't so straightforward. Through interactive visualizations, we'll help you develop your intuition for setting up and solving this optimization problem.Read moreOther ResourcesMLOps: From Model-centric to Data-centric AI by Andrew NgIn these slides, Andrew Ng shares the skills he sees as fundamental to the next generation of machine learning practitioners.
