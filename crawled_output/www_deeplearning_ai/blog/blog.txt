Sep 14, 2023CommunityAnswers from the instructor: AI for Good’s Robert MonarchI’m currently a machine learning professional and have been working in Silicon Valley for about 15 years. I’ve been with big companies, like Amazon Web Services and Apple, and startups focused on data labeling and machine learning.
Jun 29, 2023CommunityA conversation with Microsoft’s AI for Good Lab Director: Juan Lavista FerresI have been interested in AI for Good-type work for the majority of my career. Almost 20 years ago, a good friend of mine lost a child to SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). As a result, I started volunteering with Seattle Children’s Hospital, helping to understand the causes and preventative steps that could be taken to reduce the risk of SIDS. This volunteer engagement led to the opportunity to create the Microsoft AI for Good Lab. I could have never imagined the scope and scale of the work we’re fortunate to do today. From improving health outcomes to biodiversity conservation and humanitarian response, the relevance and need for AI in every sector has never been more pronounced.
Jun 29, 2023Ambassador Spotlight2023 Pie & AI Ambassador Spotlight: Vikram Mark Radhakrishnan, The HagueDuring my time as a PhD student, I realized that my biggest professional and personal interests are artificial intelligence and community building. As a PhD student in astronomy, I used to organize communities for astronomy enthusiasts, bringing together scientists, amateur astronomers, and astrophotographers to connect and learn from each other. And, since my research required knowledge of deep learning algorithms, I completed the courses on deep learning and TensorFlow from Deeplearning.AI and subscribed to the newsletter.  During that time, I realized that my biggest professional and personal interests are artificial intelligence and community building.
