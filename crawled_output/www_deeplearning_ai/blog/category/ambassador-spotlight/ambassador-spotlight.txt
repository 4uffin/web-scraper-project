Sep 14, 2023Ambassador Spotlight2023 Pie & AI Ambassador Spotlight: Vikram Mark Radhakrishnan, The HagueDuring my time as a PhD student, I realized that my biggest professional and personal interests are artificial intelligence and community building. As a PhD student in astronomy, I used to organize communities for astronomy enthusiasts, bringing together scientists, amateur astronomers, and astrophotographers to connect and learn from each other. And, since my research required knowledge of deep learning algorithms, I completed the courses on deep learning and TensorFlow from Deeplearning.AI and subscribed to the newsletter.  During that time, I realized that my biggest professional and personal interests are artificial intelligence and community building.
May 26, 2023Ambassador Spotlight2023 Pie & AI Ambassador Spotlight: Maxwell Nzekwe, LagosI joined the Deeplearning.AI community as an event ambassador because my primary goal is to help promote the community and its events and to provide information and assistance to those who are interested in learning more about deep learning and AI. I noticed that a lot of students and professionals want to get into tech, and that inspired me to help them. I am passionate about building the Deeplearning.AI community in Nigeria.

May 12, 2023Ambassador Spotlight2023 Pie & AI Ambassador Spotlight: Brennan Pursell, PennsylvaniaAndrew Ng persuaded me that AI is the new electricity. We are plunging into the fourth industrial revolution, and as a professional educator I need to prepare my students to contribute to, and compete in, the new economic landscape unfolding before us. As an organization, what DeepLearning.AI cares about most is sharing knowledge about this remarkable technology, which makes it a rare organization in a sector marked by sensational corporate profits and enormous societal costs.
May 5, 2023Ambassador Spotlight2022 Pie & AI Ambassador Spotlight: David QuintanillaI joined the DeepLearning AI Community because here in El Salvador, there were not many communities that talked about this topic, nor is it taught in our universities. I saw that DeepLearning.AI could help me to spread knowledge and connect with people interested in this field.

Oct 17, 2022Ambassador Spotlight2022 Pie & AI Ambassador Spotlight: Arushi BagchiI realized how deeply ingrained AI is in our everyday lives. Most people may not be aware of that, hence I wanted to bring that awareness and knowledge to them. By becoming an event ambassador, I am able to help spread AI awareness to others, as well as continue to learn from the AI experts who I host for the panel discussions. It amazes me how much people in the larger community are hungry to learn and how much appetite for AI there is out there.
Oct 10, 2022Ambassador Spotlight2022 Pie & AI Ambassador Spotlight: Patrick FleithI am a Data Scientist specializing in Space Systems Engineering. Part of my work is done at the European Space Agency. My job is to make space design and operations better with machine learning. For instance, developing anomaly detection systems to alert spacecraft operators about an abnormal satellite behavior. I also work on forecasting models, such as to predict the onboard power consumption, the temperatures of different equipment on the satellite, or to predict the remaining useful life of components. Other applications relate to natural language processing (NLP), such as question answering systems to help space systems engineers or flight control teams to gain quicker access to reliable technical information.
Oct 10, 2022Ambassador Spotlight2022 Pie & AI Ambassador Spotlight: Nelson HernándezI first attended a Pie & AI event organized by David Quintanilla, an AI ambassador here in San Salvador, and he explained what Deeplearning.AI and Pie & AI are. I liked the idea of becoming an ambassador because I’m a content creator and the role would help me improve the quality of my content. I was also interested because it would help me meet more people around the globe who are passionate about software development.
Oct 3, 2022Ambassador Spotlight2022 Pie & AI Ambassador Spotlight: Angelica ChowdhuryI wanted the Oceania region to be abreast of the latest developments from DeepLearning.AI and make AI knowledge available and easily accessible for the event attendees. Being geographically quite far away from the rest of the world, sometimes it becomes a challenge to keep up to date with the latest developments in AI. I wanted to play a small part in it by connecting AI enthusiasts and specialists from Oceania to the rest of the world.
