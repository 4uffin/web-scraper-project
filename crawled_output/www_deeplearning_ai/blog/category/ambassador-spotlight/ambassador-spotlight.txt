Sep 14, 2023Ambassador Spotlight2023 Pie & AI Ambassador Spotlight: Vikram Mark Radhakrishnan, The HagueDuring my time as a PhD student, I realized that my biggest professional and personal interests are artificial intelligence and community building. As a PhD student in astronomy, I used to organize communities for astronomy enthusiasts, bringing together scientists, amateur astronomers, and astrophotographers to connect and learn from each other. And, since my research required knowledge of deep learning algorithms, I completed the courses on deep learning and TensorFlow from Deeplearning.AI and subscribed to the newsletter.  During that time, I realized that my biggest professional and personal interests are artificial intelligence and community building.

Oct 17, 2022Ambassador Spotlight2022 Pie & AI Ambassador Spotlight: Arushi BagchiI realized how deeply ingrained AI is in our everyday lives. Most people may not be aware of that, hence I wanted to bring that awareness and knowledge to them. By becoming an event ambassador, I am able to help spread AI awareness to others, as well as continue to learn from the AI experts who I host for the panel discussions. It amazes me how much people in the larger community are hungry to learn and how much appetite for AI there is out there.
Oct 10, 2022Ambassador Spotlight2022 Pie & AI Ambassador Spotlight: Patrick FleithI am a Data Scientist specializing in Space Systems Engineering. Part of my work is done at the European Space Agency. My job is to make space design and operations better with machine learning. For instance, developing anomaly detection systems to alert spacecraft operators about an abnormal satellite behavior. I also work on forecasting models, such as to predict the onboard power consumption, the temperatures of different equipment on the satellite, or to predict the remaining useful life of components. Other applications relate to natural language processing (NLP), such as question answering systems to help space systems engineers or flight control teams to gain quicker access to reliable technical information.
Oct 10, 2022Ambassador Spotlight2022 Pie & AI Ambassador Spotlight: Nelson HernándezI first attended a Pie & AI event organized by David Quintanilla, an AI ambassador here in San Salvador, and he explained what Deeplearning.AI and Pie & AI are.
