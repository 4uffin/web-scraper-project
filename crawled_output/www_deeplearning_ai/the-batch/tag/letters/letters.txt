A report from the Coursera Connect conferenceThis week, Coursera held its annual conference in Las Vegas. A major theme was the shift from knowledge- to skills-based education, which will help many individuals, businesses, and educational institutions.Sep 10, 2025LettersAI Skills Are Redefining What Makes a Great Developer: The job market for software developers requires knowing how to use AIThere is significant unmet demand for developers who understand AI.Sep 3, 2025LettersAgents Running in Parallel Get There Faster: Parallel agents can accelerate AI systems as test-time compute scales up.Parallel agents are emerging as an important new direction for scaling up AI. AI capabilities have scaled with more training data, training-time compute, and test-time compute.Aug 27, 2025LettersHow Non-Coders Built 5 Software Products in 6½ Hours: At Buildathon on August 16, coders and non-coders alike showed how much AI is changing software development.On Saturday at the Buildathon [http://buildathon.ai] hosted by AI Fund and DeepLearning.AI, over 100 developers competed to build software products quickly using AI assisted coding.Aug 20, 2025LettersAI Transformation Comes to Universities: Exeter University groups computer science with business and environmental science, creating synergies that span AI, the economy, and the natural environment.Just as many businesses are transforming to become more capable by using AI, universities are too.Aug 13, 2025LettersWhy Meta Is Paying AI Engineers $100M: Meta’s massive compensation packages make sense considering the cost and potential return of delivering cutting-edge AI.Recently Meta made headlines with unprecedented, massive compensation packages for AI model builders exceeding $100M (sometimes spread over multiple years).Aug 6, 2025LettersHigh Stakes for Nations in the Great AI Race: The U.S. leads in AI, but China is gaining momentum. Democratic countries should remove roadblocks to AI progress so they can build models that support human rights and the rule of law.There is now a path for China to surpass the U.S. in AI. Even though the U.S. is still ahead, China has tremendous momentum with its vibrant open-weights model ecosystem and aggressive moves in semiconductor design and manufacturing.Jul 30, 2025LettersAnnouncing Buildathon: DeepLearning.AI and AI Fund host Buildathon, challenging AI buiders to engineer software projects rapidly. Sign up to compete on August 16, 2025!We’re organizing a new event called Buildathon: The Rapid Engineering Competition, to be held in the San Francisco Bay Area on Saturday, August 16, 2025!Jul 23, 2025LettersHow to Get Through the Product Management Bottleneck: As AI-assisted coding accelerates building software products, deciding what to build is a new bottleneck. Speedy decisions and empathy for users can get past it.The invention of modern writing instruments like the typewriter made writing easier, but they also led to the rise of writer’s block, where deciding what to write became the bottleneck.Jul 16, 2025LettersHow The U.S. “One Big Beautiful Bill” Will Shape AI Regulation: State-by-state regulation of AI will create a shifting patchwork of laws that are likely to hamper innovation even as they provide lesser benefits.Last week, the United States Congress passed President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” I’m disappointed it didn’t include a proposed moratorium on U.S. state-level AI regulation.Jul 9, 2025LettersShort of Time to Build With AI? Simplify Your Projects: Scale down your AI projects into something you can execute quickly. Then collect feedback from users to sharpen your ideas.I’d like to share a tip for getting more practice building with AI — that is, either using AI building blocks to build applications or using AI coding assistance to create powerful applications quickly.Jul 2, 2025LettersA Major Risk to AI Development Just Decreased: A U.S. federal judge ruled that training LLMs on copyrighted works is fair use. AI models are free to learn from books just like people are.On Monday, a United States District Court ruled that training LLMs on copyrighted books constitutes fair use.Jun 25, 2025LettersHigh-Skilled Immigration and International Students Are Good For the U.S. — And the World: Making H1-B and F-1 visas more difficult to get harms U.S. competitiveness in AI and innovation worldwide.One of the most effective things the U.S. or any other nation can do to ensure its competitiveness in AI is to welcome high-skilled immigration and international students who have the potential to become high-skilled.Jun 18, 2025LettersMeet The New Breed of GenAI Application Engineers: A new breed of software engineers is building more powerful applications faster than ever, thanks to generative AI. Here’s how to identify them in job interviews.There’s a new breed of GenAI Application Engineers who can build more-powerful applications faster than was possible before, thanks to generative AI.Jun 11, 2025Page 1 of 21Older PostsSubscribe to The BatchStay updated with weekly AI News and Insights delivered to your inboxCoursesThe BatchCommunityCareersAbout
