Securing Salesforce Integrations with Heroku AppLink
Sept 10 - by David Baliles
Improve your security model with Heroku AppLink, a managed bridge between Salesforce and Heroku that improves risk and governance.
Heroku Private Spaces: Isolated Apps and Data ServicesYour own private Heroku, delivered as a service.Contact Sales
What are Private Spaces?A Private Space, part of Heroku Enterprise, an enterprise cloud platform, is a network isolated group of apps and data services with a dedicated runtime environment, provisioned to Heroku in a geographic region you specify. With Private Spaces you can build modern apps on a secure application hosting platform with the powerful Heroku developer experience and enterprise-grade secure network topologies. This enables your Heroku applications to securely connect to on-premise systems on your corporate network and other cloud services, including Salesforce.
How Private Spaces work
See it in action
PrivateSpaces make it simple to bring all the pieces of your architecture together, from on-premise systems to cloud services, including Salesforce, into one managed Private Space that ensures sensitive data and transactions are protected. Postgres EX, Redis EX and Connect EX are unique versions of Heroku’s leading data services that have the additional security factor of being accessible only over a space’s private network.
PowerWithin a Space, you can use powerful new primitives to create new types of application architectures. Your app runs in private dynos, smart containers that are connected to a private network that lets them communicate with each other, so you can compose sophisticated application architectures using small, modular services. Setting up a space is as easy as naming it and clicking a button — in minutes your space is created so your team can stay focused on building great apps.
PerformanceEach Private Space has its own runtime dedicated to only your Heroku apps, ensuring even your highest traffic apps deliver low latency performance for every user. Your enterprise cloud platform Private Space can be deployed to a geographical region you specify to bring your Heroku apps and services closer to your users, further reducing latency. Apps in spaces run on private dynos — smart containers that fully occupy and get the performance benefit of an entire virtual compute instance.
