Eshant DasPlaced at GeeksforGeeksAs a newbie in the field of Data Science, Python, and Machine Learning, this course was extremely helpful to me in a variety of ways. First, it was so easy to understand that I was able to write fluently in a basic level python course. Secondly, the questions that were provided with each section really helped me to gain confidence. The order in which the course was aligned is fantastic
I found it to be incredibly simple to understand the theory, and I was also able to answer questions based on data science thanks to that course. Mentors gives an extremely engrossing introduction to all facets of machine learning.

Great thanks to GeeksforGeeks for quality content, your Data Science live course is awesome, especially thanks to Sandeep Jain for great content.
HarshPlaced at Marvell In this course I was able to understand all the concepts clearly and also I did projects which helped me to get hands on practice on language and tools.ABDULLAH FAZILIPlaced at GeeksforGeeksBefore joining the Geeks for Geeks "Data Science live" course, I had only a basic knowledge of python. But after joining the live classes I acquired all the required skills from mentors who are real-life industry experts. They gave me the confidence I needed to work on the projects and how you'll turn boring raw data into something valuable using various libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, etc. The best aspect of my course is the material offered by geeks for geeks, and the journey goes from basic to intermediate to advanced level. It helped me plenty. I expressed my gratitude towards the GeeksforGeeks family, in particular to Arpit Jain Sir, who was so nice as to answer all of our queries patiently.View More TestimonialsFrequently Asked Questions01 What are the benefits of a machine learning and data science program? 02 How can a machine learning and data science program help me advance my career? 03 What career opportunities are available after completing a machine learning and data science program? 04 How will these classes be conducted? 05 Is there any number to contact for query? 06
