But the streamer has quietly pulled the series from its release slate and it’s not clear if or when it will now debut.Based on Andrea Stanley’s 2019 Cosmopolitan article “Is It Possible to Stop a Mass Shooting Before It Happens?”, The Savant follows as investigator Jodi Goodwin (Jessica Chastain) infiltrates an online group of US extremists who are planning a deadly terror attack. Shown in a trailer for the series released last month, Chastain’s character specializes in hunting down snipers, would-be bombers, and people who intend to commit acts of “serious violence.” She does not know what kind of plan her latest target is working on, but she’s certain that he is “out to make a statement.”It is not entirely clear what prompted Apple’s decision to suddenly pull The Savant from its previously announced premiere date. But in a statement to Deadline, the streamer said that it does still plan to release the show at an unspecified time in the future.“After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone The Savant,” Apple said. “We appreciate your understanding and look forward to releasing the series at a future date.” (Apple gave no comment when we followed up for more information.)The Savant’s postponement comes just days after the shooting of Charlie Kirk and Disney’s initial decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! off the air after its host made a joke about President Donald Trump’s response to the deadly event. It seems more than coincidental that The Savant’s subject matter focuses on similar situations surrounding political violence.Given how swiftly the Trump-appointed FCC Chairman Brendan Carr began threatening Disney-owned ABC and its affiliate TV stations for commenting on the Kirk shooting, Apple might have pulled The Savant to preemptively avoid ruffling any feathers. But considering how much of a problem domestic terrorism actually is in the US — a point The Savant’s trailer emphasizes very strongly — the show’s topicality isn’t likely to fade away anytime soon.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Charles Pulliam-MooreCloseCharles Pulliam-MooreFilm & TV ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Charles Pulliam-MooreAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechTV ShowsCloseTV ShowsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TV ShowsMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
