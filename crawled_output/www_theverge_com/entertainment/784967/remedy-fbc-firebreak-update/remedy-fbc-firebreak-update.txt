Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.Things haven’t started out so well for FBC: Firebreak, Remedy’s multiplayer spinoff of its Control universe. When it launched in June there were complaints about repetitive gameplay and a lack of Remedy-style narrative flourishes. In a launch week update, the studio admitted that “Several things have gone well. Clearly, not everything has.” Now Remedy has detailed a major, free update that aims to fix some of those problems.It’s called “Breakpoint” and it’s launching on all platforms on September 29th. According to Remedy, “this update is more than just new content — it’s a refresh of how the core game is played.”RelatedRemedy is in controlFirst up is a revamp of the job board, which is now known as the crisis board. Here’s how Remedy explains the change:The new Crisis Board replaces the old Job Board and presents curated Crises to play, making FBC: Firebreak feel more dynamic, less predictable, and closer to its first-responder fantasy.At any given time, 4-6 Crises are active globally, ranging from full runs to shorter Jobs or Corrupted Jobs, each with randomized rewards, objectives, and length. The Crisis Board refreshes every 30 minutes.Crises in Zones 1-2 have streamlined requirements and can occasionally swap in unique Alternative Objectives for added variety. The Quick Reinforce feature lets you jump into active runs to help other teams.And to deal with the lack-of-variety issue, Firebreak is getting five new enemy types, six new weapons (three grenades, three heavy weapons), and a total of 27 gun mods to add further customization. Perhaps most notable is a new mission called “Outbreak,” in which “a Mold infestation creates unique challenges, enemies, and a dangerous new condition.”There are a handful of other changes to the experience. Yesterday Remedy detailed more simplified economy and progression systems, and the studio says the onboarding has been improved as well with, among other things, a new tutorial level.Whether or not these changes are enough remains to be seen, but the studio has further changes planned as well. An update in November will add a new game mode and cross-platform voice chat, and a third major update is expected in March. “We hope that these changes and additions make FBC: Firebreak more welcoming to new players while deepening the challenge and customization for veterans,” Remedy says.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew WebsterCloseAndrew WebsterSenior entertainment editorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew WebsterEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Logitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersYou can now upgrade a retro Casio watch with Bluetooth, step tracking, and gamesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
