While iPhone owners have a smaller pool of new devices to pick from when it’s time to upgrade, there’s a wider range of choices on Android. Some Android phones even fold in half! Imagine.On the flip side, all that choice can make for some hard decisions. Here’s where I’d like to help; I’ve tested a whole boatload of recent Android phones, and I think there are some real winners in the current batch. It’s all a matter of what you’re looking for, what you’re comfortable spending, and what your definition of a “reasonably sized phone” is. (I have my own, personally.)RelatedThe best phone to buy right nowThe best budget smartphone you can buyThe best foldable phone you can buyAs you sift through the options, you’ll almost certainly come across tech’s favorite buzzphrase of the moment: AI. Generally speaking, AI has yet to really impress me on a phone. The Pixel 10 series has some useful features, including Magic Cue, which proactively aims to surface relevant information when you need it, and Galaxy devices can translate a phone call for you in real time. These things are nothing to sneeze at! But none of it feels like the platform shift that the big tech companies keep promising. Best not to put too much stock in any company’s AI claims just yet.What I’m looking forHow we test smartphonesCollapseThere’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.LongevityCollapseA great Android phone will go the distance. I look for signs that the hardware and software will keep up for many years to come, including a strong IP rating for dust and water resistance (IP68 is preferred), durable glass panels on the front and back, and a sturdy aluminum frame rather than plastic. Samsung and Google flagships now offer seven years of OS and security updates, which as awesome. As a bare minimum three years of Android OS version upgrades is preferred, along with a total of four or five years of security updates.A great screenCollapseThe best Android phones have plenty of resolution to cover their large display area, which means 1440p, ideally. A fast refresh rate of at least 120Hz is preferred — animations and scrolling look super smooth at that rate — and even better if it’s variable down to 1Hz to save on battery life.Quality camerasCollapseAny phone can take a decent photo in good lighting, but the best phone cameras can handle low light and high-contrast scenes well, too. I look for optical (most common) or sensor-shift (rare) image stabilization, which helps compensate for hand shake and enable slower shutter speeds in low light to gather more light. A telephoto lens is great to have too, though high-res sensors are starting to offer better lossless crop modes that mimic short zoom lenses well.Wireless chargingCollapseMost phones on this list offer wireless charging, though not all do. Lack of wireless charging isn’t a complete deal-breaker, but it’s becoming an essential feature for a lot of people since it’s convenient for charging many different kinds of devices.If you live in the US, I have some bad news about the Android market, though. For complicated reasons having to do with “capitalism” and “geopolitics,” we don’t get nearly as many of the options as you’ll find in Asia and Europe — brands like Huawei, Xiaomi, Honor, and Oppo just aren’t available here. I’ve limited this guide to the devices I’ve personally tested in depth; thus, it is a fairly US-centric set of recommendations.With that in mind, it’s also worth acknowledging that most people in the US get their phones “for free” from their wireless carrier. If you can manage it, buying a phone unlocked will give you the most flexibility and freedom if you end up wanting to change carriers in the near future. Phone manufacturers also offer financing and trade-in deals to make payment more manageable. But if you’re happy with your carrier and the free phone on offer is the one you really want, by all means, take the free phone. Just make sure you understand the terms, especially if you need to change plans to cash in on the deal.However you go about it, you have some fantastic options for your next Android phone.In this articleThe best Android phone overallThe best maximalist phoneThe best Android phone that isn’t hugeThe best lightweight big phoneThe best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to chargeThe best foldable phoneOther Android phones worth consideringWhat’s coming nextThe best Android phone overall8Verge ScoreGoogle Pixel 10 (128GB)$799$799The GoodQi2 wireless charging with magnets is greatAI is actually kind of useful, finallyTelephoto camera is a nice additionThe BadMain and ultrawide cameras aren’t quite as good as the ProBattery life is just okay$799 at Amazon$799 at Google$799 at Best BuyHow we rate and review productsScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Tensor G5 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 13-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,970mAh / Charging: 30W wired, 15W wireless / Weather resistance: IP68The Pixel 10 is Google’s latest take on the “just right” Android phone that introduces a few notable upgrades. For $799, you get a sharp 6.3-inch OLED screen, the same Tensor G5 chip found in the pricier Pro version, and Qi2 wireless charging with built-in magnets, no case required. The device is built to handle the day-to-day without a fuss, and the whole thing feels straightforward instead of flashy.RelatedThe Pixel 10 finally has Qi2. The magnets are the coolest part.Android’s splashy new paint job won’t yank Gen Z from iPhonesThis year, the Pixel 10 also adds a dedicated telephoto lens, a first for the non-Pro. Unfortunately, the main and ultrawide cameras are a step down from last year’s model. If you’re not scrutinizing every pixel or chasing low-light portraits, you’ll probably never notice. For regular photos, the Pixel 10 is great; it produces clean shots, solid performance, and enough versatility for the average user.Photo: Allison Johnson / The VergeWhat really sets the Pixel 10 apart, though, is how easy it is to use. AI features like Magic Cue are useful, proactively providing info without getting in the way. For example, it can surface a restaurant’s address or reservation details from your search history or confirmation email as you finalize plans over text. The phone runs cooler than previous versions and handles heavier workloads well, and it shrugs off dust and water. If you want an Android smartphone that doesn’t overcomplicate things, the Pixel 10 is an easy recommendation.Read our full Pixel 10 review.The best maximalist phone8Verge ScoreSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra$1048$130019% off$1048The GoodExcellent screenImproved ultrawide cameraRounded corners are comfierThe BadExpensiveBulkyAI is (still) hit or miss$1048 at Amazon (256GB)$1300 at Best Buy (256GB)$1300 at Samsung(256GB)How we rate and review productsScreen: 6.9-inch 1440p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel main with OIS, 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel ultrawide, 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 45W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) / Weather resistance: IP68There’s still no phone quite like the Ultra. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is Samsung’s latest answer to the question, “What if your phone had all of the features?” It’s equipped with two telephoto cameras, a built-in stylus, and a big, bright screen. Good luck finding that combination in another phone. Related: this is one of the most expensive slab-style phones you can buy.The newest edition of the Ultra comes with rounded corners and flat edges, making it more comfortable in your hand. But if you’re looking for significant year-over-year improvements to the Ultra formula outside of that, well, you won’t find much. Samsung’s focus has been on software features, which is to say AI features. But AI on Galaxy phones remains a mixed bag — it’s certainly not the paradigm shift Samsung wants us to think the S25 series represents.Photo: Allison Johnson / The VergeAll of that puts the Ultra in a place of slightly less distinction than previous versions. The biggest updates are software features available to the rest of the S25 series. The Ultra looks and feels more like other Galaxy phones this time around, too. More than ever, it’s hard to understand what Samsung means when it calls this phone “Ultra.” Still, it’s your best choice for a feature-packed Android phone — even if it’s not quite as ultra as it once was.Read my full Galaxy S25 Ultra review.The best Android phone that isn’t huge8Verge ScoreSamsung Galaxy S25 (128GB)$780$8003% off$780The GoodThe last reasonably sized Android phoneSeven years of OS upgradesVery good cameraThe BadSamsung software is as cluttered as usualAI is still a mixed bag$780 at Amazon$800 at Best Buy$800 at Samsung How we rate and review productsScreen: 6.2-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel main with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,000mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) / Weather-resistance rating: IP68Most people like a big phone, and I get that. I do. If you want a big Android phone, you have plenty of options in front of you. But some of us like a smaller phone — something that (kind of) fits in your pocket, or feels more comfortable in your hand. For us, there is but one option on Android: the Samsung Galaxy S25.That’s the regular S25, not the Plus, which is a fine big phone. But the standard S25 is basically the last of its kind: a full-featured phone with a 6.2-inch screen. It’s not small, but it’s not huge, and we’ll have to take what we can get. And it’s a darn good phone that keeps up with the bigger devices in all the important ways: the battery goes all day, it comes with plenty of RAM, and it even has a real telephoto lens — not something you get on a basic, 6.1-inch phone on, say, iOS.Photo: Allison Johnson / The VergeThe Galaxy S25 isn’t just a good, small-ish phone by default. It’s reliable, durable, and comes with the promise of seven years of OS updates. It’s not my pick for the overall best Android phone because Samsung software can be a bit much, but if you’re comfortable in the Samsung ecosystem and you just want a phone that fits in your dang pocket, then this is the one to go with.RelatedSamsung finally made the foldables we’ve been asking forSamsung says its trifold phone should launch ‘this year’Read my full Galaxy S25 review.The best lightweight big phone8Verge ScoreSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge$700$110036% off$700The GoodLike a regular phone, but slimSurprisingly lightweightBattery life isn’t as bad as I fearedThe BadNo telephoto cameraBattery life not as strong as a standard phone$700 at Amazon (256GB)$970 at Best Buy (512GB)$820 at Amazon (512GB)How we rate and review productsScreen: 6.7-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel f/1.7 main camera with OIS, 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, 12-megapixel f/2.2 selfie / Battery: 3,900mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready) / Weather-resistance rating: IP68Big phones have a tendency to, well, look and feel big. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, on the other hand, is different. Thanks to its slim, lightweight design, the device provides a welcome reprieve from the countless chunky, heavy alternatives. It’s thinner and lighter than the Galaxy S25 Plus, making it the big phone you can actually slide into your pocket or evening bag without it protruding out.So, what’s the catch? The S25 Edge’s battery life is fine. Not great, not terrible, but somewhere straight down the middle. To be fair, it held up admirably during a particularly strenuous workday, one complete with hours of screen time, mobile hotspotting, and live blogging, making it to bedtime with battery to spare. It also lacks a dedicated telephoto lens, though it does feature the same 200-megapixel main camera found in the S25 Ultra.Compared to the S25 Plus (left) the difference is noticeable, but you feel the impact once you pick the phone up. Photo: Allison Johnson / The VergeEven with those compromises, the S25 Edge is a very capable phone that offers similar performance and durability to other devices in the S25 lineup. You’ll just have to be a little more aware of battery life as the day goes on; however, unless you’re frequently streaming video or playing graphics-intensive games throughout the day, the noticeably thinner, lighter design offers a nice change of pace.Read our Galaxy S25 Edge review.The best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge8Verge ScoreOnePlus 13$980$900-9% off$980The GoodExcellent battery lifeSix years of security updatesStrong IP rating for dust and water resistanceThe BadBig phone is bigNot as many OS updates as Google and Samsung offer$980 at Amazon (12GB RAM / 256GB ROM)$900 at Best Buy (16GB RAM / 512GB ROM)$930 at Amazon (16GB RAM / 512GB ROM)How we rate and review productsScreen: 6.82-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.6 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired, 50W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 and IP69There are plenty of good reasons to consider the OnePlus 13. It has a big, beautiful screen, and costs a hundred bucks less than the Galaxy S25 Plus. Its dust and water resistance is so strong you could practically use the phone in a hurricane without consequences. And its camera system is much improved year over year, particularly when it comes to low-light portraiture. But there’s one standout reason to consider the 13: impatience.This vegan leather back panel is so nice. Photo: Allison Johnson / The VergeThe OnePlus 13 offers enough battery stamina to get through two days of moderate use on a single charge — and that’s with plenty of power-draining features enabled, including the always-on display. If you’re thriftier with your charge, it could even go beyond that. Forgot to charge overnight? No big deal; you can probably just charge it up on night two. Charging is also relatively fast, and in the US, the phone comes with an 80W wired charger in the box. So even if you do need a midday top-off, you’ll be able to get hours of charge in a matter of minutes. No other flagship phone offers that kind of charging (or not charging) flexibility.RelatedOnePlus Pad 3 arrives with Snapdragon 8 Elite insideOnePlus’ new ‘small’ phone isn’t coming to the US, but its AI features areRead my full OnePlus 13 review.The best foldable phone8Verge ScoreSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7$1700$200015% off$1700The GoodRidiculously slim and light for a foldableAll-day battery with moderate useOuter screen finally feels normalThe BadIt’s $2,000Durability still a concernCamera bump makes it wobble on a table$1700 at Amazon (256GB)$1700 at Best Buy (256GB)$1700 at Samsung (512GB)How we rate and review productsScreen: 8-inch, 1968p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.5-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 4,400mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather resistance: IP48Does anyone truly need a folding phone? Probably not, especially one as expensive as the Galaxy Z Fold 7. But there’s no question that it’s the nicest book-style foldable we’ve used to date. Instead of the long and narrow form factor of older Fold series devices, Samsung reworked the Fold 7’s proportions to feature an outer screen with a 21:9 aspect ratio. The change — along with a thinner frame — makes the device feel more like a standard slab-style device than ever.RelatedThe Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first fully dust-resistant foldableSamsung says its trifold phone should launch ‘this year’Open the Fold 7 up, and you get a spacious inner display that’s perfect for multitasking and gaming. Being able to watch YouTube videos on one half of the screen and take notes in the other half is incredibly useful. That said, the hinge can feel stiff when opening the phone, almost like you’re prying it open. The Fold 7 also features one of the largest camera bumps we’ve encountered in a phone, making the device sit crooked on flat surfaces. That’s one of the compromises you make with such a thin foldable.The outer display’s reworked proportions make it feel like a normal slab-style phone. Image: Allison Johnson / The VergeMeanwhile, factors like outer screen sharpness, camera system quality, durability, and battery life all fall short of what you get from the more affordable Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. That said, if you’re looking for something more than a traditional slab-style device, you won’t find a better, more luxurious foldable.Read our full Galaxy Z Fold 7 review.Other Android phones worth consideringThere are many more great Android devices that weren’t covered here, and a few are worth calling out that didn’t quite make the cut for a recommendation.The OnePlus Open is also another good book-style foldable option. It’s thin and light, and the software includes some thoughtful approaches to multitasking — a crucial part of the folding phone experience. But it won’t be supported with software updates for as long as the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Read our review.Speaking of OnePlus, the company also offers the OnePlus 13R, a midrange phone with a big 6.78-inch OLED display and enough battery life to carry you through two full days on a single charge. That said, the $599 handset lacks wireless charging and full water resistance, both of which can be found on other budget-friendly phones for less. Read our review.The Google Pixel 9A comes with some small but important updates over the 8A, including more robust water resistance and a slightly bigger, brighter screen. Better yet, those improvements don’t come with a price bump. With seven years of OS updates included, that’s a strong ROI. Read our review.The Nothing Phone 3 is billed by the brand as its “first true flagship phone,” with a $799 starting price that competes directly with the iPhone 17, Galaxy S25, and Pixel 10. It boasts a 6.67-inch OLED display, a generous 5,150mAh capacity battery, and a Snapdragon 8S Gen 4 chipset, which is on the lower end of the flagship spectrum. It also looks different from previous Nothing devices. Instead of the iconic light strips on the back that glow and flash, the Nothing 3 features a small dot-matrix LED display that can show pictures and icons. Read our review.The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is Samsung’s other new foldable device. Unlike previous Flip series devices, the company’s latest flip phone ditches the file folder-shaped look for a 4.1-inch, edge-to-edge display that wraps around the cameras. The larger screen is a joy to use, making it much easier to quickly respond to texts and manage full apps. While the design is a big upgrade, the device still offers no protection against fine particles like dust or sand, raising concerns about how the device will hold up over time. Read our review.The Pixel 9 Pro Fold was our previous pick for the best foldable phone, and it remains a great option for anyone looking to jump into the foldable market. Like the Z Fold 7, it offers a more slab-style form factor when it’s closed and a spacious inner screen when it’s open. As great as it is, the 9 Pro Fold has a slightly downgraded camera system compared to other Pixel 9 devices. There’s also no formal dust resistance, so even a small amount of dust has the potential to cause significant damage to the hinge. Read our review.The Pixel 10 Pro is Google’s most refined flagship yet, and a great showcase for the Android ecosystem. It features a premium design and big hardware upgrades over its predecessor, like a Tensor G5 chip and Qi2 wireless charging with built-in magnets. It also offers genuinely useful AI features, and the camera’s portrait mode is much improved over its predecessor. However, while the 10 Pro’s battery capacity is a bit larger this time around (4,870mAh versus 4,700mAh), the battery life is just okay. We’re also feeling uneasy about generative AI being inside the camera app. Read our review.What’s coming nextThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold has an IP68 rating, making it the first foldable to offer full water and dust resistance. The device also features Google’s new Tensor G5 processor, Pixelsnap wireless charging, and improved inner and outer displays. However, it doesn’t offer better camera hardware — the Fold’s sensors are smaller than what you get in Google’s slab-style Pro phones. You can preorder the base Pixel 10 Pro Fold with 256GB of storage at Amazon, Best Buy, and Google starting at $1,799, with a release to come on Thursday, October 9th.
