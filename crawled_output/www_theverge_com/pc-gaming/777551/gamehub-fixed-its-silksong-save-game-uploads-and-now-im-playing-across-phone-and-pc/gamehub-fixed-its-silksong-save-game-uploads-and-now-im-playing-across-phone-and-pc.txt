He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.The circle is now complete: you can install your Steam copy of Hollow Knight Silksong on an Android phone, play it with your automatically downloaded Steam save games — and today, as of the new GameHub 5.0.4 update, you can easily upload your phone savegame back to Steam to resume on PC.To get save to sync to begin with, you’ll need to flick GameHub out of a “lightweight” Steam mode and pick a numbered version instead. Find it in GameHub under Silksong > hit the three-dot button > PC Game Settings > Steam.To make sure you trigger an upload when you’ve finished, swipe the right edge of the screen left, hit the gear icon and pick Exit. It should say it’s uploading your save to Steam, and it shouldn’t take very long at all before the game exits.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Sean HollisterCloseSean HollisterSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Sean HollisterGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPC GamingClosePC GamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PC GamingMore in this streamSee allMicrosoft and Asus open Xbox Ally preorders — the X costs $999Sean Hollister4 minutes agoBaldur’s Gate 3 now has a native Steam Deck build.Jay PetersSep 23Is this the smallest eGPU yet?
