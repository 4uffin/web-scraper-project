Nintendo announced that the platform will be coming to its collection of retro games available to Switch Online subscribers, and will be available on both the Switch and Switch 2.The twist is that in order to play these games you’ll need a dedicated headset accessory, which looks just like the original hardware, but lets you slot in the Switch (or Switch 2) tablet for viewing the games. A cardboard model will also be available, which sounds similar to the Labo VR headset. The main headset accessory will cost $99.99 according to Nintendo, while the cardboard version will be $24.99.A total of 14 games will be available through the service, including the likes of Mario Tennis and Tetris. Nintendo says they’ll be available starting February 17th, though the 14 games will be launching over time.Update: added official pricing from Nintendo’s site.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew WebsterCloseAndrew WebsterSenior entertainment editorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew WebsterEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsNintendoCloseNintendoPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NintendoMore in this streamSee allFight for glory in Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave coming to the Switch 2 next yearAsh ParrishSep 12Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s first DLC will take you to the Mega DimensionCharles Pulliam-MooreSep 12Go even more bananas.Andrew WebsterSep 12Most PopularMost PopularAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USAnker’s latest sleep buds can silence snoringWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxRepublicans’ political purge is just getting startedWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
