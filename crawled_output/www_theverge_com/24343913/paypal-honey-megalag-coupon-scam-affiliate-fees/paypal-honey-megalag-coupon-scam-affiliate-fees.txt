As MegaLag’s video tells it, Honey takes that credit by swapping its tracking cookie in for others’ when you interact with it.The company has issued statements saying that it follows “industry rules and practices” like last-click attribution.

But in a video published this weekend, YouTuber MegaLag claims the extension is a “scam” and that Honey has been “stealing money from influencers, including the very ones they paid to promote their product.”Honey works by popping up an offer to find coupon codes for you while you’re checking out in an online shop. But as MegaLag notes, it frequently fails to find a code, or offers a Honey-branded one, even if a simple internet search will cover something better. The Honey website’s pitch is that it will “find every working promo code on the internet.” But according to MegaLag’s video, ignoring better deals is a feature of Honey’s partnerships with its retail clients.Read Article >Most PopularMost PopularLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
