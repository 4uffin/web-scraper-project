He previously wrote for Business Insider, Rolling Stone, Futurism, and Popular Science.Remedy Entertainment is one of the few game studios that’s seemingly been doing well in an industry where its competition is downsizing and console makers are continually raising hardware prices. The studio turned 30 on August 18th, and Humble is celebrating with a 10-item bundle for $27 ($211 off the full MSRP). To put the price into perspective, Alan Wake 2 Deluxe Edition, one of the included games, currently retails for $69.99 in the Epic Games Store. You can also choose a bundle that costs $5 or $12 but includes fewer games, and each is available until October 10th.Remedy 30th Anniversary Bundle$5$5$5 at Humble (four-game bundle)$12 at Humble (eight-game bundle)$27 at Humble (10-game bundle)While Alan Wake 2 Deluxe Edition is the standout game in the bunch — and a Verge favorite from 2023 — you’ll also get a mix of classics, including 2002’s Max Payne and a 2012 remake of 1996’s Death Rally, which was initially released for MS-DOS. You’ll also get a 25 percent off coupon for FBC: Firebreak, Remedy’s latest title. If you don’t want to jump into Alan Wake 2, a remastered version of the original game and the standalone side story Alan Wake’s American Nightmare are also included. Playing the games in order will allow you to witness how the studio has progressed, including popularizing the bullet time game mechanic with Max Payne and the psychological horror genre with the Alan Wake series.RelatedSteam is dropping Windows 32-bit support in 2026Seven indie games that will upgrade your downtime this fallFBC: Firebreak is missing Control’s weird charmIf you pick up the bundle, you’ll receive a mix of Steam keys and Epic Games Store keys, which can be redeemed on their respective platforms. All of the games run on Windows, and some titles are playable on the Steam Deck, which is currently 20 percent off from Steam in its entry-level LCD configuration. Part of the proceeds from your purchase even support Save the Children — an organization that provides health, education, and protection programs for children across 113 countries — in addition to the publishers and Humble.
