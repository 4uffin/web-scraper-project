That’s because Samsung’s gorgeous, Bluetooth-enabled Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is cheaper than ever at Woot through September 19th. It’s down to $359.99 ($140 off), nearly matching the price of the $349.99 Galaxy Watch 8. Not a bad discount for a watch that came out fewer than two months ago.Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (Bluetooth)$360$50028% off$360Samsung’s latest smartwatch features a new squircle design, Gemini, and some new health features like an Antioxidant Index and Running Coach. The Classic model adds a premium design complete with a rotating bezel, an extra customizable button, and longer battery life.Read More$360 at WootThe Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is our top pick for Samsung phone owners, particularly if you’re upgrading from a Galaxy Watch 5 or earlier. The Classic model builds on the Galaxy Watch 8’s improvements with a more stylish and premium design, plus longer battery life, and the return of the beloved rotating bezel. It also inherits the Galaxy Watch Ultra’s Quick Button, which you can customize to launch your favorite app or workout.Beyond that, it’s identical to the Galaxy Watch 8, offering a thin squircle design that’s more comfortable to wear than its predecessor without sacrificing battery life. It monitors your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and can even take an EKG or detect sleep apnea when paired with a Samsung Galaxy phone. The wearable also debuts Running Coach, our favorite new fitness feature which tests your performance and creates a personalized workout plan based on your results. Plus, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic can even recommend your optimal bedtime based on your circadian rhythm and gauge your fruits and vegetables intake, though admittedly not always reliably.RelatedI tried Gemini on the Pixel Watch — here’s what it’s likeOn the smarts side, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic ships with One UI 8 Watch, which adds Google Gemini. You can ask it for nearby coffee shop recommendations, to send Slack messages, create playlists, and more. Given that it’s still early days for Gemini, results can be mixed, but hopefully it continues to improve.Unfortunately, the wearable only comes in a 46mm size, which might be too big for your taste. Still, if you’re a Samsung phone owner looking for a premium wearable, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is one of the best options available, especially now that it costs about the same as the standard model.Read our Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 review.A few more deals to wrap up the weekThe tiny Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go is available at Amazon for $22.99 ($11 off), which is $3 shy of its all-time low. This colorful Bluetooth speaker offers good value for the price, with an IPX67 waterproof rating and the ability to float in water. It can last up to 20 hours on a single charge, and can produce stereo sound when paired with another Select 4 Go.Whisker’s Litter Robot 4 is on sale with a three-year warranty for $699 ($100) directly from the company’s website. The litter box essentially cleans itself after it has been used, rotating to dump waste into a drawer, and sending alerts when it needs to be emptied. It also helps neutralize unwanted odors and is suitable for up to four cats per unit. Plus, the companion app lets you monitor your cat’s weight, track litter and waste drawer levels, and more.You can grab the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 for $199.99 at Amazon, Walmart, and Target, which is a great deal even if it’s $20 shy of their all-time low. The fitness-centric earbuds are some of the best on the market, offering heart rate monitoring (move over, AirPods Pro 3), secure ear hooks for intense workouts, and IPX4 water resistance. They also deliver great active noise cancellation, a natural-sounding transparency mode, and native support for some Android and Apple features like automatic device switching.
