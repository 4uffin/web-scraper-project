Screenshot: Dominic Preston / The VergeOnePlus has revealed a few details about its next flagship phone at a Qualcomm event in China: it’ll be called the OnePlus 15, and it will come with Qualcomm’s freshly announced Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset and a 165Hz refresh rate display.You didn’t blink and miss the OnePlus 14, if you’re wondering about that. The OnePlus 13 will be succeeded by the OnePlus 15, likely to avoid including a “4” in the product name — bad luck in Chinese culture. It’ll pair nicely with the 8 Elite Gen 5 name, which follows the Snapdragon 8 Elite. It all makes sense somehow.The company showed off a black version of the OnePlus 15 on stage at Qualcomm’s second Snapdragon Summit in China, revealing that it looks less like the 13 and more like the 13T, also known as the 13S in India. It shares that phone’s rounded square camera island, and is likely to similarly drop the alert slider in favor of a customizable shortcut button.Aside from the chipset, refresh rate, and name, we also know that the OnePlus 15 will be the company’s first flagship for a few years without Hasselblad-branded camera processing. CEO Pete Lau recently announced that the two brands would be ending their five-year partnership, though confusingly, parent company Oppo will keep working with Hasselblad. But OnePlus is striking out on its own with a new image processing technology it calls the DetailMax Engine. I dunno, names are hard, I guess.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Allison JohnsonCloseAllison JohnsonPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Allison JohnsonDominic PrestonCloseDominic PrestonNews EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Dominic PrestonMobileCloseMobilePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MobileNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsOnePlusCloseOnePlusPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All OnePlusTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
