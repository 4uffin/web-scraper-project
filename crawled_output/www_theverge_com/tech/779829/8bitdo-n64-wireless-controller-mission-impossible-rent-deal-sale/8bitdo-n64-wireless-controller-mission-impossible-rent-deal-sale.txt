The Analogue 3D, a console made to display N64 games in 4K, has had its release window pushed multiple times. That frustrated me for a while because I wanted to get my hands on 8BitDo’s slick 64 Bluetooth controller that was made to go along with the console. Its release was likely planned to coincide with the console, but the controller finally launched just a couple months ago. The white version is down to $27.69 at Amazon, which is a hefty 31 percent off its original $39.99 price.8BitDo 64 Bluetooth controller$28$4030% off$28$28 at Amazon (white)$40 at Amazon (black)The 8BitDo 64 can also be wirelessly connected to a Switch or Switch 2, coming in handy for Nintendo 64 games that you can play if you have a Nintendo Switch Online plus Expansion Pack subscription. It’s one of a few controllers out there that gives you the same set of buttons as the original N64 controller (A, B, and directional C buttons on the right-hand side), but with some modern tweaks to the layout and feature set. The sole analog stick has a Hall effect sensor and is located on the left-hand side, with a D-pad beneath it. Also, the Z button is on both sides of the trigger grips. The controller supports rumble and a turbo function.The 8BitDo 64 is also compatible with Windows and Android via Bluetooth or via a USB-C wired connection. If you wind up eventually buying an Analogue 3D whenever it releases, you’ll need a controller like this one because the console doesn’t include one.RelatedAmazon’s October Prime Day sale is happening on October 7thOther Verge-approved dealsI’ve been seeing emails in my inbox every week about how RTX 50-series GPUs are in stock at many retailers, but the bigger news is that stock is apparently so plentiful that we’re seeing deals worth sharing. Whether you have a small form factor desktop build or not, the Asus Prime RTX 5070 Ti graphics card with a triple-fan setup takes up just 2.5 slots in your case, making it a compact option if you’re trying to keep your components neatly tucked. This model debuted at $829.99, but for the past couple of weeks it has been available for $749.99 at Amazon and Best Buy. I put this model to the test during my days at Polygon (RIP), and it was a huge upgrade for me, as someone who previously used an RTX 3070 Ti that was held back by other outdated components.Phone and tablet accessories company Lisen makes an iPad stand that can let your screen rotate 360 degrees, making it a handy addition in the kitchen, the tool bench, or anywhere you need to do some work. It’s $15.19 for Prime members right now — a small discount from its original $15.99 price — but the code MFY2E8L7 will knock the cost down to $8.96 before tax (a tip of the hat to Slickdeals for surfacing this deal). Beyond rotating 360 degrees, the stand portion can adjust to multiple angles as needed, going as low at 15 degrees that makes the tablet close to parallel with a flat surface, or up to 75 degrees, which seems good for entertainment purposes.Those of us who have been patiently waiting for Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning to be available to rent can now pay just $6.99 to watch the film on services like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, and Fandango. I missed it in the theater, and after recently paying $20 to buy the Jeff Buckley documentary, It’s Never Over, I figured I’d wait until The Final Reckoning got cheaper to view. It took longer than expected to be rentable, but now I know what I’m doing this weekend. If you’d rather buy it, the film got a $7 discount on platforms, dropping to $12.99.Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
