He previously wrote for Business Insider, Rolling Stone, Futurism, and Popular Science.Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 FE were released earlier this month for $149.99. The company hasn’t yet knocked down the price, but it’s including a free Galaxy SmartTag 2 at Amazon. The bundle saves you $30 and is available until September 28th. Samsung says both items may ship separately, so don’t worry if you receive one before the other. We haven’t tested the earbuds yet, but they’re in the same family as Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which we reviewed very highly when they were released last year.Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE (with Galaxy SmartTag2)$150$18017% off$150$150 at AmazonThe Galaxy Buds 3 FE are Samsung’s latest pair of noise-canceling true wireless earbuds. The company says they have a bass-forward sound, last up to six hours with ANC enabled, and offer a total of 24 hours of listening time including its battery case. Turning noise cancellation off will bump those numbers up to eight-and-a-half and 30 hours respectively. The earbuds have an IPx4 rating, which means they’re resistant to damage from sweat or splashes of water, though Samsung recommends drying the earbuds and your hands thoroughly if they’re wet.If you have a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, the earbuds support an easy pairing mode, and allow you to switch between your phone and a Galaxy Tablet or Galaxy Book easily. The earbuds will connect to any other device via Bluetooth. You can use the earbuds to access Google Gemini hands free if you have a supported device, and get real-time translations via Samsung’s Galaxy AI.RelatedHere are 25 great deals you can snag ahead of Amazon’s fall Prime Day eventSamsung’s Galaxy SmartTag2 is a Bluetooth and Ultra Wideband tracker that allows you to locate your lost item using Samsung’s SmartThings Find app. It’s only compatible with Galaxy devices, so be mindful if you use an iPhone. Samsung says its tracker can last up to one and a half years per charge, and has an IP67 rating, which means it should be able to handle being fully submerged under water without being damaged. Its built-in loop makes it easy to attach to a backpack or other item using a carabiner if you don’t want to keep it in an inside pocket.Three more great dealsGovee is offering a two pack of its Outdoor UpDown Wall Lights for $199.99 ($30 off) at Amazon exclusively for Prime members. Both wall-mountable smart lights have an IP66 rating, which means they shouldn’t be damaged by heavy rain. Govee says they can be used in temperatures between -4 and 113 degrees Fahrenheit, so you can keep them outside year-round. Each light has four customizable sections, which can be set to one of 16 million colors. The Outdoor UPDown Wall Lights support Matter, and can be controlled via Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Govee’s Home App.We’re big fans of mechanical keyboards at The Verge, which is why I’m smitten by 8BitDo’s N Edition Retro 18 Mechanical Numpad, which is $34.90 ($10 off) at Amazon. The 18-key wireless number pad takes aesthetic inspiration from the NES, and can be connected to your computer via Bluetooth or an included 2.4GHz USB dongle. It can also be used as a standalone calculator if you want to use it without a PC. 8Bitdo offers the number pad in three other styles, which are all 10 percent off at checkout. Blink’s second-generation Video Doorbell with Sync Module Core is down to $34.99 ($35 off), a new all-time low price at Amazon, Best Buy, and The Home Depot. The 1440p doorbell cam has a 150 degree field of view and 1:1 aspect ratio, so you should be able to see a full person or keep an eye on your porch. Paying for an optional Blink Subscription Plan ($3 per month or $30 per year) adds person detection and unlimited cloud storage for video clips recorded in the past 60 days. Blink’s latest video doorbell runs on three AA batteries, and Blink says it can last up to two years before they need to be replaced. The included sync module is required to use the doorbell cam.The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
