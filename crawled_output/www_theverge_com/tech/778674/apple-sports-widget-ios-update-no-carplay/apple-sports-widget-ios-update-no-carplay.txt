The good news is that Apple Sports now has an iOS widget that can be used on your homescreen. The bad news is that you can’t use it in iOS 26’s new CarPlay widgets feature.The Apple Sports widget shows upcoming fixtures for your favorite teams, or live scores if your team is currently playing a game. It’s now one of the only free sports apps on iOS that incorporates all of Apple’s latest features, including Live Activities support for seeing scores on your lockscreen or in CarPlay, without ads getting in the way.The new Apple Sports widget. Screenshot by Tom Warren / The VergeI was really hoping Apple would make its widget work on the new iOS 26 CarPlay widgets panel, particularly because Apple Sports supports a wide variety of sports and not just soccer. While I could use iOS 26’s new Live Activities feature in CarPlay, it’s only available in the CarPlay Dashboard, and not inside the new widgets panel.The new widgets panel is great homescreen-like interface for CarPlay, and it’s far less cluttered than the typical dashboard UI. I could also use third-party apps like FotMob, but that’s limited to just soccer when I want to see tennis, Formula 1, and other sports as well as the NFL and soccer.Alongside the new widget, Apple Sports is also getting more soccer with the addition of leagues including the Bundesliga 2, Ligue 2, Primeira Liga, Segunda División, and Serie B; other teams and leagues have also been added from Austria, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.If you have any good recommendations for sports apps on iOS that support Live Activities and CarPlay widgets, please respond in the comments section. I’m also looking out for any other interesting CarPlay widgets that are available thanks to iOS 26.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Tom WarrenCloseTom WarrenSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tom WarrenAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleAppsCloseAppsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USThe foldable iPhone might look like two iPhone Airs stuck togetherThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
