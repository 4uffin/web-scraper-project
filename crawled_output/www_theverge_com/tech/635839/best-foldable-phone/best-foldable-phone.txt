They’re generally heavier, pricier, and have less capable cameras than a standard slab-style phone. And while they’re far less fragile than when they first debuted, foldables are still susceptible to the kind of damage a regular smartphone can shrug off. You really don’t want any dust getting in that hinge. But if you’re an adventurous sort of gadget lover, then a folding phone is a rewarding investment.There are basically two kinds of foldables at the moment — the kind that fold like books and the ones that fold clamshell style, like your old flip phone. Here’s how I think of it: a book-style foldable is like a phone plus a tablet, and a flip-style foldable is a phone plus a smartwatch. The book foldables provide an outer screen for all your regular phone needs, and then a tablet-like inner screen when you want, well, more screen. Flip phones come with a smaller secondary display on the outer panel that’s useful for checking information quickly. When you need to do regular phone stuff, you unfold it.What I’m looking forHow we test phonesCollapseThere’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.Top-notch software supportCollapseThe phones listed here have powerful processors and enough RAM to keep up for years, so it’s fair to expect more than a handful of OS updates throughout the life of your phone. Four years of new OS versions and five years of security updates is a healthy benchmark for this class, and many of the phones here meet or exceed that standard.A fantastic cameraCollapseMost phone cameras can perform well in good lighting conditions, from the flagship class down to $300 budget phones. The devices listed here offer a little something extra, like a useful telephoto lens, a great portrait mode, or impressive low-light shooting — and many include all three. Stabilization for the main camera unit to help in low light is a must in this category.Best-in-class build qualityCollapseMost modern foldables carry an IP48 rating, meaning they’re built to withstand full water immersion and solid particles 1mm or bigger. Devices with an IP48 rating aren’t fully protected from dust, however, which remains a concern when it comes to long-term durability. The good news is that the foldable market may be turning a corner; Google’s upcoming Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first foldable to carry an IP68 rating, making it fully water and dust-resistant.ValueCollapseIn addition to the best devices at any price, I look for phones that offer the best mix of must-have features for good prices. That might lead to a recommendation of a lower-tier model if it’s particularly feature-rich for its price or last year’s model if it’s still sold new and this year’s device doesn’t offer many upgrades.So while they all fit in one category of folding tech, they’re suited to two very different kinds of people — someone who wants even more phone with their phone and someone who wants to be fully immersed a little less. Whichever category you fit into, you’d be wise to get the manufacturer’s extended warranty with your purchase; fixes can be expensive, and you won’t be able to walk into just any phone repair shop to get them. If you don’t opt for the warranty, you’ll want to be sure you can comfortably afford to replace your phone in the event of a sudden sand-related catastrophe. Death can come swiftly to a folding screen.RelatedThe best phone to buy right nowThe best budget smartphone you can buyThe best Android phonesIf I haven’t scared you off by this point, then you’re probably the kind of person who will have a heck of a good time with a foldable. I’ve used every phone under the sun, and folding phones are some of my favorite gadgets. Run four apps at once! Prop it up like a tiny laptop! Hold it like a camcorder when you shoot video! There are tons of possibilities, and the thrill you get when you fold your phone shut never fully wears off.In this articleBest book-style foldableBest flip-style foldableThe most fun foldableThe best battery life in a foldableOther foldables to considerWhat’s coming nextBest book-style foldable8Verge ScoreSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7$1700$200015% off$1700The GoodRidiculously slim and light for a foldableAll-day battery with moderate useOuter screen finally feels normalThe BadIt’s $2,000Durability still a concernCamera bump makes it wobble on a table$1700 at Amazon (256GB)$1700 at Best Buy (256GB)$1700 at Samsung (512GB)How we rate and review productsScreen: 8-inch, 1968p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.5-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 4,400mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the foldable we’ve been waiting for Samsung to create. Unlike the long and narrow form factor of previous Z Fold devices, the Z Fold 7 boasts a more familiar 21:9 aspect ratio, making it feel much less unwieldy to use. At just 8.9mm thick, it’s nearly as slim as standard slab-style devices and doesn’t feel bulky in your pocket. Open it up, and you get a spacious inner display that’s perfect for multitasking, gaming, or simply enjoying more screen real estate. It will even last a day with moderate use, which is relatively good for a folding phone.RelatedThe foldable iPhone might look like two iPhone Airs stuck togetherSamsung’s trifold might be launching pretty soonHere’s everything you need to know about preordering the new Google Pixel phonesThe Z Fold 7, however, isn’t without its shortcomings. Notably, its starting price of $1,999 is a huge reminder that this is a luxury device, not a practical choice for everyone. The outer display also has a lower resolution than the screen found in the more affordable Galaxy S25 Ultra, and the camera bump is quite large, resulting in a slight wobble when the phone is placed on flat surfaces. That said, the camera system is top-notch, highlighted by a 200-megapixel lens that performs well in low-light scenarios.It was going to take a lot to unseat the Pixel 9 Pro Fold as our favorite book-style foldable, but the Z Fold 7 has done just that. The hardware is stunning, and the reworked proportions make it feel much nicer to use. Still, issues like long-term durability remain a concern, while the $1,999 price tag places it out of reach for most.Read our full Galaxy Z Fold 7 review.Best flip-style foldable8Verge ScoreSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7$1100$1100The GoodSamsung finally adopted the big cover screenAll-day batteryReliable cameraThe BadMore susceptible to dust than your average phoneStill too hard to run full apps on the cover screen$1100 at Amazon (256GB)$1100 at Best Buy (256GB)$1100 at Samsung (256GB)How we rate and review productsScreen: 6.9-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 4.1-inch, 948p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Samsung Exynos 2500 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,300mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48The latest Galaxy Z Flip may not be as fun as the newest Razr Ultra, but it does offer a few new tricks. Samsung ditched the old file-folder cover screen in favor of a glorious, 4.1-inch edge-to-edge panel that wraps around the cameras. The extra real estate means you have more room to quickly respond to messages or perform any task that doesn’t require you to open your phone (and risk getting lost in a digital rabbit hole).In addition to the larger cover screen, the Flip 7 offers a couple of other thoughtful updates. It’s thinner than its predecessor and features a bigger 4,300mAh battery, which is a step up from the 4,000mAh battery found in the last-gen Flip 6. The camera system remains unchanged from last year’s model, too, though that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The 50-megapixel main shooter still produces great images, and you get all the versatility the flip form factor has to offer, including the ability to easily take selfies using the rear camera.RelatedSamsung cuts price of its foldables with the Z Flip 7 FEHonor’s Magic V5 is the thinnest foldable yet, but that’s not why it mattersDespite some welcome changes, the Flip 7 carries the same IP48 rating as last year’s model, which means long-term durability against fine dust particles remains a concern. However, Samsung offers a great warranty and repair program, along with seven years of OS and security updates. The Flip 7 isn’t perfect, but it’s the most powerful and polished version yet — just don’t drop it while lounging on the beach.Read our full Galaxy Z Flip 7 review.The most fun foldable7Verge ScoreMotorola Razr Ultra (2025)$1100$130015% off$1100The GoodOne of the best-looking phones you can buyGreat battery lifeOuter screen is useful in unexpected waysThe BadAI button is wasted real estate Long-term durability is still a question markCamera processing is occasionally weird$1100 at Amazon (512GB)$1300 at Motorola (512GB)$1100 at Best Buy (512GB)How we rate and review productsScreen: 7-inch 1224p OLED 165Hz inner screen; 4-inch 1080p OLED 165Hz outer screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide; 50-megapixel f/2.0 selfie / Battery: 4,700mAh / Charging: 68W wired, 30W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP48The Razr Ultra is the newest and most advanced member of Motorola’s foldable lineup. Compared to the Razr Plus, it boasts a higher-resolution inner screen, Qualcomm’s most powerful mobile processor, double the storage space, and an upgraded selfie camera. The device is also one of the best-looking phones you can buy — the gold-bronze chassis and wooden back panel lend the Ultra a real elegance. When every phone tends to look the same — even in the foldable market — the Razr Ultra stands out in a crowd, which only adds to its charm.Beyond its appearance, the Ultra is just plain fun to use. The 4-inch outer screen covers almost the entire front of the phone, making it perfect for checking notifications, responding to messages, and taking quick actions such as hailing an Uber. The titanium hinge is also an upgrade over the stainless steel found in the Razr Plus. While the Ultra is enjoyable, it can’t overcome the gripes we’ve had with previous Motorola foldables, like inconsistent camera processing. Meanwhile, Motorola is only promising three OS upgrades and four years of security updates, which is on the shorter side considering the $1,300 retail price.Read our full Razr Ultra (2025) review.The best battery life in a foldable8Verge ScoreOppo Find N5$2099$249916% off$2099The GoodIt’s really, really thinExcellent battery lifeThe crease is almost invisibleThe BadFoldables are still fragileIt’s not launching in the US or Europe$2099 at Oppo (512GB)How we rate and review productsScreen: 8.12-inch, 2248p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.62-inch, 1140p, 120Hz OLED outer screen size/ Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.9 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 8-megapixel selfie cameras (inner and outer) / Battery: 5,600mAh / Charging: 80W wired, 50W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IPX8/IPX9Let’s get the bad news out of the way first: if you live in the US or Europe, you can’t buy the Oppo Find N5. That rules out, well, a lot of us. But if you live in China, Singapore, or any of the other Asian countries Oppo included in its so-called “global” release, then you’re in luck: you can pick up one of the world’s thinnest book-style folding phones, and the rest of us are all very jealous of you.The Find N5 isn’t all about thinness, either. Its Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is highly capable, the phone is fully water-resistant, and battery life is excellent. It utilizes silicon-carbon battery technology to accommodate a large (by foldable standards) 5,600mAh battery, which easily holds up after a long day of heavy use. What’s even more impressive is that, like the aforementioned Z Fold 7, the Find N5 is still barely thicker than a standard slab-style phone and only slightly heavier. That matters when you’re using the phone via the cover screen for long periods of time or stashing it in the side pocket of your yoga pants. When a foldable is only about as heavy and bulky as a regular phone, using the inner screen feels like getting away with something fantastic — not a benefit you have to make many other sacrifices for. Oppo delivers this in spades, and I just wish more of us could… find it.Read our full Oppo Find N5 review.RelatedCheck out Huawei’s extra-wide flip phoneForget wood, the new Razr is crystalOther foldables to considerThe latest Huawei Mate XTs gets an honorable mention for its sheer wow factor alone. It’s Huawei’s second trifold phone and features some minor upgrades over the original, which we found to be a great foldable that’s far too expensive. The second-gen Mate XTs is cheaper than the original at 17,999 yuan (about $2,520) and adds several new features, including stylus support, an upgraded Kirin 9020 chipset, and an improved 40-megapixel ultrawide.The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 is new to the scene, replacing last year’s model. Although the two devices look identical, there are a few notable changes. The biggest difference is that the Razr Plus 2025 now features a titanium hinge, rather than stainless steel, promising better durability and a less noticeable crease when the device is open. Additionally, the Razr Plus 2025 offers IP48 dust and water resistance, whereas last year’s model featured an IPX8 rating. While we haven’t tested the newest model, it appears to be a solid alternative to the Ultra.The standard Motorola Razr 2025 is a more affordable entry point into the world of foldables, starting at $699. The Razr 2025 offers improved performance, battery life, and durability — the kind of bumps we expect year after year. It boasts a smaller cover screen compared to the Razr Plus and Ultra, but still offers a spacious 6.9-inch internal display. We haven’t tested the Razr 2025 yet, but its relatively budget-friendly price is a good option for jumping into the foldable market.The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is an impressive sophomore effort from Google, offering an ideal form factor that’s a joy to use. When folded, the outer screen matches the dimensions of a regular phone, and the inner screen can get nice and bright outdoors. The whole package is also light enough that it sometimes doesn’t feel like you’re holding a foldable, though it does suffer from a slightly downgraded camera system compared to its slab-style siblings. There’s also no formal dust resistance, so long-term durability remains a concern. Read our review.What’s coming nextGoogle recently announced the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which is currently available for preorder from Amazon, Best Buy, and Google starting at $1,799, with a launch set for October 9th. It’s the first foldable to earn an IP68 rating, meaning it offers full water and dust resistance. It also features Google’s new Tensor G5 chip, improved inner and outer displays, and support for Google’s magnet-based Pixelsnap system. We got a brief hands-on with the foldable following its announcement; however, we’re not ready to share a final verdict until we’ve performed more extensive real-world testing.Update, September 24th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added info about the upcoming Pixel 10 Pro Fold.
