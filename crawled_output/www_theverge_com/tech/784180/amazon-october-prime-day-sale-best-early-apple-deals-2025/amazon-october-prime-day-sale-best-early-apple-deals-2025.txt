But if you can’t wait until the sale kicks off on October 7th to land a bargain, you don’t have to. A few Apple products are already receiving sizable discounts at Amazon and other retailers, giving you the chance to save ahead of Amazon’s two-day sales event next month.RelatedHere are 25 great deals you can snag ahead of Amazon’s fall Prime Day eventHow to sign up for Amazon PrimeHow to find the best deals during Amazon’s October Prime Day saleAdmittedly, the current discounts aren’t as steep as what we’ve seen during previous Prime Day events — and possibly this year’s October Prime Day — but they’re still a solid way to save on a lot of older Apple devices if you can’t wait. The last-gen Apple Watch Ultra 2 has returned to its all-time low, for instance, while the M1-powered MacBook Air is available at its best price to date. We’ve rounded up a handful of other Apple deals worth taking a look at below, so let’s dive in.In this articleThe best wireless earbud and headphone dealsThe best iPad dealsThe best MacBook dealsThe best Apple Watch dealsAirTags and other miscellaneous dealsThe best wireless earbud and headphone dealsApple AirPods Pro (second-gen) with USB-C charging case$199$24920% off$199The second-gen AirPods Pro improve upon Apple’s original pair with much better noise cancellation, improved sound quality, and onboard volume controls.
