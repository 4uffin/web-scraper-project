If you want to hop on this deal before the prices go back up, you have until the end of the day. The correct price will be reflected at checkout.Samsung 990 Evo Plus M.2 2280-sized SSD$100$13023% off$100$100 at B&H Photo$200 at B&H PhotoEven if you don’t have a PCIe Gen 5 rig, complete with the latest motherboard, processor, RAM, and GPU, you can still benefit from the 990 Evo Plus. That’s because all Gen 5 SSDs are backwards compatible with PCIe Gen 4 systems, meaning that it’ll work in PCs with available M.2 slots and PlayStation 5 consoles alike (although, in the case of the latter, you’ll need to install your own cheap heatsink to keep it running cool).In terms of speed, this SSD sits below the flagship PCIe Gen 4 990 Pro that came out in 2022 (it’s currently $169.99 for 2TB), but not by a whole lot. The 990 Evo Plus can achieve sequential read speeds of up to 7,250MB/s, and write at up to 6,300MB/s. Even so, it sails past Sony’s 5,500MB/s requirements for SSD read speeds in a PS5, and if you’re upgrading from a PCIe Gen 3 or slower SSD in a PC, swapping it out for this should feel like you’re using a new machine.Other Verge-approved dealsHop into the punishing roguelike action of Elden Ring Nightreign with a special discount on the deluxe edition on disc. Woot is selling the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions for just $34.99 (originally $54.99), which is a price you’d be lucky to find on the regular edition. Compared to the standard edition, this version includes additional playable characters, more bosses, plus a digital artbook, mini soundtrack, and an 11 x 17-inch poster in the box.You can spend close (or over) $100 on a 4K-ready streaming device, but you certainly don’t have to. Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K Max — its most powerful HDMI stick — is just $29.99 instead of $39.99 when you enter the code 4KTVMAX or MAX4KUP at checkout. It’s likely that your account will show one of the two codes upon visiting the product page. In that case, enter the one you see (the other code likely won’t work, or at least, it didn’t for us). The 4K Max is a competent streaming gadget that supports Wi-Fi 6E, plus Dolby Vision, HDR10 Plus, and Dolby Atmos in content that supports it. In my experience, it’s a heck of a lot faster than the last-gen Chromecast 4K.I need to break the habit of recommending the M1 MacBook Air (8GB RAM, 256GB storage) to everyone looking for an affordable laptop, which is tough to do because it’s just $599 at Walmart. But it’s hard to deny that the 2025 MacBook Air is a significantly better deal at $799 (Amazon, Best Buy), given it has twice the RAM (though, the same amount of storage), a considerably faster M4 chip, plus an overall better design and enhanced webcam.Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
