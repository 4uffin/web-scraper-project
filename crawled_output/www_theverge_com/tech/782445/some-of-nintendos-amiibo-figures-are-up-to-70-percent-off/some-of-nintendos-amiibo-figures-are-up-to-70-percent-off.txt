On Bluesky, Wario64 pointed out the page that contains all of the models selling at up to 70 percent off.The list includes some great ones, like Persona 5’s Joker, Bowser in his wedding outfit from Super Mario Odyssey, Banjo and Kazooie, Ness from Earthbound, Sora and his big ass key blade from Kingdom Hearts, and more.Additionally, GameStop and Amazon are steeply discounting newer amiibo to $15.99, some of which launched in early June for as much as $39.99. GameStop’s list is more comprehensive, and includes The Legend of Zelda figures, as well as amiibo based on characters from Street Fighter 6, Minecraft, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Monster Hunter Rise.Kirby Air Riders amiibo coming later this year will raise the bar in terms of price and functionality.
