He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.You’d be forgiven for assuming the iPhone Air would snap like a twig under pressure. It’s almost impossibly thin at just 5.6mm. But, its titanium frame is not only stronger than aluminum, it’s also more elastic. YouTuber JerryRigEverything demonstrates this with his usual bend test. While he’s able to get some slight bowing by pressing his thumbs into the center of the screen with all his might, it doesn’t crack and immediately returns to its original shape.Not content to be thwarted by Apple’s engineering team (and perhaps feeling a little disappointed that the last several devices on his channel survived the bend test), JerryRigEverything takes a trip out to his garage. With the help of a crane scale and some metal bars he’s able to find out exactly just how much pressure it takes to crack the iPhone air — 216 pounds.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Terrence O'BrienCloseTerrence O'BrienWeekend EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Terrence O'BrienAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleiPhoneCloseiPhonePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All iPhoneNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
