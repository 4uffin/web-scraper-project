He previously wrote for Business Insider, Rolling Stone, Futurism, and Popular Science.A cool new perk recently became available for Prime members: for a limited time, you can get a three-month subscription to Kindle Unlimited. If your ebookshelf is looking bare, Amazon is currently offering a three-month subscription to Kindle Unlimited for free. The service typically costs $11.99 per month, so the deal saves you $35.97 over the course of the trial. Keep in mind that your subscription will automatically renew once the trial period is over. The discount is one of Amazon’s early Prime Big Deal Days deals (that’s a mouthful), dropping well ahead of the October 7th event. We’ll be on the hunt for more early deals as that date approaches.Kindle Unlimited is a subscription service that gives you access to a library of over four million books, thousands of audiobooks, and an assortment of magazines. You can download items from the Kindle Unlimited library onto — you guessed it — a Kindle, or any device with the Kindle app. The library is large enough that you should be able to find books in your favorite genres (perhaps by your favorite author, too) and three months is plenty of time to tear through a full series or two.You can browse the Kindle Unlimited library before subscribing to see if there’s any books you’re interested in. It has some must-reads, like The Canterbury Tales and the entire The Expanse series. If you’re reading on a device with a color screen, you can use Kindle Unlimited to read manga and comics, like Watchmen, The Batman Who Laughs, and Doomsday Clock: The Complete Collection, and get the full experience.RelatedApple’s 2025 iPhone lineup is now available to buy in stores and onlineMore deals our readers loved this weekThe entire iPhone 17 lineup (plus the iPhone Air) has been released, and we highly recommend getting a screen protector for your new phone. You can get a two-pack of amFilm’s OneTouch Screen Protector for the iPhone 17, iPhone Air, and iPhone 17 Pro for $4.49 ($7.50 off) at Amazon with promo code EUZWG92J. The same code lets you get an iPhone 17 Pro Max screen protector for $4.99 ($7 off). AmFilm’s screen protector is made from tempered glass, has an anti-fingerprint coating that’ll keep your display looking sharp instead of smudged, and comes with an alignment guide to help you install it properly. Motorola’s budget-friendly Moto G Power 2025 has returned to its all-time low price of $249 ($50 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. The unlocked smartphone has a 6.8-inch 120Hz LCD display, a 5,000mAh battery, and wireless charging support. It even has a 3.5mm headphone jack.

It’s also compatible with Amazon’s Stylus Pen and Bluetooth Keyboard Case, which are helpful if you want to use the tablet for sketching or long-form writing. The tablet has lockscreen ads, which won’t interrupt you when you’re using it, but you can pick up a model without advertisements on sale for $104.99 ($50 off) at Amazon.If you have a speedy internet connection, Nvidia’s GeForce Now lets you play PC games you own through an app — no expensive gaming rig required.

The 11-inch iPad Air (M3) with 128GB of storage is back to its all-time low price of $449 ($150 off at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart. It lasts up to 10 hours per charge, and its M3 processor is powerful enough to play games and run creative apps like Final Cut or DaVinci Resolve. It’s also a great choice if all you want is a nice screen for binging TV shows and movies on the couch, or in bed.
