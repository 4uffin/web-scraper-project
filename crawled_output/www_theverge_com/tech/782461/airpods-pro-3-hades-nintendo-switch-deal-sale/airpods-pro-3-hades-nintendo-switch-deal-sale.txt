The small discount is notable because Apple’s latest earbuds have only been available for three days. In our tests, the AirPods Pro 3 were an improvement over their predecessor in three significant ways: fit, active noise cancelation performance, and audio quality.AirPods Pro 3$239$2494% off$239Apple’s AirPods Pro 3 have a new design that improves their fit, effective active noise cancellation, great audio quality with better bass, and fairly accurate heart rate sensors. Read our review.Read More$239 at Amazon$250 at Best Buy$249 at AppleApple improved the AirPods Pro 3’s chances of staying securely in your ears by changing the shape of both the buds and tips to be more angled, so they fit more snugly. The tips have been infused with foam that expands slightly in your ear to create a better seal, and Apple includes a new XXS-sized tip to fit more ears. However, the tip is still primarily silicone, so it remains easy to clean and more comfortable to wear. I picked up a pair for myself (woefully, at full price), and have found they fit better than the AirPods Pro 2, especially once I twist them to secure the buds in place.RelatedThe iPhone 17 is the one to get this yearApple’s iPhone 17 Pro is a bold redesign but a basic upgradeApple iPhone Air review: statement pieceWe tested the AirPods Pro 3’s active noise cancelling on a plane, in a room with people speaking, and at a concert, and the earbuds performed well all three times. They’re especially better at dampening high frequency sounds, like voices, than prior generations of AirPods Pro. When it came to audio quality, the AirPods Pro 3 delivered plenty of bass, better performance when listening to spatial audio music and movie soundtracks. Audio quality will always be subjective based on the sensitivity of your ears, preferred music genre, and how the tracks you listen to were mastered. We were impressed that the earbuds had 27 percent battery after roughly six hours of continual use with active noise canceling enabled, which aligned with Apple’s claims of eight hour battery life.The AirPods Pro 3’s new feature is heart rate monitoring courtesy of a pair of sensors built into the buds. Your heart rate will be tracked, and the data will be sent to and stored in the Apple Health app. In our tests, the results were on par with the readings taken by a chest strap within five to 10 beats per minute, though the accuracy is dependent on how well they fit in your ears. The earbuds also sport an IP57 rating, which means they’re sweat resistant and workout friendly. Live Translation, a feature that launches alongside the AirPods Pro 3 but is also available on AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 was pretty accurate, though not perfect.

The roguelike dungeon crawler has you hacking and slashing your way out of hell, gaining additional insights and progressing through the story each time you fail and restart. Each run is different, which keeps the game feeling fresh, and the gorgeous artwork is true eye candy. If you want to wait for a physical release of Hades II on November 25th, you can preorder it for around $49.99 at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. Xiaomi’s Sound Pocket is a durable, compact Bluetooth speaker that you can pick up for an all-time low price of $27.49 ($12.50 off) at Amazon. Xiaomi says the five watt speaker mono lasts up to 10 hours per charge, and two can be paired together for true stereo sound. The speaker’s built-in strap allows you to attach it to the loop on a backpack using a carabiner. The Sound Pocket has an IP67 rating, which means it’s dustproof and can be fully submerged under three feet of water for about half an hour. A variety of gadgets are on sale at Woot as part of its “Best of Woot” sale, and you can save an additional 10 percent on any purchase (with a maximum of $20 in savings) today only. The sale covers gear in several categories, but we recommend starting with Logitech MX Vertical Wireless Mouse, which is a Verge favorite and currently marked down to $87.99 ($32 off). Anker’s Prime 12,000 mAh Powerbank is discounted to $59.99 ($40 off), and it’s a slightly different version of a battery pack I’ve used reliably for several months, so it’s also well worth a look.
