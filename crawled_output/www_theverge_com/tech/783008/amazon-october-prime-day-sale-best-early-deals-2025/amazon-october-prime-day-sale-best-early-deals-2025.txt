Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.Amazon recently announced that its fall Prime Day sale — once again dubbed Prime Big Deal Days — will kick off on Tuesday, October 7th, and run through October 8th. While you have a few weeks to get your wishlist in order, the retailer isn’t waiting for the main event to roll out the savings. Amazon has already started dropping early deals and discounts on a range of gadgets, from phones to charging stations. You can even get three months of Kindle Unlimited for free.RelatedHow to find the best deals during Amazon’s October Prime Day saleHere are the price-matching policies for Best Buy, GameStop, and othersWe saw some great deals during Amazon’s four-day Prime Day event in July — hell, Apple’s latest iPad Mini dropped to a cool $379 — so we’re hoping to see similar worthwhile discounts this time around. Below, we’ve rounded up the best sales currently available ahead of Prime Big Deal Days. We’ll be updating this guide as more deals drop, so be sure to bookmark this page to stay on top of the latest discounts.11-inch iPad Air M3$449$59925% off$449The new 11-inch iPad Air comes with Apple’s M3 chip and GPU upgrades.

Read our review.Read More$80 at Amazon$100 at Walmart$96 at Best Buy8BitDo’s Pro 2 may not be the latest, greatest model available — that title goes to the 8BitDo Pro 3 — but it’s still a good option you can pick up for $42.49 (about $7 off) at Amazon. I’ve been using the wireless gamepad to play games on the Nintendo Switch 2, and it works great with Donkey Kong Bananza (aside from the horrible rumble feedback, which you can thankfully turn off). The retro controller features drift-free Hall effect joysticks, two back buttons on the rear grips, and a switch that allows you to quickly toggle between a range of devices — including the Switch, Steam Deck, smartphones, and Windows PCs.Amazon’s Fire TV Soundbar Plus is currently on sale at Amazon for $179.99 ($70 off). The 37-inch soundbar dropped to $149 during Prime Day, so this discount is by no means the lowest we’ve seen. Still, it’s a great, affordable option that supports Dolby Atmos and features three speakers, three tweeters, and two woofers. It also features four listening modes and a center channel for clearer dialogue.You can buy the Alexa Voice Remote Pro on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for $27.99 ($7 off), which is a few bucks shy of its all-time low. Along with Alexa integration, the comfortable clicker offers a handy remote finder feature, which allows you to keep tabs on it using an Alexa-based smart speaker, Android, or iOS. It also sports two customizable buttons and backlighting, making it easier to find in the dark.

The portable Bluetooth speaker delivers big bass in a form factor that’s about the size of a softball; however, despite its compact design, it offers up to 10 hours of continuous playback and an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, making it well-suited for lazy days outside now that it’s finally cooling down (the low this week in my area of Arizona will be only 82 degrees!).Google Pixel Buds Pro 2$179$22922% off$179Significantly smaller and lighter than their predecessors, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 also offer stronger noise cancellation, a crystal clear transparency mode, and lengthy battery life.

Read our original review.You can protect your Nintendo Switch 2 with Tomtoc’s slim FancyCase-G05, which is on sale at Amazon in select colors for Prime members for $30.99 ($6 off). The sleek carrying case features a minimalist design that perfectly fits the new handheld console. It boasts a protective hard shell, an adjustable carrying handle, and 12 game card slots, allowing you to take your console and library of games wherever you go.Xiaomi’s Sound Pocket is a durable, compact Bluetooth speaker that you can currently pick up for an all-time low of $26.99 (about $13 off) at Amazon. Xiaomi says the 5W mono speaker lasts up to 10 hours per charge, and two can be paired together for true stereo sound. The speaker’s built-in strap lets you attach it to the loop of a backpack using a carabiner, and it carries an IP67 rating, which means it’s dustproof and can be fully submerged under three feet of water for about half an hour.Apple MagSafe Charger (2m)$35$4929% off$35Apple’s latest MagSafe charger now fully supports the Qi2.2 standard, allowing it to charge compatible devices (including the iPhone 17 series and Google’s Pixel 10 lineup) at 25W rates.Read More$35 at Amazon$49 at Apple$35 at Best BuyAnker MagGo Magnetic Charging Station 8-in-1$60$7014% off$60A Qi2 pad on the front and a party in the back, with three AC outlets and four USB ports.

The portable power station offers a 518Wh battery and supports 500W of output power, with an AC outlet, three USB-A ports, two DC ports, and a car port. However, there are no USB-C ports, so you may need to pick up a USB-A to USB-C cable if you own a modern iPhone or Android device. The power station weighs 13.3 pounds and is about the size of a basketball, with a sturdy handle that makes it easy to transport during camping trips.The JBL Live Beam 3 are down to $139.95 ($90 off) right now at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, which is the lowest price we’ve seen on the noise-canceling earbuds in weeks.

The service typically costs $11.99 per month, so the deal saves you $35.97 over the course of the trial. Keep in mind that your subscription will automatically renew once the trial period is over. If you sign up, you’ll get access to a library of more than four million books, thousands of audiobooks, and an assortment of magazines.
