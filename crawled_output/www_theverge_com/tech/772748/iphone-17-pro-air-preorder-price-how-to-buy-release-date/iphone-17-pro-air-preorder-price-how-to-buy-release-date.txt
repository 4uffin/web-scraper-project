The standard iPhone 17 — which is a shockingly good value, by the way — now features a larger 6.3-inch display with ProMotion and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Meanwhile, the Pro model has returned to an aluminum build while adding the biggest battery of any iPhone yet. The iPhone Air and Pro models have a lot in common, including having a raised “plateau” bump on the back, which contains not just cameras but some internal components, too, leaving some extra room in the phones for larger batteries.RelatedThe iPhone 17 is the one to get this yearApple iPhone Air review: statement pieceApple’s iPhone 17 Pro is a bold redesign but a basic upgradeThe iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and Air start at $799, $1,099, $1,199, and $999, respectively, and each model starts with 256GB of storage.

It’s Apple’s thinnest iPhone ever at 5.6mm thick, and it features a 6.5-inch ProMotion display and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Apple says the design is its “most durable” yet, with a ceramic shield that encloses a titanium frame on both sides (also found in the iPhone 17 Pro). The device also sports a single 48-megapixel fusion camera on the back, an 18-megapixel Center Stage selfie cam on its front, along with an A19 Pro processor and Apple’s in-house C1X modem.
