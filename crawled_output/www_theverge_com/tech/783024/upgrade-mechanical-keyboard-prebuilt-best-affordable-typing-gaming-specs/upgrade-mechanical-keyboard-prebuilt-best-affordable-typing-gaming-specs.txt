Di Benedetto is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.The mechanical keyboard world has undergone a renaissance. Thanks to increased competition and commoditized tech, features that used to be exclusive to limited-run DIY boards in the $300-plus range just a few years ago are now available in prebuilt boards in the $100 to $200 range — sometimes less. The DIY kit builds, limited-run group buys, and boutique boards made by artisans are still innovating and pushing boundaries, and they’re great if you’re looking for something extra adventurous or very specific. But if you just want a great keyboard for not much money, no assembly required, your options are better than ever.Here are a bunch of keyboards under $200(ish) we like, including boards we’ve been sent for review and some we’ve bought ourselves.We’re not picking a “best,” because these are all bangers. Nor is this a comprehensive list: there are so many great keyboards in this price range it’d be impossible to test them all. These are just ones we like. They’re all affordable, feature-rich keyboards that are a great upgrade for most people — excellent for simply typing away and more than capable for gaming.What we’re looking for (and what we prefer):Typing feel and soundCollapseSwitches, keycaps, and case and switch plate material all influence how a mechanical keyboard feels and sounds. Obviously, preference plays a big role here: some people like light switches and some like heavy ones; some like loud boards and some like quiet. But most people look for boards that aren’t actively annoying to them or the people around them.Build quality and constructionCollapsePlastic cases are totally fine, especially if you’re shopping for mechanical keyboards under $60 or need something lightweight for travel. But an aluminum chassis feels nicer and makes the keyboard less likely to slide around on your desk. It also affects the typing sound and feel, and typically for the better. Most of the boards on this list have layers of foam within the case to dampen and deepen the typing sound and reduce echo and ping, and many use gaskets to isolate metal case components from each other while offering a softer typing feel. This combo is a big reason cheaper keyboards have gotten so good. That used to be something you had to mod yourself, but now even big brands like Razer mimic it. (And you can still mod most prebuilt boards plenty if you’re the tinkering type.)Size and layoutCollapseMany of our picks are 75 percent layout or smaller, which saves space on your desk and brings your mouse hand closer to your body for better ergonomics. The 75 percent layout maintains arrow keys, some function keys, and a whole F row, while a 65 percent ditches the F row (you can still use them with a modifier key and number row). If you insist on a number pad, you can shop for similar full-size or 1800-layout options — though your selection will be more limited. Or you can get a wireless numpad and even use it to the left of your keyboard (now we’re talking).ConnectivityCollapseMost of the boards we recommend are wireless “tri-mode” boards, which means they work wired, via Bluetooth, or with a 2.4GHz USB adapter. A wired connection is the simplest and can have the fastest polling rate for gaming. Bluetooth lets you use the keyboard with multiple devices, while 2.4GHz dongles offer an alternative to Bluetooth and can have a much higher polling rate.CustomizabilityCollapseAll mechanical keyboards come with removable keycaps. Replacing the keycaps is an easy way to customize your board, but we also looked for keyboards with hot-swap sockets. These sockets let you remove and replace the key switches without having to solder, so you can easily experiment with totally different typing experiences. We also look for the ability to remap key assignments and set up custom layers and shortcuts. VIA software support is ideal for the plug-and-play simplicity of its web-based interface, though decent proprietary software can be acceptable.In this articleThe Toyota Corolla of keyboardsThe hot-on-TikTok keyboardA beast of a budget aluminum boardLow-profile keyboardsFlexible, with great looks and soundA fun low-profile board I can roll withGaming / Hall effect keyboardsA hot rod for esports-level gamingGaming chops and great sound and feelSome great step-up / mid-tier optionsAffordable luxuryA tinkerer’s dreamThe Toyota Corolla of keyboardsKeychron V1 Max$85$10015% off$85The GoodNice, light typing feel“Max” boards come in many layoutsSub-legends for shortcut functionsTwo USB receivers with storageThe BadPlastic case feels and sounds cheaper than metal keyboardsStock Keychron blue keycaps are a bit boring$85 at Amazon (red switch)How we rate and review productsConnectivity: USB, BT 5.1, 2.4GHz / Keycaps: Double-shot PBT / Hot-swappable: Yes (MX-compatible) / Available sizes: 60 percent, 65 percent, 75 percent, TKL, 1800, full size, 65 percent Alice, 75 percent Alice / Available layouts: ANSI, ISO / Switch options: Gateron Jupiter Red, Blue, Banana / Case colors: Black / Remapping software: VIA / Extras: Volume knob / Battery size: 4,000mAh

Keychrons are the Toyotas of the mechanical keyboard world: reliable and excellent for the money. And they come in just about every layout you can imagine. Southpaw Alice, anyone? The Q-series metal keyboards are among our personal favorites, but the cheaper, plastic-clad V series remains our go-to budget pick, and the V Max line adds 1,000Hz wireless connectivity.The V1 Max is the 75-percent board in this lineup, and it’s a great value. I’d opt for the Gateron Jupiter Banana switches for a stronger tactile feel than the Browns. (You can get a bare-bones kit, but Keychron charges so little for caps and switches, you might as well get them.)PreviousNext1/9The V1 Max looks like most other Keychrons, but a fresh set of keycaps can solve that. Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The VergeThe Keychron is the most humdrum among our selection here — it’s available in any color you want, as long as it’s black — but you can’t go wrong with one. The V1 Max comes with modifier keycaps for both Windows and Mac, its battery lasts for days even while using its RGB backlighting, and it includes both USB-A and USB-C 2.4GHz dongles — with magnetic garages built into the chassis, ensuring you don’t misplace either.The hot-on-TikTok keyboardWobkey Rainy 75 Pro$119$119The GoodVery satisfying “raindrop-like” soundLots of color options with matching keycap setsHuge battery in Pro modelThe BadPower button hidden under Caps Lock keyOpening the case for mods is laborious$159 at Wobkey (Pro)$119 at Mechanical Keyboards (Standard)How we rate and review productsConnectivity: USB, BT 5.0, 2.4GHz / Keycaps: Double-shot PBT / Hot-swappable: Yes (MX-compatible) / Available sizes: 75 percent / Available layouts: ANSI (ISO requires alternate plate) / Switch options: HMX Violet (linear), Kailh Cocoa (linear) / Case colors: Black, silver, white, blue, pink, yellow, red, and limited-run variants / Remapping software: VIA / Battery size: 3,500mAh (Lite), 7,000mAh (Pro)

Wobkey’s Rainy 75 is one of a few keyboards that broke containment from the mech scene. It got big on TikTok thanks to videos highlighting its raindrops-on-a-window typing sound and vibey color options. If I close my eyes, I also imagine the sounds of marbles gently jostling in a small bag. It’s very satisfying to hear when rapidly typing, and its soft-but-not-too-light Kailh Cocoa linear switches feel pleasant as well.It comes in three different versions: a $129 Lite model, a $139 Standard model, and a $159 Pro with double the battery capacity and Kailh Cocoa switches (the ones most associated with the Rainy’s distinctive sound). Each Rainy model supports Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connections and comes in a wide selection of charming colors, paired with clean-looking keycap sets.PreviousNext1/8Simple and clean. Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The VergeYou used to have to go to great lengths to get the kind of sound that the Rainy 75 delivers: trying lots of mods and seeking out just the right combination of switches, switch plate, and internal foam setup. Now, you can buy this board as is, plop it on your desk, and get a fantastic typing and auditory experience. It’s really impressive.A beast of a budget aluminum boardEpomaker P75$72$8010% off$72The GoodCrisp, poppy typing soundExcellent value for a well built boardMagnetized storage slot for USB dongleThe BadWisteria Tactile switch may be too loud for someProprietary software not as good as universal options like VIA$72 at Amazon (Wisteria Tactile)$80 at Amazon (Wisteria Linear)$80 at Amazon (Zebra switch)How we rate and review productsConnectivity: USB, BT 5.0, 2.4GHz / Keycaps: Double-shot PBT / Hot-swappable: Yes (MX-compatible) / Available sizes: 75 percent / Available layouts: ANSI / Switch options: Epomaker Wisteria Linear, Wisteria Tactile, Zebra (linear) / Case colors: Silver / Remapping software: Proprietary / Extras: Volume knob / Battery size: 4,000mAh

The Epomaker P75 caused a stir among keyboard enthusiasts when it launched last year, offering tri-mode connectivity, a volume knob, three switch options, and a well-built aluminium chassis for just $100. It was an early sign we were hitting peak out-of-the-box keyboard. I picked one up myself for $80 during a Prime Day sale, and for that price, it blew me away.I took a chance on the Wisteria tactile switches, which have a bright, poppy sound with strong tactile typing feedback. They’re not clicky switches, but they’re loud and proud. The P75 is one of the only keyboards I own that got on my wife’s nerves as she worked beside me during a hectic and long day, but it’s oh-so satisfying in short stints. The silver case is shinier than most matte-finish boards you normally find, but it could look right at home in front of a Mac Mini or other Apple-style silver peripherals (especially with the right keycaps). And the casing has a handy magnetic garage for easy storage of the 2.4GHz USB dongle — which I wish every keyboard had.PreviousNext1/5Eighty bucks or less for this beauty? It still boggles my mind. Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The VergeConsidering how aggressively priced the P75 is, it’d be easy to recommend it over even a people-pleaser like the Keychron. It comes with nicer keycaps and a much better metal chassis, after all. But its loudness and somewhat janky (though workable) remapping software holds it back slightly.Note: Epomaker has informed us the P75 is no longer being manufactured, so whatever inventory retailers like Amazon still have is likely to be all that’s left. Though it does have an even cheaper cousin, the Epomaker x Aula F75, which is plastic-clad and seemingly the king of KeyboardTok. We haven’t tried one yet, but it’s often raved about by YouTubers for what it offers at under $60.Low-profile keyboardsIf you feel that you actually type faster on a laptop keyboard or you want a keyboard that travels easier, a low-profile mechanical keyboard could be right for you. They use shorter switches and much lower-height keycaps but with only slightly less key travel than regular mechanical switches. This yields a much more compact board while still offering most of the same benefits. While there are now many low-profile switch options, they still pale in comparison to the choice you have with standard switches and keycaps, and low-profile switches from different vendors usually aren’t cross-compatible.The Lofree Flows and NuPhy Airs of the world have been mainstays of our mechanical keyboard buying guide, but we’ve got a couple of newer alternatives here worth checking out.Flexible, with great looks and soundChilkey ND75 LP$95$10510% off$95The GoodGreat sound for a low-profile keyboardLCD for settings or a custom GIFAlso works with standard-height switches and keycapsThe BadPower button hidden under right Shift keyStabilizers slightly rattly on one of our test units$95 at Chilkey (with code GRAD10)$115 at Mechanical KeyboardsHow we rate and review productsConnectivity: USB, BT 5.0, 2.4GHz / Keycaps: Double-shot PBT / Hot-swappable: Yes (MX-compatible) / Available sizes: 75 percent / Available layouts: ANSI / Switch options: Aster low profile (linear) / Case colors: Beige, silver, white, black, blue, lavender / Remapping software: Proprietary / Extras: LCD screen / Battery size: 3,600mAh

The standard Chilkey ND75 is a great budget board in its own right, and the ND75 LP is a low-profile version. It’s a handsome little board that comes in a few fun colors, and it’s much easier to throw in your bag. That said, the low-profile switches that come with this board sound wonderfully clacky, though they’re not quiet, so the ND75 LP may not be the best choice for some offices. The included keycaps look sharp in their two-tone color schemes and are of nice quality, though unlike low-profile boards from NuPhy, Iqunix, and Lofree they lack sub-legends showing shortcut controls — like screen brightness, volume, and media playback. the ND75 LP has that functionality, but you’ll need to look up and memorize the shortcuts.PreviousNext1/5Get low (profile). Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The VergeThe ND75 LP has a tiny screen you can use to toggle settings, or just display a looping GIF for funsies. And if you ever get tired of the low-profile feel, you can just swap in regular switches and keycaps — the ND75 LP is one of the few boards compatible with both low-profile and standard MX-compatible switches. Because why not?A fun low-profile board I can roll withIqunix Magi65 Pro$139$139The GoodGreat typing sound and feelNice design on the Pro versionsExcellent battery lifeVIA programmableThe Bad75% and 96% layouts are a little crampedNo physical on/off switch (you have to hold Fn+Esc for 5 seconds)$139 at IqunixHow we rate and review productsConnectivity: USB, BT 5.1, 2.4GHz / Keycaps: PBT / Hot-swappable: Yes (Kailh Choc V2 only) / Available sizes: 65 percent, 75 percent, 96 percent / Available layouts: ANSI, ISO / Switch options: Gold Red switch / Case colors: Black, “ochre white” / Remapping software: VIA / Extras: Volume knob and media keys (Pro model only) / Battery size: 3,000mAhI’ve tested a half-dozen keyboards with low-profile mechanical switches — including the ND75 LP and various Lofree Flow models — but the Iqunix Magi65 Pro is my favorite. Like the ND75 LP, it uses flat, uniform-profile keycaps, but because the MG65 Pro has a flatter typing angle and no function row, using it feels less like reaching uphill.The Magi65 comes in two variants. There’s the regular Magi65 with a standard 65 percent layout, and the Pro. The Pro (which I prefer) adds a rolling volume encoder, X-shaped media keys, and a garage for its 2.4GHz dongle hidden beneath a magnetic cover plate, and it has an RGB light bar between the volume roller and media keys. I just think it’s neat.The sound from its Gold Red linear switches give it a quieter, less poppy sound than the ND75 LP, and its number-row keycaps have Mac function-row sub-legends, which is handy. The Magi65 Pro also comes with a few bonus keycaps — both Mac and Windows modifier keys, and a few purely decorative keys, including two metal ones — and a coiled USB-C cable with faux-Lemo disconnect in it.Add the facts that the Magi65 Pro is remappable using VIA, has hot-swap sockets that are compatible with any Kailh Choc V2 switches, and has battery life in the weeks and months with the backlight turned off, and you can maybe see why it’s my favorite low-profile board. Iqunix has since released both 75 percent and 96 percent layout versions in both Pro and regular iterations, which I haven’t tested. — Nathan Edwards, senior reviews editorGaming / Hall effect keyboardsNearly any keyboard is fine for casual or enthusiast-level gaming. But if you’re serious about playing games competitively and seeking any edge you can get, then you want the fastest keyboard available. Even if, let’s be honest, it’s a bit of a placebo effect for many of us.Generally, that means a keyboard that’s wired (for the fastest polling rate) with magnetic Hall effect switches (for a lightning-fast, user-programmable response time). The easy answer is to just get a Wooting keyboard, but there are some noteworthy alternatives for lower prices with some unique designs and builds.A hot rod for esports-level gamingDry Studio Ice Ring 63 RT$120$14014% off$120The GoodSuper fast response time for high-level gamingUnique open chassis designRock-solid build that’s also lightweightRotating gear for changing modes is a little silly but funThe BadNot much potential for modsSmall (1U size) right Shift keyWired only$120 at AmazonHow we rate and review productsConnectivity: Wired USB / Keycaps: Double-shot PBT / Hot-swappable: Yes, Hall effect (PCB compatibility unknown) / Available sizes: 63 percent / Available layouts: ANSI / Switch options: TTC King of Magnetic RGB / Case colors: Orange, silver, white, gray / Remapping software: Proprietary / Extras: Rotating sensitivity mode selector

One look at the Dry Studio Ice Ring 63 RT leaves almost anyone totally baffled. The whole chassis is open-air like a stripped-out race car, the bottom plate is a slab of aluminum for dissipating heat, and there’s a rotating gear jutting out its left side for tuning the responsiveness of the keys. It’s all kind of bizarre, but right on point for Angry Miao designs (Dry Studio’s parent brand).This very compact, lightweight board goes hard for gaming — it even includes a padded travel case for competitions / LAN parties. The rotating gear’s sole purpose is to change the actuation point for the Ice Ring’s magnetic Hall effect switches. Turn the dial and the RGB light emanating underneath changes color to signify its preset mode: from a standard 2mm actuation point to an ultra-fast 0.1mm. The gaming modes also enable rapid trigger, allowing faster resetting of the key input as soon as your finger begins to lift.PreviousNext1/11The Ice Ring also comes in silver, white, and titanium, but orange is obviously the correct color. Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The VergeThe Ice Ring is a legit and unique competitor to the Wooting 60HE. Scott Kim of YouTube channel Keybored did a great deep-dive video showing how the Ice Ring’s design and engineering really does yield absurdly fast response times (even faster than Wooting’s) — in part thanks to the cooling of its heatsink-like bottom plate that helps prevent potential accuracy dropoff in Hall effect switches. Even if you’re not the most hardcore FPS gamer, this board is good, quirky fun. It doesn’t have a satisfying buttery sound like other keyboards we’ve outlined here, but it’s pleasant in its own way. And even with its hardcore design and rock-solid build, devoid of any flex or softness, it’s still nice to type on.Gaming chops and great sound and feelChilkey Slice75 HE$175$1908% off$175The GoodExcellent typing sound for an HE board thanks to cork dampening layerSupport for 8,000Hz polling and 32,000Hz scan rateRapid trigger and customizable actuation point for fast-paced gamesThe BadWired onlyDecorative logo in corner looks like it should be an LCD$175 at AmazonHow we rate and review productsConnectivity: Wired USB / Keycaps: Double-shot PBT / Hot-swappable: Yes (Hall effect switches only) / Available sizes: 75 percent / Available layouts: ANSI / Switch options: Gateron Magnetic Jade Pro / Case colors: Black, gray, white, pink / Remapping software: Proprietary

Now, if you want a great, affordable-ish Hall effect keyboard that does sound great, check out the Chilkey Slice75 HE. This wired-only HE board has much more conventional looks than the Dry Studio and a straightforward 75 percent layout. But what’s most unique about it is inside: a dampening layer made of cork instead of the typical foam. It helps yield a marbley sound, almost like the Rainy 75, but with the speedy and adjustable response of magnetic Hall effect switches. It’s got all the usual features of HE boards like the Ice Ring, including rapid trigger, adjustable actuation points, and even the ability to map multiple functions to one key depending on how far you press it.PreviousNext1/6You never see the cork inside unless you open up the Slice75, but it’s like a secret weapon to this keyboard’s nice sound. Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The VergeEven setting aside all the hardcore gaming-focused features, I want to emphasize that the Slice 75 looks, sounds, and feels great. At $199, it’s pricier than all the other keyboards above, but I still think it’s a great value for its excellent sound and HE performance.Some great step-up / mid-tier optionsAs with any hobby, even as things get cheaper and commoditized there’s always a way you can dive even deeper down rabbit holes — and of course spend more money. Since it feels like everyone and their mother now makes hot-swap gasket-mounted keyboards with foam inserts and a metal chassis, that also means the mid-to-high-tier board makers are likely to start experimenting with whatever the next hot new thing may be. And aside from being cutting-edge, the other draw of higher-end keyboards is the dizzying amount of ways you can customize and build them.Affordable luxuryEvoworks Evo80$160$1706% off$160The GoodIncredible build for under $200Fantastic out-of-the-box sound and typing feelLots of color options with unique satiny chassis finishBall-catch quick-release case with hidden USB storageThe BadOnly sold at specialized retailers$160 at Milk Tooth$170 at Mechanical Keyboards$170 at QwertykeysHow we rate and review productsConnectivity: USB, BT 5.0, 2.4GHz / Keycaps: Dye-sub PBT / Hot-swappable: Yes (MX-compatible) / Available sizes: TKL, 75 percent / Available layouts: ANSI / Switch options: Keygeek Oat linear, HMX Azure linear / Case colors: Black, purple, white, silver, pink, sand, red, light blue, cream, yellow / Remapping software: VIA / Extras: Magnetic ball-catch quick release / Battery size: 8,000mAh

Evoworks is a lower-cost sub-brand of Qwertykeys / Owlab, a company that’s made some of the best-quality, most trendsetting mechanical keyboards of the last handful of years. The Evoworks Evo80 is one of the nicest built mechs I’ve used — and I’ve tried some nice ones. The anodized metal case has a soft finish that feels so smooth and precious to the touch, I’d believe someone if they told me this keyboard cost well over $300 before even adding keycaps and switches. But it actually costs just $169.99 fully assembled with everything, including a massive battery and a decorative two-piece bottom weight plate.PreviousNext1/7I can’t get over how pretty this thing is. Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The VergeThe real juice of the Evo80, though, is its sound. You can pick from a low-pitched “thocky”-sounding model with Oat switches and polypropylene internal plate or a high-pitched clacky setup with azure switches and FR4 thermoplastic-based plate. I know us keyboard fans overuse the term thock, which is meant to represent the deepest of marble-y sounds, but the low-pitch version of the Evo80 I tested is an absolute delight. Compared to something like the Rainy 75, which is fantastic in its own right, the Evo80 has a noticeably deeper, heftier tone. It’s a bass to the Rainy’s tenor or P75’s alto. As much as I’ve grown fond of many other keyboards in the low-$100 range we’re covering here, it’s very hard not to look at the Evo80 or new Evo75 that just launched and think, “What’s another 50 bucks, right?”A tinkerer’s dreamMeletrix Zoom75 Tiga$215$215The GoodNear-endless customizationEasy access to mods with ball-catch quick-release case and PCB pogo pin connectorsVery high-quality build and excellent typing experienceGIFs on the LCD are funThe BadAssembly required, taking time and effort to buildBYO switches and keycapsLike many group buys, it can be hard to get2.4GHz USB had issues and required replacing$215 at MeletrixHow we rate and review productsConnectivity: USB, BT 5.0, 2.4GHz / Keycaps: Not included / Hot-swappable: Yes (MX-compatible) / Available sizes: 65 percent, 75 percent, TKL, 98 percent / Available layouts: ANSI, ISO / Switch options: Not included / Case colors: Black, gray, lavender, purple, aquamarine, dark green, red, sky blue, pale green, brown, white, e-white / Remapping software: VIA / Extras: Magnetic ball-catch quick release, LCD screen / Battery size: 8,000mAh

Over in the build-your-own keyboard kit world, the Zoom series from Meletrix is one of the best of the mid-tier, starting at $200 and up. With so many great prebuilt options out there it might not sound logical to assemble your own keyboard, but a kit like the Zoom75 Tiga has near-endless possibilities. You determine its internal mounting method, type of switch plate (if you even put one in), and dampening material (like cork or foam). You can even set it up with alternative layouts like ISO or a split backspace key. And that’s before you choose your stabilizers, switches, and keycaps.Building the Zoom75 Tiga took me a few hours. It’s been a few years since my last kit, so I’m a little rusty. But it wasn’t very difficult, and once assembled with its cork dampening kit, polyoxymethylene (POM) plate, and WS BigLucky linear switches, it felt like a fun project worth the time spent.PreviousNext1/7The Tiga has many decorative elements, like its three-tone trim details on the sides and bottom, and a magnetic badge above the USB-C port. Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The VergeThe Tiga, as I built it, sounds satisfyingly clacky but not overly bright or loud. But, keep in mind, you can change it whenever and however you want. It’s a time investment to strip down your keyboard and build it back up, but mid-tier boards like the Tiga (and even the Evo80) have new innovations to ease the pain, like a ball-catch quick-release top cover that releases with pressure instead of screws and magnetic pogo pin connectors instead of tiny ribbon cables for the PCB. The only downside of the Zoom75 was some spotty 2.4GHz wireless performance, requiring re-flashing the PCB and USB dongle firmware — eventually requiring a replacement USB dongle from Meletrix. (Users on the company’s Discord seemed to run into similar problems.)That’s the risk with DIY kit boards: they’re infinitely customizable, but you can also run into small issues or quirks along the way (especially if you assembled it wrong). And customer support usually means troubleshooting in a Discord community. But if you’re the hobbyist type, the process can feel rewarding.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Antonio G.
