He previously wrote for Business Insider, Rolling Stone, Futurism, and Popular Science.The new Apple Watch lineup launches on Friday, and Woot has a well-timed sale on an assortment of Apple’s Solo Loop and Braided Solo Loop watchbands. Solo Loop bands are marked down to $14.99 ($34 off), while Braided Solo Loop bands are on sale for $29.99 ($69 off). These bands are also compatible with previous-generation Apple Watch models. If you’re on the fence about upgrading to one of Apple’s 2025 smartwatches, I recommend checking out Victoria Song’s reviews of the Apple Watch SE 3 and Series 11.Apple Watch Solo Loop Band$15$4969% off$15$15 at WootThe Solo Loop band is made from liquid silicon rubber that Apple says is sweat and swimproof, and has been treated with UV light to make its finish feel smooth. It’s available in several solid colors and hues to match your style. However, the Solo Loop is a single piece of material with no way to adjust its size, so you have to be sure it fits your wrist before you get one. Apple has a printable sizing tool to help you figure out which size is right for your wrists. You’ll also have to choose a watch band that’s appropriate for the size of your Apple Watch, and can use Apple’s identification tool if you don’t know that information off the top of your head.Apple Watch Braided Solo Loop$30$9970% off$30$30 at WootThe Solo Braided Loop is an official Apple Watch band made from recycled polyester yarn filaments weaved around silicon threads. Apple says the material is textured and soft while being both sweat and water resistant. As with the Solo Loop, the Braided Solo Loop has some give but its length can’t be adjusted, so you’ll need to get one in the correct size. Most of these bands are available in a single color, but Woot has discounted the multicolor Pride Edition band Apple released in 2021.RelatedLet’s compare the specs of the Apple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and SE 3You can now preorder the Apple Watch SE 3, Series 11, and Ultra 3Three more great dealsThe 11-inch iPad Air (M3) with 128GB of storage is back to its all-time low price of $449 ($150 off at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart.
