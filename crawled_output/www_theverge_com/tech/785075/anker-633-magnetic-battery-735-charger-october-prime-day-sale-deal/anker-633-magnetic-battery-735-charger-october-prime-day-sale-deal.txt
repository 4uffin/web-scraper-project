He previously wrote for Business Insider, Rolling Stone, Futurism, and Popular Science.Amazon’s October Prime Day event (also known as Prime Big Deal Days) doesn’t officially start until October 7th, but that doesn’t mean you have to wait to find a good deal on charging accessories. Many speedy wall adapters, power banks, and large battery backup solutions are already on sale now from brands like Anker and Jackery. Most of these products are great for keeping your smartphone, laptop, or tablet charged at a cafe, while others are made to power your small appliances while you’re out camping.RelatedHere are 25 great deals you can snag ahead of Amazon’s fall Prime Day eventHow to find the best deals during Amazon’s October Prime Day saleJackery’s newest Explorer 240D power station is already over 30 percent offFor starters, Anker’s 633 Magnetic Battery is available in multiple colors from Amazon and Anker (with code WS7DV2FSCH8D) for $39.99 ($20 off), its best price to date. The compact, MagSafe-equipped battery pack can supply compatible iPhone models with up to 7.5W of power and features an integrated kickstand, so you can prop up your phone while it charges. Alternatively, you can plug your device into its USB-C port for 20W charging, rather than relying on wireless charging, which is ideal when you’re in a rush and have a USB-C cord.Anker’s 633 power bank also supports passthrough charging — meaning you can charge a device and the battery pack simultaneously — and features A USB-A port on the bottom that lets you plug in a second gadget if needed. At 10,000mAh, it also has enough power and capacity to fully charge most smartphones at least once, with some juice left in the tank.Anker 633 Magnetic Battery$40$6033% off$40$40 at Amazon$40 at Anker (with code WS7DV2FSCH8D)If you could use a wall outlet, Anker’s 735 Charger is currently matching its all-time low of $25.99 ($14 off) at Amazon and Anker’s online storefront (with promo code WS7DV2L3ORHI). The three-port, 65W charger features a slim design that won’t block other outlets, as well as two USB-C ports with a combined output of 65W, which is fast enough to quickly charge phones, handheld game consoles, and select laptops at or near their maximum speed. It can even charge a 14-inch MacBook Pro from zero to 50 percent in 35 minutes.The single USB-A port tops out at 22.5W, which is still plenty fast for charging devices with small batteries, including mice, keyboards, headphones, and wireless earbuds. The charger will automatically adjust the wattage sent to each port if more than one device is connected, too, and the top USB-C port will always receive the most juice in every instance. One of my favorite touches is that its prongs fold down, which keeps them from getting damaged while traveling.Anker 735 Charger (Nano II 65W)$26$4035% off$26$26 at Amazon$26 at Anker (with code WS7DV2L3ORHI)If you’re an avid camper, Jackery’s Explorer 1000 V2 is a great way to keep your essential gadgets powered up when you go off the grid. The power station has three AC outlets, a DC outlet, two USB-C ports, and a USB-A port. Jackery says its 1,070Wh battery can charge a smartphone up to 74 times, a laptop up to 14 times, or power a coffee maker for over an hour and a half. An early October Prime Day deal knocks its price down to $429 ($370 off) at Amazon, its biggest discount of the year so far.You can top up the Explorer 1000 V2 by plugging it into an outlet, allowing you to take it from zero to 100 percent in as little as an hour with the emergency charging setting enabled. The company also sells a solar panel that’s compatible with it, which increases the charging time but should allow you to get by if you really can’t reach an outlet. The power station typically outputs up to 1,500W but has a peak output of 3,000W in case you plug in multiple appliances at once. Jackery says the power station’s battery cells should retain around 70 percent of their maximum capacity after 4,000 power cycles, which is equivalent to about 10 years.Jackery Explorer 1000 v2$429$79946% off$429$429 at Amazon$449 at JackeryVerge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
