He’s been a tech journalist for 20 years.Kuxiu already made my favorite 3-in-1 Qi2 charger, and now it’s back with an even smaller yet more powerful version. The MagSafe-compatible Qi2.2 charger folds up super compact for travel and unfurls into a “Z” to simultaneously charge an Apple Watch, AirPods, or other Qi-enabled earbuds, and a Qi2 25W phone like the new Pixel 10 Pro XL and iPhone 17 series — all from a single USB-C cable.The $79.99 / €68.95 X40 Turbo charging stand supports the new Qi2.2 standard (aka, Qi2 25W), so it can wirelessly charge compatible devices at a maximum of 25W, up from 15W on last year’s $79.99 model. That price also gets you a 45W USB-C PD charger, carrying case, and cable in the box.When I say it’s small, I mean it. The X40 Turbo is 25 percent smaller than its diminutive predecessor, measuring just 64 x 64 x 18mm (2.52 x 2.52 x 0.71 inches) when folded up.It folds down very small for a 3-in-1 charger for supreme portability. Photo by Thomas Ricker / The VergeThese 3-in-1 Z-shaped stands are dime-a-dozen on Amazon and Temu, but Kuxiu is a brand I’ve used for a few years and trust. Like the company’s other products I’ve tested, it feels like quality due to the use of aluminum instead of plastic. I don’t have a Qi2.2 phone to test it with, but I have no reason to doubt its support for 25W wireless charging.My iPhone 15 Pro only supports Qi2 (15W), which is what I saw it pulling from a power bank as the 16 N52 magnets held the phone tightly to the stand’s soft-touch surface. The spec sheet says it’ll charge a phone at 5W/7.5W/10W/15W/25W, earbuds at up to 5W, and an Apple Watch at up to 5W.If you’re looking to jump on the wireless Qi2.2 train, own a bunch of Apple gear, and like to travel light, then Kuxiu’s X40 Turbo charging stand should be on your short list. Even if you can’t take advantage of that 25W max charge, you can still benefit from its extreme portability with a little future-proofing baked in.PreviousNext1/5Ready for triple charging action. It can fold in a variety of ways if you only need to charge one or two devices.
