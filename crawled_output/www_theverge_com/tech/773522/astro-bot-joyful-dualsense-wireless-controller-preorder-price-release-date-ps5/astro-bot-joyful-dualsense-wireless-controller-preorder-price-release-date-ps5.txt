Previously, he was a freelance writer for Popular Mechanics, Men’s Health, and Esquire.If you missed out on the limited edition Astro Bot DualSense wireless controller for PlayStation 5 last year, we have good news: Sony is launching a new “Joyful” version of the gamepad for $84.99 on October 30th, and preorders have just begun at the PlayStation store, as well as at Walmart, Best Buy, and GameStop.Astro Bot “Joyful” DualSense wireless controller$85$85$85 at PlayStationLast year, Sony and Team Asobi — the developer behind Astro Bot — released a limited-edition DualSense controller to commemorate the game’s launch. It featured several charming design elements that mimicked the look of Astro, including shiny blue accents on the handles and buttons and big googly eyes on the touchpad. Unfortunately, it sold out quickly, and again after a subsequent restock.The previous Astro Bot DualSense controller had eyes that were wide open. Image: SonyThe latest Astro Bot Joyful DualSense looks similar to the first model, complete with the blue grips and buttons and carved-in sci-fi lines. The most notable difference is the eyes on the touchpad are slightly squinting instead of fully open, giving it a more cutesy and joyful expression. Like last time, the eyes are drawn onto the touchpad and don’t actually emote. Otherwise, the Joyful edition offers the same haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, motion controls, and built-in microphone as a standard DualSense.RelatedAstro Bot is the game you buy a PS5 forSony has raised PS5 pricesResale listings for last year’s Astro Bot DualSense controller remain marked up on sites like eBay, making it impossible to find without paying well above the retail price. The good news is you don’t have to pay a premium on the Joyful version since PS5 accessories are unaffected by Sony’s recent price hikes. However, we’re expecting it to sell out quickly like the previous version. If you’re not interested in the Astro Bot Joyful DualSense, Sony offers other themed DualSense controllers, including one for Helldivers 2, Spider-Man 2, and Ghost of Yotei in black and gold — all of which run for $84.99.Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
