He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.One of the biggest stories out of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Summit in Maui isn’t just about Qualcomm — it’s how Google is finally merging Android and ChromeOS to create a new operating system for computers. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon revealed that it’s finally happening, and now, a Google exec has revealed when it’s happening, too.It’s “something we’re super excited about for next year,” said Google’s Sameer Samat, head of Android Ecosystem, at the tail end of Qualcomm’s announcement keynote.RelatedGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google exec: ‘We’re going to be combining ChromeOS and Android’Google reveals it isn’t making tablets, smart rings, flip phones, or glasses (yet)More:If you think about the laptop form factor, we’ve had ChromeOS for a long time and we’re super committed to that platform and it’s been really successful for us, we’ve learned a lot from it as well. We also have Android tablets that have been super successful, they’re becoming more productivity machines all the time. So I think the opportunity for us that we see is how do we accelerate all the AI advancement that we’re doing on Android and bring that to the laptop form factor as rapidly as possible, and also have the laptop and the rest of the Android ecosystem work seamlessly together.So what we’re doing is we’re basically taking the ChromeOS experience and re-baselining the technology underneath it on Android. So that combination is something we’re super excited about for next year, and we’re working with yourselves and others on it, and we can’t wait.(I’m not sure about that whole “Android tablets have been super successful” part, but hey.)Neither Qualcomm nor Google have said precisely how they’re working together on the combined OS, but Qualcomm doesn’t just make the most popular flagship Android phone processor — here’s the new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 that’ll likely appear in the next Samsung Galaxy — but also PC chips now.Today, it announced the Snapdragon X2 Elite and Elite Extreme with claims that they’re the most efficient chips available for Windows PCs. That announcement came without a mention of Google or Android or Chrome, but it wouldn’t be surprising if an Android for PC targeted those chips or similar.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Sean HollisterCloseSean HollisterSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Sean HollisterAndroidCloseAndroidPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AndroidChromeCloseChromePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ChromeGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
