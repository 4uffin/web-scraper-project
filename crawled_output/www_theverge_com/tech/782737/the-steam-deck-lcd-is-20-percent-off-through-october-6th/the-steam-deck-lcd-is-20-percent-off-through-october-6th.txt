He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined The Verge in May 2025.The Steam Autumn Sale starts next Monday, but Valve dropped an early treat in the form of a rare Steam Deck LCD discount. The 256GB model that normally sells for $399.99 is $319.20 through October 6th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. I, for one, thank Valve for dropping this deal now instead of when the servers inevitably hiccup at the start of the game sale.For anyone out there deciding between the Steam Deck LCD, the pricier OLED, and perhaps other handhelds, it’s tough to beat the value of this discounted model. The Deck will be four years old in February, but it’s still a contender when it comes to good, reliable performance in PC games, especially considering how power-efficient it is. Another perk: it runs SteamOS, not Windows 11.Also, game compatibility across Steam is generally great (more and more developers are building games with the Steam Deck’s specs in mind ahead of launch), and Valve has patched the Steam Deck frequently throughout the years with new features. It didn’t start out great, but it eventually got there.Sure, the $549 Steam Deck OLED boasts some nice perks that some will be willing to pay extra for, like a bigger battery, a 90Hz refresh rate OLED, faster Wi-Fi 6E. But at just over $200 less, you’re getting a pretty similar gaming experience in the Steam Deck LCD.RelatedLenovo Legion Go S review part two: you were the chosen one!Steam Deck (LCD)$319$39920% off$319The Steam Deck is a portable handheld console you can use to play PC games.Read More$319 at Steam (256GB)0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Cameron FaulknerCloseCameron FaulknerEditor, CommercePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Cameron FaulknerDealsCloseDealsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All DealsEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingPC GamingClosePC GamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PC GamingTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoVerge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
