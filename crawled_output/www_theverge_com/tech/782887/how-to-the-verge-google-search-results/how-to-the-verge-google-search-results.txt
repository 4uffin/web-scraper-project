And not all of those changes are welcome.Thankfully, there’s now a way to customize what you see in search — and to prioritize seeing The Verge. You can do this by selecting The Verge as a preferred source in Google. This tells Google that you want to see us in the “Top stories” carousel on its search results page whenever our coverage is relevant to your search.The easiest way to do this is to click this link and check the box that says The Verge, and you’ll be set.You can also follow The Verge in Discover, the feed that lives on the homescreen of the Google app, by tapping “Follow” when you see us appear in your feed. In a similar vein, Google will then prioritize showing our content in your Discover feed.Why are we asking you to do this? The Google search landscape is not at all what it once was. Google is showing fewer standard blue links and more YouTube videos, social posts, forum pages, sponsored results, and, of course, AI Overviews — and these are all subject to change every time Google’s algorithms reevaluate the web.Google says that the goal of its search results pages is to provide audiences with the most helpful, relevant content for their searches, but this is happening to varying degrees of success. Major news publishers are having an increasingly hard time reaching readers, and Reddit is somehow everywhere. Smaller sites have been hit hard by the algorithm’s preference for more recognizable brands. AI Overviews continue to simply give bad information.When you do a search, you may indeed want to watch a video, poke around on discussion forums, or get a quick answer from AI, but sometimes you do just want to click on a link. Google itself admitted that it isn’t done experimenting with new features, and its algorithms will continue to shake up even blue links in search results. It remains to be seen how the company will keep serving its users’ needs in these ways while maintaining a healthy internet ecosystem.These customization features, though, are a win. In a world where users have so little control over search results, Google allowing you to personalize your sources on its two major surfaces is an unexpected, but welcome, move. Google has also long stressed to SEO experts the importance of building a trustworthy, authoritative brand to see success in search. Providing an option for readers to follow individual brands is a surprisingly direct application of that.We hope you choose to add us as a preferred source and follow us in Discover. Give us a shout if you do — we’ll be very grateful.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Alexia LaFataCloseAlexia LaFataPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Alexia LaFataGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
