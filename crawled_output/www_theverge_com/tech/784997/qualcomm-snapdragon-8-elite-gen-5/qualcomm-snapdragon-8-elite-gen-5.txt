Previously, she worked at DPReview.Qualcomm has formally unveiled its latest flagship SoC, destined for Android flagships in the very near future: the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. The name was revealed by way of a blog post last week, and if it seems like the company skipped forward a generation or two, that’s kind of the point. It features a third-generation Oryon CPU with boosted single- and multi-core performance, as well as a faster Hexagon NPU, with an emphasis on personalized, on-device AI experiences.The updated CPU comprises two prime cores of up to 4.6GHz and six performance cores up to 3.62GHz. Qualcomm claims up to 35 percent better power efficiency from the CPU, contributing to a 16 percent improvement in overall SoC efficiency. The updated Adreno GPU claims an increase of up to 23 percent in overall gaming performance, along with a 20 percent drop in power consumption.The updated Hexagon NPU likewise claims 37 percent faster performance as well as power savings over the previous version. Qualcomm suggests these improvements — along with use of its Snapdragon Sensing Hub — could enable more personalized AI that continues to learn about the user over time.On the camera side of things, the updated ISP supports the APV (Advanced Professional Video) codec. Qualcomm also claims to enable a “computational video pipeline.” Qualcomm’s Alex Katouzian explained at the company’s announcement keynote that this allows for AI enhancements to video on a frame-by-frame level. The ISP also enables context-aware autofocus, auto exposure, and auto white balance.The 8 Elite Gen 5 uses an X85 modem, announced earlier this year, which boasts 50 percent lower gaming latency thanks to “AI-enhanced Wi-Fi.” We’ll start seeing devices with the 8 Elite Gen 5 from all the usual Android suspects soon enough.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Allison JohnsonCloseAllison JohnsonPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Allison JohnsonMobileCloseMobilePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MobileNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
