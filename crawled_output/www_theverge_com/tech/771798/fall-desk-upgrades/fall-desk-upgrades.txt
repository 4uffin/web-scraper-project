He previously wrote for Business Insider, Rolling Stone, Futurism, and Popular Science.Your desk should feel truly yours. If you want a boxed copy of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time for the Super Nintendo next to your high-end monitor for no reason other than it makes you happy, go for it. However, it’s important to balance fun with function; your desk space needs to be equipped to help you get work done. Everyone’s desk is going to look different, and it’s clear from our “What’s on your desk” series that every Verge writer’s setup is unique.There are some common basics that we think every desk should have: a pair of noise-canceling headphones, a wireless charging stand, and perhaps a paper notebook and an analog timer, too. But there’s a whole lot more you can do to create an amazing setup. From a pot of flowers you’ll never have to water to color-changing light bars, here are some upgrades that we think will elevate your desk setup.Kanto YU2 Powered Desktop Speakers$300$300If you listen to music or podcasts while you work, Kanto’s YU2MB desktop speakers will be a big upgrade over the ones in your laptop or monitor. The compact desktop speakers have a dual-driver audio system powered by a 100W Class D amplifier and feature a built-in DAC, plus USB and aux ports for dongle-free connectivity. If you want extra bass, and have space under your desk, you can connect a powered subwoofer.Read More$300 at AmazonBranch Ergonomic Chair$359$359Sitting in an uncomfortable chair for eight or more hours a day can reduce your focus and cause back pain. Branch’s Ergonomic Chair has eight points of adjustment, including height and tilt, plus removable arm and lumbar rests. The chair’s wheels can roll on hard surfaces and rugs. A pro model with additional points of adjustment, adjustable lumbar, and more premium materials is also available. Read More$359 at AmazonRode NT1 (5th Generation) Microphone$249$249Any aspiring podcaster should consider Rode’s NT1, an XLR and USB condenser microphone that can be connected directly to your PC, or through an audio interface like Focusrite’s Scarlett Solo. The mic comes with a shock mount and pop filter, so you can attach it to a mount and avoid unwanted distortion in your recordings. Rode also includes an XLR and USB-C to USB-C cable.Read More$249 at AmazonDaily Bliss Stone Paper Notebook$26$26It’s helpful to have a notebook on hand to jot down quick notes, ideas, or sketches before you get distracted by the next notification on your phone or computer. The pages of Daily Bliss’ Stone Paper Notebook are waterproof, so you won’t lose everything if a glass of water spills on it, and its elastic binding will keep the book closed when you carry it around.Read More$26 at AmazonIkea Tarnaby Table Lamp$30$30Some desk upgrades are functional and make your workspace a little more fun, and that’s definitely true of Ikea’s Tarnaby. Its single bulb is surrounded by a glass enclosure that makes it look like an old-school kerosene lamp. Its brightness knob lets you dim or raise its luminosity, so you can raise it in stages as the sun goes down.Read More$30 at IkeaRazer Gigantus V2 Mouse Pad$25$25Most modern mice can be used on any surface, but Razer’s Gigantus V2 was designed with materials that allow your mouse to glide easily with almost no surface tension. The XXL-sized mat is wide and deep enough to fit a keyboard, mouse, and your computer monitor. The padding will also be more comfortable under your wrists than a hard desk.Read More$25 at AmazonMount-It Monitor Arm$36$36Many monitors don’t offer height-adjusting stands, and staring at a screen with your neck craned at an awkward angle can cause soreness. Mount-It’s monitor arm replaces your monitor’s stand and lets you position your display at the height and angle of your choice. It’s compatible with monitors between 13 and 32 inches that support VESA 75 x 75 or 100 x 100 stands.Read More$36 at AmazonGovee RGBICWW Flow Plus Light Bars$36$6040% off$36You don’t have to be a gamer to appreciate what Govee’s Flow Plus Light Bars can add to your desk setup.

Their colors can be changed through Govee’s app, or through a smart speaker with Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant.Read More$36 at AmazonQlt Qiaoletong Epiphyllum Set$27$297% off$27Many people keep flowers on their desk, but they need to be watered and can cause a mess if they tip over. Qlt Qiaoletong’s 835-piece Epiphyllum set has none of those downsides. Instead, you get a potted plant with four epiphyllums in various states of bloom, along with a few additional plants shooting up from the “dirt.” Orchid and Rose sets are also available if you want more options. Read More$27 at AmazonGrovemade Desk$2900$32009% off$2900Let’s face it, no desk upgrade is as significant as a brand-new desk.
