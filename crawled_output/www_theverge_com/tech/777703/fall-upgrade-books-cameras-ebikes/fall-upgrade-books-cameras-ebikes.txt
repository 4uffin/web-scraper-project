Summer, a time for vacations and relaxation, is over. And now, we must look to the start of a new school year and a renewed attention to work. It can sometimes be difficult to make the transition — many of us would rather spend a little more time in that hammock than planning the next project — and so we’ve put together a group of articles to try and help make it easier.There’s a wide range of articles here to encourage you to upgrade to a more stimulated, constructive year. We polled our staff on the books that changed their lives and the non-technical tools they use to stay productive. We have recommendations for ways that you can upgrade your desk, find inexpensive but useful keyboards, and try out smart lighting. And we have personal accounts of how an e-bike changed the life of one of our staffers and how an aspiring photographer discovered how film cameras can make all the difference.We hope that these articles help you greet the new season with renewed energy and give you some tips on how to upgrade both your technology and your life.Read More Welcome to our pen-and-paper clubThe Verge’s favorite lower-tech productivity tools.Verge StaffSep 16Upgrade your everyday carry setup with these 22 picksIt’s time for an everyday carry upgrade, and our gift guide is full of handy essentials to make every day better.Cameron FaulknerSep 17Seven indie games that will upgrade your downtime this fallHere are some recommendations for great games from 2025 that shouldn’t take too long to finish.Jay PetersSep 18Why I ‘upgraded’ to a film camera that’s older than I amIt’s probably not the reason you think.Dominic PrestonSep 19How I went from an e-bike hater to a believer﻿Sometimes an upgrade means changing your thinking.Allison JohnsonSep 19Welcome to our pen-and-paper clubThe Verge’s favorite lower-tech productivity tools.Verge StaffSep 16Upgrade your everyday carry setup with these 22 picksIt’s time for an everyday carry upgrade, and our gift guide is full of handy essentials to make every day better.Cameron FaulknerSep 17Seven indie games that will upgrade your downtime this fallHere are some recommendations for great games from 2025 that shouldn’t take too long to finish.Jay PetersSep 18Why I ‘upgraded’ to a film camera that’s older than I amIt’s probably not the reason you think.Dominic PrestonSep 19How I went from an e-bike hater to a believer﻿Sometimes an upgrade means changing your thinking.Allison JohnsonSep 19The VergeThe Verge logo.FacebookThreadsInstagramYoutubeRSSContactTip UsCommunity GuidelinesAboutEthics StatementHow We Rate and Review ProductsCookie SettingsTerms of UsePrivacy NoticeCookie PolicyLicensing FAQAccessibilityPlatform Status© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.
