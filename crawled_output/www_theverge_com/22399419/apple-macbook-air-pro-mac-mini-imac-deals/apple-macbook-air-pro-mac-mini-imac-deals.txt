Di Benedetto / The VergeEditor’s note: Amazon’s fall Prime Day event kicks off on October 7th; however, if you want to shop ahead of the two-day sale, we’ve rounded up the best early Prime Day deals you can already get.Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points, all of which run the company’s new operating system, macOS 26. It discontinued the M1 MacBook Air to make room for newer models, but Walmart is still selling the 2020 laptop starting at $599 — $50 off its previous low and a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro.Purchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy. Apple has recently shaken things up by increasing the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before (and thus, more opportunities for discounts). For example, the latest MacBook Air 13 with Apple’s M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is down to $799 ($200 off) at Best Buy.In this articleThe best MacBook Air dealsThe best MacBook Pro dealsM4 and M4 Pro MacBook ProThe best Mac Mini dealsAlthough Macs may not get perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $800. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store provides a one-year warranty on all products, and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.RelatedThe best laptops you can getA modder created the iPadBook that Apple won’tI tested a bunch of gaming laptops and these are the bestThe best MacBook Air dealsM1 MacBook AirThe 2020 M1 MacBook Air was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and brick-and-mortar stores. It’s still a great choice if you want a MacBook for non-intensive productivity work, especially given that it features a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, but since newer Mac laptops handily outperform it, you won’t find it in our guide to the best laptops.The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has committed to keeping it around for the foreseeable future and is currently discounting it to $599 ($50 off), which is its lowest price to date.2020 MacBook Air with M1 (256GB)$599$6498% off$599The 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold).Read More$599 at WalmartM2 MacBook AirThe M2 MacBook Air is a slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Given that it’s slightly newer than the M1, it delivers better performance, but if you want to really futureproof your laptop, we recommend spending slightly more for a laptop that has a faster, newer processor.Still here for the M2? It has some downsides to be on the lookout for, including slower storage in the base 256GB configuration, and the notch cut-out in its screen is divisive (Apple shows no signs of ditching it, either).RelatedAppleCare One is for Apple’s biggest fansHere are the laptops I’d tell any parent to consider for their back-to-school studentThe M2-powered MacBook Air from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning; however, you can still get the 13-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors at Best Buy starting at $699 ($100 off). The 15-inch MacBook Air M2 is also still available in short supply at some retailers for its original MSRP, though at this point, you’d be better off going with a discounted M4 model.13-inch MacBook Air with M2 (2022)$699$79913% off$699The 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a better display than its predecessor while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging.Read More$699 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)M3 MacBook AirApple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in 2023 in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance over the previous generation and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also offer 18 hours of battery life and have a MagSafe charging port. Apple discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM in 2024 and now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration.RelatedApple MacBook Air M3 review: small upgradesThe best iPhones in 2025The entry-level 13-inch M3 MacBook Air configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is tough to find in stock. However, you can get the 24GB RAM / 512GB SSD model with a 10-core GPU for $1,299 in select colors at Best Buy. This model has previously sold for $1,099, so we normally recommend it if you want double the amount of internal storage and additional memory without spending too much more.As for the M3-powered 15-inch MacBook Air, you can buy it in select colors at Best Buy with 512GB of storage, 16GB of RAM, and a 10-core GPU for $1,099 ($200 off). If you need even more memory, the model with 512GB of storage, 24GB of RAM, and a 10-core GPU is available for $1,199 ($450 off) at Best Buy and B&H Photo.13-inch MacBook Air with M3 (2024)$1299$1299The MacBook Air M3 is a jack-of-all-trades, with a balanced combination of performance and power efficiency. It also now supports dual displays with the lid closed, and the storage speed is noticeably faster. You don’t need to think about if this laptop will meet your needs — it just will.Read More$1299 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)Apple MacBook Air M3 (15-inch)$1099$129915% off$1099The 15-inch MacBook Air is also equipped with Apple’s M3 chip. It features a larger display and better speaker array than the 13-inch MacBook Air M3. As of October 2024, it starts with 16GB of RAM instead of the original 8GB when it launched.Read More$1099 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)M4 MacBook AirIn March, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, it comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like.RelatedApple MacBook Air M4 review: a little more for a little lessThe unbearable sameness of Liquid GlassBoth the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some sizable discounts. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at Amazon in select colors starting $799 ($200 off). If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.13-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)$799$99920% off$799Powered by the M4 chip, Apple’s latest 13-inch MacBook Air is faster than its predecessor and offers double the base RAM.

However, it includes a six-speaker sound system, not four, and your choice of a free 35W Dual USB‑C Port Compact Power Adapter or 70W USB‑C Power Adapter.Read More$999 at Amazon$999 at Best Buy$999 at B&H PhotoThe best MacBook Pro dealsDuring its “Scary Fast” event in 2023, Apple announced MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up with M4-based machines in October 2024, but the last-gen M3 models can often be the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts.M3 and M3 Pro MacBook ProThe entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).RelatedApple MacBook Pro 14 (M3, 2023) review: entry-level enigmaThe M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup.We’re having trouble finding the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock. Best Buy is selling the 14-inch, M3-powered MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a 10-core GPU for $1,599, which isn’t a discount (and we think most people should not settle for 8GB of RAM in 2025). If you need a higher-powered laptop with a larger display, you can get the 16-inch, M3 Pro-powered MacBook Pro with 36GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and an 18-core GPU for $2,099 ($700 off) at Best Buy.14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (2023)$1599$1599Apple’s previous-gen 14-inch laptop powered by the M3 processor uses a similar design to the pricier 14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s Pro- / Max-series chips but is offered at a lower price with similar ports and less RAM.Read More$1599 at Best Buy (8GB RAM, 1TB SSD)M4 and M4 Pro MacBook ProApple released the M4-series MacBook Pro in November 2024. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new in this model is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.RelatedThe M4 MacBook Pro features a quantum dot displayThe best iPad to buyApple barely talked about AI at its big iPhone 17 eventThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option.Many variations of the M4 MacBook Pro with different screen and processor configurations are on sale right now. For example, you can currently pick up the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD at Amazon for $1,299.99 ($300 off). Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,799 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.The base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,229.30 (about $269 off) at Amazon.Apple MacBook Pro 14 (2024, M4)$1299$159919% off$1299The entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM — double that of its predecessor — and a 512GB SSD for the same starting price of $1,599.

Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.M4 and M4 Pro Mac MiniDeals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.In addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.RelatedApple TV Plus is getting more expensive and will cost $12.99 per monthSatechi’s new SSD enclosure matches the Mac MiniThis Mac Mini Kensington security lock makes sure it can’t escapeRight now, you can get the base Mac Mini at B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $499 ($100 off).
