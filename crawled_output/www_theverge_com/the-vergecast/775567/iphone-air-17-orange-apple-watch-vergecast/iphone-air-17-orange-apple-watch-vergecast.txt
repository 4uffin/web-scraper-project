Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.Apple’s 2025 fall event was not the splashiest set of announcements in the company’s history. Some phones, some watches, some headphones, some cases. Some good stuff! But there was only one thing that seemingly caused deep feelings in everyone, both live in Cupertino, California, and online: the orange iPhone. THE ORANGE IPHONE.On this episode of The Vergecast, we talk a lot about the orange iPhone. We also talk through the rest of Apple’s announcements! First, The Verge’s Allison Johnson joins the show to discuss the super-thin iPhone Air, as well as the new iPhone 17 and 17 Pro models. The base model looks better than ever, we have lots of questions about cameras, and it turns out that a really thin phone actually might matter after all.

We chat about the new AirPods Pro 3, which might be the most straightforwardly awesome thing that Apple announced this week. We also talk about what’s the same and what’s different about the new Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 11, and Apple Watch Ultra 3. Apple’s wearable story is increasingly a health story, and we have some thoughts.Finally, The Verge’s Jake Kastrenakes tells us the tale of his very first journey to Apple Park and what it’s like to cover one of these events in person. We also talk through Apple’s big push on accessories, the surprising lack of AI talk, and whether the world is truly ready for Liquid Glass.If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started:The eight biggest announcements during Apple’s iPhone Air eventApple announces the ultra-slim iPhone AiriPhone Air hands-onThe iPhone 17 Pro’s orange is good — and well timedApple’s iPhone 17 Pro has the biggest battery of any iPhone Apple’s iPhone 17 drops the Plus, but gains a bigger, faster displayiPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max: our initial hands-on impressionsApple’s new iPhone Air accessories include a slim MagSafe battery, TechWoven case, and crossbody strapThe new iPhones all have Center Stage front-facing camerasApple announces AirPods Pro 3 with ‘world’s best ANC’ and heart rate sensing The Apple Watch Ultra 3 has 42 hours of battery life and satellite connectivity Apple announces new entry-level $249 Apple Watch SE 3 with always-on displayThe iPhone Air’s battery pack is slim, but not as slim as the iPhone AirApple barely talked about AI at its big iPhone 17 eventiOS 26 is out on September 15th0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.David PierceCloseDavid PierceEditor-at-LargePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by David PierceAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleApple EventCloseApple EventPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Apple EventiPhoneCloseiPhonePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All iPhonePodcastsClosePodcastsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PodcastsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechVergecastCloseVergecastPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All VergecastMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
