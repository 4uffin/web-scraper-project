Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.There’s a lot happening in the world of artificial intelligence. There is always a lot happening in the world of artificial intelligence. The money is enormous; the stakes are high; the products are, well, all over the place. Sit on your couch and read about it all long enough, and you’re bound to feel some strong feelings.On this episode of The Vergecast, we get into some of those feelings. But first, David and Jake catch up on the week’s remaining gadget news. In addition to all the Apple gadgets we discussed on Wednesday’s episode, there’s also the fact that the new AirPods Pro 3 don’t ship with a charging cable, a smart rebuttal to our bad takes on the crossbody strap, and some interesting (and orange!) new Beats headphones lurking. We also wonder what happened to Daily Hub, and what that “Talk” button might mean on Nothing’s next earbuds.
