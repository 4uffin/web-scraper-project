Projectors inside of party speakers. And my personal favorite: a robot that’s built to ferry another robot.This week on The Vergecast, we’re talking about our favorite tech (so far!) from the huge trade show that’s going on right now in Berlin. Jen joins Vee and I to discuss some of the biggest trends, starting with the wild ways that robot vacuums are learnings to climb stairs. Then we take a deep dive into the major upgrades to the Philips Hue lineup, where a decade’s worth of light bulbs are getting upgraded with motion sensing abilities, as long as you buy a new hub to power it all.Then Lauren joins us to talk about the outcome of the Google antitrust trial. The judge handed down his remedies this week, and everyone except for Google seems to be unhappy about it.

We talk about Garmin’s very expensive new smartwatch, Amazon cutting back its Prime perks, how the Pixel 10 Pro’s AI zoom feature totally botched the moon, why Instagram finally came to the iPad, and the wild journey that the FTC’s lone Democratic commissioner has been on.If you want to read more about the stories we discussed, check out the links below.Eufy built a stairlift for its robovacsPhilips Hue lights get bigger, brighter, and cheaper with a major product refreshInside Philips Hue’s plans to make all your lights motion sensorsYour Sonos speakers can now control your Hue lightsPhilips Hue responds to cheaper competitors with major product overhaulSwitchBot has ambitions to be the AI that powers your smart homeGoogle gets to keep Chrome, judge rules in search antitrust caseGoogle critics think the search remedies ruling is a total whiffHere’s what Google and the DOJ had to say about the search remedies rulingThe tech antitrust renaissance may already be overGarmin’s Fenix 8 Pro series finally lets you leave your phone at home — sort ofAmazon ends shared Prime free shipping outside your homeHere’s how the Pixel’s AI zoom compares to a real 100x lensInstagram is coming to iPad, 15 years laterOusted Democratic FTC commissioner can return (again) for now0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jacob KastrenakesCloseJacob KastrenakesExecutive EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jacob KastrenakesPodcastsClosePodcastsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PodcastsVergecastCloseVergecastPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All VergecastMost PopularMost PopularSpotify Lossless is an inconvenient improvementThe iPhone to get this yearApple’s new iPhone charger is a first of its kindPhone batteries are getting more compact, but the US is missing outThe Helldivers community is coping with a spotlight it doesn’t wantThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
