Projectors inside of party speakers. And my personal favorite: a robot that’s built to ferry another robot.This week on The Vergecast, we’re talking about our favorite tech (so far!) from the huge trade show that’s going on right now in Berlin. Jen joins Vee and I to discuss some of the biggest trends, starting with the wild ways that robot vacuums are learnings to climb stairs. Then we take a deep dive into the major upgrades to the Philips Hue lineup, where a decade’s worth of light bulbs are getting upgraded with motion sensing abilities, as long as you buy a new hub to power it all.Then Lauren joins us to talk about the outcome of the Google antitrust trial.
