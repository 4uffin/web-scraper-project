He has covered tech, policy, and online creators for over a decade.Disney gave in to threats from FCC chairman and occasional speech regulator Brendan Carr this evening, announcing that Jimmy Kimmel Live! would be pulled off the air “indefinitely.” Carr was unhappy that Kimmel said the “MAGA gang” was trying to characterize the alleged shooter of Charlie Kirk as “anything other than one of them” and threatened to pull broadcast licenses of stations airing his show as a result.The clip of Kimmel’s monologue that got him pulled off the air is still available on YouTube. Watch it for yourself and see if it’s so objectionable as to warrant pulling the entire show, let alone entire broadcast networks that air it.RelatedJimmy Kimmel Live pulled ‘indefinitely’ for joke about Charlie Kirk’s killer after FCC threatRepublicans are honoring Charlie Kirk’s memory by declaring war on the First Amendment“We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said near the top of his monologue. The remarks come just after the 2-minute mark in the clip on YouTube.Carr has regularly used his position as FCC chairman to try to manipulate speech by broadcasters that rely on his agency. He previously implied that CBS’s cancellation of Steven Colbert’s late-night show helped get the company’s merger with Paramount approved. The companies had to agree to government speech regulations in order to seal the deal.The Verge has reached out to the FCC to ask what specifically in Kimmel’s show is objectionable and which rules it is in violation of. The commission did not immediately provide comment.Clarification, September 18th: Adjusted phrasing in the first paragraph to clarify how Kimmel phrased his comment.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jacob KastrenakesCloseJacob KastrenakesExecutive EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jacob KastrenakesEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyPoliticsClosePoliticsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PoliticsSpeechCloseSpeechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SpeechTV ShowsCloseTV ShowsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TV ShowsMost PopularMost PopularAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsMeta’s failed smart glasses demos had nothing to do with the Wi-FiNest is dead, long live Google HomeI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoYes, Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension was government censorshipThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
