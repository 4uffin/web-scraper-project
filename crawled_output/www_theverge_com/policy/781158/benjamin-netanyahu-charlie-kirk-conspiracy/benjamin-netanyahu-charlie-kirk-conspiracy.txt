Although Kirk had been deeply pro-Israel, he had begun criticizing Israel and Netanyahu’s government for their invasion of Gaza — an increasingly popular stance among younger right-wing voters.On Monday, Candace Owens, an influencer who had been pushed out of Turning Point for her comments about Adolf Hitler, suggested on her podcast that Israel was trying to silence a high-profile MAGA critic. She claimed, without evidence, that Kirk had been “threatened” by hedge fund billionaire and MAGA ally Bill Ackman, who is Jewish and pro-Israel, to change his position.“Now, some are peddling these disgusting rumors — perhaps out of obsession, perhaps with Qatari funding,” said Netanyahu.Though she’s one of the very few, if any, who’s openly tied Kirk’s death to Israel, influencers closer to the MAGA mainstream have suggested that Kirk was facing pressure from the Netanyahu government to dial back on his critiques. Megyn Kelly and Tucker Carlson, two high-profile conservative podcasters, recently claimed on their shows that Kirk had told them in private conversations that he’d become increasingly uncomfortable with Israeli pressure to dial back on the criticism.Carlson also claimed that Kirk had told him he “hated” Netanyahu. “Benjamin Netanyahu really tormented Charlie,” he said Wednesday on his show, speaking to Kelly. “We talked about it many times. He tormented Charlie, and his advocates tormented Charlie. For him to run around saying that Charlie died for Israel. It’s just too much. It’s just disgusting.”0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Tina NguyenCloseTina NguyenSenior Reporter, WashingtonPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tina NguyenPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyPoliticsClosePoliticsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PoliticsMost PopularMost PopularNest is dead, long live Google HomeI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failureFirst look at the Google Home app powered by GeminiAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
