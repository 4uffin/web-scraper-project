Whether it’s the rules for Apple’s App Store or Facebook’s plan for fighting misinformation, tech platform policies can have enormous ripple effects on the rest of society. They’re so powerful that, increasingly, companies aren’t setting them alone but sharing the fight with government regulators, civil society groups, and internal standards bodies like Meta’s Oversight Board. The result is an ongoing political struggle over harassment, free speech, copyright, and dozens of other issues, all mediated through some of the largest and most chaotic electronic spaces the world has ever seen.Trump signs ‘Saving TikTok’ order to start resolving its big ban problemGiving TikTok’s US operations new ownership is meant to satisfy the nationwide ban-or-divest law targeting ByteDance.Emma Roth and Tina NguyenSep 25Silicon Valley’s latest argument against regulating AI: that would literally be the Antichrist﻿This is a real thing Peter Thiel told a group of tech professionals recently.Tina NguyenSep 25Latest In PolicySExternal LinkSarah JeongAn hour agoLinkTrump takes hard anti-anti-fascist stance.The White House has released a national security presidential memorandum on fighting “domestic terrorism,” which apparently includes doxing ICE agents. The document outlines a sweeping strategy to investigate and harass a broad swath of organizations and institutions that the White House claims are anti-American.There are common recurrent motivations and indicia uniting this pattern of violent and terroristic activities under the umbrella of self-described “anti-fascism.” These movements portray foundational American principles (e.g., support for law enforcement and border control) as “fascist” to justify and encourage acts of violent revolution. This “anti-fascist” lie has become the organizing rallying cry used by domestic terrorists to wage a violent assault against democratic institutions, constitutional rights, and fundamental American liberties. Common threads animating this violent conduct include anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence[The White House]LLauren FeinerTwo hours agoLink“It might be easier to just shut down AdX.”Craycroft made this suggestion after testifying that potential buyers for AdX from Big Tech or existing ad exchanges could create new competition concerns.

The DOJ is trying to show that Google’s own analyses indicate it would be feasible to spin out the product.LLauren FeinerSep 25LinkGoogle muddies the waters about the feasibility of a break up.During cross examination, Google attorney Jeannie Rhee walked through a long list of proprietary Google tools and asked Weissman if he found replacements for them outside of Google.
