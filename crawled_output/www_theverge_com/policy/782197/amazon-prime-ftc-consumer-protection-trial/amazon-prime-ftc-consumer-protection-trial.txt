She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform.Amazon is about to face a roughly month-long trial against the US Federal Trade Commission in Seattle to defend its Prime program from claims it tricked tens of millions of customers into signing up for the membership and made it hard to quit.It’s one of several Big Tech trials the US government has initiated that’s taking place this year, but the first major one in recent history against Amazon. Jury selection in the case will begin on Monday, which will be followed by opening arguments in the case. The FTC has separately sued Amazon for allegedly anticompetitive practices in a case that’s set to begin in early 2027.The case beginning Monday alleges that Amazon deceived consumers about its sign-up and cancellation process for Prime benefits in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act (ROSCA), which requires sellers to get consumers’ informed consent to charge them. The FTC alleges that Amazon used design tricks known as dark patterns to get users to sign up for Prime even when they might not have wanted to or without realizing what they were getting into. Once locked into a recurring subscription, the FTC alleges, Amazon made it difficult for users to cancel, and slow-rolled changes that would have made it easier for customers to do so, but cost Amazon revenue.Amazon executives could be held personally liable for violations if the FTC is able to prove them during the trialThe government already won a significant ruling last week from Judge John Chun, who found on summary judgement that Amazon violated ROSCA by collecting customers’ billing information before disclosing the material terms of the Prime membership. Chun also ruled that two Amazon executives could be held personally liable for violations if the FTC is able to prove them during the trial. Chun earlier admonished Amazon for withholding documents from the FTC in a way that was “tantamount to bad faith.”Amazon has denied it violated the law, with spokesperson Heather Layman calling the claims “false on the facts and the law” when it was filed in 2023. “The truth is that customers love Prime, and by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership.” The company agreed to simplify its Prime cancellation process in Europe in 2022 in response to pressure from regulators there.Going after recurring subscription fees has been a popular tactic among both Republicans and Democrats. Lina Khan, who ran the FTC during the Biden administration, championed the click-to-cancel rule to make it as easy to cancel a membership as sign up, but it was struck down by an appeals court before taking effect. Current FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson opposed the rule as a commissioner, but the agency has continued the Amazon suit brought under Khan, and filed a new lawsuit against Uber for allegedly making it difficult to cancel its Uber One food/grocery/rideshare discount subscription.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Lauren FeinerCloseLauren FeinerSenior Policy ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Lauren FeinerAmazonCloseAmazonPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AmazonPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
