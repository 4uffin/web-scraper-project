Google redux: all the news from the ad tech trialby
Verge StaffLinkFacebookThreadsRSSComments0CommentsOn April 17th, 2025, Judge Brinkema ruled that Google did act illegally to acquire and maintain monopoly power in online advertising. Now, DOJ and Google lawyers are returning to the courtroom to argue over whether this should lead to a Google breakup by forcing the company to sell its AdX exchange.In the initial trial, the DOJ argued that Google unfairly locked up the market for ad tech tools that publishers and advertisers rely on to monetize their websites and market their goods. Google responded that it created efficient products that work well for customers and said it faced plenty of competition.Read on below for all of the updates and notes from the case.HighlightsThe US government is taking a second stab at breaking up GoogleGoogle loses ad tech monopoly caseGoogle’s empire is under siegeGoogle and the DOJ’s ad tech fight is all about controlGoogle and DOJ return for round two of their antitrust fight — this time about adsTwo hours agoLauren FeinerSplitting up Google’s ad tech tools is technically feasible, DOJ witness says.Distributed systems expert Jonathan Weissman testified that separating AdX and DFP from Google’s infrastructure would not require a huge undertaking like a full rewrite of code. We expect to hear more from Weissman and others about the feasibility of a breakup tomorrow.Sep 24Lauren FeinerGoogle’s ad tools would be attractive to buyers, M&A witness says.Investment banker Paul Crisci evaluated whether AdX and DFP would be attractive assets for potential buyers if Google is forced to sell them. Crisci testified that at least in an initial assessment, plenty of companies in ad tech and adjacent markets would likely be interested in buying them.Sep 24Lauren FeinerWhat if we could just trust Google?During testimony from the DOJ’s expert economic witness Robin Lee, Judge Brinkema asked how necessary a forced sale of Google’s ad tech products would be if we assumed Google would faithfully follow all the restrictions on its behavior. Lee said if that were the case, behavioral restrictions could be sufficient but only if they could capture all problematic behavior upfront, and if deviations could be quickly detected.Sep 24Lauren FeinerDay 3 of trial kicks off.I’m back at court for the third day of the government’s case-in-chief. The judge made clear she wants to hear from more technical witnesses who can tell her about how the different proposals would work.Sep 23Lauren FeinerJudge wants to hear how a break up would work.Brinkema was getting tired of hearing from industry witnesses by the end of Tuesday, and told the parties she’s looking to home in on the technical feasibility of a break up and other remedies. The government said it would aim to cut to its technical witnesses when court resumes Wednesday.Sep 23Lauren FeinerAI hasn’t disrupted Google’s ad tech monopoly.That’s how several witnesses described the impact of the technology on Google’s dominance. While AI might be creating new opportunity in online ads, it hasn’t fundamentally changed the way display advertising works, and Google’s unshakeable hold on it, they testified.Sep 23Lauren Feiner‘I’m hopeful for the first time in a long time.’The Trade Desk Chief Revenue Officer Jed Dederick said after years of stagnation in the display ad market Google dominated, he’s finally optimistic it can see innovation with the right remedies. Google is painting the decline in display ads as a sign of its increasing irrelevance, but Dederick says a break up could incentivize more investment in it.Sep 23Lauren FeinerWitnesses disagree on how much of Google’s ad tech a buyer should be able to own.Government witnesses had different takes on whether a potential acquirer should be allowed buy both of Google’s sell-side tools, if forced to divest, or just one. Kevel’s Avery thinks it would work best to sell them together, but Omnicom’s Lambert fears that would just recreate the same problem that exists with Google.Sep 23Lauren FeinerTransparency is key.Government witnesses across the ad ecosystem have testified that transparency is at the top of their wishlist for remedies to achieve. That means knowing why some bids on ads win over others. They say that publishers and advertisers alike have little insight into this today, since that decision ultimately happens in the “black box” of Google’s ad server.Sep 23Lauren FeinerGovernment witnesses want it to go even further with a Google break up.Several witnesses for the DOJ have advocated that the government go even farther than it’s proposed by forcing Google to sell its publisher ad server from the outset, in addition to its ad exchange. “You can’t take half the antibiotics and hope the disease goes away,” Jay Friedman from the Goodway Group testified.Sep 23Lauren FeinerAdvertiser witness warns of short-term pain if Google were forced to sell AdX.Luke Lambert, who works for a subsidiary of Omnicom Media Group, testified that even a one day outage of Google’s AdX exchange would cause “extreme” pain for his team because they would need to scramble to find new ways to spend ad budgets. Google’s attorney is suggesting that could be the case if AdX has to be divested to a new buyer.Sep 23Lauren FeinerGoogle rivals line up as potential buyers for its ad tech.James Avery, who runs an ad server company for retailers called Kevel, testified he’d like to buy Google’s ad server and exchange, ideally together. Index Exchange CEO Andrew Casale is also interested. Google’s cross examination has tried to cast this interest as a way that the industry could reconsolidate under new ownership.Sep 23Lauren FeinerWe’re back for day 2 of the Google ad tech remedies trial.The government will continue its case-in-chief today, where it’s arguing for a break up of Google to restore competition to the markets for publisher ad tools. Yesterday, we heard from a publisher witness and a rival ad exchange CEO. Catch up on our coverage here.Sep 23Lauren FeinerGoogle begins its battle for the ‘unofficial currency of the internet’Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesGoogle has spent a decade sharpening its “weapons” in an industry that helps sustain large swaths of the open internet, the Justice Department argued before a federal judge Monday. After years of operating an illegal monopoly in two ad tech markets and unlawfully tying its products together, nothing short of a break up will suffice to overcome Google’s “massive head start” over rivals, it claims.DOJ attorney Julia Tarver Wood began her opening arguments in the remedies trial for the US v. Google ad tech case by quoting Winston Churchill’s warning that “those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” The government argued that unless Judge Leonie Brinkema breaks Google up, the company will almost certainly find a way to recreate its unfair advantages that have left publishers feeling they have no choice but to use its products, even when they degrade in quality. Google attorney Karen Dunn, on the other hand, argued that the government’s “radical and reckless 61-page proposal is a swing for the fences.”Read Article >Sep 22Lauren FeinerGoogle competitor calls its remedies proposal “disingenuous.”Andrew Casale, CEO of ad exchange company Index Exchange, testifies that Google’s proposed solutions leave too much room for it to maintain dominance. Casale also says Index would consider buying AdX if Google were forced to sell it.Sep 22Lauren FeinerPublishers have no viable alternatives to Google, witness testifies.The government’s first publisher witness, Advance Local VP of advertising technology Grant Whitmore, wants Google to sell both AdX and its publisher ad server, DFP. The DOJ is currently asking for a DFP sale only if other remedies don’t do enough. Whitmore says Google has demonstrated it can adapt to changes and maintain its dominance.Sep 22Lauren FeinerGoogle calls DOJ’s proposals “radical and reckless.”Google attorney Karen Dunn argues that the government is seeking to go well beyond what’s needed to restore competition to the ad tech markets, and might even hurt the customers it’s seeking to help.Sep 22Lauren FeinerDOJ seeks to remove Google’s “massive head start” in ad tech.In the government’s opening statement, Julia Tarver Wood warns Judge Leonie Brinkema against leaving open new paths for Google to distort competition in its favor. That’s why the DOJ is asking the judge to force Google to sell its AdX exchange entirely.Sep 22Lauren FeinerDOJ antitrust chief praises Google ad tech court’s efficiency.In a statement outside the courthouse, Antitrust Division chief Gail Slater notes how the court known as the “rocket docket” has a statute of the tortoise and the hare outside. Speed is important in tech antitrust cases because of how quickly the markets change.Sep 22Lauren FeinerWe’re at the courthouse where Google is fighting another break up attempt.Google and the Justice Department have returned to a federal courthouse in Virginia for a two-week trial to determine how to restore competition to the advertising technology market that Google monopolized. I’ll share updates to our trial coverage stream during breaks.Sep 20Lauren FeinerThe US government is taking a second stab at breaking up GoogleImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesStarting Monday, the US government will get another crack at convincing a federal judge to break up Google, after a different judge decided to keep it intact despite finding it to be a monopolist.Lawyers for Google and the Justice Department will return to a federal courthouse in Alexandria, VA for a roughly two-week trial about how to restore competition to the advertising technology markets that Google illegally monopolized. It comes just weeks after DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta — who issued a historic ruling deeming Google a monopoly in online search — delivered his prescription for restoring competition to the online search market. Mehta’s ruling stopped far short of the government’s major asks to remedy Google’s harm, including denying a requested sale of Google’s Chrome browser, and letting the company keep paying for prime distribution on spots on browsers and phones.Read Article >May 6Emma RothDOJ asks court to split up Google’s ad tech empireImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesThe US Department of Justice filed a plan in court to make Google divest its advertising marketplace and ad management platform, part of a proposal to address the company’s “decade-long campaign of exclusionary conduct,” which a judge has declared violates antitrust law.On Monday, the DOJ and Google both filed requests for remedying the tech giant’s legally declared ad-tech monopoly. The DOJ plan proposes having Google sell two major pieces of its business: its Ad Exchange (AdX) and its ad management platform DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP), which is now called Google Ad Manager. Google, which plans to appeal the original verdict, asks the court to require targeted changes in certain business practices while leaving the company intact.Read Article >Apr 19Lauren FeinerGoogle is in more danger than ever of being broken upIllustration by Cath Virginia / The VergeAfter half a decade fighting to keep its empire together, Google’s defenses are wearing thin.The company is facing a two-front war that could fundamentally reshape its business, and, the US Department of Justice argues, open new opportunities for its competitors. Last year a federal judge deemed Google an unlawful monopolist in the online search market, and this past week, a different judge declared it had monopolized the ad tech market, too. On Monday, it will face a new stage in that first battle: a three-week trial in Washington, DC to determine the appropriate remedies to restore competition to online search.Read Article >Apr 17Emma Roth and Lauren FeinerGoogle loses ad tech monopoly caseImage: Cath Virginia / The VergeThe US Department of Justice has won its antitrust case against Google, which accused the company of operating a monopoly in the advertising technology industry. The ruling, which marks Google’s most recent antitrust loss following its Search case, says the tech giant’s anticompetitive practices in two key markets “substantially harmed” publishers and users on the web.“Plaintiffs have proven that Google has willfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts to acquire and maintain monopoly power in the publisher ad server and ad exchange markets for open-web display advertising,” US District Judge Leonie Brinkema writes. “For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.”Read Article >Nov 25, 2024Lauren FeinerGoogle and the DOJ make their final arguments in the ad tech monopoly caseImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesGoogle and the Department of Justice met one final time in an Alexandria, Virginia courtroom to debate the future of Google’s online ad tech juggernaut.Over about three hours of closing arguments, attorneys for each side delivered their last arguments before US District Court judge Leonie Brinkema, who is expected to rule on it by the end of 2024. If she declares Google’s ad tech system a monopoly, the case will progress to a second trial for remedies — a process currently playing out in a separate DC District Court case over Google search.Read Article >More StoriesMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
