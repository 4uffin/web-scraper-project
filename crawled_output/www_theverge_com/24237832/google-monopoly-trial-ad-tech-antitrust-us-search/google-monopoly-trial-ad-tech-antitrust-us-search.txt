Google redux: all the news from the ad tech trialby
Verge StaffLinkFacebookThreadsRSSComments0CommentsOn April 17th, 2025, Judge Brinkema ruled that Google did act illegally to acquire and maintain monopoly power in online advertising. Now, DOJ and Google lawyers are returning to the courtroom to argue over whether this should lead to a Google breakup by forcing the company to sell its AdX exchange.In the initial trial, the DOJ argued that Google unfairly locked up the market for ad tech tools that publishers and advertisers rely on to monetize their websites and market their goods. Google responded that it created efficient products that work well for customers and said it faced plenty of competition.Read on below for all of the updates and notes from the case.HighlightsThe US government is taking a second stab at breaking up GoogleGoogle loses ad tech monopoly caseGoogle’s empire is under siegeGoogle and the DOJ’s ad tech fight is all about controlGoogle and DOJ return for round two of their antitrust fight — this time about adsToday, Two hours agoLauren FeinerWe’re back for day 2 of the Google ad tech remedies trial.The government will continue its case-in-chief today, where it’s arguing for a break up of Google to restore competition to the markets for publisher ad tools. Yesterday, we heard from a publisher witness and a rival ad exchange CEO. Catch up on our coverage here.Today, Two hours agoLauren FeinerGoogle begins its battle for the ‘unofficial currency of the internet’Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesGoogle has spent a decade sharpening its “weapons” in an industry that helps sustain large swaths of the open internet, the Justice Department argued before a federal judge Monday. After years of operating an illegal monopoly in two ad tech markets and unlawfully tying its products together, nothing short of a break up will suffice to overcome Google’s “massive head start” over rivals, it claims.DOJ attorney Julia Tarver Wood began her opening arguments in the remedies trial for the US v. Google ad tech case by quoting Winston Churchill’s warning that “those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” The government argued that unless Judge Leonie Brinkema breaks Google up, the company will almost certainly find a way to recreate its unfair advantages that have left publishers feeling they have no choice but to use its products, even when they degrade in quality. Google attorney Karen Dunn, on the other hand, argued that the government’s “radical and reckless 61-page proposal is a swing for the fences.”Read Article >Sep 22Lauren FeinerGoogle competitor calls its remedies proposal “disingenuous.”Andrew Casale, CEO of ad exchange company Index Exchange, testifies that Google’s proposed solutions leave too much room for it to maintain dominance. Casale also says Index would consider buying AdX if Google were forced to sell it.Sep 22Lauren FeinerPublishers have no viable alternatives to Google, witness testifies.The government’s first publisher witness, Advance Local VP of advertising technology Grant Whitmore, wants Google to sell both AdX and its publisher ad server, DFP. The DOJ is currently asking for a DFP sale only if other remedies don’t do enough. Whitmore says Google has demonstrated it can adapt to changes and maintain its dominance.Sep 22Lauren FeinerGoogle calls DOJ’s proposals “radical and reckless.”Google attorney Karen Dunn argues that the government is seeking to go well beyond what’s needed to restore competition to the ad tech markets, and might even hurt the customers it’s seeking to help.Sep 22Lauren FeinerDOJ seeks to remove Google’s “massive head start” in ad tech.In the government’s opening statement, Julia Tarver Wood warns Judge Leonie Brinkema against leaving open new paths for Google to distort competition in its favor. That’s why the DOJ is asking the judge to force Google to sell its AdX exchange entirely.Sep 22Lauren FeinerDOJ antitrust chief praises Google ad tech court’s efficiency.In a statement outside the courthouse, Antitrust Division chief Gail Slater notes how the court known as the “rocket docket” has a statute of the tortoise and the hare outside. Speed is important in tech antitrust cases because of how quickly the markets change.Sep 22Lauren FeinerWe’re at the courthouse where Google is fighting another break up attempt.Google and the Justice Department have returned to a federal courthouse in Virginia for a two-week trial to determine how to restore competition to the advertising technology market that Google monopolized. I’ll share updates to our trial coverage stream during breaks.Sep 20Lauren FeinerThe US government is taking a second stab at breaking up GoogleImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesStarting Monday, the US government will get another crack at convincing a federal judge to break up Google, after a different judge decided to keep it intact despite finding it to be a monopolist.Lawyers for Google and the Justice Department will return to a federal courthouse in Alexandria, VA for a roughly two-week trial about how to restore competition to the advertising technology markets that Google illegally monopolized. It comes just weeks after DC District Court Judge Amit Mehta — who issued a historic ruling deeming Google a monopoly in online search — delivered his prescription for restoring competition to the online search market. Mehta’s ruling stopped far short of the government’s major asks to remedy Google’s harm, including denying a requested sale of Google’s Chrome browser, and letting the company keep paying for prime distribution on spots on browsers and phones.Read Article >May 6Emma RothDOJ asks court to split up Google’s ad tech empireImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesThe US Department of Justice filed a plan in court to make Google divest its advertising marketplace and ad management platform, part of a proposal to address the company’s “decade-long campaign of exclusionary conduct,” which a judge has declared violates antitrust law.On Monday, the DOJ and Google both filed requests for remedying the tech giant’s legally declared ad-tech monopoly. The DOJ plan proposes having Google sell two major pieces of its business: its Ad Exchange (AdX) and its ad management platform DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP), which is now called Google Ad Manager. Google, which plans to appeal the original verdict, asks the court to require targeted changes in certain business practices while leaving the company intact.Read Article >Apr 19Lauren FeinerGoogle is in more danger than ever of being broken upIllustration by Cath Virginia / The VergeAfter half a decade fighting to keep its empire together, Google’s defenses are wearing thin.The company is facing a two-front war that could fundamentally reshape its business, and, the US Department of Justice argues, open new opportunities for its competitors. Last year a federal judge deemed Google an unlawful monopolist in the online search market, and this past week, a different judge declared it had monopolized the ad tech market, too. On Monday, it will face a new stage in that first battle: a three-week trial in Washington, DC to determine the appropriate remedies to restore competition to online search. Read Article >Apr 17Emma Roth and Lauren FeinerGoogle loses ad tech monopoly caseImage: Cath Virginia / The VergeThe US Department of Justice has won its antitrust case against Google, which accused the company of operating a monopoly in the advertising technology industry. The ruling, which marks Google’s most recent antitrust loss following its Search case, says the tech giant’s anticompetitive practices in two key markets “substantially harmed” publishers and users on the web.“Plaintiffs have proven that Google has willfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts to acquire and maintain monopoly power in the publisher ad server and ad exchange markets for open-web display advertising,” US District Judge Leonie Brinkema writes. “For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.”Read Article >Nov 25, 2024Lauren FeinerGoogle and the DOJ make their final arguments in the ad tech monopoly caseImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesGoogle and the Department of Justice met one final time in an Alexandria, Virginia courtroom to debate the future of Google’s online ad tech juggernaut.Over about three hours of closing arguments, attorneys for each side delivered their last arguments before US District Court judge Leonie Brinkema, who is expected to rule on it by the end of 2024. If she declares Google’s ad tech system a monopoly, the case will progress to a second trial for remedies — a process currently playing out in a separate DC District Court case over Google search.Read Article >Nov 25, 2024Emma RothGoogle’s empire is under siegeImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesToday, Google will have a final chance to prove to a federal judge that its advertising business isn’t a monopoly. The US Department of Justice spent several weeks earlier this year arguing that Google maintains too much control over web advertising and uses that power to lock in customers, leaving little room for competition. The trial wraps up this week. If it loses, Google could have to make sweeping changes to the core of its business.Even if the tech behemoth emerges from this trial unscathed, a spreading legal fire still jeopardizes everything it has created. For many years, Google’s sprawling empire has faced little legal scrutiny, allowing the company to freely build up its search engine, browser, operating systems, and line of hardware products that all intersect to bolster one another. It’s the overlap of Google’s massive businesses that has attracted attention from government agencies and tech industry rivals, who are set on taking apart Google’s stronghold piece by piece.Read Article >Oct 22, 2024Lauren FeinerTech critics want a Google exec punished for deleted chatsThree advocacy groups are trying to amp up the pressure on Google for allegedly destroying company records. The American Economic Liberties Project, Check My Ads, and the Tech Oversight Project are urging the State Bar of California to investigate Kent Walker, Google’s President of Global Affairs and a member of the Bar. They claim Walker “coached” the company “to engage in widespread and illegal destruction of records relevant to multiple ongoing federal trials.”In a letter shared exclusively with The Verge, the groups point to a 2008 memo Walker sent to employees while he served as general counsel. The so-called Walker Memo was highlighted in the Department of Justice’s recent antitrust trial, one of multiple cases where Google has been accused of obscuring potentially incriminating documents. The memo referenced “several significant legal and regulatory matters” Google faced at the time as the rationale for a new policy limiting employee chat message retention. The DOJ claimed it marked a turning point for company secrecy — as Google changed the default setting on chats from “history on” to “history off.”Read Article >Oct 17, 2024Emma RothGoogle is replacing the exec in charge of Search and adsIllustration: The VergeGoogle is making a big change to company leadership. In a memo to staff posted on Thursday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that Prabhakar Raghavan, the senior vice president in charge of search, ads, and other important segments, will now take on the role of chief technologist.“Prabhakar has decided it’s time to make a big leap in his own career,” Pichai writes. “After 12 years leading teams across Google, he’ll return to his computer science roots and take on the role of Chief Technologist, Google. In this role, he’ll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.”Read Article >Oct 1, 2024Lauren FeinerHow Google tried to unravel the DOJ’s ad tech caseImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesThe Department of Justice just wrapped up three weeks of trial where it argued whether Google has created illegal monopolies in the ad tech market. During much of it, Google kept asking a more fundamental question: what is that market? The company has a variety of defenses to the DOJ’s accusations, ranging from Supreme Court precedent to security concerns. One of its biggest, however, is that the agency simply doesn’t understand online advertising. Google alleges that it’s slicing up the market in a way that doesn’t make sense and that it downplays or ignores Google’s biggest advertising competition: social media.Read Article >Sep 27, 2024Lauren FeinerGoogle and the DOJ are out of court until November 25th.Closing arguments in their ad tech antitrust trial will start at 10AM that day. But for now, it’s a wrap.The final day saw a couple of depositions from Google — including testimony from Ryan Pauley, chief revenue officer at Verge parent company Vox Media — plus a Daily Mail executive who returned in a short but heated DOJ rebuttal.US v. Google redux: all the news from the ad tech trialSep 26, 2024Lauren FeinerGoogle says a closed ad ecosystem isn’t anticompetitive — it’s just saferImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesGoogle took a page out of a familiar playbook in court this week, defending itself from claims of anticompetitive conduct by raising security concerns. While the government argues it locked up the ad tech market to make more money, Google’s witnesses say that a more closed ecosystem is often safer for users — echoing a defense both it and Apple have made of their mobile app stores.Google’s attorneys have spent the last few days mounting its defense against the Department of Justice. The company argues that conduct the Department of Justice paints as anticompetitive — like locking customers into its services and exerting control over the rules of the industry through its dominance — actually has justifiable business purposes. The point was emphasized by two Google executive witnesses: Per Bjorke, director of product management for ad traffic quality, and Alejandro Borgia, director of product management for ad safety. Combined, the teams work to ensure Google’s ads are bought and sold by trustworthy parties and that they’re seen by real people, not bots.Read Article >Sep 24, 2024Lauren FeinerHow Google made the ad tech industry revolve around itselfImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesGoogle’s mission statement seems made to evoke warm and fuzzy feelings about how its products help everyone. “Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful,” Google says on its corporate site. The company used to have an even more saccharine motto: “Don’t be evil.”But the decisions Google made in growing its massive advertising technology business were cold-blooded and carefully crafted to primarily benefit itself, the Department of Justice argued during the first two weeks of its antitrust trial.Read Article >Sep 19, 2024Lauren FeinerTL;DR on the DOJ’s ad tech antitrust trial against Google.I’ve been going to this extremely wonky and jargon-y trial almost every day, and I joined Decoder to translate the highlights so far. The trial — which is only accessible in-person from an Alexandria, VA courtroom — is in its second week. Google is expected to start calling witnesses any day now, once the Justice Department wraps its chief case.Sep 19, 2024Nilay PatelWhy Google is back in court for another monopoly showdownImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesToday on Decoder, we’re talking about the big Google antitrust trial that’s currently taking place in a federal courthouse. No, not the one you’re thinking of — it’s the second Google antitrust case in just as many months. The company lost a landmark case in August in which a court ruled that it had an illegal monopoly in search.This time around, the Department of Justice is claiming Google has another illegal monopoly in the online advertising market. Read Article >Sep 19, 2024Lauren FeinerGoogle employees’ attempts to hide messages from investigators might backfireImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesGoogle employees liberally labeled their emails as “privileged and confidential” and spoke “off the record” over chat messages, even after being told to preserve their communications for investigators, lawyers for the Justice Department have told a Virginia court over the past couple of weeks.That strategy could backfire if the judge in Google’s second antitrust trial believes the company intentionally destroyed evidence that would have looked bad for it. The judge could go as far as giving an adverse inference about Google’s missing documents, which would mean assuming they would have been bad for Google’s case.Read Article >Sep 17, 2024David PierceIn US v. Google, YouTube’s CEO defends the Google wayImage: Cath Virginia / The VergeThe word of the day in US v. Google was “parking.” As in: did Google buy some of its most ascendant and dangerous competitors in the online advertising business, all the while planning on parking them off in some far-flung corner of the company so that no one could possibly upset Google’s dominance? That is a central question of the government’s entire case against Google, and it came up over and over on Monday morning.To kick off the second week of the landmark antitrust trial over Google’s control of online advertising, the Department of Justice called Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube and a longtime Google advertising executive. Mohan came to Google in 2008 through Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick, which formed the basis of Google’s now-unstoppable advertising engine. Mohan also helped advocate for the acquisition of Admeld, another company at the center of the suit. He argued throughout his testimony that Google was never attempting to buy up and neuter its competitors; it was simply trying to compete.Read Article >Sep 16, 2024Lauren FeinerHow Google got away with charging publishers more than anyone elseImage: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesFor years, Google took the same 20 percent commission for ad transactions that ran through its platform, even though it was higher than what any other industry player charged. Executives privately worried the fee was difficult to defend. Now, the Justice Department argues it’s a key sign of Google’s monopoly over online ads.Google’s so-called take rate took center stage on the last day of week one in the Justice Department’s second antitrust trial against Google. Citing internal Google documents and the testimony of former Google sell-side ads executive Chris LaSala, the DOJ sought to demonstrate that Google never experienced any real pricing pressure due to its unshakable dominance in the market, despite knowing its fee was higher than competitors’ and being aware of customer complaints about its tools. The trial continues this week, with YouTube CEO and former Google ads executive Neal Mohan testifying on Monday.Read Article >More StoriesMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
