Google redux: all the news from the ad tech trialby
Verge StaffLinkFacebookThreadsRSSOn April 17th, 2025, Judge Brinkema ruled that Google did act illegally to acquire and maintain monopoly power in online advertising. Now, DOJ and Google lawyers are returning to the courtroom to argue over whether this should lead to a Google breakup by forcing the company to sell its AdX exchange.In the initial trial, the DOJ argued that Google unfairly locked up the market for ad tech tools that publishers and advertisers rely on to monetize their websites and market their goods. Google responded that it created efficient products that work well for customers and said it faced plenty of competition.Read on below for all of the updates and notes from the case.HighlightsThe US government is taking a second stab at breaking up GoogleGoogle loses ad tech monopoly caseGoogle’s empire is under siegeGoogle and the DOJ’s ad tech fight is all about controlGoogle and DOJ return for round two of their antitrust fight — this time about adsSep 25Lauren Feiner“It might be easier to just shut down AdX.”Craycroft made this suggestion after testifying that potential buyers for AdX from Big Tech or existing ad exchanges could create new competition concerns. Brinkema picked up on this idea, asking, “why is that not a very simple and elegant solution?” Craycroft said it could be, but AdX offers some additional benefits.Sep 25Lauren FeinerGoogle exec accuses DOJ of spinning a “burden” for publishers as a “choice.”Craycroft testified that the government’s remedies proposals are “naive” and “incoherent.” Despite its claims that breaking up Google’s ad tech business would give publishers more freedom, he testified, the DOJ’s proposals would burden them with a new tech tool to manage.Sep 25Lauren FeinerGoogle considered shutting down AdX.Google advertising executive Tim Craycroft testified that the company had done several internal analyses about potentially divesting part of AdX or even shutting it down altogether. The DOJ is trying to show that Google’s own analyses indicate it would be feasible to spin out the product.Sep 25Lauren FeinerGoogle muddies the waters about the feasibility of a break up.During cross examination, Google attorney Jeannie Rhee walked through a long list of proprietary Google tools and asked Weissman if he found replacements for them outside of Google. Rhee is trying to complicate the picture of how simple Weissman says it would be to move AdX and DFP to another provider, suggesting there are many unknown variables.Sep 25Lauren FeinerThe devil is in the details.That’s how Brinkema characterized a concern that moving the code for Google’s ad tech tools to a new environment could change how well they work. Court began today with the continuation of expert witness Jon Weissman, who says migrating AdX and DFP is technically feasible, and that any new code needed doesn’t need to be identical to Google’s, just equivalent in function.Sep 24Lauren FeinerSplitting up Google’s ad tech tools is technically feasible, DOJ witness says.Distributed systems expert Jonathan Weissman testified that separating AdX and DFP from Google’s infrastructure would not require a huge undertaking like a full rewrite of code. We expect to hear more from Weissman and others about the feasibility of a breakup tomorrow.Sep 24Lauren FeinerGoogle’s ad tools would be attractive to buyers, M&A witness says.Investment banker Paul Crisci evaluated whether AdX and DFP would be attractive assets for potential buyers if Google is forced to sell them. Crisci testified that at least in an initial assessment, plenty of companies in ad tech and adjacent markets would likely be interested in buying them.Sep 24Lauren FeinerWhat if we could just trust Google?During testimony from the DOJ’s expert economic witness Robin Lee, Judge Brinkema asked how necessary a forced sale of Google’s ad tech products would be if we assumed Google would faithfully follow all the restrictions on its behavior. Lee said if that were the case, behavioral restrictions could be sufficient but only if they could capture all problematic behavior upfront, and if deviations could be quickly detected.Sep 24Lauren FeinerDay 3 of trial kicks off.I’m back at court for the third day of the government’s case-in-chief. The judge made clear she wants to hear from more technical witnesses who can tell her about how the different proposals would work.Sep 23Lauren FeinerJudge wants to hear how a break up would work.Brinkema was getting tired of hearing from industry witnesses by the end of Tuesday, and told the parties she’s looking to home in on the technical feasibility of a break up and other remedies. The government said it would aim to cut to its technical witnesses when court resumes Wednesday.Sep 23Lauren FeinerAI hasn’t disrupted Google’s ad tech monopoly.That’s how several witnesses described the impact of the technology on Google’s dominance. While AI might be creating new opportunity in online ads, it hasn’t fundamentally changed the way display advertising works, and Google’s unshakeable hold on it, they testified.Sep 23Lauren Feiner‘I’m hopeful for the first time in a long time.’The Trade Desk Chief Revenue Officer Jed Dederick said after years of stagnation in the display ad market Google dominated, he’s finally optimistic it can see innovation with the right remedies. Google is painting the decline in display ads as a sign of its increasing irrelevance, but Dederick says a break up could incentivize more investment in it.Sep 23Lauren FeinerWitnesses disagree on how much of Google’s ad tech a buyer should be able to own.Government witnesses had different takes on whether a potential acquirer should be allowed buy both of Google’s sell-side tools, if forced to divest, or just one. Kevel’s Avery thinks it would work best to sell them together, but Omnicom’s Lambert fears that would just recreate the same problem that exists with Google.Sep 23Lauren FeinerTransparency is key.Government witnesses across the ad ecosystem have testified that transparency is at the top of their wishlist for remedies to achieve. That means knowing why some bids on ads win over others. They say that publishers and advertisers alike have little insight into this today, since that decision ultimately happens in the “black box” of Google’s ad server.Sep 23Lauren FeinerGovernment witnesses want it to go even further with a Google break up.Several witnesses for the DOJ have advocated that the government go even farther than it’s proposed by forcing Google to sell its publisher ad server from the outset, in addition to its ad exchange. “You can’t take half the antibiotics and hope the disease goes away,” Jay Friedman from the Goodway Group testified.Sep 23Lauren FeinerAdvertiser witness warns of short-term pain if Google were forced to sell AdX.Luke Lambert, who works for a subsidiary of Omnicom Media Group, testified that even a one day outage of Google’s AdX exchange would cause “extreme” pain for his team because they would need to scramble to find new ways to spend ad budgets. Google’s attorney is suggesting that could be the case if AdX has to be divested to a new buyer.Sep 23Lauren FeinerGoogle rivals line up as potential buyers for its ad tech.James Avery, who runs an ad server company for retailers called Kevel, testified he’d like to buy Google’s ad server and exchange, ideally together. Index Exchange CEO Andrew Casale is also interested. Google’s cross examination has tried to cast this interest as a way that the industry could reconsolidate under new ownership.Sep 23Lauren FeinerWe’re back for day 2 of the Google ad tech remedies trial.The government will continue its case-in-chief today, where it’s arguing for a break up of Google to restore competition to the markets for publisher ad tools. Yesterday, we heard from a publisher witness and a rival ad exchange CEO. Catch up on our coverage here.Sep 23Lauren FeinerGoogle begins its battle for the ‘unofficial currency of the internet’Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty ImagesGoogle has spent a decade sharpening its “weapons” in an industry that helps sustain large swaths of the open internet, the Justice Department argued before a federal judge Monday. After years of operating an illegal monopoly in two ad tech markets and unlawfully tying its products together, nothing short of a break up will suffice to overcome Google’s “massive head start” over rivals, it claims.DOJ attorney Julia Tarver Wood began her opening arguments in the remedies trial for the US v. Google ad tech case by quoting Winston Churchill’s warning that “those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” The government argued that unless Judge Leonie Brinkema breaks Google up, the company will almost certainly find a way to recreate its unfair advantages that have left publishers feeling they have no choice but to use its products, even when they degrade in quality. Google attorney Karen Dunn, on the other hand, argued that the government’s “radical and reckless 61-page proposal is a swing for the fences.”Read Article >Sep 22Lauren FeinerGoogle competitor calls its remedies proposal “disingenuous.”Andrew Casale, CEO of ad exchange company Index Exchange, testifies that Google’s proposed solutions leave too much room for it to maintain dominance. Casale also says Index would consider buying AdX if Google were forced to sell it.Sep 22Lauren FeinerPublishers have no viable alternatives to Google, witness testifies.The government’s first publisher witness, Advance Local VP of advertising technology Grant Whitmore, wants Google to sell both AdX and its publisher ad server, DFP. The DOJ is currently asking for a DFP sale only if other remedies don’t do enough. Whitmore says Google has demonstrated it can adapt to changes and maintain its dominance.Sep 22Lauren FeinerGoogle calls DOJ’s proposals “radical and reckless.”Google attorney Karen Dunn argues that the government is seeking to go well beyond what’s needed to restore competition to the ad tech markets, and might even hurt the customers it’s seeking to help.Sep 22Lauren FeinerDOJ seeks to remove Google’s “massive head start” in ad tech.In the government’s opening statement, Julia Tarver Wood warns Judge Leonie Brinkema against leaving open new paths for Google to distort competition in its favor. That’s why the DOJ is asking the judge to force Google to sell its AdX exchange entirely.Sep 22Lauren FeinerDOJ antitrust chief praises Google ad tech court’s efficiency.In a statement outside the courthouse, Antitrust Division chief Gail Slater notes how the court known as the “rocket docket” has a statute of the tortoise and the hare outside. Speed is important in tech antitrust cases because of how quickly the markets change.Sep 22Lauren FeinerWe’re at the courthouse where Google is fighting another break up attempt.Google and the Justice Department have returned to a federal courthouse in Virginia for a two-week trial to determine how to restore competition to the advertising technology market that Google monopolized.
