He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.We only just put Apple’s iPhone 17 launch event behind us, but Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman is already glancing into his crystal ball to see what’s next for the company. In today’s Power On newsletter Gurman says that there are at least 10 more products from Apple that are expected to launch either later this year or in the first half of 2026.Some of those products have been rumored for some time, or are just kind of obvious upgrades. The M5 iPad Pro, for instance, is a matter of when not if. Though the rumors that it will have a second front facing camera for those that prefer to use their iPad in portrait mode is interesting. The iPad Pro could be the first Apple product with an M5 as it’s expected to launch in October, with upgraded MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs to follow in early 2026.Gurman also claims that a budget-friendly iPhone 17e is in the works for early next year. Upgrades over the 16e are expected to be pretty minor, with most of the handset remaining the same, but moving to the new A19 chip inside the iPhone 17 line. The Apple TV and HomePod mini are also expected to get updates next year with processor bumps along with support for the new version of Siri and Apple Intelligence features. Same with the Vision Pro, which is expected to get an M4 processor and an improved headband, but otherwise remain largely unchanged while a larger update is in the works for 2027.Perhaps the most interesting thing on the list is the long-rumored smart home hub code-named J490. Early chatter suggested that the smart display would launch this past March but, clearly, the device never materialized. Now Gurman claims it should launch in the spring. It would mark the first new major product category for Apple in a while, but one that it’s largely laid the groundwork for between the HomePod and iPad.Rounding out the rumors are AirTag 2 and a pair of new monitors. Updated AirTags will have better range thanks to a new wireless chip. Less is known about the monitors, but the code-names of J427 and J527 suggest we could be looking at a pair of 27-inch displays. The Pro Display XDR and Studio display are both getting on in years, with the Pro having been released at the tail end of 2019.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Terrence O'BrienCloseTerrence O'BrienWeekend EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Terrence O'BrienAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleApple RumorsCloseApple RumorsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Apple RumorsARCloseARPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ARiPadCloseiPadPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All iPadiPhoneCloseiPhonePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All iPhoneSmart HomeCloseSmart HomePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Smart HomeTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularSpotify Lossless is an inconvenient improvementThe iPhone to get this yearPhone batteries are getting more compact, but the US is missing outThe Helldivers community is coping with a spotlight it doesn’t wantLiam Hemsworth is Geralt in the first Witcher season 4 trailerThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
