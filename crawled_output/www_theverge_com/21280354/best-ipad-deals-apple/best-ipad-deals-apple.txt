The day-to-day discounts come and go like changing winds, so there’s often some amount to be saved, particularly on Apple’s most affordable iPad. The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Mini are also regularly discounted, as is the latest iPad Air.In this articleThe best iPad (2025) dealsThe best iPad Mini (2024) dealsThe best iPad Air (2025) dealsThe best iPad Pro (2024) dealsIt’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is available, from the 11th-gen base iPad to the more powerful models with M3 and M4 chips. Every model mentioned in this guide can run Apple’s iPadOS 26 update, which is now available to download.RelatedThe best iPad to buyMultitasking in iPadOS 26 is a game-changerThe best iPad (2025) dealsApple iPad (11th-gen)$299$34914% off$299$299 at Amazon (128GB, Wi-Fi)$299 at Walmart (128GB, Wi-Fi)$399 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi)Apple’s 11th-gen iPad landed on the scene in March. The newest base model tablet is a fairly iterative update of the prior model, but with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and the A16 Bionic chip, which is nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip used in the 10th-gen iPad. That being said, the newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1 and subsequent updates. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model.Pricing-wise, the latest iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We saw a pretty significant price drop to $279 during Prime Day, though you can still find the entry-level model on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at $299 ($50 off). Alternatively, you can purchase the 256GB model at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at $399 ($50 off), or the 512GB variant at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $599 ($50 off).The best iPad Mini (2024) dealsiPad Mini (2024)$399$49920% off$399$399 at Amazon (128GB, Wi-Fi)$399 at Best Buy (128GB, Wi-Fi)$499 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi)How we rate and review productsThe seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar in several ways to the previous model, but comes with some big internal upgrades. It includes faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, so the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.RelatedThe iPad Mini might get an OLED upgrade in 2026Apple’s DIY repair program now covers iPadsA modder created the iPadBook that Apple won’tRight now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $399 ($100 off), which is about $20 short of the all-time low we saw during Prime Day. If you need additional storage, you can also pick up the 256GB variant at Amazon and Best Buy for $499 ($100 off), or the 512GB model at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $699 ($100 off).The best iPad Air (2025) deals11-inch iPad Air M3$449$59925% off$449$449 at Amazon (128GB, Wi-Fi)$549 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi)$749 at Amazon (512GB, Wi-Fi)13-inch iPad Air M3$649$79919% off$649$649 at Amazon (128GB, Wi-Fi)$749 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi)$949 at Amazon (512GB, Wi-Fi)The 2025 iPad Air is little more than a spec bump over the previous model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer into the future than either the entry-level iPad or the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence, plus compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard that has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys. In short, the Air is a credible laptop replacement.The 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as prior models — but it’s common to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage for $449 ($150 off). You can also grab the 256GB model at Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy for $549 ($150 off), or the step-up 512GB model at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $749 ($150 off).RelatedHow to install the iOS 26 public betaHang on, did the iPad just become a computer?Instagram is coming to iPad, 15 years laterThe larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy with 128GB of storage starting at $649 ($150 off). You can also pick up the 256GB model at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at $749 ($150 off), or the 512GB variant at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $949 ($150 off).The best iPad Pro (2024) deals11-inch iPad Pro (2024)$899$99910% off$899$899 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi)$1081 at Amazon (512GB, Wi-Fi)$1476 at Amazon (1TB, Wi-Fi)How we rate and review products13-inch iPad Pro (2024)$1099$129915% off$1099$1099 at Amazon (256GB, Wi-Fi)$1299 at Amazon (512GB, Wi-Fi)$1699 at Amazon (1TB, Wi-Fi)How we rate and review productsThe 2024 iPad Pro is a far more impressive upgrade than the latest iPad Air. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they were the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest M4 chip, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true of both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge (also found in the 11th-gen iPad), which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call.As for deals, the base 11-inch iPad Pro with 256GB of storage is currently on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for around $899 (about $100 off), while the model with Wi-Fi and 512GB of storage is $1,081.43 (about $118 off) at Amazon and Walmart. The sleek and super-thin 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale in its 256GB base configuration at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $1,099 ($200 off), or in its 512GB configuration at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at $1,299 ($200 off). Amazon and Best Buy also have the 1TB model for $1,699 ($200 off) if you’re looking for more storage to hold your apps, photos, and videos.While there are some enticing deals on the iPad Pro with the M4 chip, it’s worth noting that the current model is more than a year old. That means if you want the most up-to-date tech, you may want to hold off before making your decision. A recent report from Bloomberg suggests that a new iPad Pro with an M5 chip could arrive as early as the fall, which is around when iPadOS 26 is expected to become available.Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
