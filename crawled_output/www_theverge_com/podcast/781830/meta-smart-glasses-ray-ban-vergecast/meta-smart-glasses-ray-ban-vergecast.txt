Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.Meta obviously believes in smart glasses. It’s not alone: Google, Apple, Samsung, and others all appear to be heavily invested in the idea that the next big gadget will be on your face. But at least for now, it appears Meta is the company building the best, most interesting, and most successful version of that gadget.On this episode of The Vergecast, we talk a lot about Meta’s big bet on face computers. But first, a surprise! Nilay joins the show for a special episode of Brendan Carr is a Dummy, America’s favorite podcast within a podcast, to talk about why it matters so much that Jimmy Kimmel’s show was suspended, how Carr and the Trump administration are finding leverage to control speech, and why this incident has caused such backlash across the political spectrum.

The Verge’s Jake Kastrenakes and Richard Lawler discuss the Meta Ray-Ban Display (the one with the screen), the Oakley Meta Vanguard (the one with the sick wraparounds) and the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 (the one that’s like the old one.) These devices are name crimes, and we say so. Then we talk about Meta’s differing approaches to each model, and whether any of them are likely to convince people who wear glasses — and, even tougher, people who don’t — to put on a new pair.Finally, in the lightning round, we talk about the maybe-possibly-sorta TikTok deal, Reddit’s power on the open web, Nvidia’s deal with Intel, and much more.If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started, first on Brendan Carr and the FCC:Jimmy Kimmel Live pulled after FCC threat over Charlie Kirk joke Here’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the air Republicans are honoring Charlie Kirk’s memory by declaring war on the First Amendment Charlie Kirk’s death got complicated by “extremely online” culture The right wing is creating a society of snitchesAnd in Meta Connect news:Meta Ray-Ban Display hands-on: the best smart glasses I’ve ever triedOakley Meta Vanguard hands-on: what athletes actually wantMeta’s new Ray-Ban smart glasses have twice the battery lifeI sat down with Mark Zuckerberg to try Meta’s impressive new Ray-Ban Display glasses Meta is opening up its smart glasses to developersAnd in the lightning round:The US and China might finally have a TikTok deal Reddit wants a better AI deal with Google: users in exchange for contentAndroid’s next flagship processor is the ‘Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5’ Nothing wants you to talk to your earbuds’ charging case Nvidia invests $5 billion into Intel to jointly develop PC and data center chipsYouTube is inching closer to becoming a shopping channel Samsung brings ads to US refrigeratorsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.David PierceCloseDavid PierceEditor-at-LargePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by David PierceMetaCloseMetaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MetaPodcastsClosePodcastsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PodcastsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechVergecastCloseVergecastPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All VergecastMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
