It’s sort of a history show meets a rewatch podcast: we’re going to tell the stories behind the most interesting tech products ever, and also just hang out and talk about whether we owned a Zune or could successfully ride a hoverboard.The show launches Sunday, October 5th. You’ll be able to get the first eight-episode season on The Verge’s YouTube channel or on The Vergecast’s podcast feed, but if I might make one request, please also subscribe to Version History wherever you get podcasts. This show has been so much fun to make, and I think you’re going to like it.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.David PierceCloseDavid PierceEditor-at-LargePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by David PierceGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsPodcastsClosePodcastsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PodcastsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechVergecastCloseVergecastPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All VergecastCommentsLoading commentsGetting the conversation ready...Most PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
