Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.YouTube is the most powerful platform in entertainment, and as such it has outsize influence on what kind of entertainment people make and watch. When YouTube adds a mid-video ad break, videos get longer to accommodate it. When YouTube tells podcasters to make video, podcasters make video. And for its next act, it appears the company is prepared to turn all its creators into livestreamers.On this episode of The Vergecast, The Verge’s Mia Sato takes us through all the news from last week’s Made On YouTube event, and explains why live content is so important — and so hard to cultivate. YouTube’s other big focus this year appears to be AI, again, and Mia helps us figure out whether all this AI is going to make YouTube better or make it utterly unwatchable. Maybe both.

Jake and Hayden agree with a few, set David straight on a few others, and seem utterly bewildered by at least one of them.Finally, Hayden sticks around to answer a question from the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11 or email vergecast@theverge.com!) about the words we use when we talk about AI. When everything is AI, AI loses all meaning — and that’s exactly where we’re headed.If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started:YouTube is inching closer to becoming a shopping channelYouTube makes it easier and more lucrative to go liveNew YouTube AI tools help creators give viewers what they wantHow YouTube spent 20 years taking over the entertainment businessAI is confusing — here’s your cheat sheetFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.David PierceCloseDavid PierceEditor-at-LargePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by David PiercePodcastsClosePodcastsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PodcastsStreamingCloseStreamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All StreamingTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechVergecastCloseVergecastPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All VergecastYouTubeCloseYouTubePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All YouTubeMost PopularMost PopularLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
