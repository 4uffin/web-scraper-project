Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.It’s very thin. And very light. And quite nice to look at. It also only has one camera, the battery life isn’t amazing, and it’s not like Apple saved some special new software feature for its fanciest phone. The new iPhone Air is just… the nice one. So where does that leave the Air? And where does that leave anyone trying to decide which iPhone to buy?On this episode of The Vergecast, we try and answer those questions. The Verge’s Allison Johnson and Jake Kastrenakes, who have been using and reviewing Apple’s latest iPhones — the Air, the 17, and the 17 Pro — join the show to talk about what they’ve learned. Not to spoil the fun, but there’s not many surprises in these new devices. They are what you think they are. And maybe, at this point in the smartphone era, that’s just fine.

The Watch SE 3 is Apple’s best low-end watch yet, and it’s good enough to make the Watch Series 11 seem like not such a good deal. The Series 11 does have a few upgrades, though, and so does the (even bigger and even more powerful) Watch Ultra 3. The names are confusing, but which watch you should buy actually isn’t, and Vee walks us through the process.Finally, we answer a question on the Vergecast Hotline (call 866-VERGE11, or email [email protected]!) about Apple’s approach to AI. Is it possible that Apple is trying to essentially quiet quit the AI race? Or is something else happening here? We have a few ideas.If you want to know more about everything we discuss in this episode, here are some links to get you started:Apple iPhone Air review: statement pieceApple iPhone 17 review: the one to getApple iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max reviewAirPods Pro 3 review: tripling down on a good thingApple Watch SE 3 review: major glow-upApple Watch Series 11 review: stuck in the middle0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.David PierceCloseDavid PierceEditor-at-LargePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by David PierceAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsiPhoneCloseiPhonePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All iPhonePodcastsClosePodcastsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PodcastsSmartwatchCloseSmartwatchPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SmartwatchTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechVergecastCloseVergecastPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All VergecastWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMost PopularMost PopularApple iPhone Air review: statement pieceVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoRepublicans are honoring Charlie Kirk’s memory by declaring war on the First AmendmentThe iPhone 17 is the one to get this yearThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
