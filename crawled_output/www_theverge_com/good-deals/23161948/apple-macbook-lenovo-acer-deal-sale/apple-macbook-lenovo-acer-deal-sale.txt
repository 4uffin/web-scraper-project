Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The VergeIf you want a great laptop, you’re going to have to fork over a ton of money, right? Not necessarily. There are dozens of good laptops on the market at various price points. However, it can feel overwhelming to find the right one for your needs (some are better suited for, say, college students, whereas others are ideal for gamers).RelatedThe best laptops you can getI tested a bunch of gaming laptops and these are the bestThat’s why we’ve come up with this list of some of the best laptop deals available right now. In addition to the latest discounts, we’ll share each discounted model’s best features (and downsides) to give you more clarity during your shopping journey. And if you need to do more research, you can also check out our guides to the best laptops on the market and the top gaming laptops.In this articleThe best laptop dealsApple MacBook dealsMicrosoft Surface dealsAsus laptop dealsThe best Lenovo laptop dealsThe best Razer deals The best HP laptop dealsThe best laptop dealsApple MacBook dealsM1 MacBook Air2020 MacBook Air with M1 (256GB)$599$6498% off$599The 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold).Read More$599 at WalmartApple itself no longer sells the 13-inch MacBook Air with M1 — and hasn’t for years — but you can still get this solid laptop for $599.99 ($50 off) at Walmart. The 2020 model is available in one configuration, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but it’s still capable at handling basic tasks like a champ, including streaming video, browsing, and dealing with documents. You can also use the M1 MacBook Air for creative work in Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Logic, and Pixelmator, though you may experience slowdown due to its low 8GB of memory.The laptop’s battery lasted between eight and ten hours when we originally reviewed it, and those figures should be mostly accurate, barring some differences likely caused by operating system updates. In addition to offering great performance for its price, the laptop also comes with other nice-to-have features, including a comfortable keyboard and an excellent trackpad. Just note its 720p webcam isn’t particularly good, so if a high-resolution webcam matters a lot to you, you may want to buy one separately. Also, be aware that, due to the limitations of the M1 chip, you can only use one external display at a time and port selection is also more limited than newer models.M2 MacBook Air13-inch MacBook Air with M2 (2022)$699$79913% off$699The 2022 MacBook Air is a thin, lightweight device powered by Apple’s M2 chip. The M2 model touts an improved 1080p webcam and a better display than its predecessor while retaining features like long battery life and MagSafe charging.Read More$699 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip is a significant leap above the M1 model it succeeded, both in terms of design and performance. The old wedge-shaped look was replaced for a more squared-off design that’s still used by the current-generation MacBook Air. It has a 1080p webcam, which was a welcome improvement given the disappointing camera on the 2020 M1 model. It’s also much lighter and thus more portable as well, yet it retains features like MagSafe charging and Touch ID, as well as a nice display.Despite its age, the M2 processor inside of this machine is still powerful enough to handle many tasks, from common ones such as browsing to more complex and creative projects. Compared to newer, pricier models, this one unsurprisingly struggles with gaming. That being said, it’s capable of running Cyberpunk 2077. The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 launched with 8GB of RAM, but that configuration became unavailable last year when Apple made 16GB the new standard.While a well-rounded laptop overall, there is one key area where Apple’s M1 model is better: storage. The base M2 MacBook Air with 256GB of storage is actually slower than its predecessor because it’s stored in a single NAND chip. This was corrected in subsequent MacBook Air models, so the slowdown is unique to M2 machines with 256GB of storage. Also, be aware as well that port selection isn’t great, and the included display notch — which is also found on both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros — can make using the menu bar more challenging until you get used to it. If that doesn’t bother you, however, you can get a configuration with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, an 8-core CPU and GPU for $699 ($100 off) at Best Buy. Alternatively, you can get a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU for $1,039.99 ($259 off) at Best Buy. If you need more storage, a 15-inch MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU for $1,199.99 ($298 off) at Best Buy.RelatedThe best iPad to BuyApple iPhone Air review: statement pieceM4 MacBook Air13-inch Apple MacBook Air 13 (2025, M4)$800$99920% off$800The M4 MacBook Air has a speedy processor, and double the RAM of previous models. It has a thin and light design, all day battery life, and still starts with 256GB of storage. Read our review.Read More$800 at AmazonThe 13-inch MacBook Air with M4 is Apple’s latest thin and lightweight laptop, and it’s our top pick in The Verge’s guide to the best laptops right now. It’s not a MacBook Pro, but Apple’s M4 processor in the Air is still mighty capable. In our tests, it only throttled under heavy load from creative applications, which is understandable given its fanless design. The machine comes with 16GB of RAM as standard rather than an optional upgrade, but the base configuration still comes with just 256GB of storage, so be mindful of that limitation if you work with a lot of larger files.Apple hasn’t increased the number of ports on a MacBook Air since reintroducing MagSafe to the M2 model in 2022, but this generation has Thunderbolt 4 ports rather than Thunderbolt 3 for faster file transfer speeds. Another notable addition is the 1080p Center Stage camera from the MacBook Pro, so you’ll stay in frame if you move around on a video call. Battery life should last all day, though your experience will vary depending on how hard you push this machine.You can currently get a configuration of the 13-inch with M4 with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and a 10-core CPU and GPU for $799 at Amazon and Best Buy. If you need a larger screen, you can get the 15-inch MacBook Air with the same specs for $999 ($200 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.RelatedThe best deals on MacBooks right nowM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro14-inch MacBook Pro with M4$1299$159919% off$1299The entry-level MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM — double that of its predecessor — and a 512GB SSD for the same starting price of $1,599. It also gets a third USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 port and comes in a space black option.Read More$1299 at Amazon$1299 at Best Buy$1399 at B&H Photo14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro$1799$249928% off$1799The 14-inch MacBook Pro with a 12-core / 16-core M4 Pro chip starts with 24GB of RAM — a 6GB increase over the prior generation. It also has a 512GB SSD, three Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, an optional nano-texture display, and a 12-megapixel webcam.Read More$1799 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)$1899 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)$1849 at Adorama (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro$2249$249910% off$2249The 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro starts with 24GB of RAM and offers more computing cores (14 for the CPU and 20 for the GPU) compared to the 14-inch model. It also picks up Thunderbolt 5 ports and a 12-megapixel Center Stage camera.Read More$2249 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)$2249 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)$2249 at B&H Photo (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)The M4 generation MacBook Pros are Apple’s fastest laptops yet. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 starts with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, and comes equipped with three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and a MagSafe charging port. It can send video to two external displays simultaneously (the previous generation could only handle one) and has an improved 12-megapixel Center Stage camera with better video quality.The M4 MacBook Pro and M4 MacBook Air run on the same chip, but the Pro’s cooling system is better, so it handles resource-intensive tasks (including games) without throttling as easily. The laptop’s 14.2-inch screen is bright (up to 1,600 nits when viewing HDR content), and supports the P3 color gamut, both of which are important to professionals who rely on color accuracy when editing photos and video. The display has a 120Hz refresh rate, so scrolling through webpages or moving windows around should appear smoother than 60Hz screens. In our stress test, which included editing 33-megapixel RAW images and working with a large photo library in Adobe Lightroom, the laptop ran for 12 hours without kicking up the fans or feeling hot to the touch.If you want even more power, you can jump up to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Pro processor. It comes with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, a 12-core CPU, and a 16-core GPU. The M4 Pro MacBook Pro has over twice the memory bandwidth of the base M4 MacBook Pro, so it should perform better across the board. That said, it might be tough to notice the benefits of its extra memory and processing power during casual use, but it will come in handy when you’re pushing the laptop to the limits while video editing or playing games. It has three Thunderbolt 5 ports, and you can use that extra bandwidth with an external SSD with fast transfer speeds, to name an example. You can also get the MacBook Pro with M4 Pro with a 16-inch screen if you’d like to work on a larger display.Right now, the 14-inch M4 model with 16GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD and 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU is $1,299 ($400 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. You can get a 14-inch M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, 12-core CPU, and 16-core GPU for $1,799 at Amazon and B&H Photo. The 16-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro with 24GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, 14-core CPU, and 20-core GPU is currently on sale for $2,249 ($250 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.RelatedApple’s future MacBook Pro might have a touchscreenMicrosoft Surface dealsMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th EditionMicrosoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition$889$120026% off$889The 13.8-inch Surface Laptop is Microsoft’s closest rival to the MacBook Air, using Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chipsets for exceptional battery life.Read More$1020 at Amazon Buy (X Elite, 16GB RAM, 512 SSD)$889 at B&H Photo (X Plus, 16GB RAM, 512 SSD)We chose Microsoft’s 7th Edition Surface Laptop as one of the best laptops you can get because it’s the top Snapdragon Copilot Plus PC we’ve tried yet. The laptop runs on a power-efficient ARM processor that doesn’t skimp on performance. Its 13.8-inch 2,304 x 1,536 120Hz screen supports Dolby Vision HDR (High Dynamic Range) and looks very nice. It has a large, precision haptic trackpad that gives you plenty of room to tap and swipe, an offers satisfying feedback no matter where you press it.The laptop has a pair of USB 4 ports, one USB-A 3.1 Gen 1 port, plus a headphone jack. One of the concerns of using an ARM-based Windows PC has been software compatibility, but this model proves that’s no longer something to be as worried about. It runs Photoshop, and apps compiled for X86 processors work thanks to Microsoft’s Prism emulator. Be sure to check the compatibility of the specific Windows app you rely, though, as there’s still a chance they won’t work as intended.Even after our toughest tests, the battery lasted seven hours. That’s with 100 percent screen brightness, after downloading multiple Steam games, attending video calls, and running through multiple projects in Photoshop. Using the laptop with less power-hungry apps, including Slack, WhatsApp, Discord, and Chrome, the laptop used just 30 percent of its battery in seven hours. For the best battery life, you’ll want to stick to using native ARM apps when possible. If you want to make the switch to an ARM-based laptop to get some of the benefits MacBook users have had for years, the 7th Generation Surface Laptop is worth checking out.You can get a 13.8-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop (7th Edition) with a Snapdragon X Plus processor, 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD for around $888.86 ($211 off) at B&H Photo. A model with the Snapdragon X Elite processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is on sale for $1,019.99 ($380 off) at Amazon.Asus laptop dealsAsus Zenbook S 16Asus Zenbook S 16$1400$180022% off$1400The Asus Zenbook S 16 features AMD’s Ryzen AI mobile processors. It’s one of the thinnest and lightest 16-inch laptops available and doesn’t cut corners on performance. It’s a mighty machine that can handle all sorts of heavy workloads with ease and grace.Read More$1400 at AsusWe chose Asus’ Zenbook S 16 as another one of our top recommendations for students, but it’s a solid laptop for anyone who wants a large-screened Windows laptop. In our tests, the 16-inch 120Hz 3K (2,880 x 1,800) OLED display emits vivid colors and excellent contrast. The laptop was more than capable of handling common tasks, including video chats using its 1080p webcam, music streaming, but its graphics and gaming performance is what really sets it apart from laptops in its size and price classes.This machine runs Cyberpunk 2077 at around 77 frames per second with the resolution set to 1080p with AMD’s FSR 2.1 upscaling software turned on. The laptop isn’t designed for gaming, but it’s good to know it’s up to the task if you’re willing to turn down some graphical settings. The Zenbook S 16’s battery lasted 11 hours during our testing. However, the percentage indicator in the Windows taskbar would often fluctuate, making it difficult to pin down exactly how much juice was left.You can get a configuration of the laptop with 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor for $1,399.99 ($400 off) from Asus.The best Lenovo laptop dealsLenovo Yoga Book 9i (2024)Lenovo Yoga Book 9i (2024)$1500$200025% off$1500The Lenovo Yoga Book 9i is a dual-screen laptop that can fold and flip into several different modes. A Bluetooth keyboard, mouse, and stylus come with it, along with a keyboard folio that can transform into a laptop stand. It’s the Swiss Army knife of laptops. Read our head-to-head review.Read More$1500 at Best BuyA dual-screen laptop is admittedly pretty niche, but we chose Lenovo’s Yoga Book 9i is the best of the bunch in our best laptops guide. It runs on Intel’s Core Ultra 7 155U processor, and comes with 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and integrated Intel UHD graphics chip. Its key feature is the pair of 13.3-inch 60Hz OLED touchscreen displays, which each have a 2880 x 1800 resolution. The screens have a clamshell design and are attached by a hinge, so the Yoga Book 9i looks like a typical laptop when opened.You can use the laptop in a few configurations. In clamshell mode, the bottom screen displays a full-sized virtual keyboard with trackpad to give you a traditional laptop experience. Our experience in this mode was mixed because it’s too easy to accidentally minimize apps, or make typos if you’re used to the tactile feel of a physical keyboard.You can attach the Yoga Book 9i to the included keyboard folio, which props it up and allows you to use both screens independently like a laptop attached to an external monitor (except, in the Yoga Book 9i’s case, they’re built-in). One screen can be folded completely over the other display to use the laptop like a large-screen tablet, or folded partially to prop one screen up if you want to watch a movie at a more comfortable angle.During our testing, the Yoga Book 9i was difficult to use on a lap with the included Bluetooth keyboard because it would shift around while being used. However, moving apps from one display to another using touch gestures was intuitive thanks to tutorials in the User Center app, which immediately launch upon the first boot. The software also lets you enable and disable gestures, if you find some confusing or unnecessary. Switching from a traditional laptop to a dual-screen model will likely take an adjustment period, so it’s very helpful that Lenovo designed software to help ease you through the transition.Despite having two screens, the Yoga Book 9i only weighs 2.95 pounds, which was light enough to carry in a backpack without weighing us down. The keyboard folio adds some bulk, but comes with an attached elastic band to keep the laptop and accessory from getting detached while you travel. If you’re dedicated to the dual-screen lifestyle, or you want to give it a try, the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i is on sale for $1499.99 ($500 off) at Best Buy.The best Razer dealsRazer Blade 16 (2025, RTX 5090)$1900$240021% off$1900$1900 at Razer (RTX 5060)$2200 at Razer (RTX 5070)$3500 at Razer (RTX 5080)The Razer Blade 16 is one of our favorite 16-inch gaming laptops, and multiple configurations of the machine are currently on sale. Every 2025 model has a 16-inch OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate and a 2560 x 1600 resolution. From there you can choose a machine with the mix of CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage options that’s right for your budget. However, only two models of the Razer Blade 16 are currently on sale.The first is its entry-level configuration with an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 processor, Nvidia’s RTX 5060 graphics card with 8GB of video memory, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD, which you can get for $1,899.99 ($500 off) from Razer. For a more powerful option with an RTX 5070 graphics card, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD, that’s $2,199.99 ($600 off) now from Razer. Power differences aside, both laptops are equipped with three USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type A ports, two USB4 ports, a UHS-II SD card reader, HDMI 2.1 port, 3.5mm headphone jack, and proprietary charging port.We tested the highest-end configuration of the laptop, which has an Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU. However, since it’s $4,999 and not currently discounted, we recommend the much more affordable configurations to anyone who wants to play PC games on the go. One of the typical tradeoffs when getting a high-end gaming laptop is thickness and weight, but the Razer Blade 16 is surprisingly slender at 4.6 pounds and .69 inches thick at its thickest point.Razer even managed to fit in a 1080p webcam that looks good and six-speaker audio system into the laptop’s thin chassis. Non-gaming features, like the Razer Blade 16’s large trackpad and keyboard were a cut above what we’d expect from a gaming laptop.The laptop’s battery lasted about an hour and a half playing Cyberpunk 2077 and around two hours when playing Elden Ring, so you’ll be able to play games for a bit without plugging it in. However, we needed to turn down both game’s graphics settings to achieve that longevity. We also tested the Razer Blade 16 for creative tasks, and lightly editing roughly 1,000 images in Adobe Lightroom, which took about an hour and drained 25 percent of the laptop’s battery.

It’s powered by an Intel Core i5-1342H processor and has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. It has an 144Hz 1080p screen and Nvidia RTX 4050 graphics card with 6GB of dedicated video memory, which shine when playing live service games like Minecraft and Fortnite. You should also be able to play more graphically-demanding games at lower graphics settings. HP equipped the laptop with an HDMI port, one USB-C port, two USB-A ports, an ethernet port, and a headphone jack.The laptop doesn’t have a touchscreen, and our reviewer wasn’t a fan of its display’s 16:9 aspect ratio (it’s easy to get spoiled with 16:10 these days), but its negative qualities are easier to accept when the laptop is $699 ($350 off) at Walmart. Having a machine with a respectable dedicated GPU along for under $700 is impressive. The laptop is also capable of handling day-to-day tasks like streaming videos, putting together slideshows, spreadsheets, and documents, and video chatting with friends and colleagues.Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
