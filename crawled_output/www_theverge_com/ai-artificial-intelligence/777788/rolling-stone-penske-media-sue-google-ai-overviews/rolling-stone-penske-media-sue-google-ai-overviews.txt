He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.Disclosure: Penske Media Corporation is an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.Penske Media Corporation, the publisher of Rolling Stone and The Hollywood Reporter, has become the first major American media company to sue Google over its AI summaries. The company claims that the AI Overviews that often appear at the top of search results leave users with little reason to click through to the source, hurting traffic and illegally benefitting from the work of its reporters.While Penske Media is the biggest name to take on Google over its AI Overviews, it’s not the first. Online education company Chegg sued Google in February, as did a group of independent publishers in Europe. The News / Media Alliance has also spoken out about the feature, calling it the “definition of theft” and seeking action from the DOJ.Google spokesperson José Castañeda defended the summaries to the Wall Street Journal saying, “with AI Overviews, people find search more helpful and use it more.” But Penske and other publishers say there is little reason to follow the links provided in search results and, as a result, they have seen significant drops in traffic and revenue. Penske claims in the suit that revenue from affiliate links is down by over 1/3 this year, and it attributes that directly to a drop in traffic from Google.The company also claims it’s in a tough situation. It can either block Google from indexing its content, essentially removing itself from all search results, which would further devastate its business. Or, it can continue to provide training material to Google for its AI, “adding fuel to a fire that threatens PMC’s [Penske Media Corporation] entire publishing business,” the complaint states, according to the Wall Street Journal.This is, of course, just the latest battle between AI companies and the creators of the content they harvest. Encyclopedia Britannica and Merriam-Webster recently sued Perplexity, as did News Corp last year. Meanwhile Microsoft and OpenAI have found themselves in the crosshairs of the New York Times, the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, and others. Google might also have a tougher time defending itself now that it’s been forced to admit that “the open web is already in rapid decline,” as it faces multiple antitrust complaints.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Terrence O'BrienCloseTerrence O'BrienWeekend EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Terrence O'BrienAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularNest is dead, long live Google HomeI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failureFirst look at the Google Home app powered by GeminiAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
