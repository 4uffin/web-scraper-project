An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.OpenAI is teaming up with Nvidia via a “strategic partnership” that will get the ChatGPT-maker more compute and more cash to develop new models on the road to superintelligence.The partnership, announced Monday, will allow OpenAI to “build and deploy at least 10 gigawatts of AI datacenters with NVIDIA systems,” which translates to millions of GPUs that can help power OpenAI’s new models. One of the most important points here, besides more data centers and compute — which are always in high demand for companies like OpenAI — is that as part of the deal, NVIDIA “intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI progressively as each gigawatt is deployed,” per the release. The details will be finalized in the next few weeks, according to the companies.Nvidia will now be a “preferred strategic compute and networking partner for [OpenAI’s] AI factory growth plans,” OpenAI said.“Everything starts with compute,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. “Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.” Last week, OpenAI said ChatGPT had reached 700 million weekly active users.News of the strategic partnership comes after the January announcement that Microsoft would no longer be the sole compute provider for OpenAI, and that the tech giant would now just have a “right of first refusal” in such cases. Since then, OpenAI has branched out, beginning to build its own data centers and a $300 billion cloud computing deal with Oracle. OpenAI and Microsoft also put out a pointed statement earlier this month that they had signed a “non-binding memorandum of understanding,” adding that they are “actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement.”Microsoft has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI, but the companies have had to evolve their partnership as OpenAI grows. The companies have reportedly clashed over the “AGI clause” in their agreement, which would shut Microsoft out of earnings after OpenAI achieves AGI, or the idea of AI that equals or surpasses human intelligence.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Hayden FieldCloseHayden FieldSenior AI ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Hayden FieldAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIBusinessCloseBusinessPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All BusinessNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsNvidiaCloseNvidiaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NvidiaOpenAICloseOpenAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All OpenAITechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMore in this streamSee allApparently you can pay your way out of national security concerns.Richard LawlerSep 18Nvidia’s AI chips are no longer welcome in ChinaElissa WelleSep 17Nvidia and AMD will cut the US government in on revenue from AI chip sales in China.Richard LawlerAug 11Most PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Logitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersYou can now upgrade a retro Casio watch with Bluetooth, step tracking, and gamesSamsung now owns Denon, Bowers & Wilkins, Marantz, Polk, and more audio brandsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
