For example, the European Union’s AI Act that bans some uses of AI deemed “unacceptable” within the EU. There is also an agreement between the US and China that nuclear weapons should stay under human, not AI, control. But there is not yet a global consensus.In the long term, more is needed than “voluntary pledges,” Niki Iliadis, director for global governance of AI at The Future Society, said to reporters on Monday. Responsible scaling policies made within AI companies “fall short for real enforcement.” Eventually, an independent global institution “with teeth” is needed to define, monitor, and enforce the red lines, she said.“They can comply by not building AGI until they know how to make it safe,” Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley and a leading AI researcher, said during the briefing. “Just as nuclear power developers did not build nuclear plants until they had some idea how to stop them from exploding, the AI industry must choose a different technology path, one that builds in safety from the beginning, and we must know that they are doing it.”Red lines do not impede economic development or innovation, as some critics of AI regulation argue, Russell said. ”You can have AI for economic development without having AGI that we don’t know how to control,” he said. “This supposed dichotomy, if you want medical diagnosis then you have to accept world-destroying AGI — I just think it’s nonsense.”0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Hayden FieldCloseHayden FieldSenior AI ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Hayden FieldElissa WelleCloseElissa WelleAI ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Elissa WelleAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIAnthropicCloseAnthropicPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AnthropicNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsOpenAICloseOpenAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All OpenAIPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
