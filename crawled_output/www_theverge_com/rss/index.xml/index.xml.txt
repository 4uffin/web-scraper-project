<p class="has-text-align-none">The Beo Grace earbuds come with a matching aluminum charging case that you can turn into an audio transmitter by plugging it into a device with USB-C or line-in, allowing it to stream audio from your laptop, an airplane TV, or another device that might not support Bluetooth to your earbuds. There’s a leather pouch you can store the case in, too, but that will cost you an extra $400.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Beo Grace earbuds are available for preorder now, and will start shipping on November 17th.</p>

GoPro has announced a new handheld camera stabilizer that, unlike the Karma Grip stabilizer it debuted in 2016, can be used with more than just its action cameras.

<p class="has-text-align-none">GoPro has announced a new handheld camera stabilizer that, unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/12/4/13833832/gopro-karma-grip-stabilizer-hero5-price-release" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/12/4/13833832/gopro-karma-grip-stabilizer-hero5-price-release">Karma Grip stabilizer</a> it debuted in 2016, can be used with more than just its action cameras. The new Fluid Pro AI is compatible with the company’s devices like the Hero13 Black, but with a 400-gram payload capacity, it can also be used with smartphones and some compact point-and-shoot cameras. It’s more expensive than competitors’ products like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344307/insta360-flow-2-pro-smartphone-gimbal-tracking-stabilized-apple-iphone-watch">$159.99 Insta360 Flow 2 Pro</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614181/dji-osmo-mobile-7-pro-smartphone-gimbal-announcement-price-release-date">$149 DJI Osmo Mobile 7 Pro</a>, but its versatility and better battery life could justify its higher $229.99 price tag for some when it’s available on October 21st.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">As with Insta360 and DJI’s most recent gimbals, GoPro’s Fluid Pro AI has an integrated AI-powered tracking module that it uses to recognize hand gestures that can control it from afar and to keep subjects automatically in frame by locking on to their face or body. To manually select who you want to track, the gimbal can be connected to a mobile app, which provides additional tools for capturing panoramic images or time-lapses.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/gopro_fluid_2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.0099980003999178,100,99.9800039992" alt="Two images of the GoPro Fluid Pro AI gimbal with an action camera and smartphone attached." title="Two images of the GoPro Fluid Pro AI gimbal with an action camera and smartphone attached." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Swappable mounting brackets let you attach an action camera or smartphone to the Fluid Pro AI, as long as it weighs less than 400 grams.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: GoPro" data-portal-copyright="Image: GoPro" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Fluid Pro AI is capable of panning a camera a full 360 degrees and tilting it up to 320 degrees. It also features a built-in LED fill light and uses swappable mounting brackets that include a clamping mechanism to accommodate smartphones of various sizes. In lieu of features like a telescoping arm or tripod legs that pop out of its handle, the Fluid Pro AI has a sizable battery that GoPro says is good for up to 18 hours of use, or up to six hours when the AI tracker is active and the LED light is on. Intsa360’s and DJI’s only muster up to 10 hours with tracking disabled.</p>

It’s been nearly six years since GoPro launched its Max 360-degree camera. The original was only slightly larger than the company’s iconic action cameras and while the new Max2 is a bit taller, thicker, and 36 grams heavier than its predecessor, its 360-degree video capabilities have been improved from 5.6K / 30fps to 8K / [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s been nearly six years since GoPro launched its Max 360-degree camera. The original was only slightly larger than the company’s iconic action cameras and while the <a href="http://www.gopro.com/MAX2">new Max2</a> is a bit taller, thicker, and 36 grams heavier than its predecessor, its 360-degree video capabilities have been improved from 5.6K / 30fps to 8K / 30fps, and it now allows single-lens, 180-degree videos to be captured at up to 4K / 60fps.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The company had previously confirmed that it was working on a new version of its 360-degree action camera <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/6/23860476/gopro-max-360-video-new-model">as far back as 2023</a>, and after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/699058/gopro-max-2-360-degree-camera">sharing promotional images of the Max2</a> on Instagram in July, GoPro says it will finally be available starting on September 30th for $499.95. That’s nearly the exact same price as the original Max, which will potentially make it a tempting alternative to competitor’s 8K-capable 360-degree cameras, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715901/dji-osmo-360-degree-action-camera-8k">DJI Osmo 360</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/652785/insta360-x5-action-camera-replaceable-lens">Insta360 X5</a>, which both start at $549.99.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/gopro_max2_1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.0099980003999178,100,99.9800039992" alt="A close-up of the touchscreen side of the GoPro Max 2 360-degree camera." title="A close-up of the touchscreen side of the GoPro Max 2 360-degree camera." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The Max2 features a slightly larger 1.82-inch LCD touchscreen on one side.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: GoPro" data-portal-copyright="Image: GoPro" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Max2 can’t quite match the capabilities of the Osmo 360 that DJI says can capture 8K videos at up to 50fps, but GoPro insists its new 360-degree camera captures “true 8K” because, according to the company, it doesn’t count overlapping or unusable pixels captured between its two lenses, resulting in 16 to 21 percent more usable resolution than competitors’ offerings. That’s important because while 360-degree cameras were once popular for the novelty of being able to look around while watching a video, they’re now more useful as a camera that can record all the action going on around you with enough resolution to extract high-quality flat videos that can be easily shared and viewed online.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/gopro_max2_2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0.0099980003999178,100,99.9800039992" alt="A person holds an AirPods charging case next to the GoPro Max2 360-degree camera." title="A person holds an AirPods charging case next to the GoPro Max2 360-degree camera." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The Max2 supports Bluetooth microphones, letting you use even wireless earbuds to record audio.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: GoPro" data-portal-copyright="Image: GoPro" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Max2 carries forward a lot of features of the original, including a six microphone array with wind noise reduction that captures sounds in all directions, GPS, waterproofing to a depth of 16 feet, and an LCD touchscreen on one side that’s now 10 percent larger at 1.82 inches. Upgrades include the addition of support for Bluetooth microphones so you can use your wireless earbuds to record audio, 13 different voice command controls that can be used in 11 languages, and a larger 1,960mAh removable battery. On a full charge, the Max2 can capture 8K / 30fps footage for up to 66 minutes, which can be boosted to 90 minutes by dropping the resolution to 5.6K / 30fps.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most interesting features of the Insta360 X5 when it launched last April was swappable lenses, but the GoPro Max2 now offers that functionality, too. Its lenses are made from “strong optical glass with a water-repelling coating” and, should they get cracked or scratched, they can be removed and replaced without tools by simply twisting them off and on.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Footage from the Max2 can be edited on your smartphone using the GoPro Quik app. You can export videos that focus on a specific object or person using AI-powered tracking or you can choose your framing by just watching the 360-degree video and moving your phone around in real time. It’s designed to be consumer-friendly, but the Max2 is also compatible with the GoPro Labs beta program, which provides optional firmware updates that unlock advanced features like higher bitrates and on-screen histograms for pro users.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re tired of juggling an action camera plus a flashlight, torch, flare, or lantern anytime your adventures extend past sunset, GoPro has announced an <a href="http://www.gopro.com/LITHERO">updated version of its Hero action camera with illumination built right in</a>. The Lit Hero has a cluster of four bright LEDs positioned right next to its lens, and while GoPro hasn’t revealed exactly how much light they put out, they’re definitely brighter than the LED on the back of your smartphone.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Lit Hero is available for preorder starting today for $269.99 and is expected to ship starting on October 21st. GoPro’s standard Hero model, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235177/gopro-hero-13-black-10-bit-g-log-upgraded-battery-new-lenses">announced over a year ago</a>, is still $199.99. At 93 grams the Lit Hero is 7 grams heavier than the basic Hero, but in addition to the added lights, it comes with a performance bump from 4K/30fps to 4K/60fps and a battery that can record for up to 100 minutes at full quality with the LEDs turned off.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new action camera is still waterproof to a depth of 16 feet, and while underwater photography is potentially where the built-in light will be most useful, based on sample photos captured with the Lit Hero, the light doesn’t have an especially long range. It may be best suited as a way to illuminate nearby faces using an included diffuser to soften the intensity, or left off to make videos and images look like they were captured by an instant camera with an overzealous flash.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Google will soon let you ask its Gemini AI assistant for help progressing in mobile games. On Tuesday, <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-play/curation-update-september-2025/">Google announced</a> that a Gemini Live integration will appear within a new overlay on games downloaded from the Play Store, allowing you to ask for some hints without opening a new window.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The feature will roll out in select games over the coming months, and mimics the Gaming Copilot integration that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675456/microsoft-xbox-copilot-gaming-ios-android-update">Microsoft added to the Xbox mobile app</a> and on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780771/microsoft-xbox-copilot-windows-game-bar-available-download">Windows 11 PCs</a> this year. With Gemini Live, the AI assistant can “see” what’s on your screen, giving it the ability to tailor its suggestions to your game, according to Google. Similar to Microsoft’s Gaming Copilot, you can ask questions aloud while you play, and Gemini will respond with an audible response.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Along with access to Gemini, Google’s new in-game overlay will also include details about your rewards, offers, and achievements. Google is also widely releasing its initiative to bring Google Play Games to PC, three years after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891046/google-play-games-android-games-windows-pc-beta-launch">program’s beta launch</a>. There are currently more than 200,000 Google Play games that you can play across mobile and PC.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some other gaming-related updates coming to the Google Play Store include “enhanced” pages for games that provide an overview of your game progress, achievements, and developer updates. Google is also launching the ability to ask and answer questions about a game directly on its Google Play Store page in select markets,&nbsp; while other players can provide a response.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Google Play You tab will start rolling out this week in “select Play Points markets,” according to Google, and will expand to additional countries on October 1st.

<p class="has-text-align-none">The mechanical keyboard world has undergone a renaissance. Thanks to increased competition and commoditized tech, features that used to be exclusive to limited-run DIY boards in the $300-plus range just a few years ago are now available in prebuilt boards in the $100 to $200 range — sometimes less. The DIY kit builds, limited-run group buys, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23312108/angry-miao-cyberblade-anc-earbuds-am-hatsu-mechanical-keyboards-arthouse-design-tech">boutique boards</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/659125/norbauer-seneca-review-luxury-capacitive-keyboard">made by artisans</a> are still innovating and pushing boundaries, and they’re great if you’re looking for something extra adventurous or <em>very</em> specific. But if you just want a great keyboard for not much money, no assembly required, your options are better than ever.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are a bunch of keyboards under $200(ish) we like, including boards we’ve been sent for review and some we’ve bought ourselves.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re not picking a “best,” because these are all bangers. Nor is this a comprehensive list: there are <em>so</em> many great keyboards in this price range it’d be impossible to test them all. These are just ones we like. They’re all affordable, feature-rich keyboards that are a great upgrade for most people — excellent for simply typing away and more than capable for gaming.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Keychrons are the Toyotas of the mechanical keyboard world: reliable and excellent for the money. And they come in just about <a href="https://www.keychron.com/collections/all-keyboards">every layout you can imagine</a>. <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q14-max-alice-layout-qmk-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard?variant=41589612445785">Southpaw Alice</a>, anyone? The Q-series metal keyboards are among our personal favorites, but the cheaper, plastic-clad V series remains our go-to budget pick, and the <a href="https://www.keychron.com/collections/keychron-v-max-series-keyboard">V Max line</a> adds 1,000Hz wireless connectivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-v1-max-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard?variant=40637899800665">V1 Max</a> is the 75-percent board in this lineup, and it’s a great value. I’d opt for the Gateron Jupiter Banana switches for a stronger tactile feel than the Browns. (You can get a bare-bones kit, but Keychron charges so little for caps and switches, you might as well get them.)</p>

The V1 Max comes with modifier keycaps for both Windows and Mac, its battery lasts for days even while using its RGB backlighting, and it includes <em>both </em>USB-A and USB-C 2.4GHz dongles — with magnetic garages built into the chassis, ensuring you don’t misplace either.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.wobkey.com/products/rainy75">Wobkey’s Rainy 75</a> is one of a few keyboards that broke containment from the mech scene. It got big on TikTok thanks to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@milkcloud.o/video/7341674350086573314">videos highlighting</a> its <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nessasaurus_/video/7378314185760902442">raindrops-on-a-window typing sound</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cozyaddy_/video/7543636088280173846">vibey color options</a>. If I close my eyes, I also imagine the sounds of marbles gently jostling in a small bag. It’s very satisfying to hear when rapidly typing, and its soft-but-not-too-light Kailh Cocoa linear switches feel pleasant as well.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It comes in three different versions: a $129 Lite model, a $139 Standard model, and a $159 Pro with double the battery capacity and Kailh Cocoa switches (the ones most associated with the Rainy’s distinctive sound). Each Rainy model supports Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connections and comes in a wide selection of charming colors, paired with clean-looking keycap sets.</p>

</audio>
</div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/EPOMAKER-P75-Mechanical-Bluetooth-Swappable/dp/B0D66PTZR4?th=1">Epomaker P75</a> caused a stir among keyboard enthusiasts when it launched last year, offering tri-mode connectivity, a volume knob, three switch options, and a well-built aluminium chassis for just $100. It was an early sign we were hitting peak out-of-the-box keyboard. I picked one up myself for $80 during a Prime Day sale, and for that price, it blew me away.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I took a chance on the Wisteria tactile switches, which have a bright, poppy sound with strong tactile typing feedback. They’re not clicky switches, but they’re loud and proud. The P75 is one of the only keyboards I own that got on my wife’s nerves as she worked beside me during a hectic and long day, but it’s oh-so satisfying in short stints. The silver case is shinier than most matte-finish boards you normally find, but it could look right at home in front of a Mac Mini or other Apple-style silver peripherals (especially with the right keycaps). And the casing has a handy magnetic garage for easy storage of the 2.4GHz USB dongle — which I wish every keyboard had.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Considering how aggressively priced the P75 is, it’d be easy to recommend it over even a people-pleaser like the Keychron. It comes with nicer keycaps and a much better metal chassis, after all. But its loudness and somewhat janky (though workable) remapping software holds it back slightly.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Note:</strong> Epomaker has informed us the P75 is no longer being manufactured, so whatever inventory retailers like Amazon still have is likely to be all that’s left. Though it does have an even cheaper cousin, the </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/EPOMAKER-Mechanical-Swappable-Five-Layer-Bluetooth/dp/B0CNT61VMZ"><em>Epomaker x Aula F75</em></a><em>, which is plastic-clad and seemingly <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTHWRYrRoDBK6-MjgMW/">the king</a> of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@withcorinna/video/7507420939512991019">KeyboardTok</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="low-profile-keyboards">Low-profile keyboards</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you feel that you actually type faster on a laptop keyboard or you want a keyboard that travels easier, a low-profile mechanical keyboard could be right for you. They use shorter switches and much lower-height keycaps but with only <em>slightly</em> less key travel than regular mechanical switches. This yields a much more compact board while still offering most of the same benefits. While there are now many low-profile switch options, they still pale in comparison to the choice you have with standard switches and keycaps, and low-profile switches from different vendors usually aren’t cross-compatible.</p>

</div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The standard <a href="https://chilkey.com/collections/keyboards/products/nd75-assembled-edition">Chilkey ND75</a> is a great budget board in its own right, and the <a href="https://chilkey.com/products/nd75-lp">ND75 LP</a> is a low-profile version. It’s a handsome little board that comes in a few fun colors, and it’s much easier to throw in your bag. That said, the low-profile switches that come with this board sound wonderfully clacky, though they’re not quiet, so the ND75 LP may not be the best choice for some offices. The included keycaps look sharp in their two-tone color schemes and are of nice quality, though unlike low-profile boards from NuPhy, Iqunix, and Lofree they lack sub-legends showing shortcut controls — like screen brightness, volume, and media playback. the ND75 LP has that functionality, but you’ll need to <a href="https://manuals.plus/not-defined/nd75-lp-mechanical-keyboard-manual#:~:text=turn%20it%20on.-,Multimedia%20key%20combination,-Button%20description%20and">look up</a> and memorize the shortcuts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ND75 LP has a tiny screen you can use to toggle settings, or just display a looping GIF for funsies. And if you ever get tired of the low-profile feel, you can just swap in regular switches and keycaps — the ND75 LP is one of the few boards compatible with both low-profile and standard MX-compatible switches. Because why not?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve tested a half-dozen keyboards with low-profile mechanical switches — including the ND75 LP and various Lofree Flow models — but the <a href="https://iqunix.com/products/magi65?variant=48960681541938">Iqunix Magi65 Pro</a> is my favorite. Like the <a href="https://chilkey.com/products/nd75-lp">ND75 LP</a>, it uses flat, uniform-profile keycaps, but because the MG65 Pro has a flatter typing angle and no function row, using it feels less like reaching uphill.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Magi65 comes in two variants. There’s the <a href="https://iqunix.com/products/magi65?variant=48960665878834">regular Magi65</a> with a standard 65 percent layout, and the <a href="https://iqunix.com/products/magi65?variant=48960681541938">Pro</a>. The Pro (which I prefer) adds a rolling volume encoder, X-shaped media keys, and a garage for its 2.4GHz dongle hidden beneath a magnetic cover plate, and it has an RGB light bar between the volume roller and media keys. I just think it’s neat.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The sound from its Gold Red linear switches give it a quieter, less poppy sound than the ND75 LP, and its number-row keycaps have Mac function-row sub-legends, which is handy. The Magi65 Pro also comes with a few bonus keycaps — both Mac and Windows modifier keys, and a few purely decorative keys, including two metal ones — and a coiled USB-C cable with faux-Lemo disconnect in it.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Add the facts that the Magi65 Pro is remappable using VIA, has hot-swap sockets that are compatible with any Kailh Choc V2 switches, and has battery life in the weeks and months with the backlight turned off, and you can maybe see why it’s my favorite low-profile board. Iqunix has since released both <a href="https://iqunix.com/products/iqunix-magi75-96-aluminum-low-profile-mechanical-keyboard?variant=50355797426482">75 percent</a> and <a href="https://iqunix.com/products/iqunix-magi75-96-aluminum-low-profile-mechanical-keyboard?variant=50355798212914">96 percent</a> layout versions in both Pro and regular iterations, which I haven’t tested. <em>— Nathan Edwards, senior reviews editor</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One look at the <a href="https://store.dry---studio.com/products/dry-studio-ice-ring-63-rt?variant=51420399337745">Dry Studio Ice Ring 63 RT</a> leaves almost anyone totally baffled. The whole chassis is open-air like a stripped-out race car, the bottom plate is a slab of aluminum for dissipating heat, and there’s a rotating gear jutting out its left side for tuning the responsiveness of the keys. It’s all kind of bizarre, but right on point for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/630856/angry-miao-am-infinity-mouse-gaming-price-specs-impressions">Angry Miao designs</a> (Dry Studio’s parent brand).</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This very compact, lightweight board goes hard for gaming — it even includes a padded travel case for competitions / LAN parties. The rotating gear’s sole purpose is to change the actuation point for the Ice Ring’s magnetic Hall effect switches. Turn the dial and the RGB light emanating underneath changes color to signify its preset mode: from a standard 2mm actuation point to an ultra-fast 0.1mm. The gaming modes also enable rapid trigger, allowing <a href="https://wooting.io/rapid-trigger">faster resetting of the key input</a> as soon as your finger begins to lift.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Ice Ring is a legit and unique competitor to the <a href="https://wooting.io/wooting-60he">Wooting 60HE</a>.

Even if you’re not the most hardcore FPS gamer, this board is good, quirky fun. It doesn’t have a satisfying buttery sound like other keyboards we’ve outlined here, but it’s pleasant in its own way. And even with its hardcore design and rock-solid build, devoid of any flex or softness, it’s still nice to type on.</p>

This wired-only HE board has much more conventional looks than the Dry Studio and a straightforward 75 percent layout. But what’s most unique about it is inside: a dampening layer made of cork instead of the typical foam. It helps yield a marbley sound, almost like the Rainy 75, but with the speedy and adjustable response of magnetic Hall effect switches. It’s got all the usual features of HE boards like the Ice Ring, including rapid trigger, adjustable actuation points, and even the ability to map multiple functions to one key depending on how far you press it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As with any hobby, even as things get cheaper and commoditized there’s always a way you can dive even deeper down rabbit holes — and of course spend more money. Since it feels like everyone and their mother now makes hot-swap gasket-mounted keyboards with foam inserts and a metal chassis, that also means the mid-to-high-tier board makers are likely to start experimenting with whatever the next hot new thing may be. And aside from being cutting-edge, the other draw of higher-end keyboards is the dizzying amount of ways you can customize and build them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Evoworks is a lower-cost sub-brand of Qwertykeys / Owlab, a company that’s made some of the best-quality, most trendsetting mechanical keyboards of the last handful of years. The <a href="https://www.qwertykeys.com/products/evo80">Evoworks Evo80</a> is one of the nicest built mechs I’ve used — and I’ve tried some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204005/angry-miao-am-rgb-65-nintendo-game-boy-mechanical-keyboard-price-specs">nice ones</a>. The anodized metal case has a soft finish that feels so smooth and precious to the touch, I’d believe someone if they told me this keyboard cost well over $300 before even adding keycaps and switches. But it actually costs just $169.99 fully assembled with everything, including a massive battery and a decorative two-piece bottom weight plate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The real juice of the Evo80, though, is its sound. You can pick from a low-pitched “thocky”-sounding model with Oat switches and polypropylene internal plate or a high-pitched clacky setup with azure switches and FR4 thermoplastic-based plate. I know us keyboard fans overuse the term thock, which is meant to represent the deepest of marble-y sounds, but the low-pitch version of the Evo80 I tested is an absolute delight. Compared to something like the Rainy 75, which is fantastic in its own right, the Evo80 has a noticeably deeper, heftier tone. It’s a bass to the Rainy’s tenor or P75’s alto. As much as I’ve grown fond of many other keyboards in the low-$100 range we’re covering here, it’s very hard not to look at the Evo80 or new <a href="https://www.qwertykeys.com/products/evo75">Evo75</a> that just launched and think, “What’s another 50 bucks, right?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over in the build-your-own keyboard kit world, the Zoom series from Meletrix is one of the best of the mid-tier, starting at $200 and up. With so many great prebuilt options out there it might not sound logical to assemble your own keyboard, but a kit like the <a href="https://meletrix.com/collections/zoom75-tiga">Zoom75 Tiga</a> has near-endless possibilities. You determine its internal mounting method, type of switch plate (if you even put one in), and dampening material (like cork or foam). You can even set it up with alternative layouts like ISO or a split backspace key. And that’s before you choose your stabilizers, switches, and keycaps.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Building the Zoom75 Tiga took me a few hours. It’s been a few years since my last kit, so I’m a little rusty. But it wasn’t very difficult, and once assembled with its cork dampening kit, polyoxymethylene (POM) plate, and <a href="https://shop.wuquestudio.com/collections/switches-in-stock/products/ws-biglucky-switch-linear35pcs">WS BigLucky linear switches</a>, it felt like a fun project worth the time spent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Tiga, as I built it, sounds satisfyingly clacky but not overly bright or loud. But, keep in mind, you can change it whenever and however you want. It’s a time investment to strip down your keyboard and build it back up, but mid-tier boards like the Tiga (and even the Evo80) have new innovations to ease the pain, like a ball-catch quick-release top cover that releases with pressure instead of screws and magnetic pogo pin connectors instead of tiny ribbon cables for the PCB. The only downside of the Zoom75 was some spotty 2.4GHz wireless performance, requiring re-flashing the PCB and USB dongle firmware — eventually requiring a replacement USB dongle from Meletrix. (Users on the company’s Discord seemed to run into similar problems.)&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s the risk with DIY kit boards: they’re infinitely customizable, but you can also run into small issues or quirks along the way (especially if you assembled it wrong). And customer support usually means troubleshooting in a Discord community. But if you’re the hobbyist type, the process can feel rewarding.</p>

Google has spent a decade sharpening its "weapons" in an industry that helps sustain large swaths of the open internet, the Justice Department argued before a federal judge Monday. After years of operating an illegal monopoly in two ad tech markets and unlawfully tying its products together, nothing short of a break up will suffice [&#8230;]

The European Union wants to assess if Apple, Google, and Microsoft are doing enough to prevent the proliferation of online scams on their platforms. The Financial Times reports that EU regulators are formally requesting information from the three US tech companies under the Digital Services Act regarding their efforts to tackle financial fraud, alongside Booking [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">The European Union wants to assess if Apple, Google, and Microsoft are doing enough to prevent the proliferation of online scams on their platforms. <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/27c7e693-72c3-41a7-aac1-3bc449ffa2c2">The Financial Times</a></em> reports that EU regulators are formally requesting information from the three US tech companies under the Digital Services Act regarding their efforts to tackle financial fraud, alongside Booking Holdings, the global accommodation platform that owns Booking.com and other travel sites.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“We see that more and more criminal actions are taking place online,” EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen told the publication. “We have to make sure that online platforms really take all their efforts to detect and prevent that kind of illegal content.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Regulators will evaluate how Apple and Google are handling fraudulent applications like fake banking apps in their respective app stores, while Google and Microsoft’s search engines will be examined for fake search results. Booking, the only Europe-based company being scrutinized, will be analyzed over how it handles fake accommodation listings. These information requests could lead to official investigations being launched into the four companies, which would leave them faced with potential fines of up to six percent of their annual global turnover.</p>
