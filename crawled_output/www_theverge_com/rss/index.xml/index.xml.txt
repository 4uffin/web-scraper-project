The Trump administration’s crackdown on perceived left-wing threats following the death of Charlie Kirk continued on Monday evening, with Donald Trump announcing an executive order titled “Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization.” The order directs federal departments and agencies to “investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations — especially those involving terrorist [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump administration’s crackdown on perceived left-wing threats following the death of Charlie Kirk continued on Monday evening, with Donald Trump<strong> </strong>announcing an executive order titled “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/">Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization</a>.” The order directs federal departments and agencies to “investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations — especially those involving terrorist actions — conducted by Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa, or for which Antifa or any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa provided material support.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The impact of the order is unclear, as <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-designating-antifa-terrorist-organization/">experts have noted</a> that “domestic terrorism” isn’t recognized or sanctioned in the way foreign terror groups are. Additionally, “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21281581/antifa-bus-hoax-trump-misinformation-protests-police">antifa</a>” is an unstructured anti-fascist movement, as Trump-appointed former FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress in 2020 that antifa was not an organization, but a “movement or ideology.” Trump first said he would sign the order on Truth Social <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/politics/antifa-terrorist-designation-trump" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/17/politics/antifa-terrorist-designation-trump">last week</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Today’s order claims that “Antifa is a militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government,” with “coordinated efforts to obstruct enforcement of Federal laws through armed standoffs with law enforcement, organized riots, violent assaults on Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement officers, and routine doxing of and other threats against political figures and activists.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Since Kirk’s shooting, there have been Republican commentators, politicians, and public officials calling for civil liberties crackdowns targeting speech and donations to liberal political causes. Today’s order goes hand in hand with the campaigns targeting employers, Big Tech companies, and late-night talk show hosts.</p>

<p>If you’ve been holding off on getting a new iPhone, now’s the perfect time to size up your options. Apple recently launched its 2025 iPhone lineup, which includes the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and a brand-new model, the ultra-thin iPhone Air. These new phones offer a number of new features over their predecessors, such as upgraded cameras, faster chips, better battery life, and even better screens — Apple Intelligence, however, is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple-event/774963/apple-september-launch-event-ai-apple-intelligence">still a work in progress</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Alongside the new hardware, Apple also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777466/apple-ios-26-launch-iphone-liquid-glass-update">launched iOS 26</a> (yes, the numbering system has changed and we’re jumping from iOS 18), which includes a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple-ios/777383/iphone-ios-26-liquid-glass-redesign-look">Liquid Glass user interface</a>, live translation, wallpapers in messages, and more. The software marks Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/18/4741724/ios-7-review">biggest visual redesign since iOS 7</a>, and despite some very polarizing reactions, we think it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/mobile/710980/apple-ios-26-preview-liquid-glass-ux">looks fine</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If your current iPhone is humming along, there’s no need to rush out and get a new one. But if you’re questioning whether it’s the year to replace your iPhone that’s a few generations old, then I think the answer is an easy yes. There are real gains to be had this time around, especially in the basic iPhone 17, which features a higher-refresh-rate display than last year’s model for smoother-looking animations, plus double the base storage to 256GB — all without raising the price, despite the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/673424/trump-apple-iphone-tariff-25-percent-india">current tariff situation</a>.</p>

<p>The iPhone 17 marks a turning point for the standard model. After years with a lower-quality screen, the cheapest model finally got two major upgrades for 2025: an always-on display and a high-refresh-rate panel. These features make it feel meaningfully better than the iPhone 16 and prior models in everyday use, bringing it closer than ever to the Pro models. And at the same $799 starting price as the previous generation, this year’s update is a no-brainer.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While the iPhone 17’s 48-megapixel main camera is carried over from last year, the ultrawide camera has been changed from a 12-megapixel sensor to a 48-megapixel sensor, and it delivers sharper and more vibrant photos. The device features an 18-megapixel Center Stage selfie camera, which is also in the Air and 17 Pro. Your selfies may not look materially better, but the front camera’s square sensor elevates the user experience, making it possible to take horizontal selfies while holding the device vertically (no need to rotate the phone).</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/257946_iPhone_17_AKrales_0063.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 17’s always-on display lets you quickly glance at notifications.&lt;/em&gt;" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p>Apple also gives you double the storage — 256GB versus 128GB in the base iPhone 16 — and improved battery life. The standard 17 still lacks a proper telephoto camera, and the A19 chip is slower than the A19 Pro found in the Pro models. Still, it’s a big step up in almost every way, even if it looks basically the same as every iPhone from the past six years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The iPhone 17 Pro introduces a bold redesign and a number of notable upgrades, including the lineup’s most advanced camera setup yet. It also features rounded edges, and similar to last year, it’s on equal footing with the 17 Pro Max in terms of performance; the biggest differences that the Pro Max offers a larger display, a larger battery, and up to 2TB of storage.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Whereas the iPhone 17 is for most people, the 17 Pro is more geared toward creators. The device has three 48-megapixel cameras, including a 48-megapixel telephoto, and it offers several pro features aimed at those who want to take the best possible photos and videos. Some of those features include Genlock support, which lets videographers sync up timecodes across multiple cameras, and support for ProRes RAW recording. It also sports the upgraded Center Stage selfie camera found in other 2025 iPhone models.</p>

<p>Despite the additions and improvements, there’s little here that makes the 17 Pro an absolute must-upgrade. However, it comes in an irresistible orange, which is apparently the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/775186/apple-iphone-17-pro-cosmic-orange-color-good">new “it” color</a>.</p>

<p>The iPhone 17 Pro Max’s redesign isn’t just about looks. Apple hollowed out the device’s aluminum frame to fit in the biggest battery yet in an iPhone. Apple says the device offers up 39 hours of video playback, which is 12 more hours than last year’s iPhone 16 Plus, our previous battery champ. The device can easily push through a full day and then some, though your mileage will vary depending on how often you play mobile games, watch videos, and doomscroll on social media.</p>

<p>There are other benefits to going with the 17 Pro Max. It has the largest display among the latest iPhone lineup — 6.9 inches — and offers up to 2TB of storage, giving creators more room than ever for storing their media.

<p class="has-text-align-none">The iPhone Air is Apple’s biggest redesign since the iPhone X was released in 2017. It’s shockingly thin and light, at 5.6mm and 165 grams, respectively. Thanks to its titanium frame and Ceramic Shield 2 display, it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/782245/iphone-air-jerryrigeverything-durability-test">more durable</a> than you might expect, too. The device feels deceptively small, despite having a 6.5-inch display. You really have to see and feel the phone yourself to get the appeal.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But the thinner design comes with a few substantial compromises compared to the other models available this year. One of the biggest is that the Air features a single 48-megapixel camera on the back. That’s not to say the device’s camera is <em>bad</em>. But it’s a far less versatile system than even the far more affordable iPhone 17, which has a dual-camera setup. The second compromise is on battery life, which is just okay. It’s not terrible, but it’s not great, either.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At $999, you’re paying a lot for middling battery life and camera performance. Those who primarily care about design, though, may be more forgiving about those shortcomings.</p>

We really wish it included MagSafe for $599, but those upgrading from older iPhones will probably be satisfied with what&#8217;s included.</div>
<figure class="product-image"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="200" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/DSC_2268-Enhanced-NR_b11600.jpg?w=300" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="A hands-on photo of Apple’s iPhone 16E." /></figure>
<div class="product-scores"><h4>Score: 7</h4><table class="product-pros-cons"><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Reliable performance</li><li>Good, if limited, camera system</li><li>It’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>No MagSafe</li><li>$599 feels like $100 too much</li><li>No ultrawide</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-16e&#038;subid1=Verge022725"> $599 at <strong>Apple</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-iphone-16e-128gb-apple-intelligence-black-verizon/6443386.p"> $599.99 at <strong>Best Buy</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/apple-iphone-16e/"> $599.99 at <strong>Verizon</strong></a></li></ul></div>
<p><em><em><strong>Screen:&nbsp;</strong>6.1-inch Super Retina XDR /&nbsp;<strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;A18&nbsp;<strong>Cameras:</strong>&nbsp;48MP Fusion</em></em> with 1x and 2x optical zoom, 12-megapixel selfie<em><em> /&nbsp;<strong>Battery:&nbsp;</strong>Not advertised /&nbsp;<strong>Charging:</strong>&nbsp;20-watt wired, <em><em>7.5W Qi</em></em></em></em>, no MagSafe<em><em>/&nbsp;<strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong>&nbsp;IP68</em></em></p>
<p>This recommendation comes with a heavy sigh. Yes, the 16E is the cheapest new iPhone Apple sells. Yes, it’s a good phone. It has a capable camera, reliable performance, full water resistance, wireless charging, and will be supported with software updates for years to come. But its $599 price tag starts to feel like too much when you consider what it’s missing. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no MagSafe, which you can kind of add by way of a MagSafe case, but it’s a bummer not to have it built in when it has basically become a standard iPhone feature. There’s no ultrawide camera, no Dynamic Island housing timely information, no camera control button (not a huge loss, honestly), and no Ultra Wideband for precise object tracking. It does support Apple Intelligence, but that doesn’t feel like much of a consolation, given that it’s very much still a work-in-progress.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The 16E will most likely receive more years of software support than a previous-gen model like the iPhone 14 or 15. And sure, Apple Intelligence might turn into something useful someday. The 16E is a good choice if you want the path of least resistance to blue bubbles and FaceTime at your fingertips. But if you’d like MagSafe, a more advanced camera, and some of the other bells and whistles that got lost on the way to the 16E, then it’s not a bad idea to look at one of the older iPhones.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4PDv5T">What’s coming next</h2>
<p>Apple’s latest iPhone lineup is available now, but there are already reports about what’s next.

Apple is reportedly still working to flatten the crease that appears when the phone is unfolded, but has otherwise settled on a design. Looking ahead to 2027, a report claims Apple is planning a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/765063/apple-iphone-air-redesign-three-year-plan">redesigned “all-screen” iPhone</a> to celebrate the device’s 20th anniversary. These upcoming releases are allegedly part of Apple’s three-year plan — starting with the new iPhone Air — that’s aimed at refreshing its smartphone lineup.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a post on X, malware tracker vx-underground revealed that bad actors targeted some streamers with a spearphishing campaign that attempted to lure victims into <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1970036781765800212">promoting the game</a> in exchange for compensation. “Unfortunately, the Steam game was actually a cryptodrainer masquerading as a legitimate video game,” vx-underground wrote in a post on X.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talk show is returning on Tuesday after Disney pulled it off the air over comments made about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. In a statement on Monday, Disney said it planned to resume production after having “thoughtful conversations” with Kimmel.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,&#8221; Disney said. &#8220;It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.&#8221; The original decision was made shortly after Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr threatened the operating licenses of broadcast stations that aired Kimmel’s show, a move that put ABC under pressure from major broadcasting companies Nexstar and Sinclair, both of which said they would no longer transmit Kimmel’s show.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even with <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> returning to its normal schedule, it’s still not clear whether all ABC affiliates will air it. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar for more information but didn’t immediately hear back.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">During the episode that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/780502/heres-the-jimmy-kimmel-clip-that-got-him-pulled-off-the-air">got <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> pulled off the airwaves</a>, Kimmel remarked that “we hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.” Carr claimed the statement violated broadcasters’ mandate to act in the “public interest” and said they could handle Kimmel “the easy way or the hard way” — the latter with the FCC involved.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The decision to suspend Kimmel’s talk show <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/781148/jimmy-kimmel-charlie-kirk-monologue-brendan-carr-censorship-first-amendment">sparked outrage</a> among <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/781629/senate-democrats-push-brendan-carr-on-censorship">Democratic lawmakers</a>, free speech advocates, and hundreds of celebrities <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jimmy-kimmel-celebrities-backing-tom-hanks-jennifer-aniston-1236377217/">who signed a letter</a> in support of Kimmel, calling the situation a “dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.” The FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it would retaliate against Disney, ABC, or broadcasters that put Kimmel’s show back on the air.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“I am glad to see Disney find its courage in the face of clear government intimidation,” Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/agomezfcc.bsky.social/post/3lzhcglkwv22j">said in response to the decision</a>. “It will continue to be up to us as citizens to push back against this Administration’s growing campaign of censorship and control.”</p>

Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points, all of which run the company’s new operating system, macOS 26. It discontinued the M1 MacBook Air to make room for newer models, but Walmart is still selling the 2020 laptop starting at $599 — $50 [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points, all of which run the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple-mac-os/777936/apple-macos-tahoe-26-final-release-testing-impressions-liquid-glass">new operating system, macOS 26</a>. It discontinued the M1 MacBook Air to make room for newer models, but <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/609040889/">Walmart</a> is still selling the 2020 laptop starting at $599 — $50 off its previous low and a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319419/apple-macbook-pro-m4-max-pro-review-price-specs">latest 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> with M4 Pro.</p>
<p>Purchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy. Apple has recently shaken things up by increasing the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before (and thus, more opportunities for discounts). For example, the latest MacBook Air 13 with Apple’s M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is down to $799 ($200 off) at <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/apple-macbook-air-13-inch-laptop-apple-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight/JJGCQ8RH7G">Best Buy</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Although Macs may not get perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $800. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. <a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac&amp;subid1=vergedeals030724">Apple’s refurbished store</a> provides a one-year warranty on all products, and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.</p>
<p>But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="EVXzol">The best MacBook Air deals</h2>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pEzsTQ">M1 MacBook Air</h3>
<p>The<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon">2020 </a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon">M1 MacBook Air</a> was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and brick-and-mortar stores. It’s still a great choice if you want a MacBook for non-intensive productivity work, especially given that it features a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, but since newer Mac laptops handily outperform it, you won’t find it in our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops">guide to the best laptops</a>.</p>
<p>The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24101727/apple-m1-macbook-air-laptop-walmart">committed to keeping it around</a> for the foreseeable future and is currently <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/609040889">discounting it to $599</a> ($50 off), which is its lowest price to date.</p>
<div class="product-block"><h3>2020 MacBook Air with M1 (256GB)</h3>
<div class="product-description">The 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold).</div>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3VqFgR">M2 MacBook Air</h3>
<p>The M2 MacBook Air is a slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Given that it’s slightly newer than the M1, it delivers better performance, but if you want to really futureproof your laptop, we recommend spending slightly more for a laptop that has a faster, newer processor. </p>
<p>Still here for the M2? It has some downsides to be on the lookout for, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191141/apple-macbook-pro-13-m2-base-model-slow-device">slower storage in the base 256GB configuration</a>, and the notch cut-out in its screen is divisive (Apple shows no signs of ditching it, either).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review/23207440/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review">M2-powered MacBook Air</a> from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning; however, you can still get the 13-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors at <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-air-13-inch-apple-m2-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight/6602763.p?acampID=0&amp;affgroup=%22Content%22%2C%22Howl+Migrated+Partners%22%2C%22May+Contract+Change%22%2C%22Partners+to+Keep%22%2C%22Temp+0%25%22&amp;irclickid=1ngXNix1oxycUYK11Bwh9QfKUksRLrQFQ2yxU00&amp;irgwc=1&amp;loc=Vox+Media&amp;mpid=482924&amp;ref=198&amp;skuId=6602763">Best Buy</a> starting at $699 ($100 off). The 15-inch MacBook Air M2 is also still available in short supply at some retailers for its original MSRP, though at this point, you’d be better off going with a discounted M4 model.</p>

<p>Apple’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24114684/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-15-inch-2024-review">updated entry-level laptops arrived in 2023</a> in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance over the previous generation and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also offer 18 hours of battery life and have a MagSafe charging port. Apple discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM in 2024 and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24282981/apple-macbook-air-m2-m3-16gb-ram-minimum-price-unchanged">now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration</a>.</p>
<p>The entry-level 13-inch M3 MacBook Air configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is tough to find in stock. However, you can get the 24GB RAM / 512GB SSD model with a 10-core GPU for $1,299

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="m4-macbook-air">M4 MacBook Air</h3>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In March, Apple released an updated <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review">MacBook Air</a>, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, it comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest&nbsp;MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some sizable discounts. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage<strong> </strong>on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZDC3WW5">Amazon</a> in select colors starting $799<strong> </strong>($200 off). If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for<strong> </strong>$999 ($200 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZDBDCFH">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1883968-REG/apple_mw1l3ll_a_15_macbook_air_m4.html">B&amp;H Photo</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="RdiMiF">The best MacBook Pro deals</h2>
<p>During its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23933672/apple-event-mac-october-news-updates-products-scary-fast">“Scary Fast” event</a> in 2023, Apple announced MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24270706/apple-macbook-pro-m4-pro-max-14-16-announcement-specs">M4-based machines in October 2024</a>, but the last-gen M3 models can often be the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="phB246">M3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro</h3>
<p>The entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23944344/apple-macbook-pro-14-2023-review-m3-specs-battery-ports">14-inch M3 MacBook Pro</a> has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).</p>
<p>The M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup.</p>
<p>We’re having trouble finding the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock. <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-pro-14-laptop-m3-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-8gb-memory-10-core-gpu-1tb-ssd-silver/6551409.p">Best Buy</a> is selling the 14-inch, M3-powered MacBook Pro with<strong> </strong>8GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a 10-core GPU for $1,599, which isn’t a discount (and we think most people should not settle for 8GB of RAM in 2025). If you need a higher-powered laptop with a larger display, you can get the 16-inch, M3 Pro-powered MacBook Pro with 36GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and an 18-core GPU for $2,099 ($700 off) at <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/apple-macbook-pro-16-laptop-m3-pro-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-36gb-memory-18-core-gpu-512gb-ssd-silver/JJGCQXS7GZ">Best Buy</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="m4-and-m4-pro-macbook-pro">M4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro</h2>
<p>Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro in November 2024. Notably, the base <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks">14-inch M4 MacBook Pro</a> is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new in this model is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.</p>
<p>The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option.</p>
<p>Many variations of the M4 MacBook Pro with different screen and processor configurations are on sale right now. For example, you can currently pick up the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHWM5FB">Amazon</a> for $1,299.99 ($300 off). Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,799 ($200 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-12-core-16-core/dp/B0DLHY2BJ6">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-apple-m4-pro-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-24gb-memory-512gb-ssd-space-black/6602748.p?skuId=6602748&amp;nrtv_cid=xihekf1lfnwyc&amp;irclickid=1ngXNix1oxycUYK11Bwh9QfKUksR4j1hQ2yxU00&amp;irgwc=1&amp;ref=198&amp;loc=Howl%20Technologies%2C%20Inc.&amp;acampID=0&amp;mpid=376373&amp;affgroup=%22Content%22%2C%22Partners%20to%20Keep%22%2C%22Temp%200%25%22">Best Buy</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="dJ3cdr">The best Mac Mini deals</h2>
<p>The newest Mac Minis in town are the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283861/apple-redesigned-mac-mini-macbook-pro-imac-m4-photos">M4-based models, which arrived late last year</a>. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cUuNKL">M4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini</h3>
<p>Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24289730/apple-mac-mini-m4-review">M4 Mac Mini</a> starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23762570/apple-mac-studio-m2-ultra-2023-review">Mac Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23770770/apple-mac-pro-m2-ultra-2023-review">Mac Pro</a> when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.</p>
<p>In addition to the odd decision to place the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282752/the-magic-mouse-haters-are-going-to-have-a-field-day-with-this-one">power button on its underside</a>, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.</p>
<p>Right now, you can get the base Mac Mini at <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859258-REG/apple_mu9d3ll_a_mac_mini_m4_10c_10cgpu_16gb_256gb.html">B&amp;H Photo</a><strong> </strong>with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for<strong> </strong>$499 ($100 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for around $689 ($110 off) at <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859259-REG/apple_mu9e3ll_a_mac_mini_m4_10c_10cgpu_16gb_512gb.html">B&amp;H Photo</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core/dp/B0DLBX4B1K">Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale for around $1,301 ($99 off)<strong> </strong>at<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core/dp/B0DLBVHSLD">Amazon</a><strong> </strong>and $1,309 <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859256-REG/apple_mcx44ll_a_mac_mini_m4_pro_12c.html">B&amp;H Photo</a>.</p>

The new features include a new “dating assistant” AI chatbot that helps you find potential matches as well as a new “Meet Cute” feature that automatically matches you with someone using a “personalized” algorithm.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">With the dating assistant, you can type out specific prompts to try and match up with certain types of people; Meta gives the example of “find me a Brooklyn girl in tech.” The assistant can also help “level up your profile” or offer dating ideas. The chatbot will be available in the Matches tab and is “gradually” rolling out in the US and Canada, Meta says.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The Meet Cute feature will pair you with someone every week and is “ideal for anyone who’s tired of swiping and is looking for a fresh, easy way to expand their typical pool of dating candidates,” Meta says. (OkCupid tried something similar <a href="https://www.themarysue.com/new-okcupid-blind-date-app/">in 2013</a> with its Crazy Blind Date app.) Meta is “exploring” adding other time frequencies for the recommendations and you can opt out of the Meet Cute if you like. </p>

On Monday, more than 200 former heads of state, diplomats, Nobel laureates, AI leaders, scientists, and others all agreed on one thing: There should be an international agreement on “red lines” that AI should never cross —&#160;for instance, not allowing AI to impersonate a human being or self-replicate.&#160; They, along with more than 70 organizations [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, more than 200 former heads of state, diplomats, Nobel laureates, AI leaders, scientists, and others all agreed on one thing: There should be an international agreement on “red lines” that AI should never cross —&nbsp;for instance, not allowing AI to impersonate a human being or self-replicate.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">They, along with more than 70 organizations that address AI, have all signed the Global Call for AI Red Lines <a href="https://red-lines.ai/#call">initiative,</a> a call for governments to reach an “international political agreement on ‘red lines’ for AI by the end of 2026.” Signatories include British Canadian computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, OpenAI cofounder Wojciech Zaremba, Anthropic CISO Jason Clinton, Google DeepMind research scientist Ian Goodfellow, and others. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“The goal is not to react after a major incident occurs… but to prevent large-scale, potentially irreversible risks before they happen,” Charbel-Raphaël Segerie, executive director of the French Center for AI Safety (CeSIA), said during a Monday briefing with reporters.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">He added, “If nations cannot yet agree on what they want to do with AI, they must at least agree on what AI must never do.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The announcement comes ahead of the 80th United Nations General Assembly high-level week in New York, and the initiative was led by CeSIA, the Future Society, and UC Berkeley’s Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Ressa mentioned the initiative during her <a href="https://webtv.un.org/en/asset/k14/k14a609n83">opening remarks</a> at the assembly when calling for efforts to “end Big Tech impunity through global accountability.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some regional AI red lines do exist. For example, the European Union’s AI Act that bans some uses of AI deemed “unacceptable” within the EU. There is&nbsp; also an agreement between the US and China that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-xi-agreed-that-humans-not-ai-should-control-nuclear-weapons-white-house-2024-11-16/">nuclear weapons</a> should stay under human, not AI, control. But there is not yet a global consensus.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the long term, more is needed than “voluntary pledges,” Niki Iliadis, director for global governance of AI at The Future Society, said to reporters on Monday. Responsible scaling policies made within AI companies “fall short for real enforcement.” Eventually, an independent global institution “with teeth” is needed to define, monitor, and enforce the red lines, she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“They can comply by not building AGI until they know how to make it safe,” Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley and a leading AI researcher, said during the briefing. “Just as nuclear power developers did not build nuclear plants until they had some idea how to stop them from exploding, the AI industry must choose a different technology path, one that builds in safety from the beginning, and we must know that they are doing it.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Red lines do not impede economic development or innovation, as some critics of AI regulation argue, Russell said. ”You can have AI for economic development without having AGI that we don&#8217;t know how to control,” he said. “This supposed dichotomy, if you want medical diagnosis then you have to accept world-destroying AGI — I just think it&#8217;s nonsense.”</p>

It feels like July’s four-day Prime Day just happened, but Amazon’s annual fall sale event is about to make its return. Prime Big Deal Days kicks off on Tuesday, October 7th, at 3AM ET and lasts through October 9th at the same time. For those who haven’t shopped this event in previous years, think of [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">It feels like July’s four-day Prime Day <em>just </em>happened, but Amazon’s annual fall sale event is about to make its return. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech">Prime Big Deal Days</a> kicks off on Tuesday, October 7th, at 3AM ET and lasts through October 9th at the same time. For those who haven’t shopped this event in previous years, think of it as a Black Friday / Cyber Monday primer that lets you get the jump on your holiday shopping.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But these sales are only for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">Amazon Prime subscribers</a>. If you’re interested in the goodies being offered but haven’t signed up for Prime, don’t worry — Amazon makes it very easy.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignleft"><blockquote><p>If you’re attracted by the goodies being offered but haven’t signed up for Prime, Amazon makes it very easy</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Besides giving access to Prime Day bargains, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=23945845011">Amazon includes a bunch of features</a> to entice people to sign up for its Prime service. These include access to its streaming video service, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/offers/">Prime Video</a>, which sadly is no longer ad-free, though you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=TD5EYJIUGQMY13QQdi">pay extra for that</a>; free and faster shipping on purchases (with two-day or one-day delivery for many items and even same-day delivery for some); discounts on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/fmc/learn-more">a selection of Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods groceries</a>; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/">Amazon Music</a> ad-free audio streaming (not to be confused with the more extensive Amazon Music Unlimited, which is an additional $10.99 per month for Prime members and $11.99 per month for non-members); <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/">Prime Gaming</a>, which includes a free Twitch channel subscription and a bunch of free games; unlimited photo storage (along with 5GB of video storage); and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/nonprime-pr/">Prime Reading</a>, which gives you access to a rotating library of comics, books, and magazines as well as early access to a curated selection of new books. Amazon also added discounts at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277750/amazon-prime-bp-earnify-savings-fuel-rewards">BP and Amaco gas stations</a> last year.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/myh/households">share your Prime account</a> with one other adult, and up to four teens and four children — shared benefits include fast delivery, Prime streaming access, purchased ebooks and other media, and early access to lightning deals. (Some features, such as Music Prime, are not shared.) And you get a 30-day free trial, so you can try it (and the Prime Day specials) out. However, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769051/amazon-prime-free-shipping-benefit-sharing-ending">starting October 1st</a>, Amazon will no longer let Prime members share free shipping benefits with those who live at a different address.</p>
<p>Here’s how to sign up.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime/">https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime</a> and scroll down to where it says <strong>Choose your plan</strong>. You can immediately click on the button that says <strong>Start your free 30-day trial </strong>if you want, but don’t you want to see what your options are first?</li>
<li>Choose which plan you want. The basic plan lets you sign up for the service for $14.99 per month or $139 per year, which comes out to a little over $12 a month. </li>

You’ll get a free six-month trial subscription (if you’re a new member), and after that, you’ll only have to pay $7.49 a month or $69 a year. </li>
<li>If you’re on any of a variety of government assistance programs, like SNAP and Medicaid, you can also join for less with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/58f8026f-0658-47d0-9752-f6fa2c69b2e2/qualify/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref=us_lt35_prime_desktop&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=vergeprimeday2020-20&amp;linkId=60e0e4a6adcecd8761a4c1fd3e75cb8e&amp;language=en_US">Prime Access</a>: $6.99 a month with a free 30-day trial.</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="b3jpMU">Create an account</h2>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Once you’ve decided which plan you’re going to go with, you’ll need an Amazon account. If you don’t already have one, you’ll need to sign up. Click on <strong>Start your free 30-day trial</strong> and then <strong>Create your Amazon account</strong> to set one up with your name, email, and password. We strongly recommend <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215571/factor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to">setting up two-factor authentication</a> for your account as well.</li>
<li>On the next page, Amazon will verify your account by sending what it calls an OTP (one-time password) to your email. Go to your email, copy the OTP, paste it into the Amazon page, and click <strong>Verify</strong>.</li>
<li>You’ll then be asked to enter your credit or debit card information.</li>
<li>And you’re done!</li>
</ul>
<p>We should probably mention the obvious: you can sign up for a Prime membership, take advantage of the free 30-day trial, and then cancel it once the Prime Day sale is over. But you can only do that once, so you won’t be able to use that trick next year when Prime Day comes around.</p>

The Steam Autumn Sale starts next Monday, but Valve dropped an early treat in the form of a rare Steam Deck LCD discount. The 256GB model that normally sells for $399.99 is $319.20 through October 6th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. I, for one, thank Valve for dropping this deal now instead of when [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Steam Autumn Sale starts next Monday, but Valve dropped an early treat in the form of a rare <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">Steam Deck LCD discount</a>. The 256GB model that normally sells for $399.99 is $319.20 through October 6th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. I, for one, thank Valve for dropping this deal now instead of when the servers inevitably hiccup at the start of the game sale.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For anyone out there deciding between the Steam Deck LCD, the pricier OLED, and perhaps other handhelds, it’s tough to beat the value of this discounted model. The Deck will be four years old in February, but it’s still a contender when it comes to good, reliable performance in PC games, especially considering how power-efficient it is. Another perk: it runs SteamOS, not Windows 11.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Also, game compatibility across Steam is generally great (more and more developers are building games with the Steam Deck’s specs in mind ahead of launch), and Valve has patched the Steam Deck frequently throughout the years with new features. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review">It didn’t start out great</a>, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">it eventually got there</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Sure, the $549 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> boasts some nice perks that some will be willing to pay extra for, like a bigger battery, a 90Hz refresh rate OLED, faster Wi-Fi 6E. But at just over $200 less, you’re getting a pretty similar gaming experience in the Steam Deck LCD.</p>
<div class="product-block"><h3>Steam Deck (LCD)</h3>
<div class="product-description">The Steam Deck is a portable handheld console you can use to play PC games.</div>
