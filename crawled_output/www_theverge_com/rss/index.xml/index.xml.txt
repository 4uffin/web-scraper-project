While it seems like a foregone conclusion that there will be a foldable iPhone, possibly late next year, there hasn’t been much info about what it would look like. In the latest installment of his Power On newsletter Mark Gurman says he’s being told it will look more or less like two iPhone Airs stuck [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">While it seems like a foregone conclusion that there will be a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204421/apple-first-foldable-iphone-arrive-2026">foldable</a> iPhone, possibly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660739/apple-may-stagger-next-years-iphones-to-make-way-for-a-foldable">late next year</a>, there hasn’t been much info about what it would look like. In the latest installment of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-21/mark-gurman-s-iphone-17-first-impressions-touchscreen-macbook-pro-meta-glasses?cmpid=BBD092125_POWERON&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=250921&amp;utm_campaign=poweron">Power On newsletter </a>Mark Gurman says he’s being told it will look more or less like two <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/779588/apple-iphone-air-review-battery-camera">iPhone Airs</a> stuck together.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That means it should be pretty thin, though potentially thicker than a Pixel 10 Pro Fold (10.8mm) and Galaxy Z Fold7 (8.9mm) since an iPhone Air comes in at 5.6mm thick. Though Ming-Chi Kuo’s sources suggest the foldable will be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/625162/kuo-makes-fresh-foldable-iphone-predictions">quite a bit thinner</a> when unfolded, possibly as little as 4.5mm. Unfortunately, Gurman also expects the foldable iPhone to cost more than the Pixel Fold, starting at at least $2,000, possibly more.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One benefit of basing the foldable on the iPhone Air’s design is durability. While foldables have improved a lot over the years, there are still concerns about how they can stand up to abuse. But Gurman says the iPhone fold will be made of titanium, just like the Air, which both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/782245/iphone-air-jerryrigeverything-durability-test">JerryRigsEverything</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woya8vjeFpo">iFixIt</a> have found to be pretty tough. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">iFixIt also gave the iPhone Air a surprisingly decent repairability score of seven. If an iPhone fold could even get close to the same repairability score it would be a pretty big deal. Both the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Google_Pixel_Fold">Pixel Fold</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/9KhF6emBjbE">Z Fold7</a> earned repairability scores of three, meaning these phones that are far more fragile than your standard glass rectangle are also much harder to repair.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Analyst <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1968249865940709538">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> took to X on Wednesday to claim that a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/779759/apple-macbook-pro-oled-touchscreen-rumors">MacBook Pro with an OLED touchscreen</a> was expected to enter mass production by late 2026. Today <em>Bloomberg’s</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-21/mark-gurman-s-iphone-17-first-impressions-touchscreen-macbook-pro-meta-glasses?cmpid=BBD092125_POWERON&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=250921&amp;utm_campaign=poweron">Mark Gurman</a> is following up to remind us that he was reporting on a touchscreen MacBook Pro way back in 2023. He confirmed Kuo’s timeline was correct.
Since Gurman’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/apple-working-on-adding-touch-screens-to-macs-in-major-turnabout?sref=9hGJlFio">original story</a>, the launch date has been pushed back from late 2025, to late 2026 or early 2027. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Apple has traditionally been resistant to the idea of merging the iPad and MacBook lines, and still likely won’t do it completely. But according to Gurman iPad sales have begun to taper off, and customers increasingly expect touch-based interfaces, even on their laptops. This is in part because many Windows laptops now include touchscreens by default. So Apple is feeling the pressure to bring the two product lines more in sync with each other.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re the kind of person who owns leather driving gloves in multiple colors to match your different Jaguars, then there hasn’t been a digital paper option that could live up to your lofty luxury standards until now. But Montblanc is finally delivering a truly bougie take on the e-ink writing tablet. The $905 <a href="https://www.montblanc.com/en-us/discover/edit/digital-writing-by-montblanc.html">Montblanc Digital Paper </a>writing tablet combines a basic black-and-white e-ink screen with a digital pen modeled on the company’s <a href="https://www.montblanc.com/en-us/meisterstuck-platinum-line-midsize-ballpoint-pen-MB132491VG.html">Meisterstück</a>. As you’d expect you can jot down notes, sketch, and even annotate books in epub or PDF format.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Technical details are relatively light. There’s a 3740 mAh battery inside its aluminum shell, but there’s no mention of how long it’s expected to last under normal use. There’s a leather side bar where the pen attaches magnetically and charges wirelessly, and we know that it overs “over 4,000” levels of pressure sensitivity. But the tech specs are clearly besides the point. Montblanc isn’t selling you a cutting edge device, it’s selling you a luxury experience. What’s important isn’t the resolution of the screen, it’s the interchangeable tips that mimic three different paper textures. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The company has dipped its toes into digital writing before with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/1/12749642/montblanc-augmented-paper-hands-on-ifa-2016">Augmented Paper</a> line and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/3/6101153/mont-blanc-tries-to-turn-the-stylus-into-a-luxury-product">styli</a> for Samsung, but this is largely new territory for Montblanc. If you’re in the market for a e-ink writing tablet you’re probably going to get more for your money (like color) by going with the $629 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24234815/the-remarkable-paper-pro-is-as-outrageous-as-it-is-luxurious">Remarkable Paper Pro</a>. But if you’re looking for a lux e-ink experience that will look at home on a <a href="https://www.montblanc.com/en-us/discover/brand/wes-anderson.html">solid oak desk</a> nestled between your gold name plate and humidor, the Montblanc Digital Paper pad (in its $205 calf leather folio, of course), might fit the bill.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The memos also advise any H-1B employees and their H-4 dependents currently in the US to remain and not travel abroad until further notice. Since the changes to the H-1B visa are structured as a travel restriction, employers are concerned that any workers that are part of the program will be denied reentry to the country without a $100,000 fee. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The White House press secretary <a href="https://x.com/presssec/status/1969495900478488745">Karoline Leavitt</a> took to X to try and calm panicked workers and companies by assuring them that current visa holders would not be charged the $100,000 upon reentry and could continue to travel as normal. However, it doesn’t appear that these assurances have changed people’s behavior much.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hi all&#8211;We have now reviewed the actual text of today&#8217;s Presidential Proclamation on H-1B visas, which you can find here: Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers &#8211; The White House. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Here&#8217;s what you need to know: </strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First, the proclamation is structured as a travel restriction. Beginning at 12:01 am eastern time on September 21, 2025 (so, 9:01 pm Pacific time tomorrow), individuals will not be able to enter/return to the U.S. in H-1B status unless their petition has an additional $100,000 payment associated with it. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What you need to do: </strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you are in H-1B status and are in the U.S., you should remain in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. We know this may interrupt your travel plans. But the critical thing is to stay in the U.S. in order to avoid being denied reentry. </li>
<li>While the proclamation doesn&#8217;t reference H-4 dependents, we also recommend that H-4s remain in the U.S. </li>
<li>If you are in H-1B or H-4 status and are currently outside the U.S., we strongly recommend that you do what you can to return to the U.S. tomorrow before the deadline. The Proclamation was released within the last 30 minutes, so we realize that there isn&#8217;t much time to make sudden travel arrangements.

<p class="has-text-align-none">I will be updating this post later this evening with a form for people to fill out if they are currently outside the U.S. with an H-1B visa.

All the fawning by tech CEOs wasn’t enough to convince Donald Trump to back off his crusade against immigrants. Yesterday the president announced that the government would be adding a $100,000-a-year fee on all H-1B visas in an effort to discourage their use.&#160; While many industries make significant use of the H-1B program to attract [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">All the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/772760/tech-ceos-ai-trump-white-house-dinner">fawning by tech CEOs</a> wasn’t enough to convince Donald Trump to back off his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/09/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-suspends-the-entry-of-certain-alien-nonimmigrant-workers/">crusade against immigrants</a>. Yesterday the president announced that the government would be adding a $100,000-a-year fee on all H-1B visas in an effort to discourage their use.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While many industries make significant use of the H-1B program to attract highly skilled foreign workers, the tech industry is particularly reliant. Amazon has roughly 14,000 H-1B workers across its multiple entities, far more than any other company according to data from the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub">federal government</a>. But Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and Tata Consultancy (a major IT services firm) each have more than 4,000 employees working on H-1B visas.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The fee will only apply to new applicants and it’s likely to face legal challenges, but even just the specter of this change appears to have some companies <a href="https://x.com/onestpress/status/1969374699038675364?t=jDzfhbAprVkR5qJLgqb3jA&amp;s=19">scrambling</a>. There are <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/work/microsoft-urges-h-1b-visa-holders-to-stay-in-us-for-foreseeable-future-after-trump-announces-100000-visa-fee/articleshow/124009637.cms?from=mdr">reports</a> that Microsoft and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/simonwillison.net/post/3lzbrkxfahs22">Amazon</a> issued <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rivertam.bsky.social/post/3lzbgopvsos2g">internal memos</a> advising any workers currently abroad that operate on a visa to return to the US before the new fees kick in at midnight tonight. When asked, Microsoft declined to comment on the leaked memo or the changes to the H-1B program. Unsurprisingly, tech companies have already been warning those working on visas <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/03/31/immigration-h1b-fear-siliconvalley/">not to leave the US</a> for fear that they might not be able to return.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt took to X to clarify that the $100,000 fee would not apply to renewals or existing visa holders. She also said that H-1B holders could travel as normal and would not be restricted from reentering the country. However those assurances appear to have done little to calm people’s nerves.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Broadly when the White House talks about attracting the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/trump-h-1b-visas-fee.html">top, top people</a>” to the US, it seems they’re talking about wealth not skill. It also unveiled a so-called “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/19/trump-gold-card-visa-00573494">gold card</a>” program that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will replace the existing <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-first-preference-eb-1">EB-1</a> and <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-second-preference-eb-2">EB-2</a> visa programs. Those programs are for people of “extraordinary ability” (often artists, athletes, educators, and executives) or those with advanced degrees in competitive fields. The replacement program demands that applicants “prove [their] exceptional value to the United States of America by contributing a million dollars.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the gold card potential immigrants would pay $1,000,000 as part of a fast-tracked application process, and that fee could climb to $2,000,000 if the person was sponsored by a company for employment. Clearly this new program would favor wealth over actual skills, though the Trump administration claims (without any data to back it up) that it will raise over $100 billion that it will use to pay down the debt and lower taxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, with the national debt currently exceeding <a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20national%20debt,accumulated%20over%20the%20nation's%20history.&amp;text=Updated%20daily%20from%20the%20Debt%20to%20the%20Penny%20dataset.">$37 trillion</a>, and the federal government expected to add more than <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61305">$2 trillion in 2025</a>, any revenue raised by the gold card program or fees on H-1B visas would be insignificant.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Updated</strong>: Added response from Microsoft</em> and clarifications from press secretary Karoline Leavitt.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A cool new perk recently became available for Prime members: for a limited time, you can get a three-month subscription to <strong>Kindle Unlimited</strong>. If your ebookshelf is looking bare, Amazon is currently offering a three-month subscription to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku/ref=2025">Kindle Unlimited</a> for free. The service typically costs $11.99 per month, so the deal saves you $35.97 over the course of the trial. Keep in mind that your subscription will automatically renew once the trial period is over. The discount is one of Amazon’s early <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/774151/amazon-october-prime-day-fall-dates-2025">Prime Big Deal Days</a> deals (that’s a mouthful), dropping well ahead of the October 7th event. We’ll be on the hunt for more early deals as that date approaches.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kindle Unlimited is a subscription service that gives you access to a library of over four million books, thousands of audiobooks, and an assortment of magazines. You can download items from the Kindle Unlimited library onto — you guessed it — a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-glare-free/dp/B0CFPJYX7P/">Kindle</a>, or any device with the Kindle app. The library is large enough that you should be able to find books in your favorite genres (perhaps by your favorite author, too) and three months is plenty of time to tear through a full series or two. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You can browse the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Browse-Kindle-Unlimited-Books/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=9069934011">Kindle Unlimited library</a> before subscribing to see if there’s any books you’re interested in. It has some must-reads, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canterbury-Tales-Translation-Gerald-Davis-ebook/dp/B01GQK9EPY"><em>The Canterbury Tales</em></a><em> </em>and the entire <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leviathan-Wakes-Expanse-Book-1-ebook/dp/B0047Y171G"><em>The Expanse</em></a><em> </em>series. If you’re reading on a device with a color screen, you can use Kindle Unlimited to read manga and comics, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Watchmen-2019-Alan-Moore-ebook/dp/B07ST6DPBQ"><em>Watchmen</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Batman-Who-Laughs-2018-ebook/dp/B07WC9XV26"><em>The Batman Who Laughs</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doomsday-Clock-Complete-Collection-2017-ebook/dp/B08JSJZFWZ"><em>Doomsday Clock: The Complete Collection</em></a><em>, </em>and get the full experience. <em>&nbsp;</em></p>
