<p class="has-text-align-none">With new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782251/trump-h-1b-skilled-worker-visas-cost-100000">restrictions and fees on work visas</a> in the US set to take effect at midnight tonight, it’s no surprise that many employers are advising workers abroad to return to the US. Leaked memos from <a href="https://sources.news/p/heres-googles-memo-warning-h-1b-employees">Google</a>, <a href="https://x.com/simonw/status/1969429646682067362/photo/2">Amazon</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rivertam.bsky.social/post/3lzbgqokk2k2g">Microsoft</a> have been circulating on social media that instruct instruct any H-1B visa holders currently traveling to immediately make travel arrangements to land in the US before 12AM ET on Sunday September 21st. The companies all acknowledge the limited warning provided and apologize, promising to provide more guidance as the situation evolves. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The memos also advise any H-1B employees and their H-4 dependents currently in the US to remain and not travel abroad until further notice. Since the changes to the H-1B visa are structured as a travel restriction, employers are concerned that any workers that are part of the program will be denied reentry to the country without a $100,000 fee.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ve included the full text of the leaked memos below. Microsoft declined to comment for this story, and Amazon and Google had not responded at the time of publication. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Microsoft</strong>:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>IMPORTANT ADVISORY: New travel restriction for H-1B visa holders</strong> </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Hi all&#8211;We have now reviewed the actual text of today&#8217;s Presidential Proclamation on H-1B visas, which you can find here: Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers &#8211; The White House. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Here&#8217;s what you need to know: </strong></p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">First, the proclamation is structured as a travel restriction. Beginning at 12:01 am eastern time on September 21, 2025 (so, 9:01 pm Pacific time tomorrow), individuals will not be able to enter/return to the U.S. in H-1B status unless their petition has an additional $100,000 payment associated with it. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What you need to do: </strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you are in H-1B status and are in the U.S., you should remain in the U.S. for the foreseeable future. We know this may interrupt your travel plans. But the critical thing is to stay in the U.S. in order to avoid being denied reentry. </li>
<li>While the proclamation doesn&#8217;t reference H-4 dependents, we also recommend that H-4s remain in the U.S. </li>
<li>If you are in H-1B or H-4 status and are currently outside the U.S., we strongly recommend that you do what you can to return to the U.S. tomorrow before the deadline. The Proclamation was released within the last 30 minutes, so we realize that there isn&#8217;t much time to make sudden travel arrangements. But again, we strongly encourage you to do your best to return. </li>
</ul>
<p class="has-text-align-none">I will be updating this post later this evening with a form for people to fill out if they are currently outside the U.S. with an H-1B visa. We want to be able to follow up with each individual and provide support and guidance as they try to return within the next 28 hours. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The proclamation does not impact any other visa statuses. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There is other content about the pause in processing H-1B petitions for individuals who are outside the U.S. At this time, we do not interpret this to immediately impact extensions of H-1B status or changes of status to H-1B as long as you are currently in the U.S. We&#8217;ll share more about that later.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Proclamation is scheduled to take effect this Sunday at 12:01 AM ET. It introduces significant changes to re-entry procedures for H-1B visa holders currently outside the United States. We continue to review the Proclamation, but the initial advice we have received is that re-entry will require a mandatory payment of $100,000 per petition, which may cause substantial delays or prevent re-entry to the U.S.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>If you are currently in the U.S.:</strong></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We <strong>strongly advise against any international travel</strong> if you are in valid H-1B status or need to travel to activate your H-1B visa. You should remain in the U.S.</li>

After this deadline, individuals cannot enter the U.S. on H-1B status without an additional $100,000 payment associated with their petition. Recommended actions for you to take:</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you have H-1B status and are in the U.S.: Stay in the country for now, even if you have travel planned for the immediate future. We will continue to provide updates as more details are available.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you have H-4 dependent status: We also recommend you remain in the U.S., though the proclamation doesn&#8217;t specifically mention H-4 dependents.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you have H-1B or H-4 status and are outside the U.S.: Try to return before tomorrow&#8217;s deadline if possible. We realize this is short notice but returning soon is advisable and you should make every effort possible to clear U.S. customs before 12:00 a.m. EDT (9:00 p.m. PDT) on Sunday, September 21, 2025.</p>

All the fawning by tech CEOs wasn’t enough to convince Donald Trump to back off his crusade against immigrants. Yesterday the president announced that the government would be adding a $100,000-a-year fee on all H-1B visas in an effort to discourage their use.&#160; While many industries make significant use of the H-1B program to attract [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">All the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/772760/tech-ceos-ai-trump-white-house-dinner">fawning by tech CEOs</a> wasn’t enough to convince Donald Trump to back off his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/09/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-suspends-the-entry-of-certain-alien-nonimmigrant-workers/">crusade against immigrants</a>. Yesterday the president announced that the government would be adding a $100,000-a-year fee on all H-1B visas in an effort to discourage their use.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">While many industries make significant use of the H-1B program to attract highly skilled foreign workers, the tech industry is particularly reliant. Amazon has roughly 14,000 H-1B workers across its multiple entities, far more than any other company according to data from the <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub">federal government</a>. But Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, and Tata Consultancy (a major IT services firm) each have more than 4,000 employees working on H-1B visas.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The fee will only apply to new applicants and it’s likely to face legal challenges, but even just the specter of this change appears to have some companies <a href="https://x.com/onestpress/status/1969374699038675364?t=jDzfhbAprVkR5qJLgqb3jA&amp;s=19">scrambling</a>. There are <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/nri/work/microsoft-urges-h-1b-visa-holders-to-stay-in-us-for-foreseeable-future-after-trump-announces-100000-visa-fee/articleshow/124009637.cms?from=mdr">reports</a> that Microsoft and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/simonwillison.net/post/3lzbrkxfahs22">Amazon</a> issued <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rivertam.bsky.social/post/3lzbgopvsos2g">internal memos</a> advising any workers currently abroad that operate on a visa to return to the US before the new fees kick in at midnight tonight. When asked, Microsoft declined to comment on the leaked memo or the changes to the H-1B program. Unsurprisingly, tech companies have already been warning those working on visas <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/03/31/immigration-h1b-fear-siliconvalley/">not to leave the US</a> for fear that they might not be able to return.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Broadly when the White House talks about attracting the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/19/us/politics/trump-h-1b-visas-fee.html">top, top people</a>” to the US, it seems they’re talking about wealth not skill. It also unveiled a so-called “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/19/trump-gold-card-visa-00573494">gold card</a>” program that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will replace the existing <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-first-preference-eb-1">EB-1</a> and <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-second-preference-eb-2">EB-2</a> visa programs. Those programs are for people of “extraordinary ability” (often artists, athletes, educators, and executives) or those with advanced degrees in competitive fields. The replacement program demands that applicants “prove [their] exceptional value to the United States of America by contributing a million dollars.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the gold card potential immigrants would pay $1,000,000 as part of a fast-tracked application process, and that fee could climb to $2,000,000 if the person was sponsored by a company for employment. Clearly this new program would favor wealth over actual skills, though the Trump administration claims (without any data to back it up) that it will raise over $100 billion that it will use to pay down the debt and lower taxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, with the national debt currently exceeding <a href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20national%20debt,accumulated%20over%20the%20nation's%20history.&amp;text=Updated%20daily%20from%20the%20Debt%20to%20the%20Penny%20dataset.">$37 trillion</a>, and the federal government expected to add more than <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61305">$2 trillion in 2025</a>, any revenue raised by the gold card program or fees on H-1B visas would be insignificant.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A cool new perk recently became available for Prime members: for a limited time, you can get a three-month subscription to <strong>Kindle Unlimited</strong>. If your ebookshelf is looking bare, Amazon is currently offering a three-month subscription to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku/ref=2025">Kindle Unlimited</a> for free. The service typically costs $11.99 per month, so the deal saves you $35.97 over the course of the trial. Keep in mind that your subscription will automatically renew once the trial period is over. The discount is one of Amazon’s early <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/774151/amazon-october-prime-day-fall-dates-2025">Prime Big Deal Days</a> deals (that’s a mouthful), dropping well ahead of the October 7th event. We’ll be on the hunt for more early deals as that date approaches.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kindle Unlimited is a subscription service that gives you access to a library of over four million books, thousands of audiobooks, and an assortment of magazines. You can download items from the Kindle Unlimited library onto — you guessed it — a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-glare-free/dp/B0CFPJYX7P/">Kindle</a>, or any device with the Kindle app. The library is large enough that you should be able to find books in your favorite genres (perhaps by your favorite author, too) and three months is plenty of time to tear through a full series or two. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You can browse the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Browse-Kindle-Unlimited-Books/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=9069934011">Kindle Unlimited library</a> before subscribing to see if there’s any books you’re interested in. It has some must-reads, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canterbury-Tales-Translation-Gerald-Davis-ebook/dp/B01GQK9EPY"><em>The Canterbury Tales</em></a><em> </em>and the entire <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leviathan-Wakes-Expanse-Book-1-ebook/dp/B0047Y171G"><em>The Expanse</em></a><em> </em>series. If you’re reading on a device with a color screen, you can use Kindle Unlimited to read manga and comics, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Watchmen-2019-Alan-Moore-ebook/dp/B07ST6DPBQ"><em>Watchmen</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Batman-Who-Laughs-2018-ebook/dp/B07WC9XV26"><em>The Batman Who Laughs</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doomsday-Clock-Complete-Collection-2017-ebook/dp/B08JSJZFWZ"><em>Doomsday Clock: The Complete Collection</em></a><em>, </em>and get the full experience. <em>&nbsp;</em></p>

You’d be forgiven for assuming the iPhone Air would snap like a twig under pressure. It’s almost impossibly thin at just 5.6mm. But, its titanium frame is not only stronger than aluminum, it’s also more elastic. YouTuber JerryRigEverything demonstrates this with his usual bend test.

<p class="has-text-align-none">You’d be forgiven for assuming the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/779588/apple-iphone-air-review-battery-camera">iPhone Air</a> would snap like a twig under pressure. It’s almost impossibly thin at just 5.6mm. But, its titanium frame is not only stronger than aluminum, it’s also more elastic. YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ56ve39l2I">JerryRigEverything</a> demonstrates this with his usual bend test. While he’s able to get some slight bowing by pressing his thumbs into the center of the screen with all his might, it doesn’t crack and immediately returns to its original shape. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Not content to be thwarted by Apple’s engineering team (and perhaps feeling a little disappointed that the last several devices on his channel survived the bend test), JerryRigEverything takes a trip out to his garage. With the help of a crane scale and some metal bars he’s able to find out exactly just how much pressure it takes to crack the iPhone air — 216 pounds.</p>

Henry is only half of a head - just eyes, ears, nose, and the top of their head - meaning they move around by sliding on the floor and jumping up and down. Also, Henry can possess everyday objects. It's a strange concept, but the developers at Lululu Entertainment use the goofy ideas to tell a poignant story and have a <em>lot</em> of fun along the way.</p>

A 10 percent stake in Intel, 15 percent of Nvidia’s China sales, a “golden share” of Nippon Steel — what price will Trump extract next in exchange for favorable treatment?

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/764480/intel-donald-trump-lip-bu-tan-deal">10 percent stake in Intel</a>, 15 percent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/regulator-newsletter/757996/trump-screwed-over-nvidias-chinese-sales-then-let-them-happen">of Nvidia’s China sales</a>, a “golden share” of Nippon Steel — what price will Trump extract next in exchange for favorable treatment? Well, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/u-s-government-expected-to-get-multibillion-dollar-fee-in-tiktok-deal-685e3944?st=Z4pVCZ&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> is reporting</a> that the Trump Administration is “expected to collect a multibillion-dollar fee” in exchange for negotiating a US takeover of TikTok’s US business.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">That fee will reportedly come from TikTok’s US investors, including private equity firm Silver Lake and Oracle, with the new group getting half of TikTok, while TikTok China’s parent company ByteDance would still have under 20 percent.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yesterday, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOwC4q7kYpg/">Trump said that</a> “the United States is getting a tremendous fee-plus, I call it a ‘fee-plus,’ just for making the deal.” But Trump <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/738172/trump-threatens-100-percent-tariff-on-computer-chips-with-a-gigantic-loophole">says a lot of things that need dissecting</a>, and it was absolutely unclear today <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/781967/tiktok-deal-us-china-still-ambiguous">whether there’s even a TikTok deal or not</a>.
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So to see the <em>WSJ</em> reporting that “people familiar with the matter” think a deal might not only get approved, but also see billions of dollars flow from US companies into the Trump Administration’s coffers, sounds like something to be aware of.
Why would those companies pay Trump’s government billions unless they think they’ll make even more? </p>
