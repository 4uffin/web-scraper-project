Today, Microsoft and Asus are officially opening preorders for the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X at $599 and $999 respectively in the US. They’re $799 CAD and $1299 CAD in Canada, €599 and €899 in Europe, £499 and £799 in the UK, and $799 AUD and $1599 AUD in Australia. They both [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Microsoft and Asus are officially opening preorders for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X</a> at $599 and $999 respectively in the US. They’re $799 CAD and $1299 CAD in Canada, €599 and €899 in Europe, £499 and £799 in the UK, and $799 AUD and $1599 AUD in Australia. They both ship October 16th.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">(In the United States, the Xbox Ally X will be exclusive <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/rog-xbox-ally-x-7-fhd-120hz-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-ai-z2-extreme-processor-24gb-with-1tb-ssd-windows/JJGHGPLVHW">to Best Buy</a>, the <a href="https://shop.asus.com/us/90nv00h2-m003l0-rog-xbox-ally-x-2025.html">Asus Shop</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/rog-xbox-ally-x/8mzbmmcjzns9/">Microsoft</a>; the Xbox Ally is going wider at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM6C3ZMN">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/rog-xbox-ally-7-fhd-120hz-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-a-processor-16gb-with-512gb-ssd-windows/JJGHGPGFL4">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/ROG-Xbox-Ally-2025-RC73YA-XB-ALLY-Z2A-16/17398308268">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/rog-xbox-ally/8mzbmmcjznt5/">Microsoft</a>, the <a href="https://shop.asus.com/us/90nv00g1-m001b0-rog-xbox-ally-2025.html">Asus Shop</a>, and <a href="https://www.antonline.com/Asus/Electronics/Gaming_Devices/Handheld_Game_Consoles/1529274">Ant Online</a>.)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a few different ways to look at those prices. If you’re used to console pricing, Microsoft’s first Xbox handhelds are not cheap! Even the vanilla white Xbox Ally costs $150 more than a Switch 2, which was itself criticized for price, and it costs $100 more than a far more powerful Xbox Series X did at launch in the US, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">Microsoft’s new Xbox price hike notwithstanding</a>. In Europe and the UK, the weaker of the two Allys costs the same as an Xbox Series X.
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">But you can’t play <em>that</em> Xbox in a passenger seat. And if you’re a PC gamer, or want to be, things look a bit rosier. These “Xbox” handhelds will be the first with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780388/microsoft-xbox-fullscreen-mode-windows-11-handheld-leak">a new build of Windows</a> that hides the desktop and Explorer shell, frees up gobs of memory for your games, and (hopefully) lets you navigate solely by controller.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Handhelds have unfortunately been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/682594/asus-rog-ally-x-price-hike-legion-go-s-steam-deck-oled-supply">getting pricier</a> and pricier anyhow, to the point flagship ones now cost as much as gaming laptops. At $999, the Xbox Ally X might compare well to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review">$999 MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost">$1,349 Lenovo Legion Go 2</a> that offers the same AMD Z2 Extreme chip you’ll find here — particularly because my colleagues and I agree the new Allys have one of the most comfortable designs we’ve held. (In summary: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/776797/xbox-ally-x-prongs-comfort-editorial">Prongs rock</a>.)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Just know you’re getting a wildcard if you opt for the $599 Ally, as it contains a never-before-seen Ryzen Z2 A processor that’s much more like the chip in the Steam Deck. Instead of 8 Zen 5 CPU cores and 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores designed to run between 15 and 35 watt TDP, you’re getting 4 Zen 2 CPU cores and 8 RDNA 2 GPU cores designed to run between 6 and 20 watts for lower performance gaming.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re planning to have reviews of the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X in the coming weeks. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Microsoft says they’ll be available in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico,
the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, and Vietnam — and will additionally come to Brazil China, India, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Philippines and Switzerland.<a href="https://youtu.be/-pPqcWGnVDk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to promoting Pritchard, who has been with the company since 2006, Nintendo’s American arm will be adding Satoru Shibata as CEO.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nvidia’s <a href="https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/audio2face/latest/overview.html">Audio2Face</a> works by analyzing the “acoustic features” of a voice, allowing it to generate animation data that it maps to the 3D avatar’s facial expressions and lip movement. The company notes that developers can use the tool to create 3D characters for pre-scripted content, as well as for livestreams.</p>

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order recognizing the framework of a deal between ByteDance and the US that would satisfy the TikTok divest-or-ban law. The deal values TikTok’s US operations at $14 billion and puts it under the control of companies based in the US. “I spoke with President Xi [Jinping], we had [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/saving-tiktok-while-protecting-national-security/">signed an executive order</a> recognizing the framework of a deal between ByteDance and the US that would satisfy the TikTok divest-or-ban law. The deal values TikTok’s US operations at $14 billion and puts it under the control of companies based in the US.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">“I spoke with President Xi [Jinping], we had a good talk,” Trump said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3urjiwp_wQ">during a briefing</a>. “I told him what we were doing, and he said, ‘Go ahead with it.’”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the deal, TikTok “will be majority-owned and controlled” by companies based in the US. The order states that TikTok’s US-based operations will have a new board of directors that will have to follow rules to protect American data and national security, while TikTok’s recommendation algorithm, code, and content moderation system in the US will come under the control of its new owners.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/25/trump-approves-tiktok-deal-through-executive-order.html">CNBC’s David Faber</a> says Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX, which is based in Abu Dhabi, will get a 45 percent stake in TikTok’s US company. Investors in TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance, will get 35 percent, according to CNBC.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When asked whether TikTok’s algorithm will show MAGA-related content, Trump responded, “If I could make it 100 percent MAGA, I would. But it’s not going to work out that way, unfortunately.” Trump added that, “every group, every philosophy, every policy will be treated fairly.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Since coming into office, Trump <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688252/tiktok-ban-trump-extension-deal">has continued</a> to push back the deadline for TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company as negotiations dragged on. Last Friday, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/781967/tiktok-deal-us-china-still-ambiguous">President Donald Trump said</a> he “made progress” on an agreement with China, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/white-house-tiktok-algorithm-data-deal-trump-china-rcna232627">later stating</a> that the administration is &#8220;100% confident that a deal is done.”</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Just one day before TikTok’s most recent ban enforcement deadline on September 16th, Trump announced that he would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/779161/trump-extends-the-tiktok-ban-enforcement-deadline-again">extend it a fourth time</a> while the US continues working out a deal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent referenced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778087/tiktok-ban-framework-deal-us-china-trump">a potential agreement</a> ahead of the extension, telling reporters that the US and China have reached a “framework” deal, and Trump said that big companies were lined up to buy into it.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump was the first to attempt a TikTok ban in 2020, and the idea gained bipartisan support under Biden, resulting in a 2024 divest-or-ban law. Critics of TikTok contended the app could be used for surveillance or propaganda by the Chinese government, rejecting anything short of a full sale. But Trump’s own stance softened, he said, in part due to his popularity on the app — and a potential backlash from young voters during the 2024 presidential election likely didn’t hurt. “Is it that important for China to be spying on young people?” he said in January 2025. “On young kids watching crazy videos?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amazon’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/782478/october-amazon-prime-day-deals-guide">October Prime Day event</a> (also known as Prime Big Deal Days) doesn’t officially start until October 7th, but that doesn’t mean you have to wait to find a good deal on charging accessories. Many speedy wall adapters, power banks, and large battery backup solutions are already on sale now from brands like Anker and Jackery. Most of these products are great for keeping your smartphone, laptop, or tablet charged at a cafe, while others are made to power your small appliances while you’re out camping.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">For starters, <strong>Anker’s 633 Magnetic Battery </strong>is available in multiple colors from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Foldable-Wireless-Portable/dp/B09NRG4GK3">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.anker.com/products/a1641">Anker</a> (with code <strong>WS7DV2FSCH8D</strong>) for $39.99 ($20 off), its best price to date. The compact, MagSafe-equipped battery pack can supply compatible iPhone models with up to 7.5W of power and features an integrated kickstand, so you can prop up your phone while it charges. Alternatively, you can plug your device into its USB-C port for 20W charging, rather than relying on wireless charging, which is ideal when you’re in a rush and have a USB-C cord. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Anker’s 633 power bank also supports passthrough charging — meaning you can charge a device and the battery pack simultaneously — and features A USB-A port on the bottom that lets you plug in a second gadget if needed. At 10,000mAh, it also has enough power and capacity to fully charge most smartphones at least once, with some juice left in the tank.</p>
<div class="product-block"><h3>Anker 633 Magnetic Battery</h3>

<h3>Where to Buy:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Foldable-Wireless-Portable/dp/B09NRG4GK3"> <strike>$59.99</strike> $39.99 at <strong>Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.anker.com/products/a1641"> <strike>$59.99</strike> $39.99 at <strong>Anker (with code WS7DV2FSCH8D)</strong></a></li></ul></div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you could use a wall outlet, <strong>Anker’s 735 Charger</strong> is currently matching its all-time low of $25.99 ($14 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Compact-Foldable-MacBook/dp/B09C5RG6KV">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.anker.com/products/a2667">Anker’s online storefront</a> (with promo code <strong>WS7DV2L3ORHI</strong>). The three-port, 65W charger features a slim design that won’t block other outlets, as well as two USB-C ports with a combined output of 65W, which is fast enough to quickly charge phones, handheld game consoles, and select laptops at or near their maximum speed. It can even charge a 14-inch MacBook Pro from zero to 50 percent in 35 minutes.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The single USB-A port tops out at 22.5W, which is still plenty fast for charging devices with small batteries, including mice, keyboards, headphones, and wireless earbuds. The charger will automatically adjust the wattage sent to each port if more than one device is connected, too, and the top USB-C port will always receive the most juice in every instance. One of my favorite touches is that its prongs fold down, which keeps them from getting damaged while traveling.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re an avid camper, <strong>Jackery’s Explorer 1000 V2</strong> is a great way to keep your essential gadgets powered up when you go off the grid. The power station has three AC outlets, a DC outlet, two USB-C ports, and a USB-A port. Jackery says its 1,070Wh battery can charge a smartphone up to 74 times, a laptop up to 14 times, or power a coffee maker for over an hour and a half. An early October Prime Day deal knocks its price down to $429 ($370 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-Explorer-Portable-Generator-Emergency/dp/B0D7PPG25F">Amazon</a>, its biggest discount of the year so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">You can top up the Explorer 1000 V2 by plugging it into an outlet, allowing you to take it from zero to 100 percent in as little as an hour with the emergency charging setting enabled. The company <span>also sells <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-SolarSaga-Portable-Compatible-Generator/dp/B0D8377KV3" target="_blank">a solar panel</a> that’s compatible with it, which increases the charging time but should allow you to get by if you really can’t reach</span> an outlet. The power station typically outputs up to 1,500W but has a peak output of 3,000W in case you plug in multiple appliances at once. Jackery says the power station’s battery cells should retain around 70 percent of their maximum capacity after 4,000 power cycles, which is equivalent to about 10 years.</p>

The Pro Ultra sports a giant 18-inch display with a meager 1920 x 1200 resolution and an absolutely <em>massive</em> 192Wh battery.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s listed as including an AMD Ryzen 5 processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and 512GB NVMe SSD. Ports include USB-C, USB 3.0, HDMI, SD card reader, and a headphone jack. There isn’t much more info at this time, except a price of €449 ($523). That’s likely a <em>starting</em> price for one of the smaller models. We’ve reached out to Avenir Telecom for more details.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But let’s get back to that big 192Wh battery, claiming to get up to 28 hours of “intensive office use” or seven days of standby time. That ain’t gonna fly. Literally.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/lithium-batteries">FAA</a> does not allow passengers to take a lithium battery greater than 160Wh on a plane, and even one above 100Wh requires air carrier approval. It’s why most big laptops top out at 100Wh. The <a href="https://www.catsa-acsta.gc.ca/en/what-can-bring/guidelines-batteries">Canadian Air Transport Security Authority</a> has some exceptions for large batteries meant for wheelchairs and mobility aids, but they’re supposed to be outside the device. Perhaps the Energizer is strictly a road trip laptop?</p>

You can already look back at previous parts of livestreams as they’re going on by clicking through to the Videos section of a streamer’s profile, but it seems like this change will be a much easier way to rewind and see what you missed.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Rewinding will be available first on the web, and initially only for Twitch Turbo subscribers or for channels that you subscribe to individually. Twitch is doing this more limited launch to start because the company needs to make sure that the feature doesn’t become a way to get around ads, CEO Dan Clancy <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2574798976?t=00h47m48s">says in a livestream</a>. Twitch plans to release the feature to everyone at some point in the future and is also working on bringing it to mobile.</p>
