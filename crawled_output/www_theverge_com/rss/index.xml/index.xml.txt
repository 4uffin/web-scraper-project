<p class="has-text-align-none">Nintendo is releasing a new <em>Fire Emblem</em> mobile game, <em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em>. The <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250925.html">company says</a> the game is a spinoff of the series and “introduces a new style of battles featuring role-playing and social deduction.” </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The company’s description of the game indicates that <em>Shadows</em> will have <em>Among Us</em>-like elements of treachery: </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the three allies participating in each battle is secretly a treacherous disciple of shadow. Players choose to take on the role of either a disciple of light, aiming to find their way through the labyrinth, or a disciple of shadow.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">After the initial battle, players vote to determine who they believe is the treacherous disciple of shadow. The outcome of the vote affects whether the next battle is more favorable or more challenging. Whether the disciples of light can correctly discover the traitor—or the disciple of shadow can successfully deceive the others—holds the key to how the next battle unfolds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nintendo says <em>Fire Emblem Shadows</em> is available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fire-emblem-shadows/id6746113513">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.zaha">Android</a>, and while it’s a free-to-play app, it will have optional in-app purchases.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the biggest stories out of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785068/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-x2-elite-and-extreme-for-windows-pcs">Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Summit</a> in Maui isn’t just about Qualcomm — it’s how Google is finally merging Android and ChromeOS to create a new operating system for computers. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/784381/qualcomm-ceo-seen-googles-android-pc-merger-incredible">revealed that it’s finally happening</a>, and now, a Google exec has revealed <em>when</em> it’s happening, too.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s “something we’re super excited about for next year,” said Google’s Sameer Samat, head of Android Ecosystem, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/fpHCkdIg9gU?si=7UvAW6p3F_HXDYrC&amp;t=4655">at the tail end of Qualcomm’s announcement keynote</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">More:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">If you think about the laptop form factor, we&#8217;ve had ChromeOS for a long time and we&#8217;re super committed to that platform and it&#8217;s been really successful for us, we’ve learned a lot from it as well. We also have Android tablets that have been super successful, they’re becoming more productivity machines all the time. So I think the opportunity for us that we see is how do we accelerate all the AI advancement that we&#8217;re doing on Android and bring that to the laptop form factor as rapidly as possible, and also have the laptop and the rest of the Android ecosystem work seamlessly together.
</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">So what we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re basically taking the ChromeOS experience and re-baselining the technology underneath it on Android. So that combination is something we&#8217;re super excited about for next year, and we’re working with yourselves and others on it, and we can’t wait.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">(I’m <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/763778/google-canceled-tablet-no-smart-ring-or-flip-phone-glasses">not sure</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18700394/google-tablets-android-chromeos-priorities-cancellation">about that</a> whole “Android tablets have been super successful” part, but hey.)</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Neither Qualcomm nor Google have said precisely how they’re working together on the combined OS, but Qualcomm doesn’t just make the most popular flagship Android phone processor — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/784997/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">here’s the new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> that’ll likely appear in the next Samsung Galaxy — but also PC chips now.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, it announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/785068/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-x2-elite-and-extreme-for-windows-pcs">the Snapdragon X2 Elite and Elite Extreme</a> with claims that they’re the most efficient chips available for Windows PCs. That announcement came without a mention of Google or Android or Chrome, but it wouldn’t be surprising if an Android for PC targeted those chips or similar.</p>

Lumafield has released the results of a new study of lithium-ion batteries that “reveals an enormous gap in quality between brand-name batteries and low-cost cells” that are readily available through online stores including Amazon and Temu.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lumafield has <a href="https://www.lumafield.com/battery-report#battery-quality-report">released the results of a new study</a> of lithium-ion batteries that “reveals an enormous gap in quality between brand-name batteries and low-cost cells” that are readily available through online stores including Amazon and Temu. The company used <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/18/23640484/lumafield-neptune-ct-scanner-3d-x-ray-hands-on-interview">its computed tomography (CT) scanners</a>, capable of peering inside objects in 3D using X-rays, to analyze over 1,000 lithium-ion batteries. It found dangerous manufacturing defects in low-cost and counterfeit batteries that could potentially lead to fires and explosions.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The study tested <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18650_battery">18650 lithium-ion battery cells</a>, which are used in various products including electric toothbrushes, power tools, e-bikes, power banks, and even electric cars. The batteries were purchased from ten different brands: three OEMs, including Samsung and Panasonic, sourced from “highly reviewed, specialized suppliers,” three vendors selling rewraps (typically OEM batteries with their plastic outer wrapping replaced) sourced from “specialized battery sites” or the brand’s own web stores, and four companies selling low-cost or counterfeit batteries sourced from “large, general online retailers such as Temu.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/battery_xray_2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="A side-by-side comparison of two battery X-ray scans revealing issues with build quality." title="A side-by-side comparison of two battery X-ray scans revealing issues with build quality." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;An X-ray comparison of lithium-ion batteries from Panasonic and a brand called Treasurecase revealing build quality issues with the latter.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Lumafield" data-portal-copyright="Image: Lumafield" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Lumafield scanned 1,054 batteries – around 100 from each brand – and found 33 of them had a serious manufacturing defect known as negative anode overhang. The defect “significantly increases the risk of internal short-circuiting and battery fires” and can reduce the overall life of the battery,” according to Lumafield. All 33 of the batteries with the defects came from the 424 sold by low-cost brands or brands selling counterfeits. One of the counterfeits was identified by its pink wrapper designed to match the one Samsung uses on its 30Q cells. Other low-cost brands claimed capacities of 9,900 mAh while brand-name 18650 batteries have capacities in the range of 3,000-3,450 mAh. Not only were the counterfeits’ specs overinflated, but in real-world testing Lumafield found their capacities were less than 1,300 mAh.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When taking only low-cost/counterfeit batteries into consideration, there’s nearly an 8 percent chance they could have the dangerous negative anode overhang defect, based on Lumafield’s findings. For two of the counterfeit brands that were reporting impossible specs, the percentage of tested batteries from those brands that were found to have the defect were even higher – upwards of 12 and 15 percent. None of the name brand OEM batteries were found to have any problems, and while there was some deviation in anode overhang for rewrap batteries, the deviations were seven times worse for the low-end cells.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When looking at other indicators of build quality, all of the batteries from the low-cost brands also had much worse edge alignment of their internal wound layers than those made by reputable OEMs, increasing the risk of short circuits and performance loss.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Defects like negative anode overhang and bad edge alignment don’t mean an affected battery is guaranteed to explode or catch fire, but they can increase the risk of those incidents occurring, particularly when combined with other factors such as being left in a hot car or an accidental drop causing additional damage.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The results of Lumafield’s study suggest that batteries from reputable OEMs like Samsung, Panasonic, and Murata are safer and more reliable. And while rewrap batteries fared well in Lumafield’s test, their replaced wrapping makes it difficult to know exactly where they’ve been sourced which increases risks due to a potential lack of quality control in supply chain management.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Not everyone has access to an X-ray CT machine to test the quality of the cells in every battery-powered device they purchase, but the study is a reminder that purchasing devices from reputable brands can increase the chances that their batteries are free of dangerous manufacturing defects. Trying to save money with less-known brands could end up costing you a lot more in the long run.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Qualcomm has formally unveiled its latest flagship SoC, destined for Android flagships in the very near future: the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777925/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-name">name was revealed by way of a blog post</a> last week, and if it seems like the company skipped forward a generation or two, that’s kind of the point. It features a third-generation Oryon CPU with boosted single- and multi-core performance, as well as a faster Hexagon NPU, with an emphasis on personalized, on-device AI experiences.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"> The updated CPU comprises two prime cores of up to 4.6GHz and six performance cores up to 3.62GHz. Qualcomm claims up to 35 percent better power efficiency from the CPU, contributing to a 16 percent improvement in overall SoC efficiency. The updated Adreno GPU claims an increase of up to 23 percent in overall gaming performance, along with a 20 percent drop in power consumption.</p>
<img src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/bento.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The updated Hexagon NPU likewise claims 37 percent faster performance as well as power savings over the previous version. Qualcomm suggests these improvements — along with use of its Snapdragon Sensing Hub — could enable more personalized AI that continues to learn about the user over time. </p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On the camera side of things, the updated ISP supports the APV (Advanced Professional Video) codec. Qualcomm also claims to enable a “computational video pipeline.” Qualcomm’s Alex Katouzian explained at the company’s announcement keynote that this allows for AI enhancements to video on a frame-by-frame level. The ISP also enables context-aware autofocus, auto exposure, and auto white balance.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The 8 Elite Gen 5 uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/622713/qualcomm-v-apple">an X85 modem</a>, announced earlier this year, which boasts 50 percent lower gaming latency thanks to “AI-enhanced Wi-Fi.” We’ll start seeing devices with the 8 Elite Gen 5 from all the usual Android suspects <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778620/xiaomi-oh-my">soon enough</a>. </p>

It&#8217;s been a long wait, but we finally got to see Insomniac&#8217;s take on Wolverine in action. The studio released a new trailer showing some of the surprisingly bloody superhero gameplay at Sony&#8217;s most-recent State of Play showcase. There&#8217;s no date yet, but the game — which is called simply Wolverine — is expected to [&#8230;]

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s been a long wait, but we finally got to see Insomniac&#8217;s take on Wolverine in action. The studio released a new trailer showing some of the surprisingly bloody superhero gameplay at Sony&#8217;s most-recent State of Play showcase. There&#8217;s no date yet, but the game — which is called simply <em>Wolverine</em> — is expected to launch on the PS5 in the fall of 2026.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The game was first announced in 2021 with a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/09/marvels-spider-man-2-and-marvels-wolverine-revealed/">brief cinematic trailer</a>. At the time, Insomniac was pretty vague on the details of the game, but today’s trailer included the following synopsis:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Become a living weapon. As he searches for answers about his past, Wolverine will do whatever it takes — unleashing brutal claw combat, violent rage, and relentless determination — to cut through the mystery of the man he used to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In-development footage of the game started making the rounds as part of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/19/24007570/insomniac-games-hack-wolverine-x-men-ryhsida">massive Insomniac Games leak in 2023</a>.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The game has been particularly anticipated after Insomniac released a trio of excellent Spider-Man games, most recently with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23915605/spider-man-2-review-ps5" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.theverge.com/23915605/spider-man-2-review-ps5">Spider-Man 2</a></em> on the PS5 in 2023.</p>

Saros, the next game from Returnal developer Housemarque, launches for PS5 on March 20th, 2026, Sony announced during its September State of Play presentation on Wednesday.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Saros, the next game from <em>Returnal</em> developer Housemarque, launches for PS5 on March 20th, 2026, Sony announced during its September State of Play presentation on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Based on a <a href="https://youtu.be/XtCS5tuvCKs?feature=shared">gameplay trailer</a> shown during the event, it looks like <em>Saros</em> takes a lot of cues from <em>Returnal</em>, with futuristic weapons, lots of bullets and rings filling the screen, and mysterious environments that you’ll have to navigate. You’ll also get a new shield that lets you run into projectiles that you can absorb as energy and then throw back toward your enemies.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Housemarque is also introducing an unlockable “Second Chance” ability that lets you come back to life after you die, which could be useful for what looks to be a very difficult game. There are other new permanent-progression systems added to the game, too.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Saros</em> was initially announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/611627/sony-playstation-5-ps5-saros-housemarquestudio-housemarque">earlier this year</a>, and at the time, Sony only provided a 2026 release date.
