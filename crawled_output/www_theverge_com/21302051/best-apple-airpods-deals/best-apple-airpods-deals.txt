Photo: Chris Welch / The VergeEditor’s note: Amazon’s fall Prime Day event kicks off on October 7th; however, if you want to shop ahead of the two-day sale, we’ve rounded up the best early Prime Day deals you can already get.If you know where to look, you can often score discounts on Apple’s ever-expanding AirPods lineup. Both the newer AirPods Max and AirPods 4 (with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the latest AirPods Pro with USB-C. Events like Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday often bring the steepest discounts, though you can still find great deals throughout the year.In this articleThe best AirPods 4 dealsThe best AirPods Pro (third-gen) dealsThe best AirPods Max dealsBelow, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the latest AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max.RelatedYou can preorder the AirPods Pro 3 right nowThe best wireless earbuds to buy right nowThe best AirPods 4 dealsApple AirPods 4$116$12910% off$116$116 at Amazon$116 at Walmart$119 at Best BuyAirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation$169$1796% off$169$169 at Amazon$169 at Walmart$172 at Best BuyAt its September 2024 event, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments.RelatedApple’s AirPods update adds camera controls and moreHow to install the iOS 26 public betaWhy I love my Apple EarPodsThe $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app.Given they’ve been out for nearly a year, we consistently see discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. Right now, for instance, the standard AirPods 4 are on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $116 ($13 off), which is $27 shy of their all-time low. The AirPods 4 with ANC, meanwhile, are available at Amazon and Walmart for their typical sale price of $168.99 (also $10 off), which is a far cry from their Prime Day low of $119.Read our full AirPods 4 review.The best AirPods Pro (third-gen) dealsAirPods Pro 3$249$249The third-gen AirPods Pro add a new built-in heart rate sensor and live translation feature. They also improve upon their predecessor with twice the noise cancellation, better sound, and a fifth swappable ear tip option.Read More$249 at Amazon$249 at Walmart$249 at Best BuyAt its recent “Awe Dropping” event, Apple introduced the new AirPods Pro 3. In addition to improved noise cancellation and sound, the earbuds now include a built-in heart rate sensor that syncs with the iPhone Fitness app to track your pulse and calories burned across more than 50 workout types — essentially doubling as a fitness tracker. They’re also more comfortable and secure than their predecessor, thanks to a redesigned, more angled fit and five ear tip sizes, including a new XXS option. On top of that, they carry a more robust IP57 rating for dust, water, and sweat resistance and debut a live translation feature that generally conveys the gist well, though with enough errors that it can’t beat a human interpreter.Because the AirPods Pro 3 are brand new and won’t hit shelves until September 19th, there aren’t any deals available yet. For now, you can only pick them up at their full $249 price from Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart.Read our full AirPods Pro 3 review.Apple AirPods Pro (second-gen) with USB-C charging case$199$24920% off$199$199 at Amazon$199 at Walmart$250 at Best BuyHowever, if you’re looking to save, the second-gen AirPods Pro with USB-C remain a solid option and are still widely available despite no longer being part of Apple’s official lineup. They’re currently available at Amazon and Walmart for $199 ($50 off), which is their typical sale price and a relatively minor discount compared to previous sales. While they lack the AirPods Pro 3’s heart rate sensor, live translation feature, and new XXS ear tips, the second-gen AirPods Pro still deliver excellent noise cancellation that outperforms the first-gen model. They also add swipe-based controls and an extra-small fourth ear tip. Apple additionally updated them in 2023 with a USB-C charging case and an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance, while the latest version also supports lossless audio when used with Apple’s Vision Pro headset and doubles as a pair of FDA-approved hearing aids.RelatedApple’s AirPods Pro hearing health features are as good as they soundPowerbeats Pro 2 review: the workout buds to beatThe best alternatives to Spotify for listening to musicRead our AirPods Pro with USB-C impressions.The best AirPods Max dealsApple AirPods Max$500$5499% off$500$500 at Amazon (USB-C)$500 at Walmart (USB-C)$500 at Best Buy (USB-C)The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not the best noise-canceling headphones for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user.RelatedApple releases AirPods Max update with lossless audio after brief delayWhat a set of knockoff headphones taught me about headphones — and knockoffsTurn your AirPods Max into a masterpiece with Casetify’s new headphone wrapToward the end of last year, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with a new model that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. As of this writing, they’re on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart in select colors starting at $499.99 ($50 off), which isn’t nearly as low as the $399 asking price we saw during Prime Day.Read our original AirPods Max review.Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
