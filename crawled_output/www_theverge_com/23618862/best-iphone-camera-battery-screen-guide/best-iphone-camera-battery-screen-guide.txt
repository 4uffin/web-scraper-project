Apple recently launched its 2025 iPhone lineup, which includes the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and a brand-new model, the ultra-thin iPhone Air. These new phones offer a number of new features over their predecessors, such as upgraded cameras, faster chips, better battery life, and even better screens — Apple Intelligence, however, is still a work in progress.Alongside the new hardware, Apple also launched iOS 26 (yes, the numbering system has changed and we’re jumping from iOS 18), which includes a new Liquid Glass user interface, live translation, wallpapers in messages, and more. The software marks Apple’s biggest visual redesign since iOS 7, and despite some very polarizing reactions, we think it looks fine.If your current iPhone is humming along, there’s no need to rush out and get a new one. But if you’re questioning whether it’s the year to replace your iPhone that’s a few generations old, then I think the answer is an easy yes. There are real gains to be had this time around, especially in the basic iPhone 17, which features a higher-refresh-rate display than last year’s model for smoother-looking animations, plus double the base storage to 256GB — all without raising the price, despite the current tariff situation.What we’re looking forHow we test smartphonesCollapseThere’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.Overall valueCollapseThe most expensive, souped-up iPhone isn’t automatically the best one for everyone. What I look for is a happy medium — features that will satisfy most people at the best price. Sometimes, that’s last year’s model.Battery lifeCollapseBattery performance can vary significantly between current iPhone models, primarily due to the size of the phone. Everyone wants a phone that can last a full day, and these recommendations reflect that.Screen sizeCollapseOne size does not fit all. Some people like a small phone, others want the biggest screen money can buy. This list includes iPhones for people in both camps.In this articleThe best iPhone for most peopleThe best high-end iPhoneThe iPhone with the best battery lifeThe best iPhone for people who hate bulky phonesThe best inexpensive-ish iPhoneWhat’s coming nextThe best iPhone for most people8Verge ScoreApple iPhone 17$799$799The GoodAlways-on display makes it vastly more usefulHigh refresh rate makes using the phone smootherThe cameras are solidBattery lasts well through the dayThe price isn’t going upNo redesign, but the green is niceThe BadZoom capabilities are weak compared to the ProGets hot during heavy gaming sessionsApple Intelligence is still somewhere between useless and MIA$799 at Apple (256GB)$830 at Best Buy (256GB)How we rate and review productsScreen: 6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe / Qi2 / Weather-resistance rating: IP68The iPhone 17 marks a turning point for the standard model. After years with a lower-quality screen, the cheapest model finally got two major upgrades for 2025: an always-on display and a high-refresh-rate panel. These features make it feel meaningfully better than the iPhone 16 and prior models in everyday use, bringing it closer than ever to the Pro models. And at the same $799 starting price as the previous generation, this year’s update is a no-brainer.RelatedThe iPhone 17 is a shockingly great dealThe best phone to buy right nowAppleCare One is for Apple’s biggest fansWhile the iPhone 17’s 48-megapixel main camera is carried over from last year, the ultrawide camera has been changed from a 12-megapixel sensor to a 48-megapixel sensor, and it delivers sharper and more vibrant photos. The device features an 18-megapixel Center Stage selfie camera, which is also in the Air and 17 Pro. Your selfies may not look materially better, but the front camera’s square sensor elevates the user experience, making it possible to take horizontal selfies while holding the device vertically (no need to rotate the phone).The iPhone 17’s always-on display lets you quickly glance at notifications. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeApple also gives you double the storage — 256GB versus 128GB in the base iPhone 16 — and improved battery life. The standard 17 still lacks a proper telephoto camera, and the A19 chip is slower than the A19 Pro found in the Pro models. Still, it’s a big step up in almost every way, even if it looks basically the same as every iPhone from the past six years.Read our iPhone 17 review.The best high-end iPhone8Verge ScoreiPhone 17 Pro$1099$1099The GoodSolid battery lifeBrighter screen outdoorsCenter Stage cameraFaster chargingDoesn’t get blazing hotOrangeThe BadWhat’s up with Siri?Heavier than last year$1099 at Apple (256GB)$1100 at Best Buy (256GB)$1299 at Apple (512GB)How we rate and review productsScreen: 6.3-inch 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 Pro / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.78 with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel 8x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W MagSafe / Qi2 / Weather-resistance rating: IP68The iPhone 17 Pro introduces a bold redesign and a number of notable upgrades, including the lineup’s most advanced camera setup yet. It also features rounded edges, and similar to last year, it’s on equal footing with the 17 Pro Max in terms of performance; the biggest differences that the Pro Max offers a larger display, a larger battery, and up to 2TB of storage.Whereas the iPhone 17 is for most people, the 17 Pro is more geared toward creators. The device has three 48-megapixel cameras, including a 48-megapixel telephoto, and it offers several pro features aimed at those who want to take the best possible photos and videos. Some of those features include Genlock support, which lets videographers sync up timecodes across multiple cameras, and support for ProRes RAW recording. It also sports the upgraded Center Stage selfie camera found in other 2025 iPhone models.The iPhone 17 Pro offers a smaller form factor compared to the 17 Pro Max. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The VergeDespite the additions and improvements, there’s little here that makes the 17 Pro an absolute must-upgrade. However, it comes in an irresistible orange, which is apparently the new “it” color.Read our iPhone 17 Pro review.The iPhone with the best battery life8Verge ScoreiPhone 17 Pro Max$1199$1199The GoodSolid battery lifeBrighter screen outdoorsCenter Stage cameraFaster chargingDoesn’t get blazing hotOrangeThe BadWhat’s up with Siri?Heavier than last year$1199 at Apple (256GB)$1200 at Best Buy (256GB)$1399 at Apple (512GB)How we rate and review productsScreen: 6.9-inch 2868 x 1320 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 Pro / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.78 with sensor-shift IS; 48-megapixel 8x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 40W wired, 25W MagSafe / Qi2 / Weather-resistance rating: IP68The iPhone 17 Pro Max’s redesign isn’t just about looks. Apple hollowed out the device’s aluminum frame to fit in the biggest battery yet in an iPhone. Apple says the device offers up 39 hours of video playback, which is 12 more hours than last year’s iPhone 16 Plus, our previous battery champ. The device can easily push through a full day and then some, though your mileage will vary depending on how often you play mobile games, watch videos, and doomscroll on social media.The bigger iPhone 17 Pro Max means a bigger battery. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The VergeThere are other benefits to going with the 17 Pro Max. It has the largest display among the latest iPhone lineup — 6.9 inches — and offers up to 2TB of storage, giving creators more room than ever for storing their media. If you want the most iPhone you can possibly get, including the longest battery life, then the 17 Pro Max is the way to go.Read our iPhone 17 Pro Max review.The best iPhone for people who hate bulky phones7Verge ScoreiPhone Air$999$999The GoodEasier to carry thanks to its slim profileRemarkably light and more pleasant to use for long periods of timeThe BadBattery drains quicker than a standard phoneNo ultrawide camera$999 at Apple (256GB)$1000 at Best Buy (256GB)$1199 at Apple (512GB)How we rate and review productsScreen: 6.5-inch 2736 x 1260 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A19 Pro / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 18-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 30W wired, 20W MagSafe / Qi2 / Weather-resistance rating: IP68The iPhone Air is Apple’s biggest redesign since the iPhone X was released in 2017. It’s shockingly thin and light, at 5.6mm and 165 grams, respectively. Thanks to its titanium frame and Ceramic Shield 2 display, it’s more durable than you might expect, too. The device feels deceptively small, despite having a 6.5-inch display. You really have to see and feel the phone yourself to get the appeal.But the thinner design comes with a few substantial compromises compared to the other models available this year. One of the biggest is that the Air features a single 48-megapixel camera on the back. That’s not to say the device’s camera is bad. But it’s a far less versatile system than even the far more affordable iPhone 17, which has a dual-camera setup. The second compromise is on battery life, which is just okay. It’s not terrible, but it’s not great, either.The iPhone Air is the thinnest iPhone ever, though it still has a chunky camera hump. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The VergeAt $999, you’re paying a lot for middling battery life and camera performance. Those who primarily care about design, though, may be more forgiving about those shortcomings.Read our full iPhone Air review.The best inexpensive-ish iPhone7Verge ScoreiPhone 16E$599$599The GoodReliable performanceGood, if limited, camera systemIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buyThe BadNo MagSafe$599 feels like $100 too muchNo ultrawide$599 at Apple$600 at Best Buy$600 at VerizonHow we rate and review productsScreen: 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48MP Fusion with 1x and 2x optical zoom, 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 20-watt wired, 7.5W Qi, no MagSafe/ Weather-resistance rating: IP68This recommendation comes with a heavy sigh. Yes, the 16E is the cheapest new iPhone Apple sells. Yes, it’s a good phone. It has a capable camera, reliable performance, full water resistance, wireless charging, and will be supported with software updates for years to come. But its $599 price tag starts to feel like too much when you consider what it’s missing.There’s no MagSafe, which you can kind of add by way of a MagSafe case, but it’s a bummer not to have it built in when it has basically become a standard iPhone feature. There’s no ultrawide camera, no Dynamic Island housing timely information, no camera control button (not a huge loss, honestly), and no Ultra Wideband for precise object tracking. It does support Apple Intelligence, but that doesn’t feel like much of a consolation, given that it’s very much still a work-in-progress.RelatedThe best budget smartphone you can buyiOS 26 with Apple’s Liquid Glass redesign is out nowYou can turn off iOS 26’s obtrusive new screenshot previewsThe 16E will most likely receive more years of software support than a previous-gen model like the iPhone 14 or 15. And sure, Apple Intelligence might turn into something useful someday. The 16E is a good choice if you want the path of least resistance to blue bubbles and FaceTime at your fingertips. But if you’d like MagSafe, a more advanced camera, and some of the other bells and whistles that got lost on the way to the 16E, then it’s not a bad idea to look at one of the older iPhones.Read my full Apple iPhone 16E review.What’s coming nextApple’s latest iPhone lineup is available now, but there are already reports about what’s next. One report suggests Apple is readying a book-style foldable iPhone for 2026, which allegedly looks like two iPhone Air models put side by side. Apple is reportedly still working to flatten the crease that appears when the phone is unfolded, but has otherwise settled on a design. Looking ahead to 2027, a report claims Apple is planning a redesigned “all-screen” iPhone to celebrate the device’s 20th anniversary. These upcoming releases are allegedly part of Apple’s three-year plan — starting with the new iPhone Air — that’s aimed at refreshing its smartphone lineup.Update, September 22nd: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability, and added the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max, and Air as new picks.
