Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.I wanted to love Shokz’s OpenFit 2, the company’s latest open-ear wireless earbuds debuting here at CES 2025. While Shokz made several improvements to the overall design and function, the sound can still be a tad hollow.I tried the OpenFit Air a few months back, and they ticked off almost everything I was looking for in a pair of open-ear running buds. While not perfect, bass was decent. Volume could also be quite challenging in certain environments — again, something understandable for open-ear design. The problem was the ear hook design didn’t fit well if I wore my eyeglasses. (That, and the touch controls were finicky to use.)RelatedThe Shokz OpenFit Air would’ve been perfect if not for my glassesShokz’s new bone conduction headphones have a clever solution for bassShokz sent me a pair of the $179.95 OpenFit 2 ahead of CES. Based on the updates, I was very hopeful. For starters, Shokz added an extra speaker to each bud for a total of two: one dedicated to bass, the other for mids and highs. It’s an approach that worked fantastically well with the OpenRun Pro 2 bone conduction headphones that include an air conduction speaker to improve the bass. (My colleague David Pierce and I are diehard OpenRun Pro 2 converts.) Volume has been slightly improved. The ear hook design has also been tweaked so the curved portion over the top of the ear is thinner. Physical buttons were added to each bud for simpler controls. Battery life also improved to 11 hours, up from the seven hours on the original OpenFit and the OpenFit Air’s six hours. There are also four EQ presets!And in my testing, I immediately noticed many of these improvements. It’s still not ideal, but the thinner ear hook is easier to use with my glasses on days when I don’t want to wear contact lenses. Loud highways and super noisy environments were still challenging but outperformed the OpenFit Air. While getting these hands-on pics, the bustle of the Vegas Strip didn’t drown out my music or prevent me from hearing my colleague Antonio G. Di Benedetto’s photo cues. I got about 10–11 hours on a single charge. When I wanted to pause or skip tracks, the physical buttons were easier to use (though my butterfingers still occasionally struggled, especially when wearing press-on nails.)The physical buttons help a lot when trying to skip, pause, or play tracks. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The VergeUnfortunately, I also couldn’t help but notice the sound quality. While better than the Air, it wasn’t quite as good as I’d hoped. On “Unfair” by Stray Kids, what should be rumbly baritone vocals sound muddy. Vocals, in general, can sometimes sound distant even with the vocal EQ. At higher volumes, bass-heavy songs occasionally sounded distorted. My issues were most apparent when I was running outdoors. However, if you’re listening to a podcast or in a relatively quiet room at a lower volume, it’s much less noticeable.All of this is somewhat expected from open-ear buds. It’s more that the effect of having dedicated speakers for bass versus treble and mids wasn’t as impressive as the OpenRun Pro 2. When I first tried the latter, my jaw dropped and I said, “Oh.” With these, it’s more of an appreciative nod. This might be because the OpenFit 2 are traditional headphones using air conduction. The OpenRun Pro 2 use air conduction for bass and bone conduction for treble and mids.Sound quality is an notable improvement over the OpenFit Air, but I find myself preferring the OpenRun Pro 2. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The VergeWhether the sound quality is a deal-breaker depends on how you intend to use these buds. I mostly use open-ear buds for running and found myself wanting to reach for the OpenRun Pro 2 instead. But while puttering around the house or strength training, the lack of a wraparound neckband makes these infinitely more comfortable, especially for exercises like chest presses or leaning back in my chair.The OpenFit 2 are available starting today from Amazon, B&H Photo, and Shokz for $179.95 in black and beige.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Victoria SongCloseVictoria SongSenior Reviewer, Wearable TechPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Victoria SongCESCloseCESPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All CESGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsHands-onCloseHands-onPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Hands-onHeadphonesCloseHeadphonesPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All HeadphonesNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsReviewsCloseReviewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ReviewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMore in this streamSee allI wore a one-horsepower exoskeleton to the world’s biggest tech showSean HollisterMar 5Zoox robotaxi hands-on: safe but laggingAbigail BassettFeb 11Matter will be better in 2025 — say the people who make itJennifer Pattison TuohyJan 23Most PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
