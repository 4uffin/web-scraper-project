Image: The VergeWhen it comes to finding a device to read ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doomscrolling on X or Bluesky. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.In this articleThe best Kindle (2024) dealsThe best Kindle Kids (2024) dealsThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) dealsThe best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) dealsThe best Kindle Scribe (2024) dealsThe best Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition dealsThe best Kindle Colorsoft Kids dealsAmazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the Kindle Scribe, Amazon is moving beyond books and into the realm of writing — something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper.All that being said, it’s worth noting that Amazon may debut new Kindle models at its fall hardware event on September 30th. And with an October Prime Day event scheduled for October 7th and 8th, there’s a good chance we’ll see better Kindle discounts in the near future.RelatedHere are the best iPad deals right nowBookshop CEO Andy Hunter amps up his crusade against AmazonThe entry-level Kindle remains the smallest e-reader Amazon offers, one that’s available in either black or green. Photo by Sheena Vasani / The VergeThe best Kindle (2024) dealsWhat does it mean when a Kindle is “ad-supported”?Amazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.In case you missed it, Amazon introduced a new entry-level Kindle last year, one designed to replace the 2022 model. The latest Kindle — which starts at $109.99 — boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a “matcha” green instead of “denim,” just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.RelatedKindle’s new ad-filtering setting keeps NSFW promos off your lockscreenThe best ereader to buy right nowE Ink is turning the laptop touchpad into an e-reader for AI appsIn the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited.

The new Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99.In terms of add-ons, the newest Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The last feature is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the Percy Jackson and Harry Potter series — at no additional cost.Previously, we’ve seen the latest Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off). Right now, however, you can only pick it up at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target at its full price of $129.99.Kindle Kids (2024)$130$130Amazon’s Kindle Kids is identical to the standard Kindle — meaning it packs a 300ppi display and support for USB-C charging — but comes with a case, an extended two-year warranty, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.Read More$130 at Amazon$130 at Best Buy$130 at TargetThe Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is identical to the standard model but features wireless charging and a sensor to automatically adjust the backlight.The best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) dealsThe latest Kindle Paperwhite, which launched last year, is Amazon’s 12th-gen model. Considering it’s one of the company’s higher-end configurations, it offers all the features found in the entry-level Kindle, including USB-C charging and a crisp 300ppi display. It’s noticeably faster than Amazon’s base ebook reader and features IPX8 waterproofing, a larger seven-inch display, and longer battery life.During events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we’ve seen the standard Paperwhite drop to as low as $129.99. Sadly, the standalone model is currently only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at $159.99 (its full retail price). If you’re okay with purchasing a bundle, you can grab it at Amazon with a power adapter and either a green, pink, or black fabric cover for $196.97 ($20 off); it’s also available at Amazon with a plant-based leather cover in green, pink, or black for $202.97 (also $20 off).Read our Kindle Paperwhite (2024) review.Kindle Paperwhite (2024)$160$160Amazon’s latest Paperwhite features a larger seven-inch display and noticeably faster performance.

It packs a 10.2-inch display with 300ppi resolution, along with the same great battery life for which Kindles are known. What separates the Scribe from other Kindles, however, is that it comes with a stylus, which can be used to jot down notes or doodle in the ebook reader’s built-in notebook. With the latest Scribe, Amazon also introduced a new Active Canvas feature, so you can scribble notes directly on ebook pages, as well as a suite of AI-powered features that can summarize your notes and refine your handwriting.Although we recently saw the standard Kindle Scribe go for an impressive $259.99 ($140 off), it’s currently only available for its usual $399.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. You can also pick up the base Scribe at Amazon as a part of a bundle with a 9W power adapter, a Premium Pen, and either a plant-based leather cover starting at $444.97 ($55 off) or a “premium” leather cover starting at $459.97 ($60 off).

Photos by Andrew Liszewski / The VergeThe best Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition dealsToward the end of the last year, Amazon announced its first color e-reader, the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition. Like the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, it boasts a seven-inch display with a crisp 300ppi resolution, IPX8 water resistance, wireless charging, and 32GB of storage. However, unlike the Paperwhite, the e-reader offers a color mode, which cuts the resolution in half. Thankfully, it’s still vibrant for a color E-Ink screen despite the lower resolution, rendering it particularly ideal for reading comic books and manga.More recently, Amazon introduced a cheaper Colorsoft, one that comes with only 16GB of storage. It lacks wireless charging and an auto-adjusting front light, but it’s otherwise identical to the first-gen model. The 16GB model recently received a $30 discount, but you can only buy it right now at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its full retail price of $249.99. The 32GB Signature Edition, meanwhile, is only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its usual asking price of $279.99.That said, you can save some money at Amazon on the step-up model if you buy it as a part of a bundle for $327.97 ($53 off), which nets you a wireless charging dock and plant-based leather cover in black, pink, or green. If you want a more premium experience, Amazon also sells it with a leather cover in red or black for $349.97 ($35 off).Read our Kindle Colorsoft review.Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition$280$280The Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition is Amazon’s first e-reader with a color display.
