Kennedy Jr.‘s health and human services, which historically has had nothing to do with offshore wind farms. The reasoning? A conspiracy theory that wind turbines emit electromagnetic fields that could harm human beings.Last week, we published Gabriella Burnham’s investigation into the controversy behind Vineyard Wind. She suggested that Nantucket’s debate over wind power represented a microcosm of its future in the US.
