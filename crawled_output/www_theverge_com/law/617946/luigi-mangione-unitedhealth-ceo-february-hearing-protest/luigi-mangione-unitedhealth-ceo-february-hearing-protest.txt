New people arrive, ask if there’s a line, shuffle into a blob of bodies idling and waiting for someone to give them instructions. The hallway is horribly warm — unclear if it’s from the bodies or the heat — and it’s a little smelly, which could just be me but I don’t think it is. I estimate between 100 and 150 people are hanging around, waiting for 2:15PM to roll around, their anticipation building. This is not a club with a strict bouncer, though it feels like it. This is the Luigi Mangione hearing.The hearing is a relatively minor pre-trial status update, but for the people most tapped in, there is a lot riding on it — the Luigi info-drip has been a bit dry lately. Court dates for the 26 year old accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December keep getting pushed back. Mangione, who is currently being held in federal custody in a Brooklyn jail, has not made a public appearance since before Christmas. (Mangione is accused of gunning down Thompson in December outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel, and has pleaded not guilty.) On TikTok, commenters regularly complain that they haven’t seen Luigi on their For You page in months. When Mangione’s legal team launched a new website with updates on the case, a flood of donations came pouring into his legal fund — more than half a million dollars as of this writing.Everyone involved understands that this case is unique: there are the many officers patrolling the hallway to keep us in check, like we are kids waiting to be seen by the principal; the hordes of people, some of whom live in the city and some of whom flew in for the occasion, trying to make sense of what’s about to happen; the members of the media who are just as gobsmacked and wide-eyed, angling to get a good view.Mangione’s supporters outside the courtroom, some having arrived as early as 7:30AM. Illustration: Molly Crabapple for The VergeIt’s dark, but even from the beginning, Thompson’s killing has seemed tailor-made for the internet. Every additional detail created a new (and sometimes absurd) twist to a story that people seemed in equal parts horrified and gleeful about. The days-long manhunt for a suspect, the backpack full of Monopoly money recovered by police, and finally, when law enforcement had arrested Mangione, the fact that they wouldn’t stop releasing new photos of him. The rough outline of the crime — the murder of a wealthy CEO working in an industry millions of Americans despise — seemed to lift the veil of propriety that is otherwise expected of us. It was one thing that the obsession with his appearance resulted in comments online that feel too explicit to even type out.But it wasn’t just his looks — even before Mangione’s picture was plastered on the web, the crime he ultimately was accused of was seen as inevitable, even righteous. People joked about having an alibi for the shooter. True crime podcasters, for whom no crime is too grisly for content, said they wouldn’t help police find the killer. A niche backpack company was forced to dispel internet rumors about its involvement in the investigation, assuring customers that it didn’t help police in their search for the shooter. Compared to other murders, there was an overwhelming and swift reaction to Thompson’s death that we don’t typically see, a vibe shift that corporate PR teams are still trying to get under control.“Murder is wrong, full stop again, but I don’t mourn him,” a New York Times reader said in the comment section about Thompson. “I mourn his victims.”A consistent narrative in mainstream media reports is that Mangione has amassed a fan club of rabid young women, but mostly people are well-behaved here. The crowd is fairly diverse: people of all races and ages, though most appear under 50 years old. Chelsea Manning is here. Women outnumber men, but there is a strong showing across the spectrum — young people who skipped school, working professionals who took the day off, a woman who runs a Mangione fan account on Instagram. Three people ranging from 18 to 21 years old tell me they flew in from Chicago just to be here, curious about the court proceedings but also wanting to see with their own eyes the person who has become something of a folk hero.Chelsea Manning sits with other supporters while waiting for the Luigi Mangione hearing to commence. Illustration: Molly Crabapple for The Verge“There’s a lot of gun violence and there’s not much of a reaction, but [Mangione] is apparently a huge deal,” one of them, who asked not to be named, said questioningly.“The upper class is feeling threatened,” their friend added.One man waiting who also asked not to be named said he told his wife he was going shopping and came to the hearing instead, hoping to snag a seat inside the courtroom. (He did not.) He told me he was concerned about Mangione receiving a fair trial and that he wanted to see what the atmosphere was like. He has sent Mangione letters and even books, he told me. Like other supporters, he wore green to show support — a reference to the Nintendo character Mangione shares a name with.Richard Partington says he arrived at the courthouse around 7:30AM, at which time already 30 or so people were waiting for the building to open.A police officer loudly declares that no interviews are allowed in the packed hallway outside of the courtroom. Illustration: Molly Crabapple for The Verge“You hear polarizing opinions” about the case, he says, adding that he does not condone violence. “I’d like to get a vibe of him — does he seem angry? Does he seem remorseful?”As more and more people streamed in, it began resembling a concert, or a political rally: onlookers pushed up against the metal barricade constructed, leaning on the bars like they were in front of a stage. The closer it got to 2:15PM, the more testy everyone grew: at one point, we were told by guards that we couldn’t conduct interviews in the hallway. Some people were kicked out for breaking the no photos policy. Members of the media trickled in at the last minute, trying to secure a spot in the courtroom. The public information officer was hounded by journalists and somehow was keeping his cool. When Mangione’s attorneys entered the building, the crowd assembled cheered and held their phones up.“We’re not in a pit! Do not take photos!” a guard shouted. But the show had already started.“What a shitshow,” I overheard another say.Mangione entered the courtroom shackled at the wrists and ankles. His lawyers objected to this, but the cuffs remained throughout. He arrived flanked by multiple officers and when he sat down, he was surrounded by even more guards. He didn’t speak except to his lawyers, but that didn’t stop everyone in the courtroom — members of the public and journalists alike — from craning their heads to catch a glimpse. The reporter next to me took no notes, just watched, like it was a play. Afterward, friends texted me to ask what he was like, but I don’t know that anyone there would have much of an answer: he was quiet (demure, even), taller than I had pictured, apparently not wearing socks, and yes, looks like he does in pictures.Luigi Mangione arrives, flanked by police escort. Illustration: Molly Crabapple for The VergeIn all, only about 18 of the people waiting outside the courtroom were allowed in, along with several dozen members of the media. The hearing itself was anti-climatic in essence: it was a routine status update in the state’s case against Mangione, which is proceeding ahead of the federal case. There were eight to 10 officers inside at all times, making sure nobody uses a cell phone and that people are not being disruptive. There was no grand reaction to his entrance, no gasps or even whispers that I could hear.Attorneys for the state said they had turned over 800 gigabytes of discovery material to the defense, including surveillance footage collected by NYPD, data from the medical examiner like DNA testing, ballistics reports, and more. At a press conference after the hearing, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s attorney, said her team was still awaiting police reports from New York City, that they are “concerned [Mangione’s] constitutional rights were violated,” and that there were “serious search and seizure issues” in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he was arrested. Agnifilo also said the defense was waiting for other key evidence, including what has been described as his “manifesto.”The scene in the courtroom at the February 21 hearing in People v. Mangione in New York City. Top: Judge Gregory Carro, center left: Luigi Mangione, center right: Karen Friedman Agnifilo Illustration: Molly Crabapple for The VergeBut one moment in court felt especially notable in this case driven by the public’s consumption of it. In court, Agnifilo said New York City mayor Eric Adams and NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny shared key evidence in the case in a documentary before sharing it with the defense.“This week on HBO in a documentary, I see the Chief of Detectives and the New York City mayor, full hair and makeup done, sitting down and giving an interview for television talking about the evidence in Luigi’s case,” Agnifilo said to reporters. “It’s outrageous that they have time to go and prejudice Mr. Mangione’s ability to receive a fair trial.”The hearing lasted all of 20 minutes. Mangione was escorted out, again by an almost comical number of guards. He walked deliberately, with his chin up, and scanned the room briefly as he passed. Then he was gone.The hearing on Friday was mostly procedural. The real spectacle began once court was adjourned and crowds dispersed: in real time, Reddit users created a timeline of what happened. Celebrity news aggregators shared new images of Mangione as they hit the news wires. By the time I left the building there were already TikToks with millions of views, clips of Mangione entering court set to “Dangerous Woman” by Ariana Grande, and his name was trending on Twitter, now known as X. The latest turn in the case against Mangione traveled quickly back to where this had all started. He is next expected in federal court in a month. The internet moves at lightspeed. The legal system, less so.Luigi Mangione is escorted out of the courtroom. He throws one last look over his shoulder as his supporters cheer despite the scolding of the police in the room. Illustration: Molly Crabapple for The VergeMeanwhile on Reddit, supporters of Mangione who did not attend the hearing or protest in person congregated in a thread for “live updates.” They theorized what he might wear (I can confirm he wore a dark green cable-knit sweater, possibly by Ralph Lauren, khakis, brown shoes, and a bullet proof vest); mused about Agnifilo and her tactics in the courtroom; and posted Getty Images links to the best shots from inside.The r/FreeLuigi subreddit is one of the few digital spaces that supporters of Mangione have left, Alex, a moderator, says. (Alex requested a pseudonym for fear of professional repercussions, and because most people in their life do not know they are involved in r/FreeLuigi.) Other subreddits have been shut down, and content on platforms like TikTok have been removed, supporters say. Despite the ubiquity of the Luigi memes and viral jokes, there are not many forums for Mangione’s supporters to freely and openly discuss the case.In an effort to keep the subreddit from being banned by Reddit, moderators running r/FreeLuigi have strict rules around how users engage. Users cannot mention “the triple Ds”: “deny,” “defend,” and “depose,” the words found written on bullet casings at the crime scene. Advocating for or celebrating violence will get you kicked out. Sexualizing Mangione is prohibited, though users are allowed to “[pay] compliments to his appearance.”“Every single day I wake up and I’m worried that Reddit has decided to take it down,” Alex says. Posts and comments must be approved before they show up, so Alex and other moderators can ensure compliance with the subreddit’s rules and the platform’s terms of service. “I don’t want to go to sleep and then wake up and someone has posted something terrible.” r/FreeLuigi has around 33,000 members and acts as a clearing house for updates on the cases against Mangione.Though they’re a moderator, Alex emphasizes repeatedly that their perspective is theirs alone, not representative of the subreddit as a whole. They say they would prefer not to be at the center of pro-Mangione activism or organizing — Alex’s involvement in the Mangione case has surprised even them. Only a few people know that they are a moderator of the group. Though they keep up with news generally, they are not the type to attend protests and have never been involved in any type of activism. Now they find themselves keeping order in a digital community united by a touchy subject that has rippled through American society and media. (By my count, there’s not one, not two, but three true crime-style documentaries about the Mangione case already, including one produced by gossip rag TMZ.)“I don’t condone murder. I don’t think this should have happened, it is very unfortunate,” Alex says. “But at the same time I don’t advocate for it, I understand why someone would want to do that.”Perhaps the main organizing message of r/FreeLuigi is the presumption of his innocence until and unless he is proven guilty. Mangione faces state charges in Pennsylvania and New York, as well as four federal charges, one of which carries the possibility of the death penalty. But that hasn’t stopped politicians and influencers from seizing the moment and taking a premature victory lap: who could forget New York mayor Eric Adams shuffling behind Mangione during a highly publicized and downright cinematic perp walk?Mangione has come to represent the symptoms of the American healthcare system, and people’s rage at it — in New York, where I live, I regularly encounter his face on stickers on bathroom walls and lamp posts, often styled as a saint. But disentangling Mangione’s right to a fair trial and the need for healthcare reform can be difficult when the very jokes that created the folk hero image also peg Mangione as guilty.“I think the waters have gotten really muddied between these two issues,” Alex says. “I’m not saying that it should stop. I think people are always going to do whatever they want to do, and it is funny, and it contributes to pop culture. But there needs to be some responsibility in it, where you make sure that you’re not making the situation worse for him.”As supporters see it, another thing making the situation worse is coverage of Mangione in the media, including documentaries. Mangione supporters have been described as “sick” (The Daily Mail); “disgusting Gen-Z fan club” (The Telegraph); and supporting Mangione “because of his good looks” (Newsweek). Before the hearing even began, the New York Post had its angle: “Twisted Luigi Mangione fans pack NYC court ahead of UnitedHealthcare CEO murder hearing.”Many of Mangione’s most dedicated and vocal supporters say this isn’t true — that they care about this specific case and about the dire need for overhauling the US’ for-profit healthcare industry.The lawyers arrive amid the media circus. Illustration: Molly Crabapple for The VergeWhile Mangione was in court, a protest of a few hundred people gathered on the street below. The protest outside was organized by People Over Profit NYC, a grassroots group focused on the Mangione trial and healthcare reform that seeks to “change the for-profit system that puts corporate interests above the well-being of ordinary Americans.” The latest hearing is a “step one” says Lindsy Floyd, a member of the group tasked with speaking with the media.“The people who are supportive of Mangione and who want to participate in the conversation [about healthcare reform] — all of us are speaking about those topics directly, and we’re doing so quite seriously,” says Floyd.“The media vilifies us out to be these horrible, wicked, deranged people who have lost our souls and are misguided. And that’s just not at all the experience.”While supporters held signs reading “Death by deductible” and “Health over wealth,” trucks with LED billboards organized by People Over Profit NYC circled the courthouse displaying stories of patients who died after their insurance claims were denied. Another truck showed information about jury nullification, a type of protest when a jury hands down a not guilty verdict even when they believe the accused has broken the law. On a park sign nearby, someone had plastered several wanted posters bearing the faces and names of other healthcare executives of companies like CVS Health and Aetna. We could hear the crowd cheering below from the courtroom every time the trucks rolled past.“This is personal for people, and this is emotional because it’s people’s lives,” Floyd told me in a phone call the day before. “When we’re talking about why someone wants to get involved, it’s because the healthcare industry failed them, and now they’re cripplingly debilitatingly disabled because of it.”Because this is 2025, there was another rogue LED truck not hired by People Over Profit NYC that was circling the building. It displayed a giant image of Mangione as a saint, with a QR code affixed that led to a website promoting a Luigi Mangione cryptocurrency. I figured I had seen enough for the day. I left to chants of “Fuck Eric Adams.”Brian Thompson’s death was processed by the public not so much as the killing of a human being, but as a despised industry getting its comeuppance. There is a reason, I suspect, that the case is referred to mostly as the “CEO shooting” rather than the “Brian Thompson murder” — it is less about the person (though there is plenty of scrutiny there too) than it is about the industry he represented. It is horrible for someone to have to see a loved one shot point-blank on their way to a work event. It’s also horrible to watch a loved one die slowly, all the while waiting for someone at the insurance company, or someone in the government, to give a shit.To many, the specifics of the case do not matter as much as the window it opened to discuss the horrors of the US healthcare system. And as Jessica Winter wrote in The New Yorker, the killing has given others the permission to indulge in some of their worst impulses, to laugh at the jokes and memes and murder ballads that might otherwise feel morally compromising.People have no doubt seized the opportunity, from Saturday Night Live joking about Mangione (to cheers from the audience) to a “CEO shooter look alike contest” held in a public park in New York. Mangione’s name has even been invoked as a verb — to “Luigi” somebody — despite the fact that he has not been convicted.The media frenzy inside the Manhattan courthouse, with press corralled into their own line. Illustration: Molly Crabapple for The VergeIn a way, Thompson’s death and Mangione’s fate are two sides of the same wretched coin. Both men have become symbols of an industry that has brought about so much pain — and generated so much profit — that people on both sides of the equation are willing to kill or die for it. And just as the cultural impact of his death has completely obscured who Thompson was as a person (and in many cases, that he was a person at all), so has Mangione’s beatification obfuscated the cold hard reality of a young man — cuffed, chained, and held without bail — who has pleaded not guilty to the murder that has made him an American icon.As he sits in prison, his photos go viral. TikToks and Reels blow up, new jokes and songs and memes are constructed every second. But then the content mills will finish grinding out what they can from the twenty minutes of Luigi the public got on Friday afternoon. The Luigi references on the For You pages will start drying up or get content-moderated out of sight; the die-hards will once again voice suspicions about the Narrative. And when Mangione and his attorneys next return to court, it’ll happen all over again: the crowds, the media, the police, the protest, the green sweaters, the memes, the livestreams, the thinkpieces and the outrage bait, a cultural engine that is ready to roar back to life the moment we catch a glimpse of Luigi Mangione once more.Molly Crabapple is an artist and writer living in New York City.
