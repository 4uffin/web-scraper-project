Nothing is more frustrating than buying a new pair of headphones, an OLED TV, or a laptop just to find out that you could have gotten it for a lot cheaper somewhere else. That’s why, in order to keep customers happy and prevent them from shopping elsewhere, many retailers offer price-matching policies in which they promise to match a lower price found elsewhere. That kind of information comes in handy no matter the time of year, but it’s especially helpful during shopping events like Amazon Prime Big Deal Days, a two-day event that formally kicks off October 7th.RelatedHow to sign up for Amazon PrimeWhat follows are the price-matching policies for a variety of major retailers. There are a few things to note here. First, all price-matching policies have several rules attached to them. We’ve summarized some of the rules here, but we recommend visiting the provided links and reading the policies carefully. Second, most retailers that serve as a marketplace for other sellers, specifically wholesale retailers like Costco and Sam’s Club, don’t have price-matching policies, and many traditional stores won’t match their prices.Lastly, there are always exceptions to the rules. If you’re looking for a deal on a product and you know it’s available for a lower price elsewhere (or it was previously offered at the same retailer), it never hurts to call or chat with a customer service rep and ask if they’ll match the price. You have nothing to lose but time, and there’s always a chance they may find a loophole or make a special exception.If Best Buy offers a better discount than Target on the latest Kindle Paperwhite, Target will refund you the difference. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeAmazonAmazon doesn’t offer price matching. Full stop. You can contact customer support, but even if you’re an Amazon Prime customer, it’s not likely that they’ll help you out.That said, Amazon does offer a pretty liberal return policy, meaning you can often return an item you purchased from Amazon if it’s available for less elsewhere (or at Amazon). Then, you can just repurchase the product wherever it’s cheapest.TargetTarget will match the price of identical items purchased from Target, Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and a select group of other competitors if you request it at the time of purchase or within 14 days of your purchase. You must bring the original ad or listing in both instances, whether digital or in print, along with your receipt, into the store. Alternatively, you can call for online purchases at 1-800-591-3869 or chat online via contactus.target.com.Be mindful, however, that Target’s policy excludes in-store price matches from other Target stores, doorbusters, and competitors’ lightning sales — including those offered by Amazon. It also doesn’t apply to products sold via Target Plus, Target Circle bonuses, “marketplace” items sold via third-party sellers, clearance items, closeout items, used items, and products that currently come with — or were initially bundled with — a promotional Target gift card.Best BuyBest Buy’s Price Match Guarantee states that a product could be eligible for a price reduction if it’s new, identical to the competitor’s product, immediately available at a qualifying competitor’s store or on its site, and not shown on Best Buy’s exclusion list — which includes “items for sale the Thursday before Thanksgiving Day through the Monday after Thanksgiving.” Items must have the identical model number and color. However, disclaimer here: Best Buy doesn’t price-match discounts that are only available as part of a competing retailer’s membership or loyalty rewards program, which disqualifies member-only events like Amazon Prime Big Deal Days.To get the difference, you have to contact Best Buy via its on-site chat and be able to show the ad or website with a lower price point. Alternatively, you can call 1-888-237-8289 or visit any Best Buy or Pacific Sales store. Approved retailers include Amazon, B&H Photo, Apple, Costco, Sam’s Club, Target, and Walmart. Items must be sold directly through the store, not a third-party seller.Best Buy will also, upon request, match an in-store or online price that was lowered during the return and exchange period, which typically lasts up to 15 days.WalmartWalmart doesn’t price match the prices of its competitors, though Walmart’s online store offers price matching on items purchased from Walmart stores if the item is in stock at Walmart.com.However, the policy doesn’t apply to those who live in Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico. Additionally, it doesn’t apply to special event prices, like those seen during Black Friday. Walmart also does not retroactively price match items bought from Walmart.com that have dropped in price after the time of purchase. The retailer additionally doesn’t price match items purchased from Walmart Marketplace retailers or third-party sellers.Apple doesn’t offer a price-matching policy, though you can price match on devices like the latest iPad Air — assuming it’s on sale — elsewhere. Photo: Antonio G. Di Benedetto, The VergeAppleWhile we’ve seen some claims that Apple will price match up to 10 percent for products bought at certain major retailers, there is no official policy on the company’s website.If Apple reduces the price of an Apple-branded product within 14 days of when you receive your item, you can visit an Apple Store or contact the Apple Contact Center at 1-800-MY-APPLE to request a refund or get credit for the price difference. However, that doesn’t apply to special sales like Black Friday or Cyber Monday.B&H PhotoB&H says that it might be able to honor a current lower price or match the price of a competitor, but it does so on a case-by-case basis. You have to contact its customer service team using the on-site chat, email, or by calling 1-800-606-6969 / 1-212-444-6615. If approved, B&H Photo will price match one identical item per customer.CostcoCostco does not price match with competitors. However, according to its website, it will issue a credit for the difference between the price a member has paid and a promotional price if you bought the item online at Costco and requested the credit up to 30 days before the change in price. If you bought the product from a Costco warehouse location, visit the membership counter at the store where you made the purchase. Costco doesn’t price match items bought from Costco warehouses with Costco.com purchases.DellDell will price match identical products from Dell, Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, HP, Apple, Lenovo, and a number of other retailers. Dell will not match prices available at Costco or Sam’s Club. You can call 1-877-275-3355 or chat online to run a price check, but you’ll need to provide a link to the competitor’s product. Dell outlines the specs you’ll need to compare for an item to be eligible for a price match before you contact them for a price match before you make a purchase.You can also contact the company about a price difference within 30 days of purchase. However, there is a long list of restrictions, and none of this is available between Thanksgiving Day and the Monday following Thanksgiving (or on Green Monday). Dell also doesn’t match membership-only pricing or the exclusive discounts you’ll find during Prime Big Deal Days or Best Buy’s Member Deals Days. Items that are discounted as a Deal of the Week or Daily Deals through Dell’s Member Purchase Program are also ineligible.eBayeBay doesn’t offer price matching on purchases made during the week of Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, but it does provide a generous price guarantee on select items outside that window. If you buy an item marked with the “Best Price Guarantee” badge — or one featured in eBay Deals — and find a lower price from an approved competitor within 48 hours, eBay will give you 110 percent of the price difference in the form of a coupon. That means you’ll receive a coupon worth the full difference plus an extra 10 percent, which you can use toward your next eBay purchase. Approved competitors include Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart.The products must be new, unopened, and identical to the competitor’s item. You have to contact eBay Customer Service, and if they verify your claims are legitimate, you will receive the coupon and be able to use it toward your next eBay purchase.GameStopGameStop does not mention an official price-matching policy on its website. In 2022, however, GameStop tweeted that the store will price match items sold and shipped by Amazon as long as they’re available online or in-store. Although GameStop only mentioned Amazon in the tweet, others have reported that the store will price match items purchased from Target and elsewhere.Google will price match any of its devices — including the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL — against all four major retailers, including Amazon. Photo: Allison Johnson / The VergeGoogleIf a request is made within the standard return period, Google will match online pricing from select retailers — specifically Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, B&H Photo, and Target. It doesn’t, however, match preorder pricing from other retailers or carrier deals. The product must also be in stock and identical, right down to the color and configuration. Plus, you need to provide a public link to the promo page or product listing to verify the lower price. Items sold by third-party sellers are ineligible for a price match.Other exclusions apply, too, including limited-time daily or hourly deals; wholesale, business, educational, or member-only pricing; mail-in offers and coupons; product bundles, clearance, and non-new items; and items from third-party sellers on a competitor’s website. Google will only provide a price match on smartphones and other items with data plans if they’re unlocked devices.You may also receive the difference if the product you purchased from the Google Store drops in price within the standard return period, though you’ll need to contact Google directly to get the price match or correction.The Home DepotThe Home Depot will match the price of identical, in-stock products from other retailers, except for membership-based wholesalers. The retailer must be able to ship the item to your location, so prices from regional retailers are ineligible. The price-match policy does not apply to special events like Black Friday, though, and it doesn’t apply to clearance prices, used and refurbished items, and rebate offers.You must bring the ad or listing with you in-store to the register. (You can also request price matches for online purchases that are shipped to the customer.) For online orders, you’ll need to provide the exact SKU for the item on the competitor’s site and The Home Depot’s site. To request a price match over the phone, you can call: 1-800-430-3376. Additionally, The Home Depot will only honor requests submitted by the original buyer — no friends or family allowed.HPAccording to HP’s website, the company will match the current pretax price for new comparable PCs and identical HP printer, display, and accessory model numbers from nationally recognized online retailers, such as Dell, Amazon, Newegg, and Best Buy. The specs have to be the same to get a price match on PCs, but the product model number does not need to be identical.You must ask for the match at the time of purchase by calling 1-800-888-0229 or via chat. You can’t request a price match via email, and the policy does not extend to items bought during promotional periods. It also doesn’t apply to membership stores like Costco and Sam’s Club, items purchased through a third-party vendor on an approved site, or items purchased using financing.HP also offers price protection on the HP-branded products it sells. If a price drops during your return window, you can request an adjustment by emailing myhpsales@hp.com. This doesn’t apply to products purchased during certain promotional events such as Green Monday and products on sale during the week of Thanksgiving and the week after, plus other seasonal holiday sales.LenovoLenovo matches pricing on comparable PCs from Lenovo, HP, or Dell with the same key specs as long as they’re sold through a list of recognized retailers. That list includes bigger stores such as Best Buy, Walmart, Amazon, Newegg, and B&H Photo as well as direct competitors such as Dell and HP. The comparable PC must also be in stock and readily available from both Lenovo and the competing retailer, and you have to contact a Lenovo sales rep with specific details about the specs and availability of the product you’re inquiring about in order to facilitate the match.That said, you can’t take advantage of coupons or special discounts while receiving a price match, and the policy doesn’t apply to membership stores like Costco. The policy also doesn’t apply to “Marketplace” items where third parties fulfill the order, so double-check that you bought the product directly from the retailer. Build-your-own models are also ineligible for a price match.Lenovo also offers a price guarantee refund for laptops and personal desktop computers bought from Lenovo.com within 30 days of purchase. To receive a refund, you must contact Customer Care and show the lower price of the identical product offered on Lenovo.com. This policy doesn’t apply to doorbuster or clearance products, however.Lowe’sLowe’s will match the price of identical, in-stock products when you present an ad, product listing, or photo from a qualifying online or local retailer, including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. The product must be purchased directly from the retailer and not a third-party seller, however, and it doesn’t apply to special sales events like Black Friday and other holiday promotions.Additionally, Lowe’s doesn’t match prices from one Lowe’s store to another, nor any rebate discounts or those available only to a select group of customers (such as loyalty clubs). Clearance, seasonal, buy one get one free, and custom made items are also ineligible for a price match. To request a price match, you can head to the store, call 1-877-465-6937, or chat online.If Microsoft lowers the price of the Xbox Series X, Microsoft might refund you the difference. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The VergeMicrosoftMicrosoft will refund you the difference if it drops the price of an in-stock physical product purchased online from the Microsoft Store within 60 days of your purchase being delivered. The same policy also applies if you find the identical product on sale at a lower price at a qualifying retailer like Amazon or Best Buy, though it doesn’t extend to the Surface Hub, HoloLens, Windows DevKits, or digital products.Furthermore, some eligible products have specific retailer exclusions. For example, price matches for Surface products at other retailers are limited to Amazon and Best Buy, while Xbox products are limited to the two aforementioned retailers as well as Target, GameStop, and Walmart. The price match policy excludes products from third-party sellers, clearance items, bundles, rebates, and prices only available after guests log in.You’ll need to contact Microsoft’s Sales and Support team at 1-800-642-7676 within 60 days of delivery to request a refund. If you purchase an item from a Microsoft Experience Center, you’ll have to go back to that location with your receipt. In both instances, Microsoft will credit your original payment method the difference between the price you paid and the current lower price, which typically takes between three and five days to process.NeweggNewegg offers price matching on select items; these products are identified by the label “Price Match Guarantee” that appears in the price box on the right side of the product page. This applies whether you find that lower price on Newegg or at what Newegg judges as a major retailer, which includes Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, GameStop, and Sears. The product must be identical, and the match won’t apply to rebates, coupons, or price drops that are only available as part of a retailer’s membership or loyalty program. It also only applies to products sold directly through the retailer, not a third-party seller.You need to notify Newegg of the lower price within 14 days of purchase. You’ll then be issued a credit you can use on the Newegg website, though you’ll only have 90 days to do so. Newegg’s price-match guarantee is not valid during major holiday sales events, including Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Green Monday.Sam’s ClubYou can request a price match against other Sam’s Club stores but not competitors. Note that this doesn’t apply to items on markdown or clearance.Update, September 19th: Added a mention of Amazon’s forthcoming Prime Big Deal Days sale and adjusted the copy to reflect current retailer policies.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Brandt RanjCloseBrandt RanjCommerce WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Brandt RanjSheena VasaniCloseSheena VasaniCommerce WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Sheena VasaniDealsCloseDealsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All DealsPrime DayClosePrime DayPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Prime DayTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMore in The Verge’s Guide to Amazon’s October Prime Day Event 2025See allA number of great chargers are already on sale ahead of October Prime DayBrandt RanjSep 25The best Apple deals to shop ahead of Amazon’s fall Prime Day eventSheena VasaniSep 24Here are 25 great deals you can snag ahead of Amazon’s fall Prime Day eventBrandon RussellSep 23Most PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
