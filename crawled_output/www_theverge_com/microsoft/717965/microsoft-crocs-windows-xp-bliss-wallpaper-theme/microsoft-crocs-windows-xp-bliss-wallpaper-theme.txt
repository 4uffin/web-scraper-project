Multiple employees told me that Microsoft has created limited edition Windows XP-themed Crocs. They even come with a Clippy shoe charm if the Bliss wallpaper on your feet wasn’t enough nostalgia.The anniversary edition Crocs are currently available for preorder for Microsoft employees, who “get first dibs” ahead of a “worldwide launch,” I’m told. The $80 shoes include a six-pack of Microsoft Jibbitz, with nostalgic options like the original MSN logo, the Internet Explorer icon, Clippy, and a mouse pointer.The Crocs include a six-pack of Microsoft Jibbitz charms. Image: MicrosoftThe Crocs feature the iconic blue sky and clouds from the Windows XP wallpaper, with a green sole to mimic the grass. The photograph of the rolling hills and blue skies of California was initially a stock image before Microsoft acquired the rights and used it as the default wallpaper for millions of Windows XP users. It might be the most viewed photograph in the world, making it instantly recognizable for many.You’ll also get a Bliss drawstring backpack to wear, just in case onlookers were unclear if your footwear was the Windows XP wallpaper or not. Hopefully each pair won’t smell like a dusty beige PC and Internet Explorer doesn’t automatically install once you’re wearing them.I asked Microsoft about its Windows XP Crocs, and the company has confirmed it plans to sell them soon. “As part of Microsoft’s 50th anniversary celebration, we’re releasing a Microsoft Limited Edition Crocs Bundle that includes nostalgic nods like Windows XP-inspired Crocs, custom Jibbitz™ charms, and a Bliss-themed drawstring backpack,” says Frank Shaw, chief communications officer at Microsoft, in a statement to The Verge. “While this is not an official partnership with Crocs, the bundle is a fun, limited-run celebration of Microsoft’s legacy.”Update, August 7th: Article updated with a statement from Microsoft.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Tom WarrenCloseTom WarrenSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tom WarrenExclusiveCloseExclusivePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ExclusiveMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftReportCloseReportPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ReportTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
