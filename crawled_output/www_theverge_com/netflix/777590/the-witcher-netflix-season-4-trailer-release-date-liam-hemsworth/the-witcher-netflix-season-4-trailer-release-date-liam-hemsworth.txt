And while we caught a brief glimpse of him in action last year, the first proper clip from season 4 of the show reveals just how Hemsworth will be inhabiting the role — including his take on Geralt’s signature growling voice.In addition to giving us a better look at Geralt, Netflix also confirmed that The Witcher’s newest season is coming out pretty soon: it will start streaming on October 30th. The show’s end is in sight, as Netflix previously confirmed that it will conclude with season 5. Here’s the official setup for the next season:After the Continent-altering events of season 3, Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri find themselves separated by a raging war and countless enemies. As their paths diverge, and their goals sharpen, they stumble on unexpected allies eager to join their journeys. And if they can accept these found families, they just might have a chance at reuniting for good…The Witcher originally debuted in 2019 with Henry Cavill as Geralt, and his time on the show wrapped up in disappointing fashion in 2023. But Netflix has been trying hard to turn the franchise into something bigger than a single series, with spinoffs like an animated film and a live-action prequel with Michelle Yeoh. Meanwhile, developer CD Projekt Red has a fourth Witcher game in the works, this time with Ciri in the lead role.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew WebsterCloseAndrew WebsterSenior entertainment editorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew WebsterEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentNetflixCloseNetflixPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NetflixNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsStreamingCloseStreamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All StreamingTV ShowsCloseTV ShowsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TV ShowsMore in this streamSee allHere’s your first look at Liam Hemsworth in The WitcherAndrew WebsterMay 22, 2024Netflix’s The Witcher will end with season 5Andrew WebsterApr 18, 2024The Witcher is sending a bunch of new friends and foes Geralt’s way in season four.Charles Pulliam-MooreApr 3, 2024Most PopularMost PopularApple’s new iPhone charger is a (second) of its kindMicrosoft is changing how Xbox controllers work on Windows 11iOS 26 with Apple’s Liquid Glass redesign is out nowThe unbearable sameness of Liquid GlassAirPods Pro 3 review: tripling down on a good thingThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
