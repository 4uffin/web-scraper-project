His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.Uber is launching a new discount program aimed at fighting against rising produce prices.The company is launching a new feature called “Fresh Days,” in which customers will receive discounts of up to 50 percent on “local fruits, vegetables, meats, and dairy.” The exact day and discount amount will vary from market to market, but Uber plans on launching the new feature in the US, Canada, the UK, South Africa, France, Japan, Taiwan, and Spain — with more countries to follow.Uber’s Fresh Day discounts will vary city by city.
Image: UberGrocery customers are experiencing sticker shock across the nation, with most of the price increases affecting fruits and vegetables. Apple prices are up 9.6 percent year-over-year, according to the latest Consumer Price Index. Overall, fresh fruits and vegetables are up 2.3 percent compared to August 2024. This “veggie-flation” comes as farmers and growers face increasing costs of their own, with the USDA estimating that farm production expenses will reach $467 billion in 2025, up 2.6 percent from the previous year and more than 36 percent higher than in 2018.Uber’s Fresh Day new discount program will hopefully take some of the bite out of that grocery order. The company is offering its steepest discounts to its Uber One subscribers; for example, an Uber One member in the US could get an exclusive 30 percent off every Tuesday on select fresh produce, meats, dairy, and eggs.Uber Eats is also rolling out a number of other updates, including an new AI-powered replacement suggestion tool in case the item you ordered isn’t in stock. Uber Eats couriers can also now share photos with customers while shopping to better communicate when an item is out-of-stock or “low quality.” And Uber is now offering a freshness guarantee, meaning the company will replace any item that arrives spoiled, damaged, past its date, or stale.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew J.
