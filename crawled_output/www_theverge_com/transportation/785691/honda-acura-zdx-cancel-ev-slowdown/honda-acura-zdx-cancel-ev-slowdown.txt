EV sales are expected to dip significantly in the coming weeks as the federal tax credit expires, and automakers are responding by canceling models, delaying factory plans, and boosting hybrids as a short-term solution. The latest model to get the axe is the Acura ZDX, an electric crossover that had both Honda and GM DNA.The ZDX had only just made its debut as a 2024 model with 325 miles of EPA rated range and a starting price of $60,000. Like the Honda Prologue, the ZDX was built by General Motors at the automaker’s Spring Hill Assembly plant in Tennessee thanks to a partnership between the two companies. It was supposed to be the big comeback of the ZDX, which was discontinued over a decade ago after poor sales. But as production was gearing up at the factory for the 2026 model, the decision was made to pull the plug.“To better align our product portfolio with the needs of our customers and market conditions…”The news was first reported by Car Dealership Guy, and subsequently confirmed by Honda. Chris Naughton, a spokesperson for the company, said the decision was made to “to better align our product portfolio with the needs of our customers and market conditions.”“ZDX has played a valuable role for the Acura brand, and will provide a foundation we will build on next year with the arrival of the all-electric Acura RSX, which will be produced at the EV Hub in Ohio in the second half of 2026, as well as with hybrid-electric Acura models now in development,” Naughton continued.The ZDX had many of the same styling and themes presented as part of the Precision concept car from 2022. And it was the first model from the Honda-owned Acura to be sold exclusively online. Reviews praised it for its cavernous interior, but some found that the feel and look of the interior to be sorely lacking.The RSX, meanwhile, is a purely Honda/Acura creature — no GM technology. It will be the first model engineered in-house on Honda’s new global EV Platform that’s also going under the automaker’s Zero series, with production slated to start in 2026. So suffice it to say, the resurrected RSX is a big deal for Acura and its parent company.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew J.
