Hawkins is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.Volvo’s EX90 SUV was supposed to usher in a new era of electrified dominance for the Chinese-owned, Swedish designed automaker. Instead, the three-row SUV has been plagued by problems from the very start, including blank infotainment screens, faulty climate controls, driver assist failures, and the noticeable lack of a working lidar sensors.Now, the EX90 is getting a fresh coat of paint, and the automaker is promising a much improved experience. In addition to a new 800-volt architecture for improved charging, the EX90 now sports a computer powered by Nvidia’s Drive AGX Orin system-on-a-chip. This computer upgrade will enable “new and improved safety, collision avoidance, and driver support features,” Volvo now claims.Volvo is also bringing a host of new features to the EX90 centered around safety. Chief among them is Emergency Stop Assist, in which the car will come to a controlled stop in its lane if the driver fails to respond to a series of warnings. Volvo envisions this working in situations where a driver has a medical emergency and can no longer control the vehicle.The news of the upgraded EX90 comes as Volvo is staking its future on a 50 percent volume increase over the next five years, anchored by a $1.3 billion investment in its factory in Charleston, South Carolina. Volvo plans on producing its XC60 mild and plug-in hybrids at the factory, as well as a new, unnamed “next-generation hybrid model” by 2030. (No word on the upcoming all-electric EX60 mid-sized electric crossover, which will be formally revealed on January 21, 2026.)Volvo will have its work cut out for it. In August, the automaker only sold 49,273 cars globally, a 14 percent drop year-over-year and the lowest volume so far in 2025.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew J.
