That amounts to a staggering total of 400,181 Uber trips that involve reports of assault or misconduct. Uber’s official number of “serious sexual assault and misconduct” over that period is only 12,522; the company estimates that 75 percent of those 400,000 cases involve “less serious” incidents of harassing comments or flirting. Still, Uber says its working on the problem, but anonymous employees say the company is ignoring promising solutions.Uber’s Festering Sexual Assault Problem[nytimes.com]NewsNewsUber Eats is adding AI to menus, food photos, and reviewsJess WeatherbedJul 31NewsNewsLyft’s self-driving shuttle buses are coming soonEmma RothJul 25JComments0Jay PetersJul 24LinkLyft is going to let you favorite drivers.After a ride, you’ll be able to mark a driver as a favorite and Lyft will prioritize matching you with them when possible.Image: LyftNewsNewsUber’s making it easier for women riders and drivers to find each otherAndrew J.
