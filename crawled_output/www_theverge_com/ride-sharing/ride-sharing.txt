It nearly decimated the taxi industry while offering riders a more seamless way to travel. But it also choked many cities with car traffic and disrupted labor with the popularization of gig work. The Verge covers all the news and analysis related to ride-sharing as well as what the future holds for this mode of transportation.TransportationTransportationUber Eats is offering grocery discounts to combat ‘veggie-flation’Andrew J.

That amounts to a staggering total of 400,181 Uber trips that involve reports of assault or misconduct. Uber’s official number of “serious sexual assault and misconduct” over that period is only 12,522; the company estimates that 75 percent of those 400,000 cases involve “less serious” incidents of harassing comments or flirting. Still, Uber says its working on the problem, but anonymous employees say the company is ignoring promising solutions.Uber’s Festering Sexual Assault Problem[nytimes.com]NewsNewsUber Eats is adding AI to menus, food photos, and reviewsJess WeatherbedJul 31NewsNewsLyft’s self-driving shuttle buses are coming soonEmma RothJul 25JJay PetersJul 24LinkLyft is going to let you favorite drivers.After a ride, you’ll be able to mark a driver as a favorite and Lyft will prioritize matching you with them when possible.Image: LyftNewsNewsUber’s making it easier for women riders and drivers to find each otherAndrew J.
