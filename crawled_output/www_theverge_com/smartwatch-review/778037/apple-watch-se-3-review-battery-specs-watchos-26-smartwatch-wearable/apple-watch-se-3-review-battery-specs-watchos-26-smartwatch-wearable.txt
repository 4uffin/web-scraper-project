Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.When I walked into Apple Park last week, there was one thing that I did not have on my bingo card: the $249 Apple Watch SE 3 stealing the show from the Apple Watch Series 11 and the Apple Watch Ultra 3.But here we are. It’s 2025, and the entry-level Apple Watch is the one I’m most excited by.That’s because compared to the iterative updates of the Series 11 and Ultra 3, the third-gen SE has gotten a massive, wide-ranging glow-up. Unlike the other watches, there also weren’t any leaks suggesting this was even in the cards, making this jam-packed release a total surprise. And the cherry on top? In the lead-up to the event, I wrote the easiest thing Apple could do to make the Apple Watch better was give people what they wanted. Nearly every single update to the SE 3 does exactly that.9Verge ScoreApple Watch SE 3$249$249The GoodWe finally get an always-on displayWe get double tap and wrist flick!So many more health features!5G!Fast charging!More durable!On-device Siri!Upgraded processorYou get a speaker tooThe BadThose bezels are still thiccWish the battery life was a skosh better$249 at Amazon$249 at Apple$249 at Best BuyHow we rate and review productsWhat’s newI could probably just list all the changes, wrap up this review, and crawl into bed because many of them are such obvious improvements. Here they are in a nutshell:The SE 3 jumps from the S8 chip to the S10, enabling faster processing and features previously limited to the Series and Ultra models, including double tap, wrist flick, on-device Siri, and improved voice isolation during phone calls.Apple has finally heard the prayers of beleaguered SE users everywhere and given the people an always-on display. Huzzah!It’s still only got an 18-hour battery life estimate, but the SE 3 finally has fast-charging. There’s a wrist-temperature sensor now, enabling retrospective ovulation tracking and more robust sleep tracking data in the Vitals app.Other health tracking features coming to the SE 3 include breathing disturbances, sleep apnea notifications, and the new Sleep Score.The SE also gets 5G connectivity for faster downloads and better cellular coverage.It supports audio playback now, so if you want to listen to your music or podcast from the wrist (hopefully not in public), you can.The watch itself is purportedly four times more resistant to cracks than the SE 2.There’s so many updates jam packed into this tiny little watch. That’s a heckuva lot. All of these “new” features were introduced on the Series 8, 9, and 10, and they function identically on the SE. Given that, it’s become harder to differentiate the SE 3 and the Series 11, especially since the latter’s coolest updates are tied to watchOS 26 and are coming to this cheaper model, too.At this point, there are only a few key upgrades reserved for the Series 11. The SE 3 doesn’t have EKG capabilities or the ability to measure blood oxygen. Hypertension notifications are limited to the Series and Ultra lineups. The SE 3 comes in the smaller 40mm and 44mm sizes, and it has thicker bezels. The smaller displays also mean that you don’t get a keyboard for texting. And while you get 5G, it lacks the re-engineered antennae in the Series 11, meaning you might get slightly worse coverage in certain areas. The SE 3 also misses out on the modest bumps to battery capacity and battery life in the Series 11.You’re giving up this handful of features in exchange for $150 off the price. For the average person, that tradeoff is absolutely worth it.FOMO? What FOMO?When I tested the second-gen SE in 2022, it felt like a first-time buyer’s Apple Watch. You got the core features, and if you’d never had an Apple Watch before, you wouldn’t feel all that bothered by the thicker bezels or missing features. That’s also true this time around, except there’s even less to miss.During testing, there were several moments when I forgot I wasn’t wearing a Series watch. The biggest pain point for me last time around was the lack of an always-on display. Now that’s available on the SE 3, most of my complaints evaporated. I can always see the time or my complications without having to wake the watch up. It sounds like a small thing, but it’s crucial to really making the watch a source of glanceable information. Likewise, I’ve become so fond of double-tap and wrist-flick gestures for single-handed convenience. Not having to give those up meant using the SE 3 didn’t feel like a sacrifice.Behold! The always-on display. It is glorious.I’ll get more into 5G performance in my upcoming Ultra 3 review, but I didn’t notice a huge drain in my day-to-day usage. (This might be more of an issue for you if you frequently leave your phone at home.)The biggest features you lose out on by choosing the SE 3 are EKGs or blood oxygen sensing. But let me play devil’s advocate here. For most of the past 18 months, none of the newer Apple Watches sold in the US could perform blood oxygen readings — and I didn’t hear many complaints. Also, while you can’t actively take on-the-spot EKGs, the SE 3 can still passively check for signs of atrial fibrillation via irregular heart rhythm notifications. I can’t comment on hypertension notifications yet, as the feature only just became available for testing yesterday. However, now that sleep apnea notifications, more robust period tracking, and wrist-temperature data for the Vitals app are available? I don’t feel like I’m missing anything except metrics I didn’t make much use of to begin with. Obviously, you’ll feel different if you do value EKG and blood oxygen, but I’d argue the majority of people get more value out of high and low heart rate alerts.Up close, it’s hard to unsee how thick the bezels are on the SE 3.But on the wrist? I got used to it.As for battery life, you have to baby the SE 3 a smidge more than the Series 11. In my first 24 hours with the watch, I left my hotel at 7:30AM PT with 100 percent battery, tracked a 48-minute mini-golf session, and then hopped on a cross-country flight. After arriving home at 11:45PM ET, roughly 13 hours later, I had 27 percent battery left with no low-power saving mode used. A 10-minute charge while I brushed my teeth and did my skincare bumped me up to 37 percent, and that was enough to get me through the night. I woke up at 6:45AM with about 22 percent battery, and that got me to around 9AM before I really needed to charge.Apple Watch users will find this battery babying normal, while Garmin or Fitbit diehards will view this as unbearably annoying. But it’s about what I’d expect from the SE 3. You have to be more aware of the SE 3’s battery levels if you’re going to push it hard throughout the day. You’re slightly freer to forget with the Series 11.Apple Watch SE 3 specsMaterial: aluminum with Ion-X glassProcessor: S10 SiPOS: watchOS 26Display: always-on, 1,000 nitsConnectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 5G, and LTEDimensions: 40mm: 40mm by 34mm by 10.7mm; 44mm: 44mm by 38mm by 10.7mmWeight: 40mm: 26.3g GPS and 26.4g cellular; 44mm: 32.9 GPS and 33g cellularBattery life: 18 hours with fast charging, 32 hours in low power mode.

I have the 40mm SE 3, and things are undoubtedly tiny, while the bezels are thicker than on the Series watches. But even I have to admit that it only really bothered me because I’d switched back from a higher-end Apple Watch. Eventually, I got used to it, and it’s much less noticeable if you use watchfaces with a black background. As someone with terrible eyesight, I find it easier to interact with and read notifications on a bigger display, but if you’ve got good eyesight, this may be a nonissue for you.The best Apple Watch for most people right nowBeefing up the $250 SE 3 this much sows chaos into the Apple Watch lineup. Right now, the dividing line between the Ultra and the Series 11 is clear — there’s better GPS tracking, a rugged design, more buttons, satellite connectivity, and the biggest honking screen and battery Apple has to offer. The line between the SE 3 and Series 11? For many people, it’s now nonexistent.The skeptic in me believes that the SE 3’s glow-up is partly an effort to draw more people into the Apple Watch ecosystem. It’s an incredible value, and Apple happens to be coming off five consecutive quarters of declining Apple Watch shipments due to a decrease in consumer demand, fewer models, and ho-hum feature upgrades. You don’t need to be a financial whiz to see the SE 3 will likely do gangbusters in terms of sales.This watch is just an incredible value. The SE line doesn’t get refreshed every year, and it’s possible that with the Series 12 or 13, Apple may introduce a new chip or sensor that enables more advanced health features that won’t make their way over to the SE 3. But that’s a moot point for people who are looking to buy today.The true decision boils down to whether you think a bigger display, thinner bezels, EKGs, and blood oxygen are worth an extra $150. If you have to buy now, I’d recommend getting the 44mm SE 3 to mitigate the screen issue. But unless you have legitimate health reasons for needing the latter two metrics? Save that extra $120–$150 for a rainy day.Agree to Continue: Apple Watch SE 3Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate.You can only use the Apple Watch SE (2025) with an iPhone. That means you’ll have already agreed to the iPhone’s terms of service and privacy agreements. Using optional services, like Apple Pay, Apple Music, or Fitness Plus, with your SE will also come with their own agreements. Using the Health app also comes with its own terms and conditions.If you choose to enable cellular service, you’ll also have to agree to your carrier’s terms. I activated cellular on T-Mobile and was asked to agree to one mandatory agreement.If you add any third-party apps or integrations, you must also agree to those individual terms and privacy policies.Specific to the Apple Watch, you must agree to the following:Terms and ConditionsFinal tally: one mandatory agreement plus any mandatory agreements for your iPhone. Several, several optional agreements.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Victoria SongCloseVictoria SongSenior Reviewer, Wearable TechPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Victoria SongAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleFitnessCloseFitnessPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All FitnessFitness Tracker ReviewsCloseFitness Tracker ReviewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Fitness Tracker ReviewsGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsReviewsCloseReviewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ReviewsSmartwatchCloseSmartwatchPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SmartwatchSmartwatch ReviewsCloseSmartwatch ReviewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Smartwatch ReviewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
