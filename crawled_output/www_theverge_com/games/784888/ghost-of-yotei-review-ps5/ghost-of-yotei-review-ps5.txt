Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.Things have been weird for PlayStation of late. After years spent cultivating an image akin to the HBO of video games through single-player franchises like The Last of Us, God of War, and Horizon Zero Dawn, the company shifted focus, jumping on the live-service bandwagon to mostly disastrous effect. Aside from a few standouts and a number of remasters, those beloved single-player games have slowed to a trickle: which is what makes Ghost of Yōtei so notable. Like its predecessor Ghost of Tsushima, it’s an attempt by studio Sucker Punch to merge the freedom of an open-world game with the style and drama of a classic samurai movie. More importantly, it’s exactly the kind of game that PlayStation needs more of.Yōtei isn’t a direct sequel, but rather a follow-up that tells a new story. This time around, you play as Atsu, whose family was killed when she was young by a group of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six. After barely surviving, she left her island home of Ezo and spent 16 years training to become a warrior capable of getting revenge. When she arrives on the island at the outset of the game, she has a very clear goal: to kill each of the Yōtei Six and then, ultimately, herself. She has each of their names written on a piece of fabric and plans to mark them off with blood after each kill. It’s both badass and unsettling.What’s great about this setup is that it keeps the experience focused on that core theme of revenge. Like Tsushima, Yōtei doesn’t deviate too much from the typical open-world action game, and so it can feel very familiar at times. But with this idea of hunting down targets, there’s a flexibility as you approach each of the six in almost whatever order you choose. And most of what you’re doing, whether it’s looking for clues at a local tavern or learning a new weapon technique, contributes to this goal. You never lose the sense of the fact that you’re out for revenge, even when you’re dabbling in side quests. Over time, the people of Ezo start calling you onryō, a vengeful spirit, and that’s really how Atsu feels.Image: Sony Interactive EntertainmentThis structure makes Yōtei feel surprisingly fresh, despite that it’s not all that different from its predecessor otherwise. Many of the changes are subtle refinements. For one thing, the leap to the PS5 means the game looks incredible, and Yōtei takes advantage of that with some stunning set-pieces. The epic samurai duels take place in burning buildings, rain-drenched mountaintops, and fields of snow covered in golden leaves. It’s the kind of game where it’s hard not to constantly stop and take screenshots — which is very easy, as you can jump into photo mode with a single button press.Yōtei also has much more interesting side quests. They really vary in tone and gameplay; some involve an investigative element, as you seek out shrines in hard-to-reach areas to unlock new skills, while others are just plain funny, like an evolving series of quests about a hapless would-be samurai who is desperate to defeat Atsu. At one point, I even befriended a bear. It reminded me a lot of The Witcher 3, where even seemingly simple stories proved to be deeper and more interesting, often with a haunting twist (the friendly bear story takes a very dark turn).One element that separates the Ghost games from other, more bombastic open worlds is their moments of calm and reflection. As with the previous game, Atsu can seek out hot springs to relax and think back on her adventures, and there are new elements like cooking and playing a shamisen by the fire that have a similarly cozy vibe. At almost any point in the game, you can camp to replenish your spirit and cook some food, and other characters will often stop by your campsite for a chat. Given how bloody and violent the rest of the experience is, these moments of respite are very welcome.Image: Sony Interactive EntertainmentYōtei is largely an improvement from its predecessor, in terms of both structure and story. But because the two games are so similar, Yōtei naturally shares some of the same flaws, which mostly stem from the sometimes incongruous mix of open-world action and the tone of a classic samurai flick. Combat is the biggest offender. When you’re fighting a few enemies — or just one of the more powerful foes — the swordplay is incredible, forcing you to be patient and strategic as you decide when to parry or attack and what kind of weapon to wield. But often, the game devolves into huge battles where the nuances of the combat get lost, and I found myself button-mashing my way to victory.Worse still is that these battles can get in the way of the more laid-back exploration. As Atsu gains notoriety by killing her enemies, bounty hunters and other outlaws start seeking her out. Often, I would find myself repeatedly attacked by these would-be samurai while I was just trying to ride to my next destination. It became tedious and actively discouraged me from exploring the landscape, because I didn’t want to get tied up in another pointless conflict.Mostly, though, Yōtei smooths out many of the issues of its predecessor, while rearranging itself to sharply focus on its epic tale of revenge. Atsu’s quest starts out violently straightforward, but things naturally become more complicated along the way thanks to some genuinely surprising twists that I won’t spoil for you. That combination of refined gameplay and cinematic story is exactly what PlayStation owners have come to expect, and Ghost of Yōtei shows that Sony can still pull it off. Which is good news, because the pendulum appears to be swinging back to these kinds of games.Ghost of Yōtei launches on the PS5 on October 2nd.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew WebsterCloseAndrew WebsterSenior entertainment editorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew WebsterEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGames ReviewCloseGames ReviewPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Games ReviewGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingPlayStationClosePlayStationPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PlayStationMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Logitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026PlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
