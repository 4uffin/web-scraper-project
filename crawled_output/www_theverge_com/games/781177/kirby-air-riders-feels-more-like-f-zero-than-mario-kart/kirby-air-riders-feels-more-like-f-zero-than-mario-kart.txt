He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined The Verge in May 2025.I got to try Kirby Air Riders this morning at a Nintendo holiday showcase, and I wasn’t prepared for how difficult it was — and how bad I am at it. The Switch 2-exclusive racer launches November 20th, and it’s full of modes, collectibles, and new characters to play as. To be clear, there’s absolutely nothing chill about Kirby Air Riders. It’s the sequel to Kirby Air Ride, a cult classic GameCube game, and a passion project for Masahiro Sakurai, the game’s director who was previously at the helm of the Super Smash Bros. franchise (it’s easy to spot the shared DNA).The demo had us play through some tutorials, which were easy to grasp, yet it was eventually clear that this game has a lot more in common with F-Zero than Mario Kart. It’s fast and chaotic, words I never expected to ascribe to a Kirby game. While most Kirby games are generally easy — too easy for some — Air Riders gives you very little time to react to incoming obstacles, and aggressive vehicular combat is all but necessary to gain boosts to stay ahead.Then, the team let us loose in City Trial, the open-world-esque environment where players battle each other (as well as CPU opponents) to compete for power-ups to gain the upper-hand in a challenge once the timer runs out. I had on a confident face, but truthfully, it’s been a while since I’ve felt this in over my head while playing a game.The controls are simple, but take some getting used to (you go forward automatically, but you hold the B button when going around a corner to drift and get a boost out of it). On the audio/visual front, it’s like playing a high-intensity minigame that lasts for several minutes. It’s overwhelmingly fast. I’m still trying to figure out if I had fun while playing it, or if I just needed more caffeine first. However, I can tell from a small taste that this game offers more depth than I anticipated, and I owe it another try at launch.I think this image perfectly sums up the vibe of my brief, yet intense experience with Kirby Air Riders. Image: Cameron Faulkner / The VergeKirby Air Riders is among the few new first-party games filling out Nintendo’s holiday lineup for the Switch 2, arriving on November 20th, just ahead of the busy Black Friday shopping rush. Outside of that, both Switch and Switch 2 owners have a lot to look forward to: a two-game collection featuring Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 is arriving on October 2nd (they’ll be available individually, as well), followed by the launch of Pokémon Legends: Z-A on October 16th. Lastly, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Nintendo’s long-awaited FPS sequel, drops on December 4th.Related2025 is turning into a good year for long-awaited games0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Cameron FaulknerCloseCameron FaulknerEditor, CommercePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Cameron FaulknerEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNintendoCloseNintendoPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NintendoMore in this streamSee allFinally, a way to attach Steam Deck or Switch 2 to an airplane tray table.Sean HollisterSep 10Fall into another Nintendo Direct.Ash ParrishSep 10These are my favorite Switch 2 accessoriesCameron FaulknerSep 5Most PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USThe foldable iPhone might look like two iPhone Airs stuck togetherThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
