The document outlines a sweeping strategy to investigate and harass a broad swath of organizations and institutions that the White House claims are anti-American.There are common recurrent motivations and indicia uniting this pattern of violent and terroristic activities under the umbrella of self-described “anti-fascism.” These movements portray foundational American principles (e.g., support for law enforcement and border control) as “fascist” to justify and encourage acts of violent revolution. This “anti-fascist” lie has become the organizing rallying cry used by domestic terrorists to wage a violent assault against democratic institutions, constitutional rights, and fundamental American liberties. Common threads animating this violent conduct include anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence[The White House]Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesThe company could lay off the Apple comparisons a bit though.Dominic PrestonSep 25NewsNewsNintendo of America boss Doug Bowser is retiringAndrew WebsterTwo hours agoHow AI safety took a backseat to military moneyAI firms are now working with weapons makers and the military.
