You’ll find these fitness trackers and smartwatches on dozens of wrists at any 5K, marathon, or Ironman. You’ll also find Garmin devotees among divers, thru-hikers, golfers, kiteboarders — you name it. But these devices aren’t just for athletes. The company’s made significant strides in its lifestyle offerings, so regardless of your fitness level, there’s a Garmin for everyone.If you’re coming from a more traditional smartwatch, Garmin’s core strengths lie in fitness, GPS, adventuring, and durability. These are hardy devices that are meant to withstand the elements and last weeks on a single charge. Several models come with offline maps, advanced navigational features, and more training metrics than any other platform. Garmin devices tend to be on the pricier side, and the company announced in March that it would begin putting its newest features behind a paywall. That’s a bummer given Garmin spent years publicly stating it had no intention of charging its users extra.What we’re looking forHow we test Garmin watchesCollapseThere are fitness trackers and smartwatches, and then there are Garmins. Depending on the type of Garmin — there are many — we will tailor our benchmarks and experiential, real-life testing. If it’s a rugged Fenix model, we’ll go on extensive GPS activities, see how well it works as a navigation tool, and dive deep into training metrics. If it’s more lifestyle focused, like the Venu 3, we’ll put an added focus on how well smart features like voice assistant access, notifications, and style. Because people buy Garmins to last a long time, we also put special consideration on battery life testing. Some other factors we consider are durability, performance, ability to connect to gym equipment, and GPS accuracy.Battery lifeCollapseGarmins are known for extra long battery life. The question is, does it last days, weeks, or even a month?Training metricsCollapseGarmin has so many training features that even the pros probably don’t use all of them. Do you get coaching programs and stamina graphs? Or are you sticking to the basics like steps, pace, and mileage?Navigational featuresCollapseSame goes for navigational features. While Garmin is known for its GPS tech, there are multiple kinds of GPS tracking and satellite systems. We also look at whether these navigational features fit the use case. For example, do running watches have back-to-start? Do offline maps come preloaded for thru-hikers?Style and durabilityCollapseDo these watches hold up to intense activity? Are they discreet enough to wear to formal occasions without screaming “I love exercise!!!!!”ValueCollapseGarmins are expensive. Does the price make sense for the intended user, feature set, and build quality?Garmins aren’t too shabby on smarts, either. While more fitness-focused than anything from Apple, Google, or Samsung, there’s enough to get you the basics like notifications and then some. For example, most Garmins have fall detection and safety features, and several Garmins released since 2023 have an FDA-cleared EKG feature. (You’ll need a phone on hand, however, as only one Garmin model has cellular connectivity.) Many Garmin devices also support offline music playback and come with a small third-party app ecosystem.There are a lot of Garmin watches to choose from. No, seriously, there are six major lineups, and each has a multitude of models. But no worries — I test several Garmins every year and can help point you in the right direction.In this articleThe best Garmin for runnersThe best Garmin for endurance sportsThe best Garmin on a budgetThe best Garmin to replace a FitbitThe best Garmin smartwatchWhat’s new The best Garmin for runners9Verge ScoreGarmin Forerunner 265 / 265S$450$450The GoodMore intuitive menu navigationMultiband GPSLong battery life — even with AOD enabledAdds helpful training featuresOh, oh, it’s OLED, you knowThe BadIt’s $100 more than the 255OLED displays don’t cost $100$450 at Amazon$450 at Garmin$450 at Best BuyHow we rate and review productsSizes: 42mm w/ 18mm straps; 46mm w/ 22mm straps / Weight: 39g (42mm); 47g (46mm) / Battery life: Up to 15 days (42mm); 13 days (46mm) in smartwatch mode / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 8GBGarmin has many running watches, and a lot of them are great. But the Forerunner 265 or 265S (if you have petite wrists) strikes an excellent balance between price, feature set, battery life, and a vibrant OLED display.That said, the Forerunner 265 / 265S is a bit of an odd duck. It comes a mere nine months after its predecessor, the Forerunner 255, and is, in many ways, pretty much the same watch. The main difference is that the 265 has an OLED display compared to the 255’s memory-in-pixel screen. Usually, that means worse battery life, but in this case, we got about a week on a single charge with the always-on display enabled. Without it, you can get up to 15 days. Given that OLED is easier to read and just, well, looks nicer, that gives the 265 lineup an edge over the 255.The 42mm Forerunner 265S fits on my petite wrists well. Plus, it’s lightweight, so it won’t distract you while running. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeThe 265 also has dual-frequency GPS (also known as multi-band). The gist is you get much more accurate maps in challenging environments like cities and dense forests because you can access both the L1 and L5 satellite frequencies. And even with dual-frequency GPS enabled, you still don’t lose a whole lot of battery life. I wore it during a half marathon with that and the AOD enabled, and I still had over 80 percent battery by the time I got home. This is also an excellent price, as the majority of multi-band GPS watches cost well over $600.RelatedThe best fitness trackers to buy right nowThe best smartwatches for Android right nowMy main complaint is that $450 (outside of a deal, at least), while not bad for Garmin, is still a lot when you consider that’s the same price as smarter smartwatches with great running features. Some runners won’t care. But if you’re on a budget — or you’re new to running and feel iffy about spending that much — then consider the Forerunner 165 series. It starts at $249.99 (add another $50 for onboard music) and does almost everything the 265 series does. The main things you’re missing are dual-frequency GPS and a few more niche sport profiles. But if you’re mostly sticking to running, gym equipment, cycling, swimming, and hiking, you’re covered.Garmin Forerunner 165 Music$300$300The Garmin Forerunner 165 Music gets you in-depth training metrics but leaves out some of the more advanced features in exchange for a more palatable price.Read More$300 at Amazon$300 at Garmin$300 at REINeither has all of Garmin’s training features, but it’s got what you’ll need to run anything from a 5K to a full marathon. That includes a Race Predictor, which gives you an estimate of what your best time would be based on your actual training. You can also use PacePro to figure out your pacing strategy for a race. You also get Garmin’s Training Readiness feature to help gauge load and recovery, Garmin Coach plans, and a host of running form metrics. It also supports offline music and safety features like fall detection. The only thing they lack is advanced mapping. (They still have trackback, point-to-point navigation, and real-time breadcrumb trail support, however.)On the other hand, if your budget allows, you could also consider the Forerunner 570 and Forerunner 970, which were released in June and cost $549.99 and $749.99, respectively. Both models have a built-in speaker and microphone, OLED screen, skin temperature sensors, flashlight, and built-in EKG reader with atrial fibrillation detection. They also give you a daily evening report with suggestions on how much sleep you should get, plus a digest of your upcoming events, workouts, and the weather. You also get access to Garmin Coach, a free multipart workout program, which allows you to upload your course and receive notifications when you’ve hit certain distance benchmarks.While both smartwatches have a lot in common, they do have some key differences, the main being that the 970 has maps. The Forerunner 570 comes in 42mm and 47mm sizes, and Garmin says its battery lasts up to 10 or 11 days based on which model you pick (with the always-on display off.) The Forerunner 970 only comes in a 47mm size, and Garmin says it can last up to 15 days per charge. The Forerunner 970 also includes three exclusive metrics: running tolerance, running economy, and speed step loss.These three tools will give you a weekly maximum mileage recommendation (with the option to adjust it up or down), and assess running efficiency. The running economy and step speed loss features require Garmin’s $169.99 HRM 600 heart rate monitor.The Forerunner 570 is a definite step up from the Forerunner 265, but not a big enough leap to recommend it to everyone instead of that model, especially because it doesn’t offer offline maps. The Forerunner 970 may be overkill for all but the most avid runners, but it’s good to see Garmin continually adding new features to the top of its line.Read my full Garmin Forerunner 265S review.The best Garmin for endurance sports8Verge ScoreGarmin Epix Pro Sapphire Edition (42mm)$750$100025% off$750The GoodNow comes in multiple sizesHands-free flashlight is SO handyGreat battery lifeMultiband GPSUpgraded heart rate sensorStarting price hasn’t changedThe BadAOD zaps battery life to three to four daysLots of incremental changesIt’s a Garmin review, so once again, the app$750 at Amazon$1000 at Garmin$1000 at REIHow we rate and review productsSizes: 42mm w/ 20mm straps; 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 51mm w/ 26mm straps / Weight: 42mm: 63g stainless steel, 58g titanium; 47mm: 78g stainless steel, 70g titanium; 51mm: 98g stainless steel, 88g titanium / Battery life: 42mm: up to 10 days (4 with AOD); 47mm: up to 16 days (6 with AOD); 51mm: up to 31 days (11 with AOD) / Display type: OLED / GPS: All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 10ATM / Music storage: Up to 32GBThe Epix Pro will get you most fitness features that Garmin has to offer. You have topographical maps, turn-by-turn navigation, and more training metrics than even a seasoned triathlete would know what to do with.The Pro is more size-inclusive than the standard second-gen Epix, which only comes in 47mm. You can get the Pro in that size, too, but it also comes in 42mm and 51mm. This was a major complaint I had with the second-gen Epix, and you love to see companies actually take this sort of thing seriously. The best part is that the Pro models start at the same price as the regular Epix did. You’ll have to pay $100 extra for materials like titanium and sapphire crystal, but that’s also true of the standard Epix.7Verge ScoreGarmin Fenix 8$1000$1000The GoodSmartens up Garmin’s flagship multisport watchExcellent battery and fitness trackingOffers MIP and OLED display optionsCondenses the Fenix and Epix lines into oneThe BadThe starting price is $350 more than the Fenix 7!Smart features are less helpful without LTE$1000 at Amazon$1000 at Garmin$1000 at REIHow we rate and review productsThat said, it muddies the waters if you’re trying to pick between the Epix Pro, Fenix 7, Fenix 7 Pro, and now, the Fenix 8. The main difference is that the Epix watches all have OLED displays. One reason I prefer OLED is that they’re much easier to read indoors — where most of us spend the majority of our time. The Fenix 7 series’ memory-in-pixel displays (plus solar charging if you opt for it) allow for weeks and weeks of charge, but the smallest Epix Pro can get around 10 days with normal usage. The 47mm and 51mm Pro models can go longer between charges due to bigger batteries, but I felt that the 42mm has enough juice to satisfy most use cases. Garmin also has so many battery-saving modes and options that I highly doubt this will ever be an issue.RelatedThe best smartwatches for Android right nowThe dangerously blurry line between wellness and medical techNot helping matters is the fact that the Fenix 8 lets you choose between an OLED and an MIP display. You also get smart features like an onboard voice assistant, the ability to take calls from the wrist, and the Garmin Messenger app. The main problem is that the starting price is now $350 more (barring any deals) than the standard Fenix 7 and right about on par with the Epix Pro. My personal feeling is that the Fenix 8’s smart features are just okay and that you’re really not missing much by not having them. We also often see discounts on older models, so I would put on my bargain-hunting hat for a discounted Epix Pro or Fenix 7 Pro while inventory is still available.But really, the winning feature of the Epix Pro is the hands-free flashlight. It’s so useful in my day-to-day life, and all you have to do is double-press a button. It’s as bright as your smartphone, comes with a red light option if you want something easier on the eyes, and can act as a strobe in an emergency situation. The Fenix 7 Pro and 8 watches also have a flashlight, so a lot of this is going to come down to personal preference for the display, price, and whether you care about smart features.We haven’t had a chance to get our hands on it yet, but Garmin also recently announced the Fenix 8 Pro. The watch, which starts at $1,199.99, is available in 47mm and 51mm sizes with either an OLED or MicroLED display. All models feature LTE and satellite connectivity, which costs $7.99 a month and allows you to send text and voice messages through the Garmin Messenger app when your phone is unavailable. The expanded connectivity also enables LiveTrack location sharing and access to real-time weather forecasts, as well as SOS requests, which get routed to Garmin’s Response Center and emergency services in the event of an emergency.8Verge ScoreGarmin Fenix 7S Pro$730$90019% off$730The GoodHands-free flashlightLong battery lifeMultiband GPSUpgraded heart rate monitorThe BadThe improved MIP display is still not the easiest to read in dim lightingToo similar to the standard Fenix 7$730 at Amazon$900 at Garmin$750 at Best BuyHow we rate and review productsIf you’re set on the most battery life possible, I recommend the Fenix 7 Pro over the standard 7 for a few reasons. Its MIP display is slightly brighter, all sizes have the flashlight, and, like the Epix Pro, it has an updated sensor array. I also recommend it over the MIP versions of the Fenix 8 because it comes in more sizes, and costs around $300 less. Especially since the Fenix 8’s smart features are a bit half-baked.Read my full Epix Pro review.The best Garmin on a budget8Verge ScoreGarmin Vivomove Sport$170$170The GoodAesthetically pleasing and accurate trackingGood for smaller wristsAffordable priceThe hidden OLED is coolThe BadThe Garmin app is overly complicatedBattery life is shorter than other hybrids$170 at Amazon$180 at GarminHow we rate and review productsSizes: 40mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 19g / Battery life: Up to 5 days / Display type: “Hidden” OLED touchscreen / GPS: Tethered GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/AWhat I love most about the Vivomove Sport is that it doesn’t look like what most people expect from a Garmin. It’s a hybrid smartwatch, which means it looks like a regular watch but can track fitness and deliver notifications. Garmin’s hybrids are also unique in that they all use an OLED display that stays hidden until you need it.This is best suited for a casually active person who wants style and value in a lightweight package. Think wellness, more so than fitness. It gets you continuous heart rate monitoring and blood oxygen level monitoring, and can even provide abnormal heart rate alerts. You also get access to more in-depth metrics like respiration rate, fitness age, stress, and Body Battery, which is Garmin’s tool for visualizing how well-rested you are. For smart features, you get all the basics, like notifications, alarms, and timers.You can’t easily read a whole text on this hidden OLED display, but you will know who sent it and make an educated choice about whether you want to reach for your phone. Photo by Victoria Song / The VergeThe Sport isn’t quite as full-featured as some other Garmin watches you’ll find on this list. For instance, you’re giving up built-in GPS in favor of tethered GPS through your phone. There are no contactless payments, nor is there a microphone or speaker for taking calls on the wrist. But this is a budget pick, and you get a lot, considering this is an entry-level gadget that could pass for a Swatch at a glance.I don’t love that the battery life is short for a hybrid, at around three to four days. Even so, that’s still much better than what you’ll get on an Apple Watch or Wear OS 5 watch. If you’re willing to spend about $100 more, the $269.99 Vivomove Trend has more chic materials, gets you more screen real estate, and wireless Qi charging. Otherwise, this is a great lifestyle wearable that can serve as a classier alternative to your typical fitness band.Garmin Lily 2$250$250The Garmin Lily 2 is a simple yet chic hybrid analog smartwatch that delivers basic fitness tracking, notifications, and up to five days of battery life.Read More$250 at Amazon$250 at Garmin$250 at Best BuyIf you prefer something newer to the Sport that’s also stylish, the Garmin Lily 2 is another good option, especially if you’ve got particularly small wrists or prefer something extremely lightweight. The swipe and tap gestures are still a little fiddly to use — which was also the case with the first-gen model — but the fresh design is a fun way to lightly monitor your fitness without bogging yourself down with notifications. Garmin also offers the Lily 2 Active, which adds a physical button, GPS, and support for more sports tracking for a starting price of $299.99.Read my full Garmin Vivomove Sport review.The best Garmin to replace a Fitbit8Verge ScoreGarmin Venu Sq 2$180$25028% off$180The GoodBright displayLong battery lifeTons of training and health featuresThe BadCluttered appProprietary USB-A charger$180 at Amazon$186 at Walmart$250 at GarminHow we rate and review productsSizes: 40mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 38g / Battery life: Up to 11 days / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 4GB (for Music Edition)If you were disappointed by the Fitbit Sense 2 and Versa 4, the Venu Sq 2 is the next best thing (and, in some ways, better).At a glance, the Venu Sq 2 could easily be mistaken for an Apple Watch. On the wrist, you’ll notice it’s made of plastic, but it still looks quite chic and extremely lightweight. The screen is bright, easy to read, and looks better than any Versa or Sense ever did.RelatedThe best smart rings for tracking sleep and healthHow to choose an Apple WatchThe feature set is also great for the price, with built-in GPS, a ton of watch faces, emergency safety features, and contactless payments. If you pay $50 more for the Music Edition, you’ll also get about 500 songs worth of storage, but we wouldn’t recommend it. This doesn’t have cellular connectivity and, therefore, isn’t truly standalone. You’ll most likely be carrying your phone with you anyway.The display is nicer than anything Fitbit ever made — and with smaller bezels, too. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeAs for health features, the Venu Sq 2 basically has everything you’d get on a Versa or Sense smartwatch but with Garmin’s treasure trove of metrics as well. That includes heart rate tracking, blood oxygen tracking, intensity minutes (how much moderate exercise you get in a week), stress tracking, hydration tracking, respiratory rate, period tracking, and Garmin’s recovery feature, Body Battery. As far as fitness goes, you also get access to Garmin Coach, which provides free 5K, 10K, and half marathon training plans. You love to see it.Another big leg-up Garmin has over Fitbit? None of these features or metrics are locked behind a paywall, even if Garmin’s AI-powered insights and a few other expanded features are only available as part of Garmin Connect Plus ($6.99 a month / $69.99 annually).Read my full Garmin Venu Sq 2 review.The best Garmin smartwatch7Verge ScoreGarmin Venu 3S$400$45011% off$400The GoodGood battery lifeBetter sleep tracking and nap detectionEKG and AFib featuresCan take calls and use your phone’s voice assistantAudio meditation sessions done wellThe BadPricey compared to other lifestyle smartwatchesLimited third-party app ecosystemNo LTE capability$400 at Amazon$400 at Walmart$400 at Best BuyHow we rate and review productsSizes: 41mm w/ 18mm straps; 45mm w/ 22mm straps / Weight: 40g for the 3S; 47g for the 3 / Battery life: Up to 10 days for 3S; 14 days for 3 / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 8GBGarmin has shored up the smarts in its watches over the past several years, and the Venu 3 series is one of the smartest (and most affordable) of the bunch.The Venu 3 series comes in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Like the Venu 2 Plus, it has a microphone and speaker. You can take calls directly from the wrist and issue commands to your phone’s digital assistant via Bluetooth. It’s not the same as having Siri, Bixby, Amazon Alexa, or Google Assistant built directly into the watch, but it’s a clever workaround that works well for hands-free control. It also supports safety features like fall detection and live tracking, as well as contactless payments.The Venu 3S has an advanced heart rate sensor and adds a wheelchair mode and nap detection. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeLike other OLED Garmins, the display is both vibrant and easy to read. As for health and fitness, you get a nice mix of basic and more advanced features and metrics. It has a heart rate sensor that enables FDA-cleared EKG and AFib detection features. Overall, it leans a bit more on the wellness and health side of things, with intensity minutes, blood oxygen monitoring, sleep tracking, period tracking, abnormal heart rate alerts, and stress tracking. As for training, you still get built-in GPS, VO2 Max, heart rate zones, respiration rate, and downloadable training plans via Garmin Coach.The Venu 3 and 3S have a sleep coach that factors in metrics like heart rate variability and recent activity to determine your sleep needs. It also adds nap detection, a feature that’s been long overdue for the Garmin platform, and audio-guided meditation sessions. From an accessibility standpoint, this also adds a wheelchair mode.RelatedGarmin isn’t into rushing to make smart glassesThe best Fitbits for your fitness and healthTechnically, the Fenix 8 is slightly smarter in that it has an on-board voice assistant. However, it is also more than double the price and not what I’d consider a good value for the average athlete. It’s more for people who spend hours upon hours training every week.This is the Garmin for you if you want the platform’s in-depth training without sacrificing the productivity of a smartwatch. The main things it’s lacking are cellular options and a robust third-party app ecosystem. That said, it’s got Spotify, Amazon Music, and Deezer for offline listening. It’s also a good option if you’re fed up with MIP displays and want a smarter Garmin rather than a full-on smartwatch.However, it is worth noting that Garmin recently launched the Garmin Venu 4. The new model is available in two sizes, 41mm and 45mm, both of which are available from Amazon, Best Buy, and Garmin for $549.99. The smartwatch features more advanced wellness features than the Venu 3, including the ability to log your caffeine and alcohol intake, providing insights into how they may be impacting your sleep. Garmin’s Fitness Coach can also create a personalized workout regimen from a pool of 25 exercises, which are based on your prior performance, recovery level, and recent sleep patterns.Read my full Garmin Venu 3S review.What’s newGarmin recently announced the Bounce 2, a new smartwatch for kids, which is available for $299.99 from Best Buy, REI, and Garmin. The LTE-connected smartwatch sports an updated circular design, as well as support for two-way communication, voice transcription, and the ability to download songs from Amazon Music. Parents can track kids in real-time using the Garmin Jr. app, and opt to receive a notification when their kid leaves a designated area. However, the watch is twice as expensive as the first-gen model and requires an LTE plan, which will run you $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year on top of the hardware cost.Update, September 23rd: Adjusted pricing / availability and added information regarding the Garmin Venu 4, the Fenix 8 Pro series, and the Bounce 2.
