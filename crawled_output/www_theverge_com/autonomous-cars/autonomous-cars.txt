So it is with great pleasure that I point you to this MotorTrend piece about Waymo’s new Zeekr-made robotaxi, and its plethora of tiny windshield wipers. Eight to be exact: four on the roof, and one at the corner above each wheel. (There are also two regular sized wipers, but who cares about that?) These diminutive wipers are meant to keep the various sensors clean and free of road grime. I remember first encountering Waymo’s tiny lidar wipers back in 2019. I’m glad to see that they’re still in the game, and still itty bitty.Image: Alex Leanse / MotorTrendAComments0Andrew J. HawkinsAug 6LinkZoox is in the clear.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was certifying Amazon’s robotaxi service for demonstration purposes, while also ending the investigation into whether the company sidestepped safety regulations. The exemption was the first under NHTSA’s newly streamlined regulatory process for approving vehicles without traditional controls, like steering wheels and pedals. As part of the agreement, Zoox is required to “remove or obscure” all references to its purpose-built autonomous shuttles complying with federal motor vehicle safety regulations.Zoox autonomous robotaxis in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024.
