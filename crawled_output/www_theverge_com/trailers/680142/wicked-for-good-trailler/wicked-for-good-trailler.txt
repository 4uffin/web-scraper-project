Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.Though Universal’s decision to split Wicked’s story across two films seemed a little iffy at first, the new trailer for Wicked: For Good makes it look like the studio knows exactly what it’s doing.Despite all of the vibrant colors and singing, there’s a dark undertone in the new Wicked: For Good trailer that speaks to how the first movie ended. Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) has become known as the Wicked Witch of the West, and the Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) has convinced everyone in Oz that she’s a villain who’s meant to be feared.With Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) working her own magic to create chaos across Oz and Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) being the face of the Wizard’s hunt to find Elphaba, people are inclined to believe that she truly is a danger to them all. But the trailer makes it abundantly clear that Glinda (Arianna Grande) hasn’t bought into the negative propaganda about her good friend at all.The trailer makes Wicked, part two, seem like it’s going to have no trouble standing on its own with a distinct tone and powerful renditions of the original musical’s second act songs. And when the movie hits theaters on November 21st, it’s probably going to set off a new wave of sing-alongs that we should all start getting ready for.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Charles Pulliam-MooreCloseCharles Pulliam-MooreFilm & TV ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Charles Pulliam-MooreEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentFilmCloseFilmPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All FilmNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTrailersCloseTrailersPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TrailersMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
