He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Saros, the next game from Returnal developer Housemarque, launches for PS5 on March 20th, 2026, Sony announced during its September State of Play presentation on Wednesday.Based on a gameplay trailer shown during the event, it looks like Saros takes a lot of cues from Returnal, with futuristic weapons, lots of bullets and rings filling the screen, and mysterious environments that you’ll have to navigate. You’ll also get a new shield that lets you run into projectiles that you can absorb as energy and then throw back toward your enemies.Housemarque is also introducing an unlockable “Second Chance” ability that lets you come back to life after you die, which could be useful for what looks to be a very difficult game. There are other new permanent-progression systems added to the game, too.Saros was initially announced earlier this year, and at the time, Sony only provided a 2026 release date. The game will also be enhanced for PS5 Pro.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPlayStationClosePlayStationPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PlayStationMore in this streamSee allA cool-looking game with a very weird name.Jay PetersSep 24PlayStation’s new wireless speakers are for your desktopJay PetersSep 24Controller of war.Andrew WebsterSep 24Most PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Logitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersSamsung now owns Denon, Bowers & Wilkins, Marantz, Polk, and more audio brandsGoogle’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
