Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.Steam has taken down a game containing malware that drained the cryptocurrency wallets belonging to hundreds of players, as reported earlier by Bleeping Computer. The free-to-play 2D platformer, titled BlockBlasters, took more than $150,000 from victims, including $32,000 from a streamer raising funds for their cancer treatment.In a post on X, malware tracker vx-underground revealed that bad actors targeted some streamers with a spearphishing campaign that attempted to lure victims into promoting the game in exchange for compensation. “Unfortunately, the Steam game was actually a cryptodrainer masquerading as a legitimate video game,” vx-underground wrote in a post on X.As noted by Bleeping Computer, BlockBlasters first appeared on Steam on July 30th, but the game quietly added a cryptodrainer on August 30th. It was published by developer Genesis Interactive and garnered more than 200 “very positive” reviews. The malicious title mostly flew under the radar until Latvian streamer Raivo Plavnieks (Rastaland.TV), who has stage 4 cancer, said that they lost $32,000 after downloading BlockBlasters over the weekend.Steam has removed a flurry of games that have infected Windows computers with malware, including PirateFi, Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution, and Chemia. Steam removed BlockBlasters on September 21st. The Verge reached out to Valve with a request for comment, but didn’t immediately hear back.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPC GamingClosePC GamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PC GamingSecurityCloseSecurityPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SecurityTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
