He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined The Verge in May 2025.Logitech’s next flagship wireless gaming mouse is ditching mechanical switches for an analog system equipped with haptics actuators to simulate the feeling of a click. The mouse is called the Pro X2 Superstrike, and it’s coming early next year for $179.99.The inductive analog system (which Logitech calls Haptic Inductive Trigger System, or HITS) boasts a small 0.6mm travel per main button. They’re supposed to let players click faster than ever thanks to their low latency — Logitech claims it improves latency by up to 30 milliseconds — plus 10 customizable actuation points, and rapid trigger support.Rapid trigger is more commonly found in gaming keyboards, but now it’s coming to mice. The simple explanation is that it allows the sensor to reset when you barely lift up on the button, letting it quickly register another input with minimal force. It allows you take action faster than those using mice that lack rapid trigger. This mouse supports five rapid trigger reset points, configurable via G Hub, letting you get super granular with when you want the analog sensor to reset.RelatedThis Superstrike is compatible with Powerplay 2, Logitech’s wireless charging mousepadThe Superstrike weighs 65 grams, and features Logitech’s Hero 2 sensor, which is also present in its current lineup of Pro X wireless gaming mice. It supports up to an 8,000Hz polling rate wirelessly via its included Lightspeed USB-A dongle, although it’s only accessible via the G Hub software. I’m generally skeptical of 8,000Hz polling rates since most people’s reaction time isn’t fast enough to warrant it, but I’m curious if it’ll make a noticeable difference in conjunction with the Superstrike’s rapid trigger functionality.Logitech is also announcing the Superlight 2C, a more compact version of the Superlight 2 mouse. It’s 10 percent lighter at 51 grams and five percent smaller overall, which could make it a preferred choice among PC gamers whose hands don’t jibe with the size of most gaming mice. Other than its shape, its specs seem identical to the Superlight 2. It’ll be available on October 21st for $159.99.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Cameron FaulknerCloseCameron FaulknerEditor, CommercePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Cameron FaulknerGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingLogitechCloseLogitechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All LogitechNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPC GamingClosePC GamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PC GamingTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Logitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersYou can now upgrade a retro Casio watch with Bluetooth, step tracking, and gamesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
