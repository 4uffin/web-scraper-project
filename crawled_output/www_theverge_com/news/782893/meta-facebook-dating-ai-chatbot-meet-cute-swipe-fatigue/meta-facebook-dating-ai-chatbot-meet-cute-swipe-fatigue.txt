He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Facebook Dating is getting new AI features to help users avoid “swipe fatigue,” Meta announced today. The new features include a new “dating assistant” AI chatbot that helps you find potential matches as well as a new “Meet Cute” feature that automatically matches you with someone using a “personalized” algorithm.With the dating assistant, you can type out specific prompts to try and match up with certain types of people; Meta gives the example of “find me a Brooklyn girl in tech.” The assistant can also help “level up your profile” or offer dating ideas. The chatbot will be available in the Matches tab and is “gradually” rolling out in the US and Canada, Meta says.The Meet Cute feature will pair you with someone every week and is “ideal for anyone who’s tired of swiping and is looking for a fresh, easy way to expand their typical pool of dating candidates,” Meta says. (OkCupid tried something similar in 2013 with its Crazy Blind Date app.) Meta is “exploring” adding other time frequencies for the recommendations and you can opt out of the Meet Cute if you like.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been pushing to make Facebook more “culturally influential” this year, with the company also making all Facebook videos reels and trying to clean up Facebook spam.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersFacebookCloseFacebookPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All FacebookMetaCloseMetaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MetaNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
