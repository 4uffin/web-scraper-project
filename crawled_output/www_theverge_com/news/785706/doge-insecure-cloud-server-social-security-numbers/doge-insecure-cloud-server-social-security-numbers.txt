Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.A new report from Senate Democrats claims that members of Elon Musk’s DOGE team have access to the Social Security numbers of all Americans in a cloud server that’s lacking verified security measures, despite an internal assessment of potential “catastrophic” risk. The report, released by Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), cites numerous disclosures from whistleblowers, including one who said a worst-case scenario could involve having to reissue SSNs to everyone in the country.As outlined in the report, DOGE staffers moved a live copy of Americans’ personal information to a cloud server despite an internal risk assessment from the Social Security Administration (SSA), which determined the impact could be “catastrophic” without the proper safeguards. The report notes that this information is considered “production data,” potentially allowing DOGE to “directly manipulate” it.In addition to SSNs, the database reportedly includes Americans’ place and date of birth, work permit status, and parents’ names. The potential security threats range from data breaches by foreign adversaries, like Russia, China, and Iran, to DOGE staffers themselves, including Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, who had unfettered access to the information and had reportedly been fired from a previous internship for leaking sensitive data.The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs released the report, which also raised concerns over DOGE’s activity at the General Services Administration and the Office of Personnel Management.Last month, a federal appeals court ruled that DOGE can continue accessing sensitive information across government agencies. Democrats accused DOGE of creating a “cross-agency master database” in April, which Wired said the government would use to track immigrants.RelatedHouse Democrats: DOGE is building a ‘master database’ of Americans’ sensitive informationDOGE staffer ‘Big Balls’ has access to immigration agency’s dataMeanwhile, SSA officials, who typically ensure the security of the agency’s cloud infrastructure, haven’t been able to monitor DOGE’s work. Staff members conducting the oversight of DOGE found that it operated with a high level of secrecy, with armed guards controlling “access to work and living spaces,” while rooms remained locked and office windows “appeared to have been hastily covered with black trash bags and tape,” according to the report. Whistleblower interviews paint a picture of workspaces bearing “stacks” of laptops and offices being converted into private bedrooms, including one containing a queen bed, a wardrobe, and a big-screen TV.Senate Democrats are calling on the Trump administration to shut down DOGE’s cloud environment, as well as to revoke DOGE’s access to personal information until agencies can certify that they’re following privacy laws. They also recommend releasing all information about the data that DOGE staffers have access to.“DOGE is jeopardizing Americans’ most sensitive data, while its employees operate under a layer of secrecy that shields them from meaningful oversight and accountability,” the report states. “This environment results in serious cybersecurity vulnerabilities, privacy violations, and risk of corruption that could open Americans’ most sensitive information to targeting by malicious actors… or serve to benefit DOGE employees and the private companies with which many maintain strong ties.”Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyPoliticsClosePoliticsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PoliticsSecurityCloseSecurityPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SecurityTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
