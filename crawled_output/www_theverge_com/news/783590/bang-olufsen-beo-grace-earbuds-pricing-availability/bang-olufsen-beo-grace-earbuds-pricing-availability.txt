Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.Bang & Olufsen’s latest Beo Grace earbuds offer a flashy aluminum design and the brand’s “most advanced” active noise cancellation for a staggering $1,500. These pricey new buds pump sound through 12mm titanium drivers, featuring ANC powered by six microphones that adjust audio based on ambient noise and the shape of your ear.The Beo Grace earbuds support Dolby Atmos spatial audio and the transparency mode inside the equally expensive Beoplay H100 headphones, which aim to recreate the sound of your environment “free from hiss or distortion.” Other features include tactile controls and “NearTap” technology that allows you to control volume by tapping in front of your ear.PreviousNext1/3The new buds offer 4.5 hours of battery life with ANC turned on — that’s less than the six hours promised by the $499 Beoplay Eleven earbuds Bang & Olufsen released last year. But Bang & Olufsen says it partnered with the battery intelligence company Breathe to improve the longevity of the Beo Grace’s battery, and says the buds surpassed 2,000 charge cycles in internal testing.The Beo Grace earbuds come with a matching aluminum charging case that you can turn into an audio transmitter by plugging it into a device with USB-C or line-in, allowing it to stream audio from your laptop, an airplane TV, or another device that might not support Bluetooth to your earbuds. There’s a leather pouch you can store the case in, too, but that will cost you an extra $400.The Beo Grace earbuds are available for preorder now, and will start shipping on November 17th.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsHeadphonesCloseHeadphonesPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All HeadphonesNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
