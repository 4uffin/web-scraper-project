We got a new trailer for the Super Mario Bros Movie sequel, a new Yoshi game, a new Mario Tennis game, this weird thing, a Hades II release date, a new Pokémon game, and Metroid Prime 4’s release date. But if that weren’t enough, and apparently it wasn’t according to Nintendo, the company has also revealed a first look at the latest Fire Emblem game titled Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave.The reveal trailer gave us a glimpse of the world of Fortune’s Weave. The game features what looks to be the same kind of factional rivalries that made Fates, Awakening, and Three Houses so special. Fortune’s Weave also features totally new characters in a brand new setting that, so far, looks much more interesting than what Fire Emblem Engage had to offer.At the heart of Fortune’s Weave is the Heroic Games, a gladiator-like contest that will no doubt have massive implications on the wider story. Fortune’s Weave looks to have the same tactical RPG rock-paper-scissors combat that I love about the series including new combat units that have some gladiatorial flair. We’ll learn all Fire Emblem Fortune’s Weave has to offer when it launches on the Switch 2 some time next year.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Ash ParrishCloseAsh ParrishVideo Games ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Ash ParrishEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsNintendoCloseNintendoPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NintendoTrailersCloseTrailersPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TrailersMore in this streamSee allPokémon Legends: Z-A’s first DLC will take you to the Mega DimensionCharles Pulliam-MooreSep 12Go even more bananas.Andrew WebsterSep 12The Switch 2 gets a little evil.Andrew WebsterSep 12Most PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USThe foldable iPhone might look like two iPhone Airs stuck togetherThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
