However, while the previous version was compatible with Apple’s Find My network and recharable, the new FineTrack Slim Smart G only works with Google’s Find Hub network and lacks charging capabilities and a replaceable battery. When it dies, you’re left with a credit card-sized piece of e-waste. You can find it on Amazon for $25.99.At 1.7mm thick – roughly the same thickness of two credit cards – the FineTrack Slim Smart G is thinner than competitor’s wallet trackers including the 2.5mm Tile Slim which also lacks charging capabilities and is limited to three years of use. With 12 months of battery life between top-ups, Ugreen’s older rechargeable FineTrack Slim will definitely outlast this new Android-only version, but every wallet tracker will eventually become e-waste when their non-replaceable batteries stop taking a charge. In five years’ time you’ll probably be eager to upgrade to the latest tracking technology anyways.Other features include IP68 dust and waterproofing so the FineTrack Slim Smart G can survive dunks to up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes, although it will be completely untrackable while submerged. It also has a built-in 80dB alarm that will potentially make it easier to locate the tracker when Google’s Find Hub app tells you it’s nearby but your wallet is in a pair of pants buried in a pile of dirty laundry.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
