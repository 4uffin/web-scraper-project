He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Palworld won’t hit 1.0 until next year, but developer Pocketpair is already announcing a farming spinoff: Palworld: Palfarm.Basically, it sounds like the Palworld version of farming simulator games like Stardew Valley. “Each Pal will lend a hand in farm work by making use of their unique abilities,” Pocketpair says in a press release. “From sowing seeds and watering to harvesting, Pals make for reliable partners. Deepen your relationships with the island residents and Pals through daily conversation and gift-giving, and you may discover unexpected, special stories unfolding.” You’ll also have to defend your farm from “some nasty Pals that come to wreak havoc.” Palfarm will support multiplayer so you can play with your friends, too.RelatedPalworld had to remove game features because of Nintendo lawsuitPocketpair hasn’t provided a release date or saying what platforms the game will come to yet. But Palfarm continues Pocketpair’s efforts to branch out from the main Palworld game, which include a Palworld dating simulator and an indie publishing label.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsMore in this streamSee allPalworld 1.0 is coming 2026.Sean HollisterSep 16Palworld had to remove game features because of Nintendo lawsuitAndrew WebsterMay 8P is for Pals who do stuff together.Ash ParrishMar 12Most PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Logitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
