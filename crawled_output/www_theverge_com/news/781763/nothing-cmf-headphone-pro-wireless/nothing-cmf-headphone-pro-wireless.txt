The launch comes after Nothing released its Headphone 1 wireless over-ear cans earlier this year.The CMF Headphone Pro will launch on September 29th, 2025, and while the company hasn’t revealed any specifics on performance, the teaser videos it shared on X hint at some of the features.The first video of the CMF Headphone Pro reveals two bright color options, light green and bright orange, and ear cushions that have been mixed and matched, so there could be some level of customizability if the cushions are sold separately. Like the Nothing Headphone 1, the CMF Headphone Pro also appears to have myriad buttons and controls in different shapes and sizes. There’s a slider that could be used for volume control, and what appears to be a scroll wheel.A follow-up video, shared earlier today, seems to confirm that Nothing will encourage users to customize the appearance of the Headphone Pro. It shows a gray ear cushion being replaced by a bright orange alternative that rotates and locks into place. Both videos are accompanied by a “remix everything” tagline, but it’s unclear exactly how customizable the headphones will be.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiAudioCloseAudioPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AudioGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsHeadphonesCloseHeadphonesPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All HeadphonesNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularNest is dead, long live Google HomeI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failureFirst look at the Google Home app powered by GeminiAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
