Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.One of the mysterious AI devices that OpenAI is considering developing with Apple’s former chief design officer, Jony Ive, “resembles a smart speaker without a display,” The Information reports. People “with direct knowledge of the matter” told the publication that OpenAI has already secured a contract with Luxshare, and has also approached Goertek — two of Apple’s product assemblers — to supply components like speaker modules for its future lineup of AI gadgets.OpenAI has also considered building glasses, a digital voice recorder, and a wearable pin, according to sources speaking to The Information, with the first products being targeted for release in late 2026 or early 2027.In May, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he envisioned a “family of devices” being born from the partnership with Ive, the first of which was described as being pocket-size, contextually aware, and screen-free. That tracks with these new rumors about OpenAI’s first device, but this is the first time that information has leaked about additional gadgets.Altman previously said that OpenAI’s first AI device wouldn’t be a pair of glasses, but these rumors suggest that smart eyewear may follow its initial product launch. An AI pin would be a surprising addition, given Ive wasn’t keen to develop a body-wearable and had slammed the Humane AI Pin. Previous reports also suggest that Altman and Ive have considered developing an in-ear device, which is notably absent in this rumored upcoming product lineup.RelatedDetails leak about Jony Ive’s new ‘screen-free’ OpenAI deviceOpenAI and Jony Ive’s ‘io’ brand has vanishedThe Information’s sources say the ChatGPT maker has started tapping into Apple’s supply chain network in China to help produce these devices. Luxshare is a major assembler of iPhones and AirPods, while Goertek assembles AirPods, HomePods, and Apple Watches. Apple reportedly canceled a meeting with manufacturing and supply chain teams in China last month over concerns it would keep executives away from the company’s US headquarters, at a time when they were needed to prevent defections to OpenAI, according to The Information, citing an unnamed person “who was informed of the decision.”Apple employees who worked on the company’s consumer hardware have also increasingly jumped ship to OpenAI since its partnership with Ive’s IO startup was announced. Tang Tan — OpenAI’s current chief hardware officer, and former Apple product design head — has promised people being poached from Apple that they will “encounter less bureaucracy and more collaboration at OpenAI,” a person familiar with Tang’s outreach told The Information.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AINewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsOpenAICloseOpenAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All OpenAIMore in this streamSee allElon Musk’s xAI is suing OpenAI and AppleEmma RothAug 25The head of ChatGPT was “surprised” by how much people were attached to GPT-4o.Richard LawlerAug 14OpenAI closes its deal to buy Jony Ive’s io and build AI hardwareHayden FieldJul 9Most PopularMost PopularNest is dead, long live Google HomeI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failureFirst look at the Google Home app powered by GeminiAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
