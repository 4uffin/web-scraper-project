He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.While it seems like a foregone conclusion that there will be a foldable iPhone, possibly late next year, there hasn’t been much info about what it would look like. In the latest installment of his Power On newsletter, Mark Gurman says he’s being told it will look more or less like two iPhone Airs stuck together.That means it should be pretty thin, though potentially thicker than a Pixel 10 Pro Fold (10.8mm) and Galaxy Z Fold7 (8.9mm), since an iPhone Air comes in at 5.6mm thick. Though Ming-Chi Kuo’s sources suggest the foldable will be quite a bit thinner when unfolded, possibly as little as 4.5mm. Unfortunately, Gurman also expects the foldable iPhone to cost more than the Pixel Fold, starting at at least $2,000, possibly more.One benefit of basing the foldable on the iPhone Air’s design is durability. While foldables have improved a lot over the years, there are still concerns about how they can stand up to abuse. But Gurman says the iPhone fold will be made of titanium, just like the Air, which both JerryRigEverything and iFixit have found to be pretty tough.iFixit also gave the iPhone Air a surprisingly decent repairability score of seven, and highlighted how Apple made it so thin and strong by moving the logic board up higher. If an iPhone fold could even get close to the same repairability score, it would be a pretty big deal. Both the Pixel Fold and Z Fold7 earned repairability scores of three.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Terrence O'BrienCloseTerrence O'BrienWeekend EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Terrence O'BrienAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleiPhoneCloseiPhonePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All iPhoneNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
