The Cyberspace Administration of China banned buying and testing the RTX Pro 6000D chips, despite companies having ordered thousands of the chips in the months since their introduction in July, according to three unnamed people with knowledge of the matter and who spoke to the FT.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he was “disappointed” by news of the ban during a press conference with reporters in London, where he is set to join President Donald Trump at a state dinner on Wednesday night. In August, Nvidia worked with Trump to broker a deal allowing the sale of H20 chips to China in return for a 15 percent cut of the profit.“We probably contributed more to the China market than most countries have. And I’m disappointed with what I see,” Huang said to reporters during the press conference. “But they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States, and I’m understanding of that.”Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson went further, saying that China is trying to become a “peer-to-peer adversary” of the US during an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Wednesday.“They have no regard whatsoever for U.S. trademark law or any of the other provisions that make for fair trade agreements,” Johnson said. “It is not the fault of the United States that there are these strained relations. It is the fault of China.”China has been making moves to build up its own chip manufacturing capability after years of tit-for-tat export controls by the US to limit the sale of AI chips to China, and China limiting the sale of chip materials to the US. China has been using less powerful chips tailor-made for the country by Nvidia.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Elissa WelleCloseElissa WelleAI ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Elissa WelleAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AINewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsNvidiaCloseNvidiaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NvidiaTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMore in this streamSee allNvidia is partnering up with OpenAI to offer compute and cashHayden FieldSep 22Apparently you can pay your way out of national security concerns.Richard LawlerSep 18Nvidia and AMD will cut the US government in on revenue from AI chip sales in China.Richard LawlerAug 11Most PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
