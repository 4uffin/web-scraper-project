Now, Microsoft is adding two new Photoshop-like features to Paint.You’ll soon be able to save your Paint creations as a project file, much like a Photoshop Document (.PSD). The Paint project files are currently being tested with Windows Insiders in the Dev and Canary Channels. “You can now save your creation as an editable Paint project file and seamlessly pick up where you left off,” explains Dave Grochocki, principal product manager lead for Microsoft’s Windows inbox apps.You’ll soon be able to save your Paint creations as a project file.

Paint files will store your layers inside the file, too. “When you’re ready to return, simply open the file to launch it in Paint, right where you left off,” says Grochocki.Microsoft is also adding opacity sliders to adjust the transparency of the pencil and brush tools in Paint. “To get started, select either tool and use the slider on the left side of the canvas to adjust the opacity to your desired level,” says Grochocki.The new opacity sliders for the pencil and brush tools.

There’s a highlighter, pen, and eraser tool in the markup toolbar, as well as the ability to easily re-crop an image.Finally, Microsoft is also adding AI-powered write, summarization, and rewrite as a free feature inside Notepad for Copilot Plus PC users. You won’t need a Microsoft 365 subscription to use this, but Grochocki says you can “seamlessly switch between local and cloud models based on your needs.” Microsoft is using the local models on Copilot Plus PCs to power this Notepad feature.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Tom WarrenCloseTom WarrenSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tom WarrenAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWindowsCloseWindowsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WindowsMost PopularMost PopularLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
