Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.Smart thermostat company Tado is launching new AI-powered features that aim to help users heat their homes more efficiently. Tado says the AI Assist update builds on the company’s existing Auto Assist options by introducing “advanced machine-learning” that “learns, predicts, and optimizes” heating in real time.AI Assist is available in Europe and the UK today for all Tado X owners at the same price as the company’s existing subscription (£29.99 a year or £3.99 per month). Existing Auto Assist subscribers will be upgraded automatically, though owners of older Tado hardware won’t get the extra AI. According to Tado’s press release, AI Assist includes:Adaptive Heating: Learns the unique heat-up and cool-down characteristics of each room with Tado AI. It fine-tunes the control of your Smart Radiator Thermostats to optimize comfort and energy efficiency.Preheat Before Arrival: Tado AI uses advanced machine learning to predict when you’ll return home and preheats your home in time for your arrival.Energy IQ : Uses AI-powered insights that reveal exactly where and how you’re using energy, enabling smarter decisions and bigger savings.Holiday Mode: Lets you set your heating to match your time away, so you return to a comfortable home while avoiding unnecessary energy use.Features like Energy IQ and an Away Mode for vacations were already included as part of Tado’s existing Auto Assist service, so this update doesn’t sound like a giant technological leap forward. Other smart home companies like Nest have offered similar features without labelling them as “AI” innovations, so it’s unclear if Tado’s use of AI has substance, or is just a buzzword-heavy rebrand.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsSmart HomeCloseSmart HomePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Smart HomeTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
