To soften the blow when the price increase goes into effect for existing cardholders on January 2nd, 2026 (new cardmembers will be paying $895 immediately) the Platinum card comes with plenty of benefits, additional shopping credits, and a “newly enhanced” American Express mobile app that will make Platinum cardholders feel extra special with an exclusive premium theme that… turns the app black.Yep, as a thank you for dropping $895 on the ability to buy things and pay for them later with interest, Platinum cardholders won’t have to endure the same navy blue app theme as the proletariat. They can join the elite by switching the app to a darker black theme, although, according to users on Reddit, the change is subtle and can be hard to discern when using iOS’ Light mode.Other new perks for Platinum cardholders include a $300 credit for Lululemon, a $400 Resy restaurant credit, a $120 Uber One credit, a $200 Oura Ring credit, and the hotel credit was bumped from $200 to $400/year. If you regularly use those perks, or hate that the mobile app’s standard navy blue theming makes you feel like a commoner, the card could still be worth it, even with the hefty price bump.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiAndroidCloseAndroidPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AndroidAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleAppsCloseAppsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppsGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleiOSCloseiOSPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All iOSNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunOpenAI really, really wants you to start your day with ChatGPT PulseThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
