Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.Google is launching a new AI concepting tool that lets you create moodboards to explore design ideas. The Mixboard Google Labs experiment gives users an open canvas to create projects from pre-populated board templates or text prompts using Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash model.The experimental tool is available through public beta in the US. The format is visually similar to platforms like FigJam or Adobe’s Firefly Boards, so this isn’t a unique concept, but it’s interesting to see Google developing more design-based apps.RelatedPinterest is finally doing something about its AI infestationAdobe adds more image generators to its growing AI familyMixboard users can add their own images, or generate visuals with descriptions like “show me cups, bowls, and plates in Memphis style,” or “plan an autumn party in my living room.” The tool can be used to explore ideas for decorating your home, planning events, or just creating an ensemble of amusing images for entertainment — similar to Pinterest boards. Google says that users can edit boards with natural language prompts to adjust or combine images, or reference uploaded images to generate new visuals. One-click options also enable users to quickly regenerate images or generate similar-looking designs.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AICreatorsCloseCreatorsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All CreatorsGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
