During its direct showcase, the company revealed more information on the sequel to The Super Mario Bros Movie — The Super Mario Galaxy Movie including a brand new trailer.The teaser trailer was just that, a taste of what’s to come. It features Mario resting under a tree in the Mushroom Kingdom while a butterfly zooms up to space as the theme to Super Mario Galaxy begins to play.We had some inkling Nintendo would go in the galaxy direction for its sequel. The first movie, which grossed over a billion dollars, spawned memes, and earned a Golden Globe nomination, hinted at a wider world beyond the Mushroom Kingdom. There’s also the fact that eagle-eyed internet sleuths found domains registered to NBC Universal, Nintendo’s movie production partner, that contained the name of the film. (An earlier leak also suggested the movie was titled “Super Mario World”.)According to Nintendo executive Shigeru Miyamoto, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be the centerpiece of Mario’s 40th anniversary celebration. Due out in April, Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Jack Black will reprise their roles as Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Bowser.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Ash ParrishCloseAsh ParrishVideo Games ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Ash ParrishEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsNintendoCloseNintendoPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NintendoTrailersCloseTrailersPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TrailersMore in this streamSee allFight for glory in Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave coming to the Switch 2 next yearAsh ParrishSep 12Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s first DLC will take you to the Mega DimensionCharles Pulliam-MooreSep 12Go even more bananas.Andrew WebsterSep 12Most PopularMost PopularI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failureNest is dead, long live Google HomeFirst look at the Google Home app powered by GeminiAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
