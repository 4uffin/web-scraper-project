During its Meta Connect keynote on Wednesday, the company announced that it’s rolling out a Horizon TV hub with access to streaming apps like Prime Video, Peacock, Twitch, and — finally — Disney Plus with Hulu and ESPN.The image shared by Meta shows content recommendations and streaming apps lined up on the homepage, along with tabs to switch between movies, TV shows, “immersive” experiences, sports, music, and your watchlist. It’s unclear whether the tabs will show content from all of these platforms, or just the ones you subscribe to.As part of the launch of Horizon TV, Meta is also partnering with Universal Pictures and Blumhouse, allowing you to watch movies like The Black Phone and M3GAN with 3D effects. Apple similarly partners with Disney to offer 3D movies on its Vision Pro headset.Horizon TV currently supports Dolby Atmos surround sound, but Meta plans on launching support for Dolby Vision later this year.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothDisneyCloseDisneyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All DisneyMetaCloseMetaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MetaNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsStreamingCloseStreamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All StreamingTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechVirtual RealityCloseVirtual RealityPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Virtual RealityMore in this streamSee allI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failureSean HollisterSep 19Meta is opening up its smart glasses to developersJay PetersSep 18A native Discord app is coming to Quest VR headsets.Jay PetersSep 18Most PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USThe foldable iPhone might look like two iPhone Airs stuck togetherThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
