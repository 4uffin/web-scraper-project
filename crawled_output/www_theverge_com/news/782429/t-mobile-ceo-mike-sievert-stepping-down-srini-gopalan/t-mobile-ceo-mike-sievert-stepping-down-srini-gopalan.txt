Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.T-Mobile is replacing Mike Sievert as CEO more than five years after he took on the role. The mobile carrier’s chief operating officer, Srini Gopalan, will become CEO on November 1st, while Sievert will become vice chairman.Sievert took over for the outspoken John Legere following T-Mobile’s merger with Sprint in 2020. While at the helm, Sievert has overseen many acquisitions, including T-Mobile’s purchase of Mint Mobile, which was partially owned by Ryan Reynolds, as well as its agreement to buy most of US Cellular. Earlier this year, the carrier axed its diversity, equity, and inclusivity policies to get FCC Chair Brendan Carr to approve an acquisition of the fiber brand Lumos.T-Mobile appointed Gopalan as COO in March 2025. Gopalan previously spent over eight years as a board member at Deutsche Telecom, and held executive positions at Vodafone and the Indian mobile telecom provider Bharti Airtel. In June, Sievert denied reports that he planned to step down from his role before the end of his contract in April 2028, though he admitted that T-Mobile hired Gopalan “with the idea of succession planning in mind.”Gopalan will help lead T-Mobile’s “strategic initiative to become the most data-driven, AI-enabled, digital-first company in the industry,” according to the press release. “Our culture and brand have made us the most admired and customer-centric company in our industry,” Gopalan says. “What lies ahead of us is even more exciting because over the last 5 years, we have built America’s best network together with digital and AI capabilities that are far ahead of anyone else in our industry.”0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothBusinessCloseBusinessPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All BusinessMobileCloseMobilePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MobileNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsT-MobileCloseT-MobilePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All T-MobileTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USThe foldable iPhone might look like two iPhone Airs stuck togetherThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
