The Xbox Series X will be priced at $649.99 in the US starting October 3rd, up from its existing $599.99 price. The Xbox Series S will move to $399.99, up from $379.99.Microsoft blames the price hikes on “changes in the macroeconomic environment,” which is a lot of words to say: tariffs. Xbox console pricing outside the US will remain the same. Thankfully, pricing for controllers and headsets will remain in the same in the US.The price rises mean Xbox Series S consoles will increase by $20, Xbox Series X consoles by $50, and the 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition Xbox Series X is increasing by $70 all the way up to $799.99.Here’s the full list of price increases in the US:ProductNew US price (RRP)Previous US price (RRP)Xbox Series S (512GB)$399.99$379.99Xbox Series S (1TB)$449.99$429.99Xbox Series X$649.99$599.99Xbox Series X Digital$599.99$549.99Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition$799.99$729.99Microsoft only just raised the prices of its Xbox products worldwide in May, with price hikes to the Xbox Series S / X consoles, controllers, and headsets. Those previous price increases already bumped the Xbox Series X up by $100, and the Xbox Series S by $80. Coupled with today’s announcement, that means the Xbox Series X has increased in price in the US by $150 and the Series S by $100 in just six months.Microsoft’s Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition originally debuted nearly a year ago at $599.99, and it’s now about to be $799.99 — a $200 increase in just a year. Microsoft’s latest price increases are the second this year, following initial price hikes in 2023.Microsoft also planned to hike the price of some of its first-party Xbox games to $80 this holiday, but then walked back those changes in July.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Tom WarrenCloseTom WarrenSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tom WarrenGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechXboxCloseXboxPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All XboxMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
