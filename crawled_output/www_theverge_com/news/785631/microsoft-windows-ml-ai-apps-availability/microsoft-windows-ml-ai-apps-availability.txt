In its announcement blog, Microsoft says Windows ML is supported on all devices running Windows 11 24H2 or newer, and provides a local AI inference framework that helps to build more “responsive, private, and cost-effective” AI experiences.“The way this works is silicon partners build and maintain execution providers that Windows ML distributes, manages, and registers to run AI workloads performantly on-device, serving as a hardware abstraction layer for developers and a way to get optimal performance for each specific silicon,” Microsoft says in the announcement. In simple terms, the platform enables AI-infused apps to tap into PC hardware that’s best suited for their specific workload, such as GPUs for power-intensive tasks, NPUs for power efficiency, and CPUs for flexibility.Windows ML has been in development for several years, having first been unveiled for Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system in 2018. Microsoft says that software developers, including Adobe, McAfee, and Topaz Labs are now working on adopting Windows ML in their upcoming releases after helping to test the platform during its development.The upcoming integration for Adobe’s Premiere Pro and After Effects video editing software will harness local NPUs for semantic search, audio tagging, and scene edit detection features. McAfee is also using Windows ML to automatically detect deepfake videos and scams on social networks, and Topaz Labs utilized the platform to develop AI-powered image editing features in Topaz Photo. With Windows ML streamlining AI development in Windows-based apps, Microsoft is hoping for an influx of similar AI experiences that can entice more consumers to its operating system.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWindowsCloseWindowsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WindowsMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunOpenAI really, really wants you to start your day with ChatGPT PulseThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
