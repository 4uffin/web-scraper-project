Compared to other desktop network attached storage (NAS) solutions from companies like Synology and Ugreen, Ubiquiti’s UNAS 2 and UNAS 4 look more like sleek wireless routers than storage solutions stuffed full of hard drives and SSDs.The entry-level UNAS 2 is now available in a black or white finish for $199 and accommodates a pair of 3.5-inch hard drives in a RAID 1 configuration. To achieve the minimal design, the drives are inserted using an access panel on the underside of the NAS which includes a sliding locking mechanism to ensure they don’t fall out while it’s standing upright. There’s a 5 Gbps USB-C port on the front for attaching additional external storage, but otherwise the UNAS 2 requires just a single ethernet cable connected to a device like a switch that supports power over ethernet (POE) delivery. If your setup is lacking one, the UNAS 2 comes with a 60W POE adapter.Hard drives are inserted into the underside of the UNAS 2 with a locking access panel. Image: UbiquitiThe UNAS 2 also includes a 1.45-inch screen on the front showing real-time performance and storage metrics, but if you need even more networked storage sitting on your desk, the UNAS 4 may be a better fit if you don’t mind sacrificing a bit more space. It’s expected to ship later this year for $379 and while it features a similar design and functionality as the UNAS 2, it’s much larger and can accommodate up to four 2.5-inch or 3.5-inch hard drives plus a pair of M.2 NVMe SSD drives. Although Ubiquiti’s rack-mounted NAS solutions offer more capacity and RAID options, the company hasn’t yet shared what RAID configurations the UNAS 4 will support, or if like the UNAS 2 it will be limited to RAID 1.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
