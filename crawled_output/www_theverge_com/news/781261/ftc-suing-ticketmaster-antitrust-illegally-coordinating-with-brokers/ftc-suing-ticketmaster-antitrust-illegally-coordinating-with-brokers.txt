The Federal Trade Commission is accusing Ticketmaster (which owns Live Nation) of allowing ticket brokers to illegally exceed limits on purchases and then profiting off the inflated resale value. Customers often pay significantly more than the face value because resellers have snatched up all the tickets. And when a ticket is resold through Ticketmaster’s site, it takes a cut, essentially profiting off the same ticket twice. The FTC even alleges that company leadership turns “a blind eye as a matter of policy” when dealing with brokers. The agency also says that Ticketmaster routinely uses deceptive practices when advertising prices, which are often much higher at checkout.With Ticketmaster controlling roughly 80-percent of primary ticket sales in the US, fans and artists are often left with little recourse. Ticketmaster often blames the technological hurdles of trying to rein in scalpers, but the FTC doesn’t seem to be buying that excuse one bit. In the complaint it rebukes those claims saying:Defendants blame a technological “arms race” and ticket scalping for shutting fans out of artist-priced primary market tickets, but in reality, Defendants’ own conduct gives purchasing consumers no choice but to resort to purchasing tickets at a steep markup in the resale market, where Defendants can collect another round of fees on the same tickets.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Terrence O'BrienCloseTerrence O'BrienWeekend EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Terrence O'BrienAntitrustCloseAntitrustPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AntitrustNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyMore in this streamSee allA live entertainment CEO was indicted over an alleged bid rigging scheme.Lauren FeinerJul 9The UK’s antitrust watchdog is investigating Ticketmaster over its Oasis sales.Emma RothSep 5, 2024Oasis ticketing chaos prompts probe into dynamic pricingJess WeatherbedSep 2, 2024Most PopularMost PopularNest is dead, long live Google HomeI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failureFirst look at the Google Home app powered by GeminiAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
