He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.We know officially that Samsung is planning to launch its first trifold phone this year, and recent rumors suggest that might mean either this month or next. Just don’t expect it to appear at this week’s Unpacked event, which promises products ranging from “premium AI tablets to the newest member of the Galaxy S25 family.”Korea’s ET News reports today that the new foldable could be unveiled as early as this month, with the phone actually on sale in November. That launch sounds pretty limited though: apparently only 50,000 units, a far cry from the millions of preorders Huawei claims to have received for its first foldable, last year’s Mate XT. It’s ready to launch its second generation, the Mate XTs, this Thursday.Other sources have claimed we might see the launch a little earlier. Another Korean site, Newsworks, expects an Unpacked on September 29th to reveal Samsung’s upcoming Project Moohan XR headset, and leaker Ice Universe claims we’ll see the trifold there too, along with a pair of AR glasses. I’d take all these dates with a pinch of salt for now, but it looks increasingly likely that we won’t have too long to wait to find out more.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Dominic PrestonCloseDominic PrestonNews EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Dominic PrestonFoldable PhonesCloseFoldable PhonesPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Foldable PhonesGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsMobileCloseMobilePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MobileNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPhonesClosePhonesPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PhonesSamsungCloseSamsungPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SamsungTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USAnker’s latest sleep buds can silence snoringWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankRepublicans’ political purge is just getting startedThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
