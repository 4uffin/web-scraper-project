The LG Easy TV features a simplified home screen with a larger font and a smaller selection of apps that cater to seniors. The TV offers picture and sound adjustments tailored to older users with enhanced brightness and voice quality and a built-in camera for making video calls with family. It can also be programmed with pop-ups that remind users to take medications or simply water the plants.The LG Easy TV is initially launching in South Korea and is based on the LG QNED Evo QNED85A Mini LED 4K Smart TV. It will be available in a 65-inch version for 2,769,000 won (around $1,965) and a 75-inch version for 3,869,000 won (around $2,746). The company eventually plans to bring the Easy TV to other markets with “rapidly aging demographics” including the US, according to Notebookcheck, but there’s no specific timeline yet.The Easy TV’s remote features a larger font and a simplified design, but it still includes a lot of buttons. Image: LGCaregivers who’ve gone so far as to tape over buttons on a TV remote to make them easier for parents or grandparents to navigate will appreciate that LG has also completely redesigned the Easy TV’s remote, but it could have simplified it even further.The remote uses a larger font and features both a “Help” button that can be used to contact family members during an emergency or simply return users to what they were last watching should they switch inputs by accident, and an AI button seniors can use to search for things using their voice. The remote still includes a lot of buttons, however, and far more than companies like Roku, Google, and Apple use on theirs. As someone who frequently accidentally opens streaming platforms he doesn’t subscribe to using their dedicated remote buttons, getting rid of those seems like an easy way to simplify this remote even further.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsLGCloseLGPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All LGNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechTVsCloseTVsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TVsMost PopularMost PopularLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
