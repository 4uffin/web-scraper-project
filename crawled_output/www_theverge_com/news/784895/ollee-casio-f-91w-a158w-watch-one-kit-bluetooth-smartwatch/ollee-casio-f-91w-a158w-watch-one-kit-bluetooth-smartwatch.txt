Image: Ollee WatchAndrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew Liszewski is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.For the first time since it launched 36 years ago, the iconic Casio F-91W digital watch is getting some smart upgrades — but not from Casio. The Ollee Watch One is a replacement mainboard for the Casio F-91W, A158W, and several other watch models that can be installed without the need for a soldering iron or any electronics know-how aside from being able to remove a few screws and clips. It doesn’t upgrade Casio’s timepieces to the point where they’re on-par with the Apple Watch, but it does add Bluetooth and app connectivity so the watch can set the time automatically, track step counts, play games, and be more personalized using an improved color-changing backlight.The DIY version of the Ollee Watch one, which requires you to already have one of six different supported Casio watch models (including the F-84W, A159W, A171W, and W-59) is available now for $54.99. If you’re not confident in tackling the upgrade yourself, which appears to take around six minutes, the company also sells the Casio F-91W-1 and A158W-1 preinstalled with the upgrade for $99.99, but it’s currently sold out.The upgraded mainboard includes an accelerometer for step counting and an upgraded audio buzzer that will alert you when you’ve reached a goal you set using an accompanying iOS and Android mobile app. The upgrade also adds a temperature sensor, an improved LED backlight that lets you adjust the color or use your watch as a flashlight, world time functionality, and the option to create five timer presets.The Ollee Watch One upgrade includes a simple ball-bouncing game called Ping. Image: OlleeThere’s no notifications, and while the Ollie Watch One does include alternate watch faces, it doesn’t upgrade the basic segmented screen that Casio includes. That being said, even with those screen limitations you can play a simplified version of Blackjack or a game called Ping that has you controlling a paddle to keep a bouncing ball up in the air. Battery life isn’t quite as impressive as the seven years Casio claims for an unmodified F91W-1, but thanks to its use of Bluetooth low energy the upgrade kit only reduces battery life to about 10 months on a CR2016 battery.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsSmartwatchCloseSmartwatchPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SmartwatchWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunOpenAI really, really wants you to start your day with ChatGPT PulseThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
