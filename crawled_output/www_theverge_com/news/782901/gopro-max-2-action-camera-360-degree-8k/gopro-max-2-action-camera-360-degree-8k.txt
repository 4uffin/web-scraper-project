Image: GoProAndrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew Liszewski is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.It’s been nearly six years since GoPro launched its Max 360-degree camera. The original was only slightly larger than the company’s iconic action cameras and while the new Max2 is a bit taller, thicker, and 36 grams heavier than its predecessor, its 360-degree video capabilities have been improved from 5.6K / 30fps to 8K / 30fps, and it now allows single-lens, 180-degree videos to be captured at up to 4K / 60fps.The company had previously confirmed that it was working on a new version of its 360-degree action camera as far back as 2023, and after sharing promotional images of the Max2 on Instagram in July, GoPro says it will finally be available starting on September 30th for $499.95. That’s nearly the exact same price as the original Max, which will potentially make it a tempting alternative to competitors’ 8K-capable 360-degree cameras, including the DJI Osmo 360 and Insta360 X5, which both start at $549.99.RelatedGoPro put a light on its Hero action camera to illuminate your adventuresGoPro’s new AI gimbal works with action cameras, point-and-shoots, and phonesThe Max2 features a slightly larger 1.82-inch LCD touchscreen on one side. Image: GoProThe Max2 can’t quite match the capabilities of the Osmo 360 that DJI says can capture 8K videos at up to 50fps, but GoPro insists its new 360-degree camera captures “true 8K” because, according to the company, it doesn’t count overlapping or unusable pixels captured between its two lenses, resulting in 16 to 21 percent more usable resolution than competitors’ offerings. That’s important because while 360-degree cameras were once popular for the novelty of being able to look around while watching a video, they’re now more useful as a camera that can record all the action going on around you with enough resolution to extract high-quality flat videos that can be easily shared and viewed online.The Max2 supports Bluetooth microphones, letting you use even wireless earbuds to record audio. Image: GoProThe Max2 carries forward a lot of features of the original, including a six microphone array with wind noise reduction that captures sounds in all directions, GPS, waterproofing to a depth of 16 feet, and an LCD touchscreen on one side that’s now 10 percent larger at 1.82 inches. Upgrades include the addition of support for Bluetooth microphones so you can use your wireless earbuds to record audio, 13 different voice command controls that can be used in 11 languages, and a larger 1,960mAh removable battery. On a full charge, the Max2 can capture 8K / 30fps footage for up to 66 minutes, which can be boosted to 90 minutes by dropping the resolution to 5.6K / 30fps.One of the most interesting features of the Insta360 X5 when it launched last April was swappable lenses, but the GoPro Max2 now offers that functionality, too. Its lenses are made from “strong optical glass with a water-repelling coating” and, should they get cracked or scratched, they can be removed and replaced without tools by simply twisting them off and on.Footage from the Max2 can be edited on your smartphone using the GoPro Quik app. You can export videos that focus on a specific object or person using AI-powered tracking or you can choose your framing by just watching the 360-degree video and moving your phone around in real time. It’s designed to be consumer-friendly, but the Max2 is also compatible with the GoPro Labs beta program, which provides optional firmware updates that unlock advanced features like higher bitrates and on-screen histograms for pro users.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiCamerasCloseCamerasPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All CamerasGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
