It’s available now in 41mm and 45mm models and starts at $549.99 which is $100 more expensive than the Venu 3.Following the Venu 3’s introduction of nap tracking the Venu 4 is expanding its sleep tracking by keeping tabs on how consistent your bedtime over the past seven days has been. It can track when health metrics like heart rate, skin temperature, and respiration are outside their typical range while you sleep, potentially indicating elevated stress levels or illness. The Venu 4 can also log lifestyle behaviors like caffeine and alcohol consumption and provide insights into how they may be affecting your sleep and heart rate.Instead of maximizing the brightness of its 1.2-inch OLED screen, the Venu 4 includes an LED flashlight on top to help you see in the dark.

Accessibility is being further expanded with the Venu 4, letting it read aloud the time and health data displayed on its watch face. Color filters have also been added, including grayscale, red/green, green/red, and blue/yellow options, to improve the readability of the Venu 4’s screen for users with color blindness.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiFitnessCloseFitnessPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All FitnessGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsSmartwatchCloseSmartwatchPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SmartwatchWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMost PopularMost PopularNest is dead, long live Google HomeI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failureFirst look at the Google Home app powered by GeminiAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
