He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined The Verge in May 2025.Apple just wrapped its extensive fall hardware keynote, which featured the marquee announcement of the thin iPhone Air, along with other iPhone 17 models, a suite of new Apple Watch wearables, and the new AirPods Pro 3 — phew, that was a lot. All of Apple’s new tech is releasing on September 19th.In case you missed out on the event as it happened, don’t worry; we’ve included all of the biggest announcements and moments from Apple’s keynote below.Air comes to the iPhoneThe biggest announcement of the event was Apple’s iPhone Air, its thinnest model ever. Previously, the Air moniker was limited to laptops and iPads, but it’s now a thing for its phones, too. The iPhone Air is 5.6mm thick, with a 6.5-inch ProMotion display and a camera bump — “plateau,” sorry — that spans nearly the entire width of the device.Most of the iPhone Air’s hardware seems to be contained in the camera bump, leaving the rest of the slim body available for a battery. It runs on the A19 Pro chip, which Apple claims can deliver MacBook Pro levels of processing power, and which is also in the iPhone 17 Pro.The iPhone Air includes a few firsts for Apple. It features the N1 chip, which controls wireless connectivity (it’ll feature Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread). It also has the C1X modem, which Apples says is two times faster than the last-gen modem found in the iPhone 16e.Image: AppleThe single-lens camera system utilizes Apple’s Fusion camera, which pulls double duty as an ultrawide lens and a 2x telephoto lens with f/1.6 aperture. Its front-facing selfie cam features Center Stage, borrowed from Apple’s laptops and iPads, to keep you centered in the frame. Center Stage aims to make it so you don’t need to rotate your phone to get a wider shot; the phone will automatically take multiple photos, letting you choose the crop you want. The iPhone Air features simultaneous video recording from the front and rear cameras.The iPhone Air starts at $999 for a 256GB model and will launch September 19th.RelatediPhone Air hands-onThere are iPhone Air accessories, tooWhile Apple touted that the iPhone Air will feature all-day battery life, it debuted a MagSafe battery for the new phone that’ll allow up to 40 hours of battery life. And in case you’re living in a constant state of fear that you’ll drop your pricey iPhone Air, Apple is selling a slim, translucent case as well as a bumper case. There’s also a crossbody strap if you want to wear your iPhone Air at the hip.A photo of Apple’s translucent case for the iPhone Air. Image: AppleThe iPhone 17 has ProMotion, finally, and starts with 256GB of storageApple’s baseline iPhone for 2025 features ProMotion, allowing its 6.3-inch OLED to go up to 120Hz for high-refresh-rate content. We’ve been waiting a long time for an affordable iPhone that goes beyond 60Hz, and it’s finally here.The iPhone 17 has Apple’s A19 chip, which is tuned for performance and efficiency. Apple claims that this chip’s GPU is 20 percent faster than the A18, and 90 percent faster than the A15 Bionic in the iPhone 14. This should make playing games more enjoyable.The iPhone 17 looks similar to the last-gen model, but there are plenty of enhancements sandwiched in. Its dual camera system, for example, includes a 48-megapixel fusion ultrawide main camera with f/1.6 aperture that can double as a macro lens. Its main 48-megapixel lens can act as a 2x 12-megapixel telephoto lens for “optical-quality” images.Like the other iPhones announced today, the iPhone 17 features a Center Stage selfie cam. No more having to rotate the phone for a wider shot, which will hopefully make it a lot easier — and faster — to snap a great pic.Image: AppleThe iPhone 17 Pro is more pro than ever, but different than beforeThe new iPhone 17 Pro has a similar camera plateau to the Air, as well as the powerful A19 Pro chip. It also has the company’s durable Ceramic Shield on both its front and back. It’s available in both 6.3-inch Pro and 6.9-inch Pro Max models.What’s unique to the Pro compared to the other iPhones announced today is its three-camera system. All three cameras are 48-megapixel lenses, but each tackles a different niche. One is an ultrawide with macro support, one is a main lens, and one is an 8x telephoto lens. As with the Air, the Pro supports Center Stage selfie capabilities to keep the subject centered and deliver multiple crops with one shot. It also supports simultaneous recording through its front and rear main cameras.The iPhone Pro 17 has a sleek two-toned unibody design that we haven’t seen Apple attempt before. More on that change: This year’s Pro is made of aluminum, not titanium. Apple says its new anodized aluminum unibody can dissipate heat 20 times greater than its previous titanium design. Internally, it features a vapor chamber, which pulls heat away from the chipset. The Pro also includes what Apple calls its biggest battery ever in an iPhone.There are some accessories coming for the iPhone 17 Pro, including TechWoven cases, translucent cases, and a crossbody strap.The iPhone 17 Pro starts at $1,099 for a 256GB version, with up to 2TB of storage supported in the iPhone 17 Pro Max. That version will cost a cool $1,999.RelatedOur first look at the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro MaxThe Apple Watch Series 11 leads the charge as its first 5G smartwatchThe Apple Watch Series 11 is coming on September 19th, and unlike the design overhaul introduced with last year’s Series 10, all of the upgrades for this year’s new model are internal (aside from the new space gray color for the aluminum model, and a new slate gray for the titanium).The Series 11, like the rest of this year’s Watch lineup, has 5G connectivity and will have live translation capabilities.Apple’s flagship smartwatch will also introduce hypertension notifications, for which it expects to receive clearance from the FDA (the Series 9 and 10 will support this, too). The Series 11 can last up to 24 hours per charge.The Series 11 will start at $399 for the 42mm version (more for the 5G-capable version), and it’s available to preorder now. It’ll launch on September 19th.RelatedHands-on with all the new Apple Watches: Series 11, Ultra 3, and SE 3The Apple Watch Ultra 3 includes Apple’s “largest display ever” in a wearableThe Apple Watch Ultra 3 isn’t too different in appearance from the Ultra 2, though it contains Apple’s largest display ever in an Apple Watch. That display can go down to 1Hz refresh rate, letting the always-on display show every second that’s ticking by. The Ultra 3 also supports 5G connectivity, plus the ability to text via satellite communication when you’re off the grid. Its battery has been enhanced to last for up to 42 hours per charge. The hypertension notifications that were detailed for the Series 11 will work on the Ultra 3, as well as the Ultra 2, pending FDA clearance.This model will start at $799.Image: AppleThere’s an Apple Watch SE 3 for those who want something less expensiveThe Apple Watch SE has gotten its first new hardware update since 2022. The third-gen SE features the S10 chip, up from the S8 chipset, with 5G support like its pricier counterparts, as well as an always-on display for the first time.Other new, notable features coming in this generation include temperature sensors, which can be used for ovulation tracking. You can also play music and other audio from its built-in speaker, which was a feature we wished was in the last-gen model.The SE 3 is launching at $249.Image: AppleApple debuted AirPods Pro 3 with better ANC and live translationDon’t count them out just because they look nearly identical to the last-gen model. The new $249 AirPods Pro 3 earbuds boast several improvements, big and small. They feature Apple’s smallest-ever heart rate sensor, letting you track some vitals without having to wear an Apple Watch. Durability has gotten an upgrade, too, with an IP57 rating.The AirPods Pro 3 also include a live translation feature that’s enabled when you hold both stems simultaneously. You’ll hear audio translated in-ear, while your voice is translated live, with transcriptions displayed on your iPhone so you can communicate with others.Apple claims that this model has significant enhancements to active noise cancellation. They’re supposedly four times better than the original AirPods Pro, and two times better than the last-gen model. Sound has gotten a boost, too — particularly bass. There’s a new vent on each earbud that lets air move for better bass performance. This model ships with five different ear tips to give you a better chance of finding a good fit.The AirPods Pro 3 ship September 19th and are available to preorder today.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Cameron FaulknerCloseCameron FaulknerEditor, CommercePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Cameron FaulknerAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleApple EventCloseApple EventPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Apple EventGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsiPhoneCloseiPhonePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All iPhoneSmartwatchCloseSmartwatchPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SmartwatchTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMost PopularMost PopularSpotify Lossless is an inconvenient improvementThe iPhone to get this yearPhone batteries are getting more compact, but the US is missing outThe Helldivers community is coping with a spotlight it doesn’t wantWhat’s next for Apple after the iPhone 17?The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
