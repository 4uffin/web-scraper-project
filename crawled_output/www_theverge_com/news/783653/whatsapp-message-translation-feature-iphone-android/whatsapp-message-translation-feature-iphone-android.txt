Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.A new translation feature for WhatsApp on iPhone and Android that translates messages into your preferred language is rolling out “gradually,” starting today in 1:1 chats, groups, and Channel update messages. It can be activated by long-pressing down on messages and tapping the “Translate” option to choose the language you want the message to be translated from or to.Support for English, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, and Arabic will initially be available for Android users, while iPhone users can translate messages into more than 19 languages at launch. Android users can also enable automatic translation for entire chat threads to apply the feature to all incoming messages.It’s no real-time translation in your ears, in front of your eyes, or on your screen, and other messaging apps have also offered similar features (Google used WhatsApp to demonstrate “Tap to translate” on Android nearly a decade ago). But for WhatsApp’s billions of users, it could make conversations easier as they move throughout the world. WhatsApp says it plans to expand translation support for additional languages in the future.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedAppsCloseAppsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppsMetaCloseMetaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MetaNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Logitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersYou can now upgrade a retro Casio watch with Bluetooth, step tracking, and gamesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
