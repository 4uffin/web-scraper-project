Di Benedetto is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.Avenir Telecom is making a line of new Energizer-branded laptops aimed at marathon battery life. There are three productivity-focused models: the Energizer EnergyBook Pro 15, EnergyBook Pro XL 18, and flagship Energizer EnergyBook Pro Ultra. The Pro Ultra sports a giant 18-inch display with a meager 1920 x 1200 resolution and an absolutely massive 192Wh battery.It’s listed as including an AMD Ryzen 5 processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and 512GB NVMe SSD. Ports include USB-C, USB 3.0, HDMI, SD card reader, and a headphone jack. There isn’t much more info at this time, except a price of €449 ($523). That’s likely a starting price for one of the smaller models. We’ve reached out to Avenir Telecom for more details.Image: Avenir TelecomBut let’s get back to that big 192Wh battery, claiming to get up to 28 hours of “intensive office use” or seven days of standby time. That ain’t gonna fly. Literally.RelatedNow there’s a 28,000mAh battery with a phone in itThe FAA does not allow passengers to take a lithium battery greater than 160Wh on a plane, and even one above 100Wh requires air carrier approval. It’s why most big laptops top out at 100Wh. The Canadian Air Transport Security Authority has some exceptions for large batteries meant for wheelchairs and mobility aids, but they’re supposed to be outside the device. Perhaps the Energizer is strictly a road trip laptop?Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Antonio G.
