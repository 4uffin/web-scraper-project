The K1 is available now for $79, and TCL says it will operate for up to 12 months on a set of four AAA batteries that also squeeze inside the interior side knob.None of the unlocking methods built into the K1 are new as far as smart locks go, but the K1 is one of the first to give you four different methods in a door knob replacement. The fingerprint sensor is supposed to unlock the door in less than a second with a simple finger tap, and the K1 can store and recognize up to 100 different fingerprints so multiple people can unlock it using multiple fingers. The door knob can also be unlocked with a key, a PIN including one-time use codes, or wirelessly using TCL’s mobile app. There’s no broader smart home support, so you can’t unlock the door using voice commands through a smart assistant, but the mobile app can track users and even set schedules for when the door knob automatically locks or opens.TCL says the K1 can run for up to 12 months on four AAA batteries which are housed inside the interior door knob.

The smart door knob is also IP53-rated against dust and water so could also install it on a backyard shed door and not worry about it being exposed to the elements.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsSmart HomeCloseSmart HomePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Smart HomeTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USAnker’s latest sleep buds can silence snoringWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankRepublicans’ political purge is just getting startedThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
