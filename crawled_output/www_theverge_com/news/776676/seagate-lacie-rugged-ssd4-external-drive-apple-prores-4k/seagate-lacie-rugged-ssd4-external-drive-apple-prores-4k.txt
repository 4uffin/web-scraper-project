Today, Seagate announced an updated version of the LaCie Rugged Mini SSD with a few small design tweaks and a big boost to transfer speeds.The drive is now called the LaCie Rugged SSD4 and is available starting today in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities (Seagate is dropping the 500MB option) for $134.99, $249.99, and $479.99, respectively.The new Rugged SSD4 introduces a few small design tweaks including a brushed aluminum finish. Image: SeagateThe Rugged SSD4 is exactly the same size as its predecessor but now features a brushed aluminum finish and a centered USB-C port. It now supports transfer speeds up to 40Gbps with 4,000MB/s read speeds and 3,800MB/s write speeds. Seagate’s older Rugged Mini SSD had a USB-C port that was slightly off-center, a smoother aluminum finish, and read speeds that maxed out at 2,000MB/s.The new drive isn’t quite as fast as the LaCie Rugged SSD Pro5 that was introduced earlier this year at CES with 6,700MB/s read and 5,300MB/s write speeds, but when it’s connected to a USB-C iPhone, the Rugged SSD4 is fast enough to capture ProRes 4K footage at 120fps.As with the previous version, the new Rugged SSD4 has an IP54 rating against dust and water, but it’s definitely not waterproof so while splashes are okay, a complete dunking would not be. Its orange bumper also protects it from drops as high as nearly 10 feet, but that’s definitely not an invitation to casually toss it around.Update, September 16th: LaCie originally said the Rugged SSD4 offered read speeds up to 3,000MB/s, but later clarified the drive’s read speeds are up to 3,800MB/s.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiDesignCloseDesignPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All DesignGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USThe foldable iPhone might look like two iPhone Airs stuck togetherThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
