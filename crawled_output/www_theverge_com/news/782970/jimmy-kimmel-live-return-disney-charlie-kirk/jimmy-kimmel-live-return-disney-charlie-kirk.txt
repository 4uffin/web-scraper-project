Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talk show is returning on Tuesday after Disney pulled it off the air over comments made about the assassination of Charlie Kirk. In a statement on Monday, Disney said it planned to resume production after having “thoughtful conversations” with Kimmel.“Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” Disney said. “It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.” The original decision was made shortly after Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr threatened the operating licenses of broadcast stations that aired Kimmel’s show, a move that put ABC under pressure from major broadcasting companies Nexstar and Sinclair, both of which said they would no longer transmit Kimmel’s show.Even with Jimmy Kimmel Live! returning to its normal schedule, it’s still not clear whether all ABC affiliates will air it. The Verge reached out to Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar for more information but didn’t immediately hear back.During the episode that got Jimmy Kimmel Live! pulled off the airwaves, Kimmel remarked that “we hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.” Carr claimed the statement violated broadcasters’ mandate to act in the “public interest” and said they could handle Kimmel “the easy way or the hard way” — the latter with the FCC involved.RelatedThis is part of Disney’s legacy nowYes, Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension was government censorshipThe decision to suspend Kimmel’s talk show sparked outrage among Democratic lawmakers, free speech advocates, and hundreds of celebrities who signed a letter in support of Kimmel, calling the situation a “dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.” The FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it would retaliate against Disney, ABC, or broadcasters that put Kimmel’s show back on the air.“I am glad to see Disney find its courage in the face of clear government intimidation,” Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez said in response to the decision. “It will continue to be up to us as citizens to push back against this Administration’s growing campaign of censorship and control.”Update, September 22nd: Added a statement from Gomez.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyPoliticsClosePoliticsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PoliticsSpeechCloseSpeechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SpeechMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USThe foldable iPhone might look like two iPhone Airs stuck togetherThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
