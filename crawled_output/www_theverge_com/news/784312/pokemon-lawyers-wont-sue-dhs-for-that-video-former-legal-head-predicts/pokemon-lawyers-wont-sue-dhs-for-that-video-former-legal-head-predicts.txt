He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.Yesterday afternoon, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) posted a piece of disgusting propaganda that glorifies the concept of a militarized police state forcefully entering people’s homes and businesses and leading them away in handcuffs and zip ties — all set to the classic Pokémon theme song and using numerous pieces of obviously copyrighted imagery from the ‘90s TV show.There’s no chance The Pokémon Company, notorious for protecting their family-friendly reputation and profits with legal action, would let that fly, right?Don’t hold your breath: The Pokémon Company’s former chief legal officer Don McGowan (who spent nearly 12 years there, as well as multi-year stints at Bungie and Microsoft) thinks there’s no way that his former company would sue.”Even if I was still at the company I wouldn’t touch this, and I’m the most trigger-happy CLO [Chief Legal Officer] I’ve ever met. This will blow over in a couple of days and they’ll be happy to let it,” he told IGN.Why? One reason is that like some other executives Trump has previously and corruptly leveraged, some of The Pokémon Company’s leaders personally depend on the US’s good graces: “Many of their execs in the USA are on green cards,” he said. Another reason, he says, is that The Pokémon Company doesn’t want the press.More at IGN, and you can read a previous interview with McGowan at Aftermath.As Kotaku points out, the DHS video may be showing off raids against significant criminals, but ICE is currently under fire for snatching up US citizens. The Supreme Court also recently cleared the way for ICE to stop people based on the color of their skin, the jobs they perform, and the language they speak.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Sean HollisterCloseSean HollisterSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Sean HollisterGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsNintendoCloseNintendoPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NintendoPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
