It can also provide summaries of what a specific participant said, identify important decisions and action items, and generate a summary of what you missed when joining a meeting late, but only when Google Meet’s Take Notes for Me feature has been activated by the host.Ask Gemini’s responses are kept private to every participant and, alongside other meeting data like captions, they’re not stored after a Google Meet call ends. Every participant will also see when Ask Gemini is enabled during a call and while it’s turned on by default, the hosts can disable it at any time, and admins can switch the default to starting meetings with it off.Google Meet will disclose to participants when Ask Gemini is turned on. Image: GoogleAsk Gemini in Meet is only available on the desktop for now, and it only works during meetings held in English. Google says support for additional languages is coming soon. Over the coming weeks it’s being rolled out to Google Workspace Enterprise Plus, Enterprise (Standard), Business Plus, and Business Standard customers first. In Q1 of 2026, Google plans to also make it available to Workspace Business Starter, Enterprise Standard, and Enterprise Plus customers once the company has “collected and applied critical user feedback to improve the feature.”Google cautions that “Gemini in Workspace can make mistakes, including about people, so users should review its output.” Using it to catch up on missed parts of a meeting is useful, but it’s potentially worth your time to go back and review those parts yourself after it’s over.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple iPhone Air review: statement pieceVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoRepublicans are honoring Charlie Kirk’s memory by declaring war on the First AmendmentThe iPhone 17 is the one to get this yearThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
