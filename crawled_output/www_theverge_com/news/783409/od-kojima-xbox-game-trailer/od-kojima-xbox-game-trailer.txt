We’re now getting a better look at exactly what OD is, in a new three-minute teaser trailer that holds true to Kojima’s promise that the game will be unique and immersive.The trailer begins with Sophia Lillis’ character opening a red door, and then lighting candles — some of which look like Death Stranding babies. With rain pouring down outside and mysterious knocking sounds, it’s clear OD will very much lean into horror for its gameplay as Lillis’ character shakes in fear.The trailer also shows off some of the early Unreal Engine work that Kojima Productions is undertaking for OD, alongside Microsoft’s assistance. Xbox chief Phil Spencer confirmed on stage at Kojima Productions’ 10th Anniversary livestream that development of the game is “well underway,” and that Microsoft is helping with the visuals and technical work.“OD is bold, it’s unique, and it’s unmistakably from this studio,“ says Spencer. ”We’re deeply supporting the production, it’s our technical work on Unreal that we’re doing with the team, both with the flashy [elements] you see on the screen, but also a lot of the behind the scenes work.”OD is subtitled knock in the teaser trailer. Image: Kojima ProductionsOD is billed as something of a cross between a game and a movie, with a promise of exploring concepts that test “your fear threshold.” Unreal Engine will drive the experience of OD, instead of the Sony-owned Decima engine that powers both Death Stranding titles. Kojima had high praise for Unreal Engine at the 10th anniversary event, saying “the technology is one step higher than Death Stranding 2.”While we know Jordan Peele is somehow involved in OD, Kojima did note today that the filmmaker is working on another part of the overall OD experience. That might be why the game is subtitled OD Knock, to differentiate it from whatever Peele is working on.We still don’t know exactly when OD will arrive, despite promises that development is well underway. “Kojima is innovating in gameplay, story, and player engagement,” says Spencer. “We’re collaborating closely, and we’re very excited for what’s next.”0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Tom WarrenCloseTom WarrenSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tom WarrenEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechXboxCloseXboxPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All XboxMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
