It will be available starting on TCL’s new QM9K series TVs — which were announced earlier this month but are launching today — and come to other TVs and streaming boxes running Google TV later this year. It will carry forward the same basic commands that Google Assistant has offered for years, such as playing a specific show when asked. But Gemini on Google TV will also let you have “free-flowing conversations” with the AI-powered assistant, so you can find shows based on specific details or vague descriptions or request a recap if you’re a few episodes behind on a series you’re watching.In a blog post announcing today’s Gemini expansion, Google suggests asking the assistant for TV show recommendations with prompts that include everyone’s genre preferences or for suggestions based on what shows are currently trending. But Gemini on Google TV isn’t limited to being a tool for finding something to watch. After activating it by saying “Hey Google” or pressing the mic button on your TV remote, you can ask broader questions like “why do volcanoes erupt” or “what’s a dessert I can make in less than an hour?” Gemini will provide text responses that are read aloud, along with suggestions for related YouTube videos.You can ask Gemini on Google TV for more than just TV show recommendations.

It won’t be the only AI assistant on the market: at CES 2025, both Samsung and LG announced they would be bringing Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant to new models of their smart TVs that are debuting this year.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechTVsCloseTVsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TVsMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
