While the initial preview was limited to certain markets, Microsoft says today’s release has “regional support everywhere except mainland China.” Microsoft is also bringing its Gaming Copilot to the Xbox mobile app next month.“Starting today, PC players will begin seeing Gaming Copilot integrated directly into their Game Bar experience as the feature rolls out gradually over the next few weeks,” says Taylor O’Malley, principal program manager at Xbox. “It will then come to the Xbox mobile app on Apple and Android next month, where players will be able to access this personalized companion via a second screen without distracting from their gameplay.”The Gaming Copilot will appear as a widget inside Windows’ Game Bar feature. Image: MicrosoftThe Gaming Copilot will be available as a widget inside the Game Bar on Windows 11, and it includes a voice mode so you can talk to the AI assistant without having to alt + tab out of a game. It will even use screenshots of a game to help answer questions, so you could ask Copilot about a boss in a game without having to describe it.You’ll also be able to use the Gaming Copilot to get game recommendations, see a list of your recent Xbox achievements, and more. Microsoft is also planning to optimize this Gaming Copilot for its upcoming Xbox Ally handheld devices, with a promise of also bringing this AI-powered experience to Xbox consoles “in the near future.”In the long term, Microsoft wants the Gaming Copilot to turn into an AI gaming coach. The company is positioning this initial effort as a sidekick of sorts, there to accompany you through games and offer up tips. Microsoft has also previously demonstrated using the Gaming Copilot with Overwatch 2, letting it recommend good hero picks to complement the rest of the team.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Tom WarrenCloseTom WarrenSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tom WarrenAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWindowsCloseWindowsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WindowsXboxCloseXboxPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All XboxMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USThe foldable iPhone might look like two iPhone Airs stuck togetherThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
