The deal values TikTok’s US operations at $14 billion and puts it under the control of companies based in the US.“I spoke with President Xi [Jinping], we had a good talk,” Trump said during a briefing. “I told him what we were doing, and he said, ‘Go ahead with it.’”Under the deal, TikTok “will be majority-owned and controlled” by companies based in the US. The order states that TikTok’s US-based operations will have a new board of directors that will have to follow rules to protect American data and national security, while TikTok’s recommendation algorithm, code, and content moderation system in the US will come under the control of its new owners.CNBC’s David Faber says Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX, which is based in Abu Dhabi, will get a 45 percent stake in TikTok’s US company. Investors in TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance, will get 35 percent, according to CNBC.When asked whether TikTok’s algorithm will show MAGA-related content, Trump responded, “If I could make it 100 percent MAGA, I would. But it’s not going to work out that way, unfortunately.” Trump added that, “every group, every philosophy, every policy will be treated fairly.”Since coming into office, Trump has continued to push back the deadline for TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company as negotiations dragged on. Last Friday, President Donald Trump said he “made progress” on an agreement with China, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later stating that the administration is “100% confident that a deal is done.”Just one day before TikTok’s most recent ban enforcement deadline on September 16th, Trump announced that he would extend it a fourth time while the US continues working out a deal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent referenced a potential agreement ahead of the extension, telling reporters that the US and China have reached a “framework” deal, and Trump said that big companies were lined up to buy into it.Trump was the first to attempt a TikTok ban in 2020, and the idea gained bipartisan support under Biden, resulting in a 2024 divest-or-ban law. Critics of TikTok contended the app could be used for surveillance or propaganda by the Chinese government, rejecting anything short of a full sale. But Trump’s own stance softened, he said, in part due to his popularity on the app — and a potential backlash from young voters during the 2024 presidential election likely didn’t hurt. “Is it that important for China to be spying on young people?” he said in January 2025. “On young kids watching crazy videos?”Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothTina NguyenCloseTina NguyenSenior Reporter, WashingtonPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tina NguyenCreatorsCloseCreatorsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All CreatorsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyPoliticsClosePoliticsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PoliticsRegulationCloseRegulationPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All RegulationSecurityCloseSecurityPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SecuritySocial MediaCloseSocial MediaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Social MediaTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechTikTokCloseTikTokPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TikTokMore in this streamSee allSome details of the TikTok deal have been worked out.Terrence O'BrienSep 20Trump claims the US is about to get a tremendous fee for taking TikTok out of ChinaSean HollisterSep 19So… is there a TikTok deal or not?Adi RobertsonSep 19Most PopularMost PopularGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
