It’s DJI’s smallest action camera to date but features the same 1 / 1.3-inch sensor with 13.5 stops of dynamic range and 4K / 120fps recording capabilities as the company’s flagship Osmo Action 5 Pro DJI, which launched a year ago. As with competitor products like the Insta360 Go Ultra, you’ll need to pair the Osmo Nano with its included modular accessory, called the Multifunctional Vision Dock, if you want a screen or want to boost its battery life.Like other products that DJI introduced this year, including the Mini 5 Pro drone and the wireless Mic 3, the company isn’t planning to immediately release the Osmo Nano in the US. “The Osmo Nano will not be available officially in the U.S. market on official websites upon its global launch on September 23,” according to DJI spokesperson Daisy Kong. “DJI remains committed to the U.S. market and is optimizing our strategy to best serve our customers amidst evolving local conditions.”The Osmo Nano’s Multifunctional Vision Dock adds a touchscreen and extra battery life. Image: DJIIt’s launching today in other regions including Canada, where the Osmo Nano with 64GB of built-in storage starts at $309 USD, although that pricing doesn’t necessarily reflect how much it will cost in the US. In the UK, it will start at £239, while in France, Germany, and Spain it will be €279. A version with 128GB of storage is $339 USD, £259, and €309, respectively.The Nano camera can be attached to its dock in either direction so its OLED preview screen can be used to frame selfies or regular videos. Image: DJIThe Osmo Nano is much smaller than DJI’s previous attempt at miniaturizing its action camera. The square-shaped Action 2 launched in 2021 with a similar modular design but featured more accessories that could be magnetically attached to the camera to expand its functionality and battery life. The new Nano is pill-shaped, 57mm long, and weighs 52 grams, making it a full gram lighter than the Action 2 and the recently launched Insta360 Go Ultra. It’s also much lighter than the 146-gram Osmo Action 5 Pro — even with the touchscreen dock attached, which bumps the Osmo Nano’s total weight to 124 grams.Accessories for the Nano camera include a mount that can be attached to the visor of a hat or helmet. Image: DJIBattery life is rated at 55 to 60 minutes of 4K / 30fps recording, or up to 90 minutes of 1080p / 24fps recording. That increases to 125 to 135 minutes at 4K / 30fps while the Nano is connected to the dock, or up to 200 minutes at 1080p / 24fps. The Nano is waterproof to depths of up to 10 meters, but the dock, which can also function as a wireless remote with live video previews, has a limited IPX4 splash resistance rating.Two wireless microphones can be directly connected to the Nano without the need for a receiver, and for those times when you’re wearing gloves or don’t have the dexterity to hit a small button, you can start recording by gently patting the camera or simply nodding your head if you’re wearing it on a hat or helmet. There’s also a pre-record option that can save footage captured just before you start a recording, but that could come with an additional hit to battery life.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiCamerasCloseCamerasPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All CamerasGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
