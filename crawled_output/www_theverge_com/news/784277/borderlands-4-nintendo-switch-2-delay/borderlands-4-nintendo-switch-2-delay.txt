He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Gearbox Software is delaying the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4, which had been set to release on October 3rd, to give the game “additional development and polish time.” The studio will provide new release timing “once we’ve fully adjusted our plans” and all digital preorders will be canceled.“We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans,” Gearbox says. Gearbox’s “hope” is to align the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 version “with the addition of cross saves,” though it’s unclear when that feature might be added.Borderlands 4 launched on September 12th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X / S. The game has come under scrutiny for performance issues, and Gearbox released a patch last week that “improves stability” on PC. The game also reportedly demoed poorly on Nintendo Switch 2 at Gamescom and PAX West.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsNintendoCloseNintendoPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NintendoMost PopularMost PopularGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
