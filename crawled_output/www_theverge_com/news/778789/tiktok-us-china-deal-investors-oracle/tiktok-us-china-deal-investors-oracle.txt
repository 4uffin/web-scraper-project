Sources tell CNBC’s David Faber that the US and China might close on an agreement within the next 30 to 45 days, while Oracle will remain the app’s cloud partner, allowing it to continue routing US user data on American servers.On Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that the US and China have reached a “framework deal” for TikTok. He added that President Donald Trump would confirm the deal on Friday — two days after TikTok’s latest deadline to divest expires. Trump has already given TikTok three extensions to negotiate a deal, and it’s unclear whether he’ll grant TikTok another while the company finalizes an agreement.TikTok’s future in the US became shrouded in uncertainty after the federal government passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which mandates that TikTok must divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or face a ban in the US due to national security concerns.RelatedTrump’s tariffs killed his TikTok dealThe China-US deal for TikTok could take another month to work outOn Tuesday, The Information reported that the US and China have reached an agreement on the “licensing of TikTok’s algorithms and other intellectual property rights.” Previous reports suggested that TikTok could launch a separate version of its app for US users. As noted by CNBC, a group of investment firms, including some existing ByteDance shareholders, could gain control of TikTok’s US operations. Trump confirmed on Tuesday that “we have a group of very big companies that want to buy it,” according to Reuters.“’I’m hearing it’s [the deal] actually going to be relatively small in terms of the actual size of the checks that are written for the entity itself, and it will not be something that is going to go public at some point,” Faber said during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street.Update, September 16th: Added a statement from Trump.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothCreatorsCloseCreatorsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All CreatorsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyPoliticsClosePoliticsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PoliticsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechTikTokCloseTikTokPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TikTokMore in this streamSee allSome details of the TikTok deal have been worked out.Terrence O'BrienSep 20Trump claims the US is about to get a tremendous fee for taking TikTok out of ChinaSean HollisterSep 19So… is there a TikTok deal or not?Adi RobertsonSep 19Most PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
