Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.After launching on Pixel 10 devices, the Google Photos feature that allows users to edit images by describing the changes they want to make is now coming to other Android phones. Google announced that the Gemini-powered conversational editing capabilities are rolling out to eligible Android users in the US starting today, and can be accessed by tapping “Help me edit” in the Google Photos editor.The update enables more Google Photos users to describe their edits using their voice or text instead of manually using the app’s tools or adjustment sliders. The aim is to make photo editing quicker and more accessible, preventing users from having to use a variety of specific app tools and understand how they’ll work together. The feature also provides suggested edits that users can select, and it works with vague commands like “make it better” or “restore this old photo.”Using short descriptions with little detail will obviously provide less control over the edited results, but the efficiency of asking Gemini to make tricky adjustments for you does sound appealing.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedAndroidCloseAndroidPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AndroidGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
