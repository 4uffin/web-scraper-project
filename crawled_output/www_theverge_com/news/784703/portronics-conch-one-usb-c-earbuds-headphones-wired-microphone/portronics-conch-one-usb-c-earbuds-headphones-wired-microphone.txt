So as wired headphones continue to make a comeback, Portronics has released a pair of USB-C earbuds called the Conch One with their microphone attached to a short cable instead of being integrated into the inline remote.Portronics sells many of its products on Amazon, but at launch the Conch One are only available through the company’s website and Amazon India for ₹1,999, or around $23. They feature 14.2mm drivers so you should get some good thump out of them, and the inline remote includes volume and playback controls, a mic button, and a unique mode button. A long press of the button toggles between a listening mode that offers four different EQ settings to enhance what you’re listening to, and a karaoke mode with eight different settings of its own.The company hasn’t share specifics on the type of mic included or its pickup pattern. Image: PortronicsWith content creators going so far as to clip their wireless mics to random objects like forks to make them handheld, these buds could catch on as a much cheaper and simpler alternative that will work for as long as your phone has power. But if you only ever plan to use them while talking on the phone, they could be less convenient than an inline mic which are typically positioned close enough to pick up your voice. When not in use, the Conch One’s mic looks like it’s going to hang down too far to be usable hands-free.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiAudioCloseAudioPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AudioGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsHeadphonesCloseHeadphonesPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All HeadphonesNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
