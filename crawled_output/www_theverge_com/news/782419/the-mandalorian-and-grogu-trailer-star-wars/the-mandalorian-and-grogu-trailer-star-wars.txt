Disney just released the first trailer for The Mandalorian and Grogu, which looks like a mixture of the adventurous vibe of the original trilogy and the cuteness of the Disney Plus series. The early clip includes blazing speeders and marching AT-ATs, along with Grogu doing all kinds of adorable things, like wielding a telescope and doing plenty of snacking. He even uses the Force to try to snatch a treat from Sigourney Weaver.There still aren’t many details on what the Jon Favreau-directed movie will be about specifically, but a new official description gives some idea as to where it fits in the timeline:The evil Empire has fallen, and Imperial warlords remain scattered throughout the galaxy. As the fledgling New Republic works to protect everything the Rebellion fought for, they have enlisted the help of legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and his young apprentice Grogu.This is also an important feature film for Disney and Lucasfilm, as Star Wars has been absent from theaters since The Rise of Skywalker in 2019. There have been a few false starts since then, but The Mandalorian and Grogu will mark the franchise’s return when it premieres on May 22nd, 2026. However, Star Wars: Starfighter — which stars Ryan Gosling and is directed by Shawn Levy — isn’t too far behind, with plans to premiere in 2027.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew WebsterCloseAndrew WebsterSenior entertainment editorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew WebsterEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentFilmCloseFilmPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All FilmNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsStar WarsCloseStar WarsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Star WarsMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
