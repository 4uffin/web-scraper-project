The studio released a new trailer showing some of the surprisingly bloody superhero gameplay at Sony’s most-recent State of Play showcase. There’s no date yet, but the game — which is called simply Wolverine — is expected to launch on the PS5 in the fall of 2026.The game was first announced in 2021 with a brief cinematic trailer. At the time, Insomniac was pretty vague on the details of the game, but today’s trailer included the following synopsis:Become a living weapon. As he searches for answers about his past, Wolverine will do whatever it takes — unleashing brutal claw combat, violent rage, and relentless determination — to cut through the mystery of the man he used to be.In-development footage of the game started making the rounds as part of a massive Insomniac Games leak in 2023.The game has been particularly anticipated after Insomniac released a trio of excellent Spider-Man games, most recently with Spider-Man 2 on the PS5 in 2023.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew WebsterCloseAndrew WebsterSenior entertainment editorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew WebsterEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPlayStationClosePlayStationPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PlayStationMore in this streamSee allA cool-looking game with a very weird name.Jay PetersSep 24PlayStation’s new wireless speakers are for your desktopJay PetersSep 24Controller of war.Andrew WebsterSep 24Most PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
