Its latest creation is an external SSD drive that includes a built-in cooling fan to improve its performance and longevity. It also has a bunch of extra ports so you can connect other accessories to your laptop or smartphone while moving data around. The Sharge Disk Pro just launched on Kickstarter and comes in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities temporarily discounted to $189, $289, and $469, respectively.As the performance of SSDs has increased, so has their propensity to heat up while in use. Excess heat can affect an SSD’s reliability and lifespan, so their performance is reduced when they reach a certain temperature (often over 70 degrees Celsius). It’s especially a problem for external SSDs housed in slim cases with no airflow, but the Disk Pro’s fan solves that. It can be set to a Turbo Mode that continually runs at 10,000rpm to keep the drive’s operating temperature at around 50 degrees Celsius, or a quieter Auto Mode that adjusts the fan speed automatically up to 7,000rpm as cooling is needed, and turns it off completely below 25 degrees Celsius.Sharge says the Disk Pro features read and write speeds of up to 10Gbps and can be magnetically attached to the back of smartphones or consoles. In addition to a built-in USB-C cable it has an HDMI port capable of 4K/144Hz and 8K/30Hz video output plus an extra USB-C and USB-A port that can deliver a total power output of 80W to connected devices. When you only need the hub functionality, a switch lets you disable the SSD entirely to help prolong its life.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiDesignCloseDesignPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All DesignGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsMore in this streamSee allI tried Sharge’s retractable charger + battery that looks like a Braun turntable.Sean HollisterAug 22Asus has the new world’s fastest OLED monitor at 720Hz — but only at 720pSean HollisterAug 19This see-thru Game Boy is a work of art — because she designed a transparent circuit boardSean HollisterAug 11Most PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
