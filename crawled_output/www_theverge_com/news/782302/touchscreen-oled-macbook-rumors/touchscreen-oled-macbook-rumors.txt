He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo took to X on Wednesday to claim that a MacBook Pro with an OLED touchscreen was expected to enter mass production by late 2026. Today Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman is following up to remind us that he was reporting on a touchscreen MacBook Pro way back in 2023. He confirmed Kuo’s timeline was correct. Since Gurman’s original story, the launch date has been pushed back from late 2025, to late 2026 or early 2027.Apple has traditionally been resistant to the idea of merging the iPad and MacBook lines, and still likely won’t do it completely. But according to Gurman iPad sales have begun to taper off, and customers increasingly expect touch-based interfaces, even on their laptops. This is in part because many Windows laptops now include touchscreens by default. So Apple is feeling the pressure to bring the two product lines more in sync with each other.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Terrence O'BrienCloseTerrence O'BrienWeekend EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Terrence O'BrienAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsLaptopsCloseLaptopsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All LaptopsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
