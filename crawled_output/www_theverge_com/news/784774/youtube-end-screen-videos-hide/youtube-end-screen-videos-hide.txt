Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.YouTube will finally let you dismiss the pop-ups that fill your screen with recommendations at the end of a video. Now, when you come across an end screen, you can select a new “hide” button in the top-right corner of the video so you can finish what you’re watching without distractions.YouTube says it’s making the change in response to feedback that viewers want to be able to “focus on the content they’re watching.” I’ve long looked for ways to hide these screens, as they sometimes cover the tail end of the video I’m trying to watch and make it difficult to see what’s happening.YouTube notes that when you select the “hide” button, it only applies to the video you’re watching — not all of them on the platform. You can also bring back the end screen by selecting the “show” button. YouTube found that this didn’t have a substantial impact on a creator’s view count while testing the feature, as it says the “hide” button resulted in just a 1.5 percent decrease in views stemming from end screen clickthroughs.In addition to this change, YouTube is removing the “subscribe” button that appears when you hover your mouse over a channel’s watermark on desktop. Doing this will “simplify and improve the viewing experience,” according to YouTube, as the platform already displays a subscribe button directly beneath videos. Neither of these updates will affect how creators make videos, as they can continue to add end screens and watermarks.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothCreatorsCloseCreatorsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All CreatorsEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsStreamingCloseStreamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All StreamingTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechYouTubeCloseYouTubePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All YouTubeMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
