Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.Meta is broadening Instagram restrictions that prevent minors from being exposed to inappropriate contact and content, bringing those protections to Facebook and Messenger and adding new limits for teenage Instagram users.After introducing “Teen Accounts” to Instagram in September — which automatically make younger users’ accounts private and restrict them from accessing certain features — Meta has announced that “similar” protections are now available on Facebook and Messenger. This comes as Facebook has spent several years struggling to attract younger users to the app, losing ground to rival social media platforms like TikTok.Facebook and Messenger Teen Accounts are rolling out in the US, UK, Australia, and Canada starting today, with other regions coming “soon,” according to Meta. The company hasn’t specified which protections will be applied, but if it matches Instagram’s Teen Account rollout then changes will automatically apply to new and existing accounts for users under the age of 18. Older teens can disable these protections, but those under 16 will need to request parental permission via supervisory tools to make any changes.Providing teens have been honest about their age during sign up, these changes will be automatically applied to all minors using Facebook and Messenger. Image: MetaCurrent Teen Account protections include restrictions around messaging and interactions with strangers, and tighter controls for seeing sensitive content. Teens are also encouraged to spend more time offline with 60-minute time limit reminders and a sleep mode that mutes notifications between 10PM and 7AM. These features are part of Meta’s efforts to address criticisms around child safety on its platforms. Facebook and Instagram are currently under EU investigation over concerns around safeguarding minors, with a separate US lawsuit filed in 2023 having accused Meta of creating a “marketplace for predators in search of children.”Under 16s won’t be able to adjust these new toggles without a parent signing off on it. Image: MetaMeta is also adding additional protections to Teen Accounts on Instagram “in the next couple of months,” that prevent minors from starting a live broadcast or disabling a feature that blurs images in DM when nudity is detected. Under 16s will require parental permission to change or remove these new Instagram restrictions, which are designed to limit contact between children and strangers on the platform.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedFacebookCloseFacebookPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All FacebookInstagramCloseInstagramPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All InstagramMetaCloseMetaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MetaNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunOpenAI really, really wants you to start your day with ChatGPT PulseThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
