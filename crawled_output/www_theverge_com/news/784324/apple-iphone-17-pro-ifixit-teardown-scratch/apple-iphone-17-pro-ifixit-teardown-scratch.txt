See our ethics statement.Apple’s new, anodized aluminum iPhone 17 Pro phones have drawn attention for reportedly being easy to scratch around the camera “plateau,” and iFixit has investigated the issue in microscopic detail in its teardown video for the phones.Here are some pictures showing just what those scratches look like under a digital microscope:PreviousNext1/4Image: iFixitiFixit talked to David Niebuhr, an engineer and professor of mechanical engineering, who has an explanation for why scratches around the iPhone 17 Pro’s camera plateau stick out so much with spalling damage that didn’t appear in tests of other areas. According to Niebuhr, the problem is the sharp edge of the camera bump where the anodization process isn’t as even, as he says, “Apple could have prevented this by making a more gradual curve and avoiding a relatively sharp corner.”iFixit adds that unless you put your iPhone 17 Pro in a case, the camera plateau is “probably going to see some damage” at some point during its lifetime. As for repairability, iFixit gives Apple credit for a screwed-in battery, but criticized requiring users to remove the screen for most repairs — something Apple avoided on the new iPhone Air.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersRichard LawlerCloseRichard LawlerSenior News EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Richard LawlerAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleiPhoneCloseiPhonePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All iPhoneNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
