Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.Meta ran into some spectacularly embarrassing technical issues during the live demos of its new smart glasses this week, and now we know why. Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, explained in an Instagram AMA why two notable demos — an influencer asking the AI assistant for cooking instructions, and Mark Zuckerberg attempting to pick up a WhatsApp call — failed.“When the chef said ‘hey Meta, start Live AI,’ it started every single Meta Ray-Ban’s Live AI in the building,” said Bosworth. “We had routed Live AI traffic to our dev server, in theory, to isolate it, but we had done it for everyone in that building on those access points. We DDoS’d ourselves, basically.” So yeah, it wasn’t the Wi-Fi, as Zuck claimed on stage.The video call issue was “more obscure,” according to Bosworth, and involved a “never-before-seen bug” that occurred because the Display glasses had gone to sleep at the same moment that the device received the call notification. Bosworth says that the bug has now been fixed, but acknowledged the onstage demo was a “terrible place for that bug to show up.”Even with the technical blunders, Meta providing an honest live product demonstration is a nice break from the usual fare of pre-recorded videos and generative AI errors that companies like Apple and Google showcase these days.RelatedI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failure0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIMetaCloseMetaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MetaNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularNest is dead, long live Google HomeI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failureFirst look at the Google Home app powered by GeminiAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
