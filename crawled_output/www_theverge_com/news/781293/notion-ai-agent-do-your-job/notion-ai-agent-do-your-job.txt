She covers AI companies, policies, and products.Notion has entered the agent era of its AI evolution with the launch of the Notion Agent on Thursday. The announcement forms the bulk of the Notion 3.0 roll out available to all users. The company calls the new product a “teammate and Notion super user” that “can do everything a human can do in Notion.”While Notion users previously constructed pages and databases manually, now the agent builds both for them. Agents can also search for information beyond the Notion workspace and across connected tools such as Slack and the internet. The agents can form a plan and act on it, doing up to “20 minutes of autonomous work at a time across hundreds of pages at once,” according to the company press release.The agents can also “remember” the user’s preferred way of working, such as which content to reference and where to file it. These “memories” are stored in the user’s profile that can be edited later. Each user’s agent can be personalized under multiple profiles with different behaviors for now, but fully automated and customized agents will be rolled out in the future.Notion’s use cases for AI agents include generating and editing email campaigns, collecting and analyzing feedback collected across multiple platforms into a single report, and turning meeting notes into emails and proposals.The company’s cofounder Akshay Kothari teased the launch of agents in August and September with videos of him prompting the agent to create a tracker of the cafes he has visited and a database of movies to watch based on scores from the website Rotten Tomatoes.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Elissa WelleCloseElissa WelleAI ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Elissa WelleAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AINewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
