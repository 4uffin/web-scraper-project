The Bounce 2 introduces a new design and upgrades that include two-way talking instead of just voice messaging. It looks less like a kids watch now, but the limited upgrades may not be enough to justify a price jump from $149.99 to $299.99 for the new model which is now available through Garmin.The original Bounce featured a square design (which potentially appealed to some kids with Apple Watch envy) and an LCD screen, while the new Bounce 2 is round with a more vivid 1.2-inch AMOLED display. Text messaging is still an option but the Bounce 2 has improved voice messages with a new feature that will transcribe them so they can be read or listened to.The Bounce 2 will be available in three colors similar to the original including light purple, slate gray, and turquoise. Image: GarminThe Bounce 2 carries forward real-time location tracking through the Garmin Jr. app and still lets parents opt for alerts when kids leave a designated area using temporary geofencing. Battery life stays the same at up to two days between charges, but a new feature that lets kids download and listen to songs from Amazon Music could reduce that. Although the watch itself has doubled in price, LTE connectivity is still $9.99 per month or $99.99 annually with one of Garmin’s Kids Smartwatch Plans.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsSmartwatchCloseSmartwatchPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SmartwatchWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USThe foldable iPhone might look like two iPhone Airs stuck togetherThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
