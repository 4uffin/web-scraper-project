He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.Today Microsoft announced its plans to bring a Fairwater AI data center, which it claims is the “world’s most powerful,” online in early 2026. The $3.3 billion construction in Wisconsin is housed at the site of Foxconn’ s failed LCD factory which was announced in 2017, but by the end of 2018 was already being called a “boondoggle.”The new data center is massive at 1.2 million square feet spread over three buildings on 315 acres of land. Under those roofs are “hundreds of thousands” of Nvidia’s GB200 GPUs, “connected by enough fiber to circle the Earth 4.5 times,” according to Satya Nadella. Microsoft claims this cluster of interconnected GPUs is ten-times more powerful than the fastest super computer and will greatly accelerate its AI training efforts. The company says that multiple other Fairwater datacenters are under construction across the US.Microsoft is also touting its supposedly environmentally friendly design which minimizes water waste through a closed loop cooling system — it only needs to be filled once and then it’s sealed, eliminating evaporation. Microsoft’s vice chair and president focused heavily on the company’s sustainability efforts when announcing the project, which makes sense given AI’s reputation for absolutely massive energy consumption.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Terrence O'BrienCloseTerrence O'BrienWeekend EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Terrence O'BrienAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMore in this streamSee allHere’s Chris Hayes on the Foxconn plant in Wisconsin that will now be a Microsoft data center.Nilay PatelMay 9, 2024Help, Foxconn has gone from AI 8K+5G to ‘3+3=∞’Nilay PatelOct 20, 2022A former Foxconn executive tries to explain what went wrong in WisconsinNilay PatelApr 19, 2022Most PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
