He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Amazon MGM Studios is working on a Spaceballs sequel, and a new cast photo confirms that Rick Moranis will be back after a decades-long break from live-action films to reprise his role as Dark Helmet. Moranis’ last live-action movie was Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves, released in 1997, and while Deadline reported earlier this year that Moranis would be returning for Spaceballs 2, now it’s official.Mel Brooks, Daphne Zuniga, Bill Pullman, and George Wyner are also coming back for Spaceballs 2, and they’ll be joined by new cast members Josh Gad, Keke Palmer, Lewis Pullman, and Anthony Carrigan. Details about the plot are under wraps, but “in typical Mel Brooks fashion, the film has been described as ‘A Non-Prequel Non-Reboot Sequel Part Two but with Reboot Elements Franchise Expansion Film,’” Amazon says.Spaceballs 2 is scheduled to hit theaters in 2027, 40 years after the original’s debut. The film was announced earlier this year in a video with a Star Wars-like title crawl parodying the massive number of sequels and spinoffs across Star Wars and other big entertainment franchises. (The black-and-white cast photo released today seems to be a nod to Star Wars, too.)Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersAmazonCloseAmazonPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AmazonEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentFilmCloseFilmPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All FilmNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunOpenAI really, really wants you to start your day with ChatGPT PulseThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
