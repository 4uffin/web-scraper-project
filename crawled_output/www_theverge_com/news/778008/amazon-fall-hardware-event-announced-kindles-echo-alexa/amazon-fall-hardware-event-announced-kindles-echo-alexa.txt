She has written previously for Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, BBC, and US News.Amazon has sent out invitations to its annual fall hardware event, where it traditionally launches a slew of new products, including Echo smart speakers, Fire TV devices, Kindles, and sometimes dozens of other gadgets.

As well as new Echo devices, indicated by a blue Alexa light. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said earlier this year that the company would be releasing beautiful new hardware this fall. The Verge will be on the ground at the event later this month to cover all the announcements.The invite shows the words “stroke of a pen” on a color Kindle (spotted by The Verge’s Andrew Liszewski).

Panay then hosted a major, hardware-free event in February 2025, where Amazon relaunched Alexa Plus, the LLM-powered version of its voice assistant.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jennifer Pattison TuohyCloseJennifer Pattison TuohySenior Reviewer, Smart HomePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jennifer Pattison TuohyAmazonCloseAmazonPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AmazonAmazon AlexaCloseAmazon AlexaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Amazon AlexaNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsSmart HomeCloseSmart HomePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Smart HomeTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMore in this streamSee allFirst look at the Google Home app powered by GeminiJennifer Pattison TuohySep 19Tour our smart home reviewer’s smart backyardVictoria BarriosSep 19Nest is dead, long live Google HomeJennifer Pattison TuohySep 19Most PopularMost PopularAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USAnker’s latest sleep buds can silence snoringWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxRepublicans’ political purge is just getting startedWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
