Windows enthusiasts have discovered a way to enable this new Xbox mode early in Windows 11, thanks to the latest 25H2 update to the operating system.The method, which involves installing a Release Preview version of Windows 11 and lots of tweaks, works on a variety of handheld gaming PCs — including MSI’s Claw devices and Asus’ ROG Ally range. I’ve been trying it out on the original ROG Ally today, and it allows the device to ignore Asus’ own software in favor of Microsoft’s Xbox app at boot.The new Xbox full-screen experience doesn’t load the full Windows desktop or a bunch of background processes, freeing up more memory for games. It’s essentially not loading the Explorer shell and saving around 2GB of memory by suppressing all the unnecessary parts of a typical Windows 11 installation.You launch straight into the Xbox PC app instead, which includes all of your PC games from the Microsoft Store, Battle.net, Steam, and other storefronts. There’s a Game Bar for navigating around, and a new task view that’s a lot more handheld-friendly.RelatedMicrosoft’s Xbox handheld is a good first step toward a Windows gaming OSThis is how Microsoft is combining Windows and Xbox for handheld PCsMicrosoft is combining ‘the best of Xbox and Windows together’ for handheldsYou can also still swap into a Windows desktop mode, or access Windows apps and games directly in this full-screen Xbox mode. Microsoft warns that you’re exiting to the Windows desktop and that you should use touch or a mouse and keyboard “for the best experience,” and it’s the exact same Windows experience that exists on multiple devices right now.If you want to try this out for yourself, it’s a relatively easy process to get going. But be warned, fiddling with registry settings or the Windows Feature Store (known as Velocity) could result in system instability. If you’re willing to risk some issues that might need rolling back or require a reinstall of Windows, there’s a handy guide on Reddit for all the settings required.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Tom WarrenCloseTom WarrenSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tom WarrenGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWindowsCloseWindowsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WindowsXboxCloseXboxPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All XboxMost PopularMost PopularApple iPhone Air review: statement pieceVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoRepublicans are honoring Charlie Kirk’s memory by declaring war on the First AmendmentThe iPhone 17 is the one to get this yearThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
