He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.Nothing has announced that it plans to spin off its sub-brand CMF, which focuses on cheaper smartphones, earbuds, and wearables, into a standalone subsidiary based in India.Founder and CEO Carl Pei announced the move on X, claiming he plans to build CMF into India’s “first truly global consumer tech brand.” Nothing is partnering with local manufacturer Optiemus in a joint venture to set up CMF, and announced plans to invest over $100 million and create at least 1,800 jobs over the next three years. Nothing can afford the investment, having just raised $200 million in a funding round that values the company at $1.3 billion.The announcement comes at an interesting time for CMF, which is busy teasing the launch of its first pair of over-ear headphones on September 29th. Like all CMF products, they’re expected to be budget-friendly — its top smartphone, the Phone 2 Pro, is just $279 in its US beta release, with its watches and earbuds all below $100.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Dominic PrestonCloseDominic PrestonNews EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Dominic PrestonAudioCloseAudioPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AudioMobileCloseMobilePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MobileNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunOpenAI really, really wants you to start your day with ChatGPT PulseThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
