Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.Amazon is opening the door to even more AI ads by offering sellers access to a new chatbot that can generate promos with a simple text prompt. With the new tool, Amazon sellers can describe the type of ad they’d like to see, and the AI chatbot will draw from a seller’s brand guidelines, product pages, and other store details to generate a concept, whether it’s for a static advertisement or a video ad.An example shared by Amazon shows how sellers can go from asking the AI chatbot to create taglines and images for a product, to having it write a script, add music, generate a voiceover, and lay out a storyboard. “This tool reduces the time and cost of designing creative ads, encouraging advertisers to explore and experiment rapidly,” Amazon writes. The ads can appear on Amazon’s online marketplace and across its other properties like Prime Video, the Kindle, and even Twitch.Amazon’s AI chatbot can generate a storyboard and more. Image: AmazonThe tool is similar to the AI chatbot-style interface that advertisers on TikTok can use to generate video ads.. It also builds on Amazon’s existing AI tools, which already let sellers generate AI videos showcasing their products. Amazon says its AI chatbot is still in beta and runs Amazon’s Nova AI model, as well as Anthropic’s Claude.Amazon is adding new “agentic” capabilities to its AI-powered seller assistant as well, allowing it to monitor inventory levels and provide information about how a seller can “optimize” their business by flagging items that are slow to sell or suggesting price changes. The seller assistant can now scan a seller’s account for product listings that may violate new product safety policies, too, in addition to suggesting new types of products to sell based on customer behavior.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIAmazonCloseAmazonPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AmazonNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
