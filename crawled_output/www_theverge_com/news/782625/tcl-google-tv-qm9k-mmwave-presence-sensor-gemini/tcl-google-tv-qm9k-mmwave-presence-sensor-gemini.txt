He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.You can now buy TCL’s new QM9K series QD-Mini LED TVs, and they run Google TV, are the first to come with Gemini AI, and have a built-in mmWave presence sensor, as reported by 9to5Google. The TVs start at $2,999 for the 65-inch model at Best Buy, with the price going up even more for the bigger versions (up to 98 inches).Using the mmWave presence sensor, the TVs can automatically turn on or off when you get close to it, and they can show a screensaver or a widget “based on your proximity,” according to the description on the Best Buy product listing. Samsung’s The Frame TVs (and some of its appliances) can also detect and respond to motion in a room, though the company hasn’t said what technology powers its motion detectors.With Gemini built-in, the QM9K TVs can “understand conversational queries and follow-up questions based on the context,” TCL says. These new TCL TVs are the first to come with Gemini, but the AI assistant will be coming to other 2025 TCL TVs as well as some Hisense TVs, the Google TV Streamer, and the Walmart Onn 4K Pro.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechTVsCloseTVsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TVsMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
