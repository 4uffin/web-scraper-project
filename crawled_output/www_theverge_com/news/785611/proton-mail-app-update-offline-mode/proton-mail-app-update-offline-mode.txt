Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.Proton has launched a major update for its encrypted Mail app, which not only adds a refreshed layout but also includes a new offline mode. That means you’ll now have full access to your inbox when you don’t have an internet connection, giving you the ability to read, write, and compose emails.Your messages will sync once you come back online, but having access to them offline seems like a helpful way to stay on top of things while on a flight or in other areas where you don’t have cellular service or access to Wi-Fi.Proton has also made key changes to the layout of the app, moving the Compose button from the top-right of the screen to the very bottom for easier access. The company also says it has made scrolling, archiving, and replying to emails “twice as fast” when compared to the previous iterations of the app.The updated app is rolling out on iOS and Android starting today. Both versions of the app will now share the same features, too, meaning Android users will finally gain the ability to snooze and schedule messages.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothAppsCloseAppsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPrivacyClosePrivacyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PrivacyTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Logitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026PlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
