Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.Google is bringing Search Live to everyone in the US, letting you search for information by having a conversation with an AI assistant. When you use the feature, Search Live will respond to your questions in real-time, as well as surface relevant links from the web.You can try the feature out by opening the Google app on Android and iOS, and then selecting the new “Live” button beneath the search bar. From there, you can ask questions out loud and turn on your camera if you want your search to include something you’re seeing. You can also find a new Search Live icon within the Lens app as well, allowing you to have a back-and-forth conversation while sharing your camera.Google previously only rolled out Search Live as part of a test within Google Labs. It’s currently only available in English.As an example, Google says you can use Search Live to learn how to make matcha by showing it the tools you’ve purchased for the job, and asking what each one is for. You can also use Search Live while setting up a new electronic device, allowing you to ask Search Live where a specific cable goes just by pointing your camera at it.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIAppsCloseAppsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppsGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunOpenAI really, really wants you to start your day with ChatGPT PulseThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
