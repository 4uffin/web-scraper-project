She has written previously for Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, BBC, and US News.Following the announcement that it is bringing Gemini to its Google Home smart home platform, it appears the company is updating its Google Home app to incorporate the new features. Android Authority dove into code for the upcoming v3.41.50.3 version of the app and found “a significant redesign.” While the overall UI doesn’t look like it’s changed dramatically, some usability tweaks streamline the app while putting Gemini front and center.According to screenshots published by Android Authority and detailed in a YouTube video, you can now “Ask Home” to control your devices by typing or saying what you want to happen or to search your video and home history to get detailed descriptions of what has already happened. This is all accessible through a new Ask Home search bar at the top of the app, which, according to AA, opens a new “Ask Home” conversation screen.RelatedNest is dead, long live Google HomeGoogle’s redesigned Home app was a long time comingGoogle had already announced that Gemini for Home is coming to Google’s smart speakers and displays, allowing you to use natural language to control smart home devices with your voice, so it’s logical that this function will also be part of the Home app.Other updates AA spotted included that the Favorites tab has been renamed to Home, and the Devices and Settings tab has gone from the bottom bar, leaving only three icons . (Devices will now be accessible via a grid icon in the Home tab.)It looks like you will also be able to add outdoor air quality and temperature as a favorite tile, and there are new icons for video and a thermometer on the Home page. The latter may hint at upcoming Nest hardware, which is slated to launch next month.I hope this big app refresh will also bring the many features Google has been trialing in its Public Preview program to all users.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jennifer Pattison TuohyCloseJennifer Pattison TuohySenior Reviewer, Smart HomePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jennifer Pattison TuohyAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleGoogle AssistantCloseGoogle AssistantPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Google AssistantNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMore in this streamSee allTour our smart home reviewer’s smart backyardVictoria BarriosSep 19Nest is dead, long live Google HomeJennifer Pattison TuohySep 19Google Nest may become Google Home again.Jennifer Pattison TuohySep 18Most PopularMost PopularAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USAnker’s latest sleep buds can silence snoringWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankRepublicans’ political purge is just getting startedThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
