Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.In spite of Brendan Carr’s efforts, the return of Jimmy Kimmel’s talk show is breaking viewership records on YouTube, and ratings of the first return broadcast were the show’s highest in a decade. Tuesday’s episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! contained Kimmel’s most-watched monologue ever on the video platform, a 28-minute segment addressing the censorship, which has reached more than 19 million views at the time of writing.The increased online viewership could include people who are unable to watch the show on network television and are flocking to YouTube instead, as Nexstar and Sinclair continue to block it from being broadcast on roughly one-quarter of ABC stations. Preliminary Nielsen figures cited by ABC and reported by The New York Times, which don’t include streaming viewership, show that Tuesday’s episode averaged 6.2 million viewers — nearly four times higher than Kimmel’s usual audience. These figures are preliminary and expected to grow in the coming days.ABC:Among Adults 18-49, “Jimmy Kimmel Live” earned a 0.87 rating, representing the show’s highest regularly scheduled episode in over 10 years — since 3/12/15.Poetically, the party that made such a public push to get Kimmel kicked off the airwaves has unintentionally amplified his platform, even while 20 percent of ABC affiliates have bent the knee and boycotted the show.Update, September 25th: Updated with additional ratings details.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunOpenAI really, really wants you to start your day with ChatGPT PulseThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
