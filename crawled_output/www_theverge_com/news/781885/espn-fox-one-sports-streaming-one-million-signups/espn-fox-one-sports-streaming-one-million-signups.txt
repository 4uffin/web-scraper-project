He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.It feels like we’ve reached total saturation when it comes to streaming services, but apparently people are happy to sign up for one (or two) more services if they include live sports. According to Antenna, a firm that tracks the streaming industry, the new ESPN service and Fox One signed up about a million new subscribers in just 10 days. And that number doesn’t include those signing in through a cable subscription or coming over from an existing Disney+ sub.Antenna didn’t specify how many people signed up for ESPN versus Fox One, though according to Front Office Sports, most of the subscribers are for ESPN. With the NFL season just getting underway it’s no surprise that many were eager to sign up for a service that would let them watch live football without cable. Fox One includes Fox News and Fox Business, but the real draw is livestreams from Fox Sports, FS1, FS2, and local Fox affiliates. These are, of course, just early results and it remains to be seen if both services will see continued success when the football season ends.While you can subscribe to ESPN’s new offering for $29.99 a month, or Fox One for $19.99 a month, bundles will continue to be a big part of Disney’s strategy. The company is even planning to offer the two under a single sub for $39.99 starting October 2nd.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Terrence O'BrienCloseTerrence O'BrienWeekend EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Terrence O'BrienDisneyCloseDisneyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All DisneyEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsSportsCloseSportsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SportsStreamingCloseStreamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All StreamingMost PopularMost PopularAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USAnker’s latest sleep buds can silence snoringWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankRepublicans’ political purge is just getting startedThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
