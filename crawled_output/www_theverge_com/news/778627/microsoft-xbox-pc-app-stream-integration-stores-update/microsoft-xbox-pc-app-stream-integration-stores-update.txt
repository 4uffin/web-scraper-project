The updated app will now list games from Steam, Battle.net, and other PC storefronts — making it a launcher for games you have installed on your PC.Microsoft has been testing this aggregated library in recent months with Xbox Insiders, but it’s now available to all Xbox PC app users. It’s designed primarily for the new fullscreen Xbox experience that will ship on the Xbox Ally devices, but it’s also part of Microsoft’s efforts to make the Xbox app on Windows the home of PC gaming.“When you install a game from a supported PC storefront, it automatically appears in ‘My Library’ within the Xbox PC app, as well as the ‘Most Recent’ list of titles in the sidebar, so you can jump back into your favorite games with just a click,” explains Jason Beaumont, vice president of experiences at Xbox.Alongside the library integration, Microsoft is also rolling out a new My Apps section in the Xbox PC app that allows PC gamers to quickly install and launch third-party apps like browsers, gaming utilities, and rival storefronts. This new feature is also designed primarily for handhelds, to help people download and launch games from multiple stores.Later this month, Microsoft will also add cloud-playable games and game history to the Xbox app that syncs your recent games list on Xbox consoles, PC, or handheld. Microsoft already started rolling this out on Xbox consoles last month. “Once this feature is released, look for the ‘Jump back in’ list on the Home screen of your console, PC, or handheld to find your recent play history and pick up where you left off,” says Beaumont.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Tom WarrenCloseTom WarrenSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tom WarrenGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPC GamingClosePC GamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PC GamingTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechXboxCloseXboxPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All XboxMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
