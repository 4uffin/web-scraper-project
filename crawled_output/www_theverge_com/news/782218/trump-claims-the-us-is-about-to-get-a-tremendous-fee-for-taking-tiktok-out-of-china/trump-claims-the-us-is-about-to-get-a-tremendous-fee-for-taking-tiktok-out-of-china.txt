He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.A 10 percent stake in Intel, 15 percent of Nvidia’s China sales, a “golden share” of Nippon Steel — what price will Trump extract next in exchange for favorable treatment? Well, The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Trump Administration is “expected to collect a multibillion-dollar fee” in exchange for negotiating a US takeover of TikTok’s US business.That fee will reportedly come from TikTok’s US investors, including private equity firm Silver Lake and Oracle, with the new group getting half of TikTok, while TikTok China’s parent company ByteDance would still have under 20 percent.Yesterday, Trump said that “the United States is getting a tremendous fee-plus, I call it a ‘fee-plus,’ just for making the deal.” But Trump says a lot of things that need dissecting, and it was absolutely unclear today whether there’s even a TikTok deal or not.RelatedSo… is there a TikTok deal or not?So to see the WSJ reporting that “people familiar with the matter” think a deal might not only get approved, but also see billions of dollars flow from US companies into the Trump Administration’s coffers, sounds like something to be aware of. Why would those companies pay Trump’s government billions unless they think they’ll make even more?Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Sean HollisterCloseSean HollisterSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Sean HollisterNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyMore in this streamSee allTrump signs ‘Saving TikTok’ order to start resolving its big ban problemEmma Roth and Tina NguyenSep 25Some details of the TikTok deal have been worked out.Terrence O'BrienSep 20So… is there a TikTok deal or not?Adi RobertsonSep 19Most PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
