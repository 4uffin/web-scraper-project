Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.Figma is launching some new updates that allow AI models to directly communicate with its app-building tool and access designs remotely. Figma’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) server — a bridge that enables AI models to tap directly into the code behind prototypes and designs created using Figma’s tools — has now been expanded to support the design platform’s AI prompt-to-app coding tool, Figma Make.“By using a Figma Make file via an MCP client, AI models can see the underlying code instead of a rendered prototype or image,” Figma’s technology chief, Kris Rasmussen, said in the announcement blog. “The Figma MCP server indexes the code in your Make file so you and your favorite platforms can request exactly what’s needed.”In simple terms, this means the MCP server can show AI models and agents exactly how an app was built in Figma Make, so it can be accurately recreated instead of guessing based on the visual design. Figma says the Make MCP server experience supports products from Anthropic, Cursor, Windsurf, and VS Code starting today, and that future updates will allow third-party MCP servers to connect with Figma Make.The MCP server can now be accessed remotely from AI coding agents, browser-based models, and integrated development environments, making the tool more accessible for developers who were previously tied to needing local access to Figma’s desktop app.Some upcoming Figma features include a Design Snapshot feature that converts Make snapshots into editable layers in Figma Design, which is expected to launch this week, and an editing feature that allows users to manipulate designs with AI prompts without leaving the Design tool canvas, which is currently in testing.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedDesignCloseDesignPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All DesignNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Logitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersYou can now upgrade a retro Casio watch with Bluetooth, step tracking, and gamesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
