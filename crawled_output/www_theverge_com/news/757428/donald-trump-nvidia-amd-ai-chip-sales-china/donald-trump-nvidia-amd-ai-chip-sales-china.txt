Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.The Trump administration has ordered Nvidia and AMD to pay the federal government a 15 percent cut of their AI chip sales revenue to China, according to reports from The New York Times and The Financial Times. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly reached an agreement with President Donald Trump just days before the Commerce Department granted the companies licenses to sell AI chips.President Trump confirmed reports of the deal during a press conference on Monday, saying he originally asked for a 20 percent cut but lowered it to 15 percent after negotiations with Huang. “I said, ‘Listen, I want 20 percent if I’m going to approve this for you, for the country,’” Trump said. “And he [Huang] said, ‘Would you make it 15?’ So we negotiate a little deal.”The approved shipments include Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308, both of which are stripped-down versions of their AI-focused GPUs, designed to comply with US export rules to China. After the Trump administration put restrictions on AI chip sales to China in April, both companies confirmed last month that they would soon resume shipments once they received licenses. Nvidia’s H20 chip came under fire last week after the Chinese government raised concerns that its chips could have a government “backdoor.”Trump said the H20 chip is an “old chip that China already has,” adding that he would consider letting Nvidia sell its Blackwell chip to China if the company lowers its performance by “30 to 50 percent.“The Trump administration’s deal with Nvidia and AMD could net the US government $2 billion per year, according to the New York Times. The Times calls the agreement “highly unusual,” a running theme for an administration that’s taken in money from meme coin dinners, lawsuits against universities, shakedowns of TV networks, and a flood of unpredictable tariffs. Last week, Trump threatened to impose a 100 percent tariff on semiconductors unless companies reach a deal to bring manufacturing to the US.RelatedTrump demands CEO of Intel resign over ties to ChinaTrump threatens 100 percent tariff on computer chips with a gigantic loopholePresident Trump said earlier this year that he weighed breaking up Nvidia before Huang embarked on a campaign of flattery, which ended up also winning the removal of AI chip export limits. Trump has inserted himself into other major business dealings in the name of national security, proposing a joint venture that would give the US government 50 percent ownership of TikTok and recently demanding the resignation of Intel’s new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, over his connections to China.Update, August 11th: Added confirmation from Trump.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothAMDCloseAMDPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AMDBusinessCloseBusinessPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All BusinessNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsNvidiaCloseNvidiaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NvidiaPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyPoliticsClosePoliticsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PoliticsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
