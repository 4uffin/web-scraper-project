When Windows 10 goes end of support on October 14th, some European customers will no longer be required to turn on Windows Backup to enroll into its Extended Security Updates (ESU).Microsoft had wanted everyone to turn on Windows Backup to get the extra year of security updates, but thanks to pressure from the Euroconsumers group this is now changing in the European Economic Area. The consumer advocacy group has been asking Microsoft to do more for those still running Windows 10 across Europe, and it has successfully convinced the software giant to offer the extended security updates free without the requirement of enabling Windows Backup.Windows Backup requires a Microsoft Account and uses OneDrive, which could lead consumers to go above the 5GB of free storage by having to back up documents and settings. It’s a catch that benefits Microsoft, as it can then sell Windows 10 users additional OneDrive storage space.“We are pleased to learn that Microsoft will provide a no-cost Extended Security Updates (ESU) option for Windows 10 consumer users in the European Economic Area (EEA),” says the Euroconsumers group in a letter this week. “We are also glad this option will not require users to back up settings, apps, or credentials, or use Microsoft Rewards.”An unnamed Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the changes to Windows Central, noting that it’s “making updates to the enrollment process to ensure it meets local expectations and delivers a secure, streamlined experience.” These changes are only being made in the European Economic Area though, so everywhere else will still need to either enable Windows Backup or pay $30 for the year or redeem 1,000 Microsoft Reward points.Consumers will still only get extended security updates for Windows 10 until October 13th, 2026, but businesses have the option to purchase up to three years of important security updates. Euroconsumers is also trying to convince Microsoft to extend its security updates beyond a year for consumers, to avoid leaving devices “exposed to risk” next year.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Tom WarrenCloseTom WarrenSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tom WarrenMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWindowsCloseWindowsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WindowsMost PopularMost PopularForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
