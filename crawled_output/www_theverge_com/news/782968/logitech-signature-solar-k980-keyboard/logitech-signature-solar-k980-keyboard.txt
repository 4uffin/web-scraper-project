He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined The Verge in May 2025.Logitech left solar-powered keyboards in the dark for over a decade, but it’s launching a new one today. Just like the K760 before it, its new $99.99 Signature Slim Solar Plus K980 can only be powered with light. There’s no USB port or swappable batteries. Instead, it features a cell that can convert solar or artificial light — 200 lux at minimum — into power to charge its battery, which the company says will last for up to 10 years. Once fully charged, the company says the K980 can be used in complete darkness for up to four months. It’s available at Amazon, Best Buy, and through Logitech itself.I asked Logitech if the K980’s battery is user-replaceable, and spokesperson Melvin Dilanchian told The Verge that it is “safely user-replaceable (because it’s encased in a plastic casing), with spare parts supplied by iFixIt.”RelatedIt has been over 13 years since Logitech launched its solar-powered iPad keyboardBeyond its solar charging capabilities, the K980 has a pretty standard full-size layout, with Windows and macOS key labels, directional keys, and a numpad. Its function row is pre-programmed to control media, screen brightness, and volume, although you can customize their secondary features (or turn off secondary features altogether) in the Logi Options Plus app for Mac or Windows. The K980 also includes a mic mute key, a camera on/off toggle, and an Action key along the top row that can be programmed however you’d prefer in the app. It also features a new addition: an AI Launch key.The AI key is what you think it is; it defaults on Windows PCs to launching Copilot (ChromeOS defaults to Gemini), though it can be customized in Logitech’s app to open ChatGPT or an AI prompt builder. Alternatively, you can assign one of Logitech’s Smart Actions to the key to, say, ask Perplexity for an answer to your query in your browser. Or, you can just set it to be right CTRL. The Action Key (the key on the top row that looks like a big O) and several others can be programmed to execute these macros, too, whether you use one of Logitech’s presets or create your own through the app.The graphite-colored version of the K980 is universal (see full image), with key labels for Windows and macOS. However, Mac users in North America can opt for the off-white model that gets rid of Windows labels for the same price (see full image).The K980 supports being paired with up to three Bluetooth devices, letting you swap between them with a press of a button. It can also be connected to a computer that has a Logitech Bolt USB transmitter, although one isn’t included in the box (would have been nice!). A previous Logitech model had playful built-in LED indicators that would warn you when the ambient light wasn’t sufficient to charge the keyboard, but the K980’s power LED simply turns from green to red if it needs more charge. This is how Logitech gets you to install its Options Plus app. The app has an indicator that says whether there’s enough light.Logitech’s Solar K750 keyboard from 2010 had these fun LED indicators to communicate whether there was adequate light to recharge. The K980 ditches them in favor of making you install Logi Options Plus to find out. Boo.2025 seems to be the year when companies decided the sun was cool again, as Lenovo recently launched the $99.99 self-charging wireless keyboard that it first showed off in January at CES 2025. I think I dig it more than the K980, although I haven’t tried it yet and it doesn’t seem to include as much in the way of customization. Still, it has things that I like in a keyboard that the K980 lacks, like adjustable legs that can give it some tilt and a spill-resistant design. Plus, it has a USB-C charging port, just in case.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Cameron FaulknerCloseCameron FaulknerEditor, CommercePosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Cameron FaulknerKeyboardsCloseKeyboardsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All KeyboardsLogitechCloseLogitechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All LogitechNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
