He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.Google is continuing to slowly tease its rumored plans to bring Android to PCs, merging it with ChromeOS, and now Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon is getting in on the action. He says he’s seen a version of the software, and that he “can’t wait to have one.”Amon was speaking on stage with Google’s head of platforms and devices, Rick Osterloh, during the opening keynote for Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Summit, where later today the company will reveal its Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset. Before that though, the two execs teased Google and Qualcomm’s future plans together, from automotive to consumer PCs.“In the past, we’ve always had very different systems between what we’re building on PCs and what we’re building on smartphones, and we’ve embarked on a project to combine that,” Osterloh said. “ We are building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems.”He went on to confirm that Google’s plans involve bringing Gemini and the full Android AI stack, along with “all of our applications and developer community,” into the PC ecosystem. “I think this is another way in which Android is gonna be able to serve everyone in every computing category.”“I’ve seen it, it is incredible,” replied Amon excitedly. “It delivers on the vision of convergence of mobile and PC. I can’t wait to have one.”The last we heard of Google’s plans was this July, when Android head Sameer Samat confirmed Google is “combining ChromeOS and Android into a single platform,” following last year’s efforts to begin developing ChromeOS on parts of the Android stack.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Dominic PrestonCloseDominic PrestonNews EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Dominic PrestonAndroidCloseAndroidPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AndroidChromeCloseChromePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ChromeChromebookCloseChromebookPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ChromebookGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
