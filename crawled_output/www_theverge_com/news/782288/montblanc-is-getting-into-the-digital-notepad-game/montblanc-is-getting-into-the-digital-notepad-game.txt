He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.If you’re the kind of person who owns leather driving gloves in multiple colors to match your different Jaguars, then there hasn’t been a digital paper option that could live up to your lofty luxury standards until now. But Montblanc is finally delivering a truly bougie take on the e-ink writing tablet. The $905 Montblanc Digital Paper writing tablet combines a basic black-and-white e-ink screen with a digital pen modeled on the company’s Meisterstück. As you’d expect you can jot down notes, sketch, and even annotate books in epub or PDF format.Technical details are relatively light. There’s a 3740 mAh battery inside its aluminum shell, but there’s no mention of how long it’s expected to last under normal use. There’s a leather side bar where the pen attaches magnetically and charges wirelessly, and we know that it overs “over 4,000” levels of pressure sensitivity. But the tech specs are clearly besides the point. Montblanc isn’t selling you a cutting edge device, it’s selling you a luxury experience. What’s important isn’t the resolution of the screen, it’s the interchangeable tips that mimic three different paper textures.The company has dipped its toes into digital writing before with its Augmented Paper line and styli for Samsung, but this is largely new territory for Montblanc. If you’re in the market for a e-ink writing tablet you’re probably going to get more for your money (like color) by going with the $629 Remarkable Paper Pro. But if you’re looking for a lux e-ink experience that will look at home on a solid oak desk nestled between your gold name plate and humidor, the Montblanc Digital Paper pad (in its $205 calf leather folio, of course), might fit the bill.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Terrence O'BrienCloseTerrence O'BrienWeekend EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Terrence O'BrienNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
