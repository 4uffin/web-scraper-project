He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Meta has announced a new generation of its Ray-Ban smart glasses, featuring significantly improved battery life and the ability to record 3K video, which brings them up to par with the Oakley HSTN smart glasses. The new glasses, technically called the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, are available to order today and start at $379.Let’s dig in on battery, which is better on a few fronts. You can use the new Ray-Bans for up to eight hours on a single charge, which is twice the four-hour battery life of the previous generation. The charging case can charge the glasses to 50 percent in 20 minutes — a slight improvement over the 22 minutes to 50 percent for the first generation. The case for the Gen 2 glasses offers an additional 48 hours of battery life, up from 32 hours.Vee has worn a lot of smart glasses this week. Photo: Colt Bradley for The VergeAs for the camera, you’ll be able to record 3K at 30fps, 1440p at 30fps, and 1200p at 60fps, all for up to three minutes. Later this fall, Meta will also add the ability to capture hyperlapse and slow-motion videos — a feature coming to all of its AI glasses.Meta is adding a cool audio-focused feature called “conversation focus” down the line, too, which will use the speakers on the glasses to boost the voice of a person you’re talking with. The company is improving live translation by expanding it to support German and Portuguese.I tried the Gen 2 glasses at Meta’s Connect event, and there’s not much to say about them at first blush — they’re a solid upgrade on paper, but they’re ultimately still Meta Ray-Ban glasses, so if you’ve used the first generation before, you pretty much get the idea. You’ll be able to buy them in Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles. The first-generation glasses will still be available, too, starting at $299.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsMetaCloseMetaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MetaNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMore in this streamSee allI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failureSean HollisterSep 19Meta is opening up its smart glasses to developersJay PetersSep 18A native Discord app is coming to Quest VR headsets.Jay PetersSep 18Most PopularMost PopularNest is dead, long live Google HomeI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failureFirst look at the Google Home app powered by GeminiAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
