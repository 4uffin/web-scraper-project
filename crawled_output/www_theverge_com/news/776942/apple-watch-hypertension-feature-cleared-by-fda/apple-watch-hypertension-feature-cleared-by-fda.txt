He’s been a tech journalist for 20 years.Starting next week, Apple’s new hypertension notification feature will be coming to Watch Series 9 and later and Apple Watch Ultra 2 and later with the launch of watchOS 26. That’s according to an emailed statement from Apple spokesperson Zaina Khachadourian saying the feature that monitors blood pressure has been cleared by the FDA.Apple’s new hypertension notifications — announced Tuesday alongside the new Apple Watch SE3, Series 11, and Ultra 3 — use data from the watches’ existing optical heart sensor to “analyze how a user’s blood vessels respond to the beats of the heart.” An algorithm will review this data over a 30 day period and notify users if it detects signs of high blood pressure.It will roll out in more than 150 countries and regions with the arrival of watchOS 26 on September 15th.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Thomas RickerCloseThomas RickerDeputy EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Thomas RickerAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsHealthCloseHealthPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All HealthNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsScienceCloseSciencePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ScienceTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
