The feature has been spotted in the latest builds of Windows 11, and allows you to set video files like MP4 or MKV as your desktop wallpaper background.The videos play every time you view your desktop, much like third-party solutions like Wallpaper Engine. Microsoft previously supported video wallpapers in Windows Vista as a DreamScene feature for the Ultimate version of the operating system, but DreamScene was dropped from Windows 7.Video wallpapers are a highly requested feature for Windows users, and Wallpaper Engine is regularly in the top 10 most played apps and games list on Steam simply because of how many people have the app installed and running.Microsoft had been testing dynamic animated wallpapers for Windows 11 for years, and a former design even revealed exactly what they looked like earlier this year. These dynamic wallpapers were supposed to ship in 2023, but never made it into the release version of Windows 11.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Tom WarrenCloseTom WarrenSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tom WarrenMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWindowsCloseWindowsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WindowsMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedWhy your outdoorsy friend suddenly has a gummy bear power bankWhy PlayStation and Xbox are no longer about the station or the boxAmazon, Google, and Microsoft warn employees to rush back to the USThe foldable iPhone might look like two iPhone Airs stuck togetherThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
