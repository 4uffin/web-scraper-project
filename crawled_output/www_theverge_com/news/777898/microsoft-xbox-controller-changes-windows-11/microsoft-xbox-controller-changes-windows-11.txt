The change will allow Xbox controllers to easily access the Task View on Windows 11 to tab between apps and games, using the Xbox button.“A new change we’re introducing is when you long press the Xbox button, it will open Task View,” explains Microsoft’s Windows Insider team. “Pressing and holding the Xbox button continues to turn off the game controller.”The task switcher on handheld gaming PCs. Image: MicrosoftThe change will align Xbox controllers with the work Microsoft is doing for handheld gaming PCs with Windows 11. The upcoming Xbox Ally devices will have an Xbox button, which opens a handheld-friendly task switcher with a long press. Microsoft has tweaked the task switcher on handhelds so it has new animations, and it’s not clear if this same interface will come to all Windows 11 gaming PCs.You can already use a single press of the Xbox button on handhelds or controllers to open the Game Bar in Windows 11, and access widgets, games, and performance information. Microsoft has started testing this change with Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel, so they should be available to all Windows 11 users in the coming months.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Tom WarrenCloseTom WarrenSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tom WarrenGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPC GamingClosePC GamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PC GamingTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechWindowsCloseWindowsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WindowsXboxCloseXboxPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All XboxMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
