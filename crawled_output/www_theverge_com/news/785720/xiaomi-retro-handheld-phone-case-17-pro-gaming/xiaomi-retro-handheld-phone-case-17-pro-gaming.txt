He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.Have you ever thought your favorite mobile games would be improved by awkward ergonomics, a dreadful D-pad, and a couple of camera lenses blocking a third of the screen? Then oh boy, does Xiaomi have the phone for you.Today it announced its flagship 17 series phones in China, led by the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max (any naming similarity to Apple is resolutely not a coincidence). Those two Pro models mostly stand out for the inclusion of a second screen on the back, which stretches across the wide camera island. It can be used to frame selfies, set timers, and control music playback, but all I can think about is Xiaomi’s official accessory to convert the phone into a ratchet Game Boy.The ¥299 (about $40) Retro Handheld Console Case includes four face buttons, a circular D-pad that looks more like an iPod Click Wheel than anything else, and a 200mAh battery that Xiaomi says should deliver 40 days of gameplay, at three hours a day. It even comes with Angry Birds 2.Angry Birds has never had so many lenses. Image: XiaomiThe sole downside — apart from what I can only assume is an incredibly awkward, cramped gaming experience ruined by the two lenses on the screen — is that you can’t use the phone’s wireless charging while the case is in place.No word yet on if, or when, the 17 Pro phones will launch in Europe or anywhere else outside China, but let’s hope the retro case comes with them when they do. Maybe this is a sign that the mad scientists in Xiaomi’s accessory lab are cooking up something even weirder for the fourth-generation photography case for next year’s 17 Ultra.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Dominic PrestonCloseDominic PrestonNews EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Dominic PrestonGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingMobileCloseMobilePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MobileNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPhone CasesClosePhone CasesPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Phone CasesPhonesClosePhonesPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PhonesTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechXiaomiCloseXiaomiPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All XiaomiMost PopularMost PopularLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
