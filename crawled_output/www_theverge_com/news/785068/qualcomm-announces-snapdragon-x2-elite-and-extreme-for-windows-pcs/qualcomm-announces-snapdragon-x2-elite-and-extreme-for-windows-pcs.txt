Today, we’re learning about the second generation of the chip that made it happen, one which’ll now come in two distinct flavors: the Snapdragon X2 Elite and Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme.Qualcomm is making a gigantic claim right in the headline of its press release: it says these are “the fastest and most efficient processors for Windows PCs.” I’m sure Intel and AMD will have something to say about that!From Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Summit video. Image: QualcommBut for now, the company claims its 3nm chips offer up to 31 percent faster CPU performance than the previous-gen Snapdragon X Elite at the same power, or can require 43 percent less power, and with up to 2.3x the GPU performance per watt (not a pure performance boost) from a new 1.85GHz GPU. On the CPU side, it’s using a 3rd-gen Oryon CPU that’ll also feature in Qualcomm’s new mobile flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite 5 chip, but here with up to 18 cores, 12 of which can run up to 4.4GHz, or up to two of them at 5GHz — a clockspeed which Qualcomm says is a first for Arm CPUs.You can see more specs below, and at Qualcomm’s website and overview PDF.Image: QualcommThere’s also a new 80 TOPS Hexagon NPU, for AI tasks, that offers 37 percent more performance with a 16 percent power consumption improvement, and the company claims it’s the fastest laptop NPU by far:Image: QualcommQualcomm’s characterizing all of this as a “legendary leap in performance,” claiming the Elite Extreme in particular offers “up to 75 percent faster CPU performance” than competitors at the same power.While it doesn’t say which competitors it’s talking about in the press release, it appears that Qualcomm is comparing against some of the most powerful (and power-hungry) laptop chips in the market, including the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H and AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, and you can see Qualcomm isn’t labeling both axes of its graphs:Image: QualcommImage: QualcommImage: QualcommQualcomm also claims these power savings will lead to “multi-day battery life,” but that’s what the company already said about last year’s Snapdragon X Elite. (We saw 14 to 18 hours from last year’s laptops, so perhaps that’s multi-day defined as “two eight-hour workdays.”)Image: QualcommStill, these sound like very solid improvements, and some of them come from distinct new portions of the silicon. Gaming on Arm, which still needed work last year, will get a boost from a dedicated new 18MB of high speed cache that Qualcomm’s calling “Adreno High Performance Memory.”And Qualcomm says Adobe creators will see big improvements over last year’s laptops: 28 percent faster photo editing in Photoshop, 43 percent faster exports from Lightroom, and a similar boosts to Premiere video analysis. Razer’s Min-Liang Tan also announced today that Razer will bring its Synapse software to Windows on Snapdragon, which is likely to be a polarizing announcement. He notably did not promise that Razer will make a Snapdragon-based gaming laptop.It’s intriguing to see that the company’s testing its X2 Elite Extreme at over 50W of power; last year, Snapdragon chips were just for thin and light laptops, but 50W lets them scale into bigger PCs.Note that when Qualcomm had its coming out party with Microsoft last year, the laptops arrived later that year. That’s not happening this time around: they’re “expected to be available 1H26,” the company writes.Qualcomm’s announcement also doesn’t mention whether these chips will feature in its hinted-at collaboration with Google on Android for PC, but Sameer Samat, Google’s president of Android Ecosystem, suggested that the merger ChromeOS and Android might be on a similar schedule. “That combination is something we’re super excited about for next year,” he says.Correction, September 24th: The new GPU boasts 2.3x performance per watt than the previous generation, not 2.3x the performance overall.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Sean HollisterCloseSean HollisterSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Sean HollisterGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsLaptopsCloseLaptopsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All LaptopsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
