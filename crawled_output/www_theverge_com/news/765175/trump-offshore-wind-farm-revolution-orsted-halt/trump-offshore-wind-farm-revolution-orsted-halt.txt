She is also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home, a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals.The Revolution Wind farm was already 80 percent complete before the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management sent it a letter Friday to “halt all ongoing activities” to address purported national security concerns and “interference” with other potential uses for the area.The move comes as data centers, domestic manufacturing, and electric vehicles are raising electricity demand, putting more pressure on power grids across the US. Nevertheless, President Donald Trump has waged his war against wind farms, attempting to eliminate competition to the fossil fuel industry that backed Trump’s campaign.The Trump administration similarly paused construction of the Empire Wind farm off the coast of New York state earlier this year, which reportedly cost its developers $50 million a week before it was allowed to start work again.Revolution Wind is supposed to provide enough electricity for more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut after coming online next year. It has already received federal and state permits to operate. Ørsted, one of the project’s developers, says it’s evaluating its legal options.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Justine CalmaCloseJustine CalmaSenior Science ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Justine CalmaClimateCloseClimatePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ClimateEnergyCloseEnergyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EnergyEnvironmentCloseEnvironmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EnvironmentNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsScienceCloseSciencePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ScienceMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
