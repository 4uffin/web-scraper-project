Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.Disney is bringing back Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talk show, but a notable chunk of ABC affiliates won’t air the new episodes. Nexstar and Sinclair Broadcasting — which control about one quarter of local ABC stations, according to Deadline — announced that they will continue to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! and air different programming in that timeslot instead.Last week, FCC Chair Brendan Carr said broadcasters will need to “find ways to change conduct to take action on Kimmel” or else face FCC involvement following Kimmel’s comments about politicians’ reactions to the shooting of Charlie Kirk, before Disney temporarily suspended the show.The Hollywood Reporter notes that Sinclair owns or controls 38 ABC affiliates, while Nexstar operates 28 stations. The blackout means the show won’t air in several major markets across the US, including Portland, Oregon; New Orleans, Louisiana; Nashville, Tennessee; Salt Lake City, Utah; Richmond, Virginia; Seattle, Washington, and others, accounting for around 25 percent of the US TV audience. Nexstar says Jimmy Kimmel Live! will still be available “nationwide on multiple Disney-owned streaming products.”RelatedYes, Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension was government censorshipThis is part of Disney’s legacy nowDuring the Concordia Annual Summit on Monday, Carr denied that the FCC influenced decisions around the show, claiming, “Jimmy Kimmel is in the situation that he’s in because of his ratings, not because of anything that’s happened at the federal government level,” as reported by Variety.Nexstar issued a statement on Tuesday saying the broadcaster stands by Disney’s original decision to suspend the show “pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue.” Sinclair similarly said that its affiliates will replace Jimmy Kimmel Live! with news programming while it evaluates the “potential return” of the show.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothDisneyCloseDisneyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All DisneyEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyPoliticsClosePoliticsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PoliticsSpeechCloseSpeechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SpeechStreamingCloseStreamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All StreamingMost PopularMost PopularForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
