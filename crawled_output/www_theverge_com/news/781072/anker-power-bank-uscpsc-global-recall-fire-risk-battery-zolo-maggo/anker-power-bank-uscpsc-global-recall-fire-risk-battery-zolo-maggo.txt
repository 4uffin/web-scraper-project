The agency has received 33 reports of incidents involving fires and explosions caused by the power banks, with four of them causing “minor burn injuries” and one resulting in “substantial property damage.” In total about 481,000 Anker power banks are part of the recall.The recalled units are all external batteries that can be used to charge devices like smartphones and tablets when connected with a USB cable, while one also features a wireless charging pad. They include the Anker Power Bank (model A1257 and A1647), Anker MagGo Power Bank (model A1652), and Anker Zolo Power Bank (model A1681 and A1689). The model numbers can be located on the back or side of the recalled power banks which were sold through Best Buy, Target, Amazon, AliExpress, Walmart, eBay, and TikTok between August 2023 and June 2025.Anker says the likelihood of one of the power banks malfunctioning is “considered minimal,” but issued the global recall “out of an abundance of caution” after identifying a potential issue with lithium-ion batteries from one of its suppliers.Consumers with a recalled unit should immediately stop using it and properly dispose of it through a facility that can safely handle lithium-ion batteries. They should not be placed in the trash, recycling bins, or the used battery boxes found at many retailers. (Please do not put it in the garbage!) Anker is offering a full refund or a gift card that can be used to purchase other Anker products. You’ll need to fill out a refill form and provide the serial number of your power bank as well as a proof of purchase.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularNest is dead, long live Google HomeI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failureFirst look at the Google Home app powered by GeminiAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
