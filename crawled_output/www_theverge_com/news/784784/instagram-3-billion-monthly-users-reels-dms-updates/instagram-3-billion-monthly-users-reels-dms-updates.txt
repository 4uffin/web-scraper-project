This milestone comes almost four years after Instagram reportedly hit 2 billion monthly users in December 2021, catching up to other Meta platforms. Zuckerberg announced that Facebook had surpassed 3 billion users in January, followed by WhatsApp in April.We’ve asked Meta if the new Instagram milestone includes users for its X rival Threads, which launched in July 2023 and requires users to sign up using an Instagram or Facebook account. Bloomberg reports that private messaging and Reels short-form video features are Instagram’s biggest growth drivers, and are what the platform is now focusing on for upcoming updates.Instagram head Adam Mosseri told the publication that upcoming changes include making DMs and Reels easier to find on the platform’s home screen navigation bar, and an algorithm update that allows users to influence which topics appear more or less frequently in Instagram and Reels feeds.Zuckerberg shared a preview of Instagram’s algorithm update on his broadcast channel.Instagram is also planning to run tests in India and South Korea that will default users to Reels when opening the app, in an effort to take advantage of India’s TikTok ban.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedInstagramCloseInstagramPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All InstagramMetaCloseMetaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MetaNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
