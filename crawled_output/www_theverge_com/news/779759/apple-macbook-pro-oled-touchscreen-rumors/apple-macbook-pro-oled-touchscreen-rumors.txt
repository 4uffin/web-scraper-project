The change could apply to OLED MacBook Pro models that are expected to enter production by late 2026, Kuo reported on X, and will incorporate a “touch panel using on-cell touch technology.”This builds on previous reports from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman regarding Apple’s interest in developing touchscreen MacBooks, having said two years ago that the company may launch its first touch-panel Mac in 2025 “as part of a larger update to the MacBook Pro.” Gurman revisited these rumors in June, saying that he expects “future iPads and Macs to both have touch screens (with vibrant OLED displays), run the same apps, and have similar user interfaces.”With the release of iPadOS 26, the iPad took a big step towards being a computer — maybe now it’s the MacBook’s turn to embrace the touchscreen interface an entire generation has been weaned upon. “This shift appears to reflect Apple’s long-term observation of iPad user behavior,” Kuo said, suggesting that adding touch controls could boost productivity for MacBook users in “certain scenarios.” I’m curious to see if future touchscreen MacBook Pro models will adopt Apple Pencil support or if that’s a step too far.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
