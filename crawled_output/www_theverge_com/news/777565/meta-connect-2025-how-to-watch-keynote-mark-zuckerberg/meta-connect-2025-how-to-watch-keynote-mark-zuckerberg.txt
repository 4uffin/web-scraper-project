He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Meta is about to kick off its annual Connect conference, beginning with a keynote address from CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday night. Zuckerberg plans to discuss “the latest on AI glasses” and will lay out “Meta’s vision for artificial intelligence and the metaverse,” according to the Connect website.As my colleague Victoria Song writes, Meta’s smart glasses are due for a major upgrade, and based on a leaked video from Meta, it seems like the company will announce exactly such a product during Connect: its first glasses with a screen. That video also showed new wraparound Oakley smart glasses. And Meta’s mention of the metaverse makes me think that Meta’s Horizon OS and VR work will get some airtime, as well.Zuckerberg’s keynote kicks off at the unusually late time of 8PM ET / 5PM PT. You can register on Meta’s Connect website to watch the livestream, and Meta also says you can watch the keynote from its Meta for Developers Facebook page or inside Horizon Worlds. The Verge will be covering the event live.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsMetaCloseMetaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MetaNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechVirtual RealityCloseVirtual RealityPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Virtual RealityWearableCloseWearablePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All WearableMore in this streamSee allI know why Mark Zuckerberg risked live demo failureSean HollisterSep 19Meta is opening up its smart glasses to developersJay PetersSep 18A native Discord app is coming to Quest VR headsets.Jay PetersSep 18Most PopularMost PopularAnker’s recent power bank recall involves over 481,000 unitsMeta’s failed smart glasses demos had nothing to do with the Wi-FiNest is dead, long live Google HomeI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoYes, Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension was government censorshipThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
