It includes a major UI overhaul based on Apple’s new Liquid Glass design language that will feature an extensive use of transparent effects on windows, buttons, and notifications. Tahoe’s menu bar will also be completely transparent, making displays seem a bit larger.RelatedApple’s Liquid Glass redesign is shaping up to be a snoozer on MacsmacOS’ Spotlight search tool and launcher will be more useful with Tahoe, ranking search results intelligently based on relevance and allowing users to perform specific actions with apps like sending an email or creating a note without having to actually open those specific apps. If you like to keep your Mac immaculately organized you can now change the colors of folders or add an emoji to make them stand out.The new Phone app can route calls from your iPhone to your desktop so you don’t need to reach for your smartphone to answer them.

It will include access to recents and voicemails, as well as new iOS features like Call Screening that can answer calls from unknown numbers for you and Hold Assist that can stay on the line until a real person responds.
