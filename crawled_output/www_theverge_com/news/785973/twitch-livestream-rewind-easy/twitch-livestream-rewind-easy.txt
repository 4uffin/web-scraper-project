He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Twitch is launching a feature this week I’ve wanted for a very long time: the ability to scrub back on a livestream right from a streamer’s main channel page. You can already look back at previous parts of livestreams as they’re going on by clicking through to the Videos section of a streamer’s profile, but it seems like this change will be a much easier way to rewind and see what you missed.Rewinding will be available first on the web, and initially only for Twitch Turbo subscribers or for channels that you subscribe to individually. Twitch is doing this more limited launch to start because the company needs to make sure that the feature doesn’t become a way to get around ads, CEO Dan Clancy says in a livestream. Twitch plans to release the feature to everyone at some point in the future and is also working on bringing it to mobile.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersCreatorsCloseCreatorsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All CreatorsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechTwitchCloseTwitchPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TwitchMost PopularMost PopularLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
