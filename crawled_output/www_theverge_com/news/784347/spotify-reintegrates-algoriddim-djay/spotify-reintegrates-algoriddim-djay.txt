He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.After pulling support for third-party DJ apps, Spotify Premium subscribers can once again log in and start streaming their playlists and queueing up requests directly from the Mac and Windows versions of Algoriddim’s popular djay software, as well as rekordbox and Serato. Right now Spotify integration is only available on desktop apps and neither Spotify nor Algoriddim has commented on the possibility of the feature coming to the mobile apps.When I started DJing at my local community streaming radio station, I relied on a combination of Spotify and Algoriddim’s djay. But, back in 2020 Spotify unceremoniously decided to kill off that integration, reportedly due to licensing issues. The company’s Terms of Service expressly forbid the mixing of Spotify songs. I guess those roadblocks have been sorted out, though, because Spotify is back in the djay app.Thankfully you can enjoy integration even with the free version of the djay app, though paying for a Pro subscription does add hardware integration, some effects, and other features that will be appreciated by more serious DJs. In the years since Spotify pulled support, Algoriddim continued to integrate with Tidal and SoundCloud, and added support for Apple Music. If you were using djay to, you know, DJ, in any serious capacity, chances are that you’ve already jumped to one of those services.Interestingly, even before it revoked access to third-party DJ apps in 2020, Spotify’s support for DJs was pretty limited. Algoriddim was certainly the biggest name on that list, but now its also adding support for rekordbox and Serato, arguably the two most popular pieces of DJ software.Updated September 24th: Added information about Serato and rekordbox support. 0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Terrence O'BrienCloseTerrence O'BrienWeekend EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Terrence O'BrienEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentMusicCloseMusicPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MusicNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsSpotifyCloseSpotifyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SpotifyStreamingCloseStreamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All StreamingMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Logitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersYou can now upgrade a retro Casio watch with Bluetooth, step tracking, and gamesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
