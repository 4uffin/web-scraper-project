Previously, he wrote about health, science and tech for Forbes.Business Insider has told journalists they can use AI to create first drafts of stories and suggested it won’t notify readers that AI was used, according to Status, a newsletter covering the media industry. The policy makes the outlet one of the first to formally allow such extensive use of the technology.The AI guidelines were reportedly circulated in an internal memo from editor-in-chief Jamie Heller on Thursday. The policy authorized journalists to deploy AI “like any other tool” for tasks like research and image editing, Status reported.A dedicated FAQ reportedly addressed whether journalists can explicitly use AI to assist with writing first drafts. “Yes, but you must make sure your final work is yours,” it answered. The guidelines stressed final products must be the journalist’s own work, however, adding that journalists would be responsible for stories under their name.Disclaimers warning audiences AI has been used will probably not accompany articles, Status said, though disclaimers would be attached to entirely AI-generated or unvetted content.AI has divided the news industry, undermining business models, sparking allegations of theft by AI companies, and creating new risks for publishers, something Business Insider knows firsthand after publishing AI-generated stories by a supposed freelancer this summer.Business Insider has been quick to embrace AI in support of its business. It appointed an AI newsroom lead and implemented an array of initiatives like an AI search tool, for example, and parent company Axel Springer inked licensing deals with tech companies like OpenAI and Microsoft.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Robert HartCloseRobert HartAI ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Robert HartAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AINewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
