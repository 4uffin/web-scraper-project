The new Aurzen D1R Cube will have access to popular streaming apps like Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon Prime, plus Roku Originals and over 500 FAST live channels.The D1R Cube is available starting today for $169.99 through Amazon and Aurzen’s online store in gray, white, and green color options. Alongside the $299 tri-fold Zip, the Cube will be one of Aurzen’s most aggressively priced projectors. But its limited capabilities will potentially make it better suited as a portable solution for bringing movie night along on your next camping trip instead of the centerpiece of your home theater setup.Aurzen says the Cube is capable of projecting an image up to 150 inches in size. With just 330 ANSI lumens of brightness, though, you’ll want a reflective screen and a completely dark room to avoid an image that’s dim or washed-out. For comparison, the Soundcore Nebula X1 Pro projector that Anker announced at IFA 2025 boasts 3,500 ANSI lumens of brightness. And while the Cube does support 4K content, it only displays it at 1080p.The Cube includes a pair of 5W speakers but supports Bluetooth for connecting to other home theater audio gear or wireless headphones. Image: RokuDespite its budget-minded pricing, the D1R Cube includes features like automatic focus and keystone adjustments for easier setup, 5W built-in speakers located on either side, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth for connecting the projector to louder wireless speakers or headphones. It also supports Apple AirPlay so you can stream video and audio directly from your iPhone and iPad. You can use Roku’s mobile app as a remote control with voice commands, and Roku Smart Home lets you get notifications from other smart devices around your home, including access to live feeds from security cameras.The majority of the all-in-one projectors available today, including models from Xgimi and Anker, feature Google TV. Although that OS provides access to a larger variety of apps (including games) when compared to Roku TV, many entry-level projectors running Google TV have not been certified to natively access Netflix, requiring additional hardware like a dongle to use one of the most popular streaming apps. Roku TV provides not only that app but access to a lot of subscription-free content, including FAST channels and the library from the defunct streaming platform Quibi, which Roku acquired in early 2021.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsSmart HomeCloseSmart HomePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Smart HomeStreamingCloseStreamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All StreamingTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
