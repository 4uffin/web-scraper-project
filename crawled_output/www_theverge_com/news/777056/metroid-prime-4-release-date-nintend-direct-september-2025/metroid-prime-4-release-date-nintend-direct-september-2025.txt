Clocking in at a luxurious 60 minutes, the direct covered a bunch of games (and movies) coming in the latter quarter of the year and beyond. But one of the bigger pieces of news was Metroid Prime 4: Beyond which Nintendo has announced will launch on December 4th.Along with the release date, Nintendo revealed another look at the game. In the teaser, Samus has gone beyond the cramped quarters of derelict space stations and alien-haunted caves to cruise wide-open sand dunes on a brand new speeder bike that we’ve never seen before. It was so cool and interesting-looking that it almost felt like a completely different game.Metroid Prime 4 has the ignominious distinction of being one of the rare first-party Nintendo games to get stuck in development hell. This game was announced way, way back in 2017. Metroid Prime 4 is so old that when it was announced: Reggie Fils-Amié was still the Nintendo of America boss, the original Switch was just three months old, and… we still had an E3 which is where the game was first announced.The reason for this extensive development time was that apparently Nintendo wasn’t satisfied with the way the game was progressing and rebooted its development back in 2019. In the years since, Nintendo remained quiet on Samus’ next first person 3D adventure while releasing two other Metroid games and remastering Metroid Prime in the interim.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Ash ParrishCloseAsh ParrishVideo Games ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Ash ParrishEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsNintendoCloseNintendoPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NintendoTrailersCloseTrailersPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TrailersMore in this streamSee allFight for glory in Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave coming to the Switch 2 next yearAsh ParrishSep 12Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s first DLC will take you to the Mega DimensionCharles Pulliam-MooreSep 12Go even more bananas.Andrew WebsterSep 12Most PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
