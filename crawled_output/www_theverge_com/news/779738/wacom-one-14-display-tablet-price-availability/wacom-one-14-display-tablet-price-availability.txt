Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.Wacom has introduced a new 14-inch creative display tablet to its entry-level product line for students and hobbyists. The Wacom One 14 is a smidge larger than the One 12 and One 13 touch pen display tablets that Wacom launched in 2023, providing a bigger digital canvas for users to sketch, edit photos, and sculpt 3D models while still being compact and light enough to toss into a backpack.It’s available to buy today for $299.95. That’s significantly less than the $400 launch price for the smaller Wacom One 12 (which has since dropped to $210 on Wacom’s website), and unlike the smaller model, the Wacom One 14 comes with a battery-free Wacom One Standard Pen stylus and USB-C cable included in the box. It’s thinner and the bezels around the display have been slimmed down, but otherwise, its design is similar to the smaller models. It needs to be connected to a laptop or computer to work, and supports Windows, Mac, and Chromebook devices.The Wacom One 14 features an IPS display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. It’s nothing fancy — lacking support for Wacom’s 10-finger multitouch gestures, for example — but that’s the point. The target demographic for this tablet is people looking to buy their first artist display tablet, or those who don’t need all the professional features and higher resolutions provided by Wacom’s more expensive Cintiq range. That $300 price can also help Wacom to better compete against more affordable offerings from competing tablet providers like Huion, XP-Pen, and Gaomon.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jess WeatherbedCloseJess WeatherbedNews ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jess WeatherbedCreatorsCloseCreatorsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All CreatorsDesignCloseDesignPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All DesignGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Xiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
