He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Valve has rolled out a new “personalized” menu for the Steam store that’s intended to make it easier for you to “browse the store and discover new games.”As part of the changes, Valve combined the long column of links to the left and the blue menu at the top into one new top menu. Valve has moved recommendations into one tab “so you can explore new games and content without having to sift through multiple areas.” The Categories tab is also now “fully personalized” with hubs based on things like genres or games that are great on Steam Deck that you can dive into.Image: Valve“With these changes, we’re aiming to make your experience smoother and more tailored to your needs,” Valve says. “We’ve been hearing from players, and experiencing ourselves, that some of the most commonly visited areas of Steam were hard to get to. So whether you’re a frequent shopper or looking to build your game library, this new layout is designed to get you where you want to go with less effort.”Valve initially rolled out the changes in beta in July.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPC GamingClosePC GamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PC GamingMost PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
