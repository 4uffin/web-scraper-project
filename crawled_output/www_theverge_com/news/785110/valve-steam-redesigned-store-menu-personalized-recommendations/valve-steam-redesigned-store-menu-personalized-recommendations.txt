He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Valve has rolled out a new “personalized” menu for the Steam store that’s intended to make it easier for you to “browse the store and discover new games.”As part of the changes, Valve combined the long column of links to the left and the blue menu at the top into one new top menu. Valve has moved recommendations into one tab “so you can explore new games and content without having to sift through multiple areas.” The Categories tab is also now “fully personalized” with hubs based on things like genres or games that are great on Steam Deck that you can dive into.Image: Valve“With these changes, we’re aiming to make your experience smoother and more tailored to your needs,” Valve says. “We’ve been hearing from players, and experiencing ourselves, that some of the most commonly visited areas of Steam were hard to get to.
