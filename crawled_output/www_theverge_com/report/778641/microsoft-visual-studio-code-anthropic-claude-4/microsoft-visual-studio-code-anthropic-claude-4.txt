Sources familiar with Microsoft’s developer plans tell me that the company has been instructing its own developers to use Claude Sonnet 4 in recent months.“Based on internal benchmarks, Claude Sonnet 4 is our recommended model for GitHub Copilot,” said Julia Liuson, head of Microsoft’s developer division, in an internal email in June. While that guidance was issued ahead of the GPT-5 release, I understand Microsoft’s model guidance hasn’t changed.Microsoft is also making “significant investments” in training its own AI models. “We’re also going to be making significant investments in our own cluster. So today, MAI-1-preview was only trained on 15,000 H100s, a tiny cluster in the grand scheme of things,” said Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman, in an employee-only town hall last week.Microsoft is also reportedly planning to use Anthropic’s AI models for some features in its Microsoft 365 apps soon. The Information reports that the Microsoft 365 Copilot will be “partly powered by Anthropic models,” after Microsoft found that some of these models outperformed OpenAI in Excel and PowerPoint.OpenAI and Microsoft announced a new deal last week that could clear the way for the AI startup’s initial public offering. Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI since 2019, and has a complex revenue sharing agreement in place. Microsoft now allows OpenAI to lean on rival cloud providers, and is expected to reveal further details about the “next phase” of its OpenAI relationship soon.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Tom WarrenCloseTom WarrenSenior EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Tom WarrenAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIAnthropicCloseAnthropicPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AnthropicMicrosoftCloseMicrosoftPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MicrosoftOpenAICloseOpenAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All OpenAIReportCloseReportPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ReportTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularApple iPhone Air review: statement pieceVideoHere’s the Jimmy Kimmel clip that got him pulled off the airI regret to inform you Meta’s new smart glasses are the best I’ve ever triedVideoRepublicans are honoring Charlie Kirk’s memory by declaring war on the First AmendmentThe iPhone 17 is the one to get this yearThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
