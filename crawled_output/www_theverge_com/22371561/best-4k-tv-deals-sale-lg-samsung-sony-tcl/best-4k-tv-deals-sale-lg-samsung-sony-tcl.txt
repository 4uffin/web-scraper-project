He previously wrote for Business Insider, Rolling Stone, Futurism, and Popular Science.Things are looking bright for those who want to nab a great TV in 2025 at a substantial discount. There’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, Sony, TCL, Hisense, or Amazon’s own Fire TV brand — even if the biggest discounts remain reserved for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, and during the lead-up to the Super Bowl.Right now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary screen for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built to provide the ultimate gaming or cinematic experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals.In this articleThe best 4K TV deals for most peopleThe best 4K TV deals for those on a budgetThe best deals on high-end 4K TVsRelatedDolby Vision 2 goes beyond HDR with more AI and ‘authentic motion’ smoothingLG’s StanbyMe 2 is an unquestionably cool TV at a questionably high priceApps for Google TV and Android TV must offer 64-bit versions by next AugustThe best 4K TV deals for most peopleSamsung Q8FSamsung’s Q8F is available for an all-time low of $599.99 ($150 off) at Amazon and Best Buy for the 55-inch model, which is a solid value for a QLED 4K TV. Its quantum dot LED panel boasts great contrast (especially in HDR content). The Q8F has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.0 ports. This means you can play in 4K at up to 60Hz with a Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series S/X, or a PlayStation 5 Pro, or at a faster 120Hz refresh rate bumped down to 1440p resolution. Samsung is also including two free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with purchase, which will allow you to stream games directly to your TV through the cloud, eliminating the need for a console.The TV is powered by Samsung’s Q4 AI processor, which is used to upscale HD video to 4K when necessary, to optimize the picture in real-time, and make navigating its interface feel snappy. Samsung also touts the Q8F’s audio system, which adjusts the EQ and boost dialogue volume when needed. If you’ve cut the cord with cable, you can watch over 2,700 free channels of TV (over 400 of which are exclusive to Samsung TVs) in addition to streaming services. You can save $302 by jumping up to the 85-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,697.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.Samsung Q8F$600$74820% off$600$600 at Amazon (55-Inch)$600 at Best Buy (55-Inch)$1698 at Amazon (85-Inch)If you’re looking for a 65-inch TV for watching sports, TV shows, movies, or playing video games, Hisense’s U65QF is a great choice, one you can currently purchase at Amazon and Best Buy for around $649.99 ($350 off). The TV features a native 144Hz refresh rate and two HDMI 2.1 ports, both of which can take full advantage of the high-speed display. It also sports a pair of HDMI 2.0 ports — which can carry a 4K signal at up to 60Hz — and a port assortment that makes it a good choice for current-gen consoles, 4K Blu-ray players, and streaming devices. If you connect a gaming PC with an AMD graphics card, you can even take advantage of the TV’s support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, which reduces graphical glitches such as screen tearing.The U65QF has an LED screen, which means it can’t match the black levels or per-pixel brightness control you’d get with an OLED display. However, its full array lighting panel offers 300 local dimming zones. The TV can control the brightness of each zone to reduce blooming, which is what happens when the area around a bright object (think a lit torch in a cave) looks unnaturally bright. Additionally, the TV has a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, so the image it produces should look good even in a room with some light interference. The U65QF also supports Dolby Vision, HLG, and HDR10 Plus for better color reproduction, and it features a Hi-View AI chip that automatically processes the image on screen so that it appears sharper.As for its operating system, Hisense’s U65QF runs on Amazon’s Fire OS and features Amazon Alexa built in. You can use the smart assistant to control the TV’s many functions, search for content, control compatible smart home accessories, and look up answers to various questions with your voice. If you want an even larger screen, you can also pick up a 75-inch model for $849.99 ($450 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.Hisense U65QF TV (2025)$597$100040% off$597$597 at Amazon (65-inch)$650 at Best Buy (65-inch)$650 at Amazon (75-inch)The best 4K TV deals for those on a budgetAmazon Fire TV 4-SeriesAmazon’s Fire TV 4-Series is an affordable option if you want to upgrade a smaller HDTV to a 4K model. The 50-inch model is currently on sale for $289.99 ($110 off) at Amazon. The TV features an LED panel with a 60Hz refresh rate and support for HDR10 / HLG, which is totally sufficient for casual TV viewing or watching movies and TV shows. It runs Fire OS, and comes with a remote that allows you to summon Amazon Alexa with the push of a button for a query or command. You can step up to a 55-inch model for $359.99 ($100 off) if you like its modest feature set but want a slightly larger screen.Amazon Fire TV 4-Series$290$40028% off$290$290 at Amazon (50-Inch)$360 at Amazon (55-Inch)Hisense QD7If your budget is under $500, the 55-inch Hisense QD7 has a lot to offer, especially now that it’s on sale for around $399.99 ($1oo off) at Amazon and Best Buy. It features a QLED panel that can deliver more contrast and brightness than a typical LED TV, with support for HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision, with a peak brightness of 600 nits. The 4K set features a processor capable of AI upscaling and full array local dimming with 160 local dimming zones. A panel with full array local dimming offers better control of brightness and contrast than direct- or edge-lit LED panels (this video from LG shows how it works), providing a more consistent picture across the entire screen. The QD7’s obvious weak point is gaming, due to its 60Hz refresh rate, but if that’s not important to you, it remains a superb value. If you want a larger TV, you can get a 65-inch model for $499.99 ($100 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.Hisense QD7$400$50020% off$400$400 at Amazon (55-Inch)$400 at Best Buy (55-Inch)$500 at Amazon (65-Inch)The best deals on high-end 4K TVsSony Bravia 8 II OLEDIf you want a TV that produces reference-quality images, Sony’s Bravia 8 II (K65XR80M2) is the best choice. It was recently selected as the top TV in Valve Electronics’ 10th annual TV Shootout based on objective and subjective tests conducted by a panel of experts comparing each set to the image on a $43,000 reference monitor. Disclosure: Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel was one of the judges. The 55-inch model also recently received a substantial price cut, dropping it to $2,598.99 ($401 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.Sony’s premium set has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, with two HDMI 2.1 ports that support 4K at 120Hz, and two HDMI 2.0 ports that top out at 4K / 60Hz. It doesn’t support Nvidia’s G-Sync or AMD’s FreeSync Pro, so there aren’t any specific features on this TV that PC gamers can take advantage of. Sony calls the Bravia 8 II its brightest OLED screen yet, and testing conducted by Hometheaterreview found its maximum brightness was 1,880 nits when viewing HDR content. Its predecessor topped out at 1,300 nits HDR video, or roughly 44 percent dimmer.The TV runs on Sony’s XR processor, which uses AI to adjust the color, contrast, and clarity of whatever you’re watching in real time to look better. The judges in the aforementioned TV Shootout chose Sony’s set as the best model for SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) processing, but third of four models compared for HDR (High Dynamic Range) processing. Any OLED TV can show true black, but judges agreed that the Bravia 8 II pulled ahead in grayscale and contrast when viewing SDR video.Sony says its TV has modes calibrated for Netflix, Prime Video, and its own Sony Pictures Core streaming services, too. Sony Picture Core is a streaming service that’s available on select Bravia TVs and Sony gaming consoles, and allows you to stream or download 4K movies at far higher bitrates than competing services. The Bravia 8 II comes with 10 credits, which you can use to download movies for offline viewing, and two years of unlimited streaming for films in its catalogue.If you want this TV in a larger size, Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo are offering the 65-inch model for around $3,098 ($402 off).Sony Bravia 8 II$2598$300013% off$2598$2598 at Amazon (55-inch)$2598 at B&H Photo (55-inch)$3098 at Amazon (65-inch)LG C4 OLEDThe last-gen LG C4 remains one of the best OLED TVs you can buy, and the 65-inch model is currently on sale for around $1,396.99 ($1,303 off) at Amazon, B&H Photo, and Best Buy. Like LG’s newer C5 OLED, it has a 120Hz panel with support for VRR, Nvidia G-Sync, and AMD FreeSync Premium (the option exists to enable a 144Hz mode if you dig in the TV’s options). Its embedded A9 AI Processor Gen7 offers higher-quality video upscaling and image optimization compared to the C3. The biggest difference between the C4 and C5 is their maximum brightness. The C4 tops out at an advertised 1,000 nits, while the C5 tops out at around 1,165 according to tests conducted by Tom’s Guide.Additionally, the C4 features a three-channel audio system, which might sound impressive compared to other TVs, but still can’t compete with a soundbar. When you’re not watching videos or playing games, you can also enable the C4’s Gallery Mode to display art. Basically, the LG C4 offers many of the same features as the C5, but retails for nearly $400 less. You can also save on the 77-inch model, which is on sale for $1,799.96 ($1,900 off) at B&H Photo.LG C4$1397$159713% off$1397$1397 at Amazon (65-Inch)$1397 at B&H Photo (65-Inch)$1800 at B&H Photo (77-Inch)Sony A95LSony’s 55-inch A95L is a premium TV with features that should appeal to gamers and cinephiles alike, and you can get it for $1,598 ($1,102 off), a return to its all-time low price at Amazon, B&H Photo, and Best Buy. The TV has a 120Hz panel and two HDMI 2.1 ports (four HDMI ports total), so you can play games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second. Its two HDMI 2.0 ports are fine for last-gen consoles like the original Nintendo Switch. If you connect a PS5, the TV will adjust its video settings based on the genre of game you’re playing, which is a nice touch, but games on that console will look incredible on any OLED set.Sony’s Cognitive Processor XR powers the A95L, which enables better motion processing so sports and games look less blurry. It also claims to improve the contrast and colors compared to previous generation Sony TVs. It has a peak brightness of 1,300 nits according to lab tests by Tom’s Guide, which is higher than most of the other OLED TVs we found on sale.The A95L is a Bravia-series TV, which means it can access Sony’s Picture Core. This video on demand service has the highest-bitrate (aka video quality) of any streaming platform, which means what you watch will look closer to an uncompressed 4K Blu-ray than a 4K stream from Netflix. Its library is limited, but Sony includes 10 credits with A95L, so you can download movies to keep forever, and a 24-month subscription that lets you stream videos from the library.If you want a higher-end OLED TV, Sony’s A95L is a great choice and has features you won’t find on non-Sony TVs. You can also get the 65-inch model on sale for around $1,998 ($1,502 off), which matches its all-time low price at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo.Sony A95L$1598$279943% off$1598$1598 at Amazon (55-Inch)$1998 at Amazon (65-Inch)Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
