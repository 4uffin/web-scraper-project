Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.After The Way of Water, James Cameron’s Avatar franchise is turning the fire up next December.At this year’s D23 Expo, James Cameron, Zoe Saldana, and Sam Worthington announced that Avatar: Fire and Ash will hit theaters on December 19th, 2025. Disney also revealed a new title card that makes it seem like the film will focus on Pandora being engulfed in flames.Along with the title card, Disney showed off concept art of the film’s “Ash People” — a new, volcano-dwelling Na’vi clan Cameron has described as embodying the aliens’ darker and more destructive sides.Though Cameron directed Fire and Ash, he’s indicated that he might not direct the fourth and fifth installments of the franchise. Disney hasn’t released any footage, but Cameron teased that while the film’s probably not what audiences are expecting, it’s “definitely” going to be something they want.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Charles Pulliam-MooreCloseCharles Pulliam-MooreFilm & TV ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Charles Pulliam-MooreDisneyCloseDisneyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All DisneyEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentFilmCloseFilmPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All FilmNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsStreamingCloseStreamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All StreamingTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMore in this streamSee all“Honey?
