Google says you can make Gemini your gym buddy, sous-chef, coding partner, creative writing guide, or anything you can dream up. Gems feels similar to OpenAI’s GPT Store that lets you make customized ChatGPT chatbots.You can set up a gem by telling Gemini what to do and how to respond. For instance, you can tell it to be your running coach, provide you with a daily run schedule, and to sound upbeat and motivating. Then, in one click, Gemini will make a gem for you as you’ve described. The Gems feature is available “soon” to Gemini Advanced subscribers.Related:Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Umar ShakirCloseUmar ShakirLast published May 29Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Umar ShakirAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleGoogle I/O 2025CloseGoogle I/O 2025Posts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Google I/O 2025NewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMore in this streamSee allHere’s an early look at Gemini on Gmail’s mobile app.Emma RothMay 24, 2024Google’s new ‘Add to Chromebook’ badge makes web apps easier to find and installUmar ShakirMay 21, 2024Single-tap passkeys are coming to Android 15Victoria SongMay 17, 2024Most PopularMost PopularXiaomi 17 series arrives with secondary screens and enormous batteriesForza Horizon 6 is set in Japan and arrives in 2026Google reveals its Android for PC is coming next yearLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’The Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
