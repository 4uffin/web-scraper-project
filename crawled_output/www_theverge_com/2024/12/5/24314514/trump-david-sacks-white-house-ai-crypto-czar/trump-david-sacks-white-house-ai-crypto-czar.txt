Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty ImagesPresident-elect Donald Trump says that VC and All-In podcast co-host David Sacks will be the “White House A.I. & Crypto Czar.”The appointment of Sacks, who hosted a $300,000-a-person dinner at his San Francisco mansion to fundraise for Trump’s campaign, follows the appointment of fellow PayPal mafia member Elon Musk to co-lead the “Department of Government Efficiency.” According to Bloomberg, like Musk, Sacks will be “a special government employee” who can serve up to 130 days a year without divesting or publicly disclosing his assets.Here’s what Sacks will be tasked with in his role, according to Trump:In this important role, David will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness. David will focus on making America the clear global leader in both areas. He will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship. He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S.Trump says Sacks will also head up the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, an independent advisory committee that exists today. In a second Truth Social post, Trump highlighted Sacks’ history at PayPal (where he worked with Musk) and his founding of Yammer, which Microsoft bought for $1.2 billion in 2012.Sacks is a vocal, longtime supporter of Musk. He’s an investor in SpaceX and played a key role in Musk’s takeover of Twitter. His VC firm, Craft Ventures, has backed tech firms like the AI enterprise startup Glean and Palantir, the Peter Thiel-founded government contractor. Sacks has also become an influential figure in the Republican Party. He spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention and was at Mar-a-Lago on Election Day.Shortly after Trump announced his appointment, leaders from key AI and crypto companies, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, rushed to X to congratulate Sacks. “Great pick,” wrote Coinbase COO Emilie Choi. “@DavidSacks was in crypto early and has a nuanced understanding of the space. Time to build in the US!”Update, December 5th: Added more info about Sacks and responses from tech leaders.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersSenior ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersAlex HeathCloseAlex HeathSources author, Verge contributorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Alex HeathAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AICryptoCloseCryptoPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All CryptoNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyPoliticsClosePoliticsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PoliticsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMore in this streamSee allTrump announces new tech policy picks for his second termWes DavisDec 23, 2024Jeff Bezos is dining with Donald Trump.Wes DavisDec 8, 2024Jeff Bezos says he’s ‘very optimistic this time around’ about TrumpAlex HeathDec 4, 2024Most PopularMost PopularGoogle’s Android for PC: ‘I’ve seen it, it is incredible’Google’s Mixboard is an AI moodboard builderLogitech’s new light-powered keyboard doesn’t even need the sunPlayStation State of Play September 2025: all the news and trailersWe’re living in a golden age of affordable mechanical keyboardsThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
