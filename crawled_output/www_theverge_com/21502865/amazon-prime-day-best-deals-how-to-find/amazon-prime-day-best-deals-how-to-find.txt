The two-day shopping affair will grant Prime members access to some of the best prices of the year on Amazon devices, as well as products from Sony, Sonos, Microsoft, Apple, Withings, and other well-known brands. This applies to items spanning a range of categories, including gaming peripherals, laptops, 4K TVs, phones, PC accessories, and more.In this articleUse a price-tracking tool or deal aggregatorSet up deal alert notifications through Alexa or the Amazon appLook for deals outside of AmazonTrust the expertsAs always, you can count on us to publish only the best deals during Prime Big Deal Days — as well as any worthwhile ones featured at Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and other competing retailers. That said, if you want to be sure you catch any and all deals that are most important to you — or be among the first to know of certain price drops — we’ve compiled some helpful tools and advice.Below, we’ve spelled out a few of our best deal-hunting tips, from how to use automated price trackers to the different ways you can set up your own personalized deal alerts. All of these methods and tools are free to use, and once you put in just a little bit of work, you can rest easy knowing that you don’t need to take much action until it comes time to make a purchase.RelatedKnow the price-matching policies for Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and othersHow to sign up for Amazon PrimeUse a price-tracking tool or deal aggregatorCamelCamelCamel’s extension helps you keep tabs on historical price trends with useful graphs like these. Image: CamelCamelCamelCamelCamelCamelCamelCamelCamel tracks the price of every product sold on Amazon and can send you alerts only when they reach the price that’s right for you. Once a product reaches the desired price you’ve set (or goes below it), you’ll get an email about it. CamelCamelCamel only works for products on Amazon, so you’ll need to use one of the other methods below if you want to track price movement at Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and other retailers.To track prices and get alerts via email, you’ll first need to create a free account. We also suggest installing the site’s browser extension, called The Camelizer, which lets you see pricing trends on a product-by-product basis, and allows you to set your desired price without navigating away from Amazon. It’s fantastic and easy to use.And, if you already have a wishlist saved on Amazon, you can import it into CamelCamelCamel.Slickdeals allows you to set up custom alerts for specific keywords, though finding the right parameters can be a trial and error process. Screenshot: SlickdealsSlickdealsSlickdeals aggregates some of the best deals around the internet, as discovered by its team and community of users. It’s a great place to find a curated set of deals on things you might be interested in. The site also allows you to create deal alerts based on keywords, but they work a little differently on Slickdeals than they do on the above sites.You can type in a product name, like “Sonos Era 100” or a retailer’s name, and once it’s added to your list, you’ll be notified of a deal alert if it meets your criteria. You can set it to alert you to any deal related to your keyword, or you can filter out deals so that you’ll be notified if, for example, the deal is popular enough to make it to Slickdeals’ front page or earned a high rating from the community. Setting these keywords a little too broadly may result in frequent notification pings and emails, though, so you’ll need to use some discretion and find the right balance of how aggressively you want Slickdeals to notify you.Unlike the Honey extension and The Camelizer, Keepa integrates historical pricing data directly into the Amazon product listing. Screenshot: KeepaKeepaKeepa is another handy tool you can use to track and compare Amazon prices over time. Like CamelCamelCamel, Keepa provides charts that track pricing trends and will alert you when it finds a deal. You can also import any wishlists you’ve previously saved on Amazon.Unlike CamelCamelCamel, however, you don’t necessarily need to create an account in order to track prices with Keepa. You just need to install the extension, and Keepa will automatically add a price history graph to supported product listings. The embedded extension features different tabs as well, one of which showcases pricing history and another that allows you to specify various pricing details. Once you’ve set your desired price, you’ll then receive price alerts via email, push notification, or RSS.Set up deal alert notifications through Alexa or the Amazon appIf you’re a Prime member who owns a fourth-gen Echo speaker or a newer model, you can also request that Amazon send you deal notifications up to 24 hours ahead of time on products you’re interested in. Amazon can alert you of price drops on eligible products in your shopping cart or wishlist, as well as anything you’ve marked as “saved for later.” To enable the feature, tap More > Settings > Notifications in the Alexa app, and then tap Amazon Shopping. Then, scroll down to Shopping Recommendations and enable Deal Recommendations. Once done, you’ll receive a notification on both your device and your Echo speaker (the latter in the form of a yellow ring) notifying you of the deal.Alternatively, you can sign up to receive deal alerts regarding products you’ve recently viewed in the Amazon Shopping app, as well as those related to your recent search history. If you’re a Prime member, you just need to navigate to the Prime Day event page in the mobile app between now and July 8th to create an alert. Once done, you’ll receive push notifications for any deal(s) you’ve subscribed to when the event begins. You can also just open the Amazon Shopping app and tap Settings > Notifications > Deals and Recommendations before toggling “Savings” and / or “Recommendations.”Look for deals outside of AmazonPrime Day is meant to show off Amazon’s huge retail presence, so, naturally, other retail chains take notice. Because of this, you can sometimes find better deals at retailers like Target, Walmart, and Best Buy. At the very least, they may be able to match Amazon’s pricing if you ask.If Amazon’s upcoming sale doesn’t have everything you want or if you just want to make sure you’re getting the best deal, shop around a bit. In the past, Target, Walmart, and Best Buy have hosted their own events in an effort to counter Amazon. And as usual, you’ll be able to find all of our deals coverage in and outside of Amazon here.Trust the expertsWe’re a discerning bunch here at The Verge, so don’t fret if you’re going into this without any prep. We’ll be corralling the best tech deals and keeping our coverage up to date in the run-up to the main event. So mark October 7th on your calendar, sign up for Amazon Prime and our new and improved Verge Deals newsletter, and maybe start putting aside a little spending cash.Verge DealsSign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
