Over 250,000 records have been preserved, and the archive posted a Twitter thread yesterday detailing how each record is cleaned and filed away.Each record is cleaned on a machine that sprays distilled water onto its surface. A little vacuum arm then sucks up the water, along with whatever dirt and nastiness has built up in the record’s grooves over the years.The discs are then photographed, and the photos are referenced to pull info from the discs’ labels and add it to the archive’s database by hand. While most of the records are from the biggest record labels like Columbia, RCA Victor, and Capitol, the archive has found 1,700 other labels.Some of the 78s are a treat to look at, including picture discs that have an image printed across the entire surface of the record. I recommend “Vem Vem (The Cuban Kissing Game)” from 1947 and “Night Herding Song” from 1949.78s don’t have standardized groove sizes, so recordings taken with various stylus tips will each sound slightly different. Here, you get four: the records are digitized with custom-built turntables that have four arms, each with a different stylus. Each version is available to download separately, with the file name showing “3.3_CT” for a recording from a 3.3 mil truncated conical stylus and so on.Four styli might make you nervous when we’re talking about preserving fragile records, some of which are over a hundred years old. But most of these 78s are made of hard shellac, which makes them prone to shattering if mishandled, but is also tough enough that the grooves won’t be damaged by a stylus. Modern equipment with diamond tip styli also exert much less force than old players with steel needles, George Blood LP points out.The whole collection is a little overwhelming to dig through, but you can narrow your browsing by year, genre, and artist. If you’d prefer to be surprised, the @great78project Twitter account posts a new record from the collection every hour.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Kait SanchezCloseKait SanchezVerge FellowLast published Nov 1, 2021Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Kait SanchezCultureCloseCulturePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All CultureEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentMusicCloseMusicPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All MusicTL;DRCloseTL;DRPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TL;DRMost PopularMost PopularApple’s iPhone 17 Pro can be easily scratchedDropout’s Sam Reich on business, comedy, and keeping the internet weirdWhy your next car should be an electric cargo bikeVideoThe Steam Deck LCD is 20 percent off through October 6thJimmy Kimmel’s show will return after censorship outrageThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
