Ford is also pivoting from advertising that highlights its specific nameplates to a campaign that’s all about lifestyle, similar to how brands like Rivian are geared toward outdoorsy, adventure types. Lisa Materazzo, Ford Chief Marketing Officer, says:We’ve identified distinct lifestyles that Ford can credibly and uniquely support, and going forward, they will inform decisions throughout the company from product design to retail experience.AExternal LinkComments0Andrew J.

In addition to teasing its new electric GLC — including an illuminated grille with “a total of 942 dots backlit from behind” — the German automaker also plans to launch no fewer than 15 new EVs over the next two years, calling it “the biggest product launch program in the history of Mercedes-Benz.” No argument here.Mercedes Just Teased a Ton of New Vehicles: 'Biggest Product Launch Program in History'[motor1.com]ATwitterComments0Andrew LiszewskiAug 5LinkHonda’s Pokémon Koraidon motorcycle finally hits the racetrack.After first revealing the prototype last March, Honda has finally demonstrated its Koraidon motorcycle, based on one of the mascots from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, in motion at Japan’s Suzuka Circuit.Koraidon moves its four legs in a galloping motion while leisurely rolling down the track, but its tires don’t spin.

The e-commerce giant is expanding its nascent Autos business to include used and certified pre-owned vehicles. Dealers can list their inventory on Amazon, where customers can browse the latest deals while shopping for toilet paper, groceries, and everything else they buy online. The company is promising stellar customer protections, including “a 3-day/300-mile return policy and a minimum 30 day/1,000-mile Limited Warranty on all vehicles.” Amazon is starting with Hyundai dealers, since it already has a preexisting deal with the Korean automaker. And from there it will grow to include other brands and cities.Image: AmazonNewsNewsFord’s planning a ‘Model T moment’ for EVs on August 11thEmma RothJul 31DInstagramComments0Dominic PrestonJul 30LinkChevy teases the next-gen Bolt EV’s redesign.Get a first look at the new fascia, NACS charging port, and brake lights on the Bolt, with Chevy promising “More this fall.”GM killed the Bolt in 2023 before resurrecting it for its newer Ultium battery tech (which... it’s also killing, at least as a brand name).

HawkinsJul 14LinkTariffs are ruining Volvo’s plans to sell new EVs in the US.The Swedish automaker said it will take a one-off, non-cash impairment charge of 11.4 billion Swedish kronor ($1.19 billion) in the second quarter related to two plug-in models: the EX90 and ES90. That means Volvo is basically reducing the value of the EVs on its balance sheet. The reason is because Donald Trump’s tariffs are making it impossible for Volvo to make a profit on these models.

HawkinsJun 23LinkNo tax breaks, no problem.Ford says it will complete the EV battery factory its building in Michigan, even without the generous tax breaks included in the (probably doomed) Inflation Reduction Act. The $3 billion factory is being built in Marshall, about 100 miles west of Detroit, in partnership with China’s CATL. That combination alone (an EV factory? with China?) makes it a likely target of Republicans who are in the process of gutting all the IRA’s clean energy investments. But Ford is sticking with its plan, even without generous tax breaks on the table.“We don’t want to back off on this facility,” Ms. Drake told reporters. “When we invest, we stick behind our investments.
