Promotional art for the expansion seems to suggest that the Hoopa, a mythical pokémon known for creating portals to other dimensions, will be featured in Mega Dimension’s story. Nintendo did not announce exactly when the DLC will drop, but you can pre-order it today through the eShop.Nintendo also revealed that Pokémon Legends Z-A will introduce new mega evolutions for Chesnaught, Delphox, and Greninja, the fully-evolved forms of Pokémon X and Y’s starter pokémon. Up until now, The Pokémon Company has been teasing and revealing new megas one by one with a series of inspired ad campaigns. But with Legends Z-A due to release in about a month, it seems like the company is putting its foot on the gas to get everyone as hyped as possible.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Charles Pulliam-MooreCloseCharles Pulliam-MooreFilm & TV ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Charles Pulliam-MooreGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsNintendoCloseNintendoPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NintendoPokemonClosePokemonPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PokemonMore in this streamSee allFight for glory in Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave coming to the Switch 2 next yearAsh ParrishSep 12Go even more bananas.Andrew WebsterSep 12The Switch 2 gets a little evil.Andrew WebsterSep 12Most PopularMost PopularApple’s new iPhone charger is a (second) of its kindThe unbearable sameness of Liquid GlassiOS 26 with Apple’s Liquid Glass redesign is out nowMicrosoft is changing how Xbox controllers work on Windows 11Meta leaks its new smart glasses with a displayThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
