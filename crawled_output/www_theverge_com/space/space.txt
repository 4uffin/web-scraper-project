It’s located about 35,000 miles from the center of Uranus in an orbit between Ophelia and Bianca.JExternal LinkComments0Jay PetersAug 15LinkSpaceX, a major federal contractor, “has most likely paid little to no federal income taxes since its founding in 2002.”The New York Times has the story.Elon Musk’s SpaceX Most Likely Doesn’t Pay Taxes[The New York Times]NewsNewsAmazon is bringing its Starlink alternative to Australia next yearJess WeatherbedAug 5JExternal LinkComments0Justine CalmaAug 4LinkNASA’s reportedly fast-tracking plans to build a nuclear reactor on the moon.The agency was already working on designing a reactor that might one day provide people with electricity on the moon.

The deployment of 24 Kuiper satellites comes just three hours after 26 Starlink satellites were deployed. Jeff Bezos plans to light up his space Internet service later this year with help from launch partners ULA, Arianespace, and yes, his own Blue Origin. The Kuiper constellation will eventually consist of more than 3,200 satellites, less than half of what Starlink already has operating, with more competitors to come.Amazon’s smallest dish teased in 2023.

After the seventh and eighth flight tests ended in massive explosions, the FAA has expanded the hazard area and required SpaceX to schedule its launch during “non-peak transit periods.”Soon we’ll find out if the extra precaution is necessary for this flight. (Update: It launched, but experienced another rapid unscheduled disassembly.)RExternal LinkComments0Richard LawlerMay 27LinkElon Musk reportedly approached Apple years ago about an iPhone / SpaceX satellite deal.The Information reports that three years ago, Musk offered Apple an 18-month exclusive connection via SpaceX in return for $5 billion up front, and $1 billion per year after that to support satellite-connected iPhone features. If Apple didn’t take it within 72 hours, he threatened to announce a competing feature.Apple went forward with Globalstar (the report also mentions a canceled “Project Eagle” effort with Boeing that would’ve delivered full-blown internet service), and before the iPhone 14 launched, Starlink announced a deal with T-Mobile.
