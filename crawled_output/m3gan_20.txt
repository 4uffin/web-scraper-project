Two years after M3GAN, a marvel of artificial intelligence, went rogue and embarked on a murderous (and impeccably choreographed) rampage and was subsequently destroyed, M3GAN's creator Gemma (Allison Williams) has become a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of A.I. Meanwhile, Gemma's niece Cady (Violet McGraw), now 14, has become a teenager, rebelling against Gemma's overprotective rules. Unbeknownst to them, the underlying tech for M3GAN has been stolen and misused by a powerful defense contractor to create a military-grade weapon known as Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno; Ahsoka, Pacific Rim: Uprising), the ultimate killer infiltration spy. But as Amelia's self-awareness increases, she becomes decidedly less interested in taking orders from humans. Or in keeping them around. With the future of human existence on the line, Gemma realizes that the only option is to resurrect M3GAN (Amie Donald, voiced by Jenna Davis) and give her a few upgrades, making her faster, stronger, and more lethal. As their paths collide, the original A.I. bitch is about to meet her match.

M3GAN 2.0
What to Know
Critics Consensus
M3gan 2.0 swaps the original's horror software for a more action-leaning programming that doesn't prove to be an upgrade, although the quippy A.I. remains an amusing mascot of slay.
Read Critics Reviews
Audience Says
A full upgrade with a T2 framework, M3GAN 2.0 is a sassy output of camp and chaos that twistedly entertains.

Sergio Burstein
Los Angeles Times
In a certain sense, it's better than its predecessor, which undoubtedly has to do with the fact that, this time, Johnstone wrote the script. [Full review in Spanish]

Adam Nayman
Toronto Star
Not everything in “M3GAN 2.0” works, but the stuff that does hits squarely enough to justify the existence of a movie that wryly satirizes mechanical, assembly-line thinking without capitulating to it.
Rated: 3/4

Chicago Reader
I’m less bothered by the obvious inspiration and the curiously pro-AI stance M3GAN 2.0 takes than I am by the fact that it feels like a cash grab on a meme instead of a sequel to a movie.

Bloody Good Horror (Podcast)
It really feels like all the wrong lessons were learned from the success of the first film. Gone is the fun camp with a mean edge, gone are the characters with a whiff of humanity. Gone is the horror entirely.

[M3GAN 2.0] delivers a film that is campy, fun, deliberately in bad taste, with deliberately bad intentions. [Full review in Spanish]

Exclaim!
M3GAN 2.0 does away with the scares and amps up the laughs, pivoting the movie from its creepy roots to whimsical, over-the-top action-comedy. It's an unexpected but brilliant move for the series.
Rated: 7/10

It was extremely disappointing 😞, and frustrating. I really enjoyed the first movie, but this sequel is too convoluted... Please take my word for it, so definitely wait for streaming.
