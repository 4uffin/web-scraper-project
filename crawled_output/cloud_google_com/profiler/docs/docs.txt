Cloud Profiler is a statistical, low-overhead profiler that
continuously gathers CPU usage and memory-allocation information from your
production applications. It attributes that information to the application's
source code, helping you identify the parts of the application consuming the
most resources, and otherwise illuminating the performance characteristics
of the code.
