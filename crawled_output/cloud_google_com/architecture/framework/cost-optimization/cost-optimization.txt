The cost optimization pillar in the
Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
describes principles and recommendations to optimize the cost of your workloads
in Google Cloud.
The intended audience includes the following:
CTOs, CIOs, CFOs, and other executives who are responsible for strategic
cost management.
Architects, developers, administrators, and operators who make decisions
that affect cost at all the stages of an organization's cloud journey.
The cost models for on-premises and cloud workloads differ significantly.
On-premises IT costs include capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational
expenditure (OpEx). On-premises hardware and software assets are acquired and
the acquisition costs are
depreciated
over the operating life of the assets. In the cloud, the costs for most cloud
resources are treated as OpEx, where costs are incurred when the cloud resources
are consumed. This fundamental difference underscores the importance of the
following core principles of cost optimization.
Note: You might be able to classify the cost of some Google Cloud services (like
Compute Engine sole-tenant nodes) as capital expenditure. For more
information, see
Sole-tenancy accounting FAQ.
For cost optimization principles and recommendations that are specific to AI and ML workloads, see
AI and ML perspective: Cost optimization
in the Well-Architected Framework.
Core principles
The recommendations in the cost optimization pillar of the Well-Architected Framework
are mapped to the following core principles:
Align cloud spending with business
value:
Ensure that your cloud resources deliver measurable business value by
aligning IT spending with business objectives.
Foster a culture of cost
awareness:
Ensure that people across your organization consider the cost impact of
their decisions and activities, and ensure that they have access to the cost
information required to make informed decisions.
Optimize resource
usage:
Provision only the resources that you need, and pay only for the resources
that you consume.
Optimize
continuously:
Continuously monitor your cloud resource usage and costs, and proactively
make adjustments as needed to optimize your spending. This approach involves
identifying and addressing potential cost inefficiencies before they become
significant problems.
These principles are closely aligned with the core tenets of
cloud FinOps.
FinOps is relevant to any organization, regardless of its size or maturity in
the cloud. By adopting these principles and following the related
recommendations, you can control and optimize costs throughout your journey in
the cloud.
