Gemini is capable of understanding virtually any input, combining different types of information, and generating almost any output. Prompt and test Gemini in Vertex AI Studio, using text, images, video, or code. Using Gemini’s advanced reasoning and state-of-the-art generation capabilities, developers can try sample prompts for extracting text from images, converting image text to JSON, and even generate answers about uploaded images to build next-gen AI applications.How to use the Gemini APIs: Advanced techniques3:44200+ generative AI models and tools Choose from the widest variety of models with first-party (Gemini, Imagen, Chirp, Veo), third-party (Anthropic's Claude Model Family), and open models (Gemma, Llama 3.2) in Model Garden. Use extensions to enable models to retrieve real-time information and trigger actions. Customize models to your use case with a variety of tuning options for Google's text, image, or code models.Generative AI models and fully managed tools make it easy to prototype, customize, and integrate and deploy them into applications.Explore AI models and APIs in Model GardenView documentationOpen and integrated AI platformData scientists can move faster with Vertex AI Platform's tools for training, tuning, and deploying ML models.Vertex AI notebooks, including your choice of Colab Enterprise or Workbench, are natively integrated with BigQuery providing a single surface across all data and AI workloads.Vertex AI Training and Prediction help you reduce training time and deploy models to production easily with your choice of open source frameworks and optimized AI infrastructure.MLOps for predictive and generative AIVertex AI Platform provides purpose-built MLOps tools for data scientists and ML engineers to automate, standardize, and manage ML projects.Modular tools help you collaborate across teams and improve models throughout the entire development lifecycle—identify the best model for a use case with Vertex AI Evaluation, orchestrate workflows with Vertex AI Pipelines, manage any model with Model Registry, serve, share, and reuse ML features with Feature Store, and monitor models for input skew and drift.MLOps with Vertex AI: Model EvaluationNo cost training Get started Agent Builder Vertex AI Agent Builder enables developers to easily build and deploy enterprise ready generative AI experiences. It provides the convenience of a no code agent builder console alongside powerful grounding, orchestration, and customization capabilities. With Vertex AI Agent Builder developers can quickly create a range of generative AI agents and applications grounded in their organization’s data.View all featuresHow It WorksVertex AI provides several options for model training and deployment:Generative AI gives you access to large generative AI models, including Gemini 2.5, so you can evaluate, tune, and deploy them for use in your AI-powered applications.Model Garden lets you discover, test, customize, and deploy Vertex AI and select open-source (OSS) models and assets.Custom training gives you complete control over the training process, including using your preferred ML framework, writing your own training code, and choosing hyperparameter tuning options.View documentationVertex AI enables faster innovation with enterprise-ready generative AICommon UsesBuild with GeminiCode sampleAccess Gemini models via the Gemini API in Google Cloud Vertex AIView code samples for Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, and CurlPythonPythonJavaScriptJavaGoCurlLoading...model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name="gemini-pro-vision")
