What is Active Assist
Active Assist refers to the portfolio of tools used in Google Cloud to
generate recommendations and insights to help you optimize your Google Cloud
projects. This includes recommenders that generate recommendations and insights
and analysis tools.
Recommenders and Recommendations
Recommenders generate recommendations that fall into six value categories that
can help you optimize your cloud in a variety of ways.
See Recommendations and
Recommenders for a detailed explanation of these
concepts.
Grant permissions to view and update recommendations and insights
Each recommender and insight type has
specific roles and permissions to control access to its recommendations and
insights. In order to enable users to review and assess these recommendations
and insights, they will include some metadata about resources. Granting
these permissions provides users with a partial view of the resource's metadata.
This partial view of data is particularly important to consider if you are using
custom roles to grant permissions.
For example, the Identity and Access Management recommender provides recommendations about
permissions. Members that have the recommender.iamPolicyRecommendations.get
and recommender.iamPolicyRecommendations.list permissions can also see
information about your IAM policy bindings.
Ensure that you have the
necessary roles and permissions
to view recommendations.
Find recommendations and insights
Each recommender lets you view and manage its recommendations and insights using
one or more of the following clients:
Active Assist
In context using the service's user interface (UI) in the Google Cloud console
REST API or Google Cloud CLI
For details about recommenders and supported clients, see
Recommenders.
View recommendations in Active Assist
View your recommendations
Certain recommendations such as the IAM Recommendation require
different levels of permissions to view. For more information, see the guide
for the specific Recommendation that you are looking for.
Manage recommendations and insights
In Active Assist, you can choose to apply or dismiss the
recommendations. Some recommendations can be applied automatically, while other
recommendations require additional steps to complete. Any additional steps will
appear in the details panel.
Apply recommendations
Warning:
Before applying recommendations in the Google Cloud console or
using the API, ensure that impacts are assessed by a reviewer within your organization.
The reviewer should have the knowledge to assess impacts identified in
recommendations, as well as impacts specific to your infrastructure and
business. Applying recommendations without proper assessment could result in
unexpected changes, such as issues with system performance, poor reliability, or
loss of required permissions. If you choose to apply recommendations without
human review, ensure that you have set up a rollback process before making any
changes.
Recommender provides information on direct
impacts in areas such as cost,
performance, or security. Recommendation reviewers should have a holistic
understanding of your infrastructure and processes so that other
business-specific impacts are considered.
Get started with recommendations
Recommendations are an easy way to optimize your cloud to help you maintain a
secure and cost effective workspace. Use the
Active Assist quickstart guide
to get started with the Active Assist.
Alternatively, you can follow the
In Context quickstart guide to find
recommendations directly in your service pages. Recommendations can also be
reviewed and applied or dismissed using the
Google Cloud CLI or REST API.
Intelligence Centers and Tools
Active Assist offers intelligent tools that helps you proactively
monitor and manage your cloud. We offer tools such as the Network Intelligence Center and
Policy Simulator to simplify and automate your management experience on
Google Cloud. Read the following documentation pages for more information on
how our products can help you optimize your cloud experience.
