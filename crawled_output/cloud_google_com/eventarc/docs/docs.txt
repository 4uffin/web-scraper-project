Eventarc overview

Advanced
Standard
Eventarc lets you build event-driven architectures without having to implement,
customize, or maintain the underlying infrastructure.
Eventarc is offered in two editions: Eventarc Advanced and
Eventarc Standard.
Both editions offer a scalable, serverless, and fully managed eventing solution that lets you
asynchronously route messages from sources to targets using loosely coupled services that are
triggered by and react to state changes known as events. Both editions support a range of
event providers and destinations—including Google Cloud services, custom applications, SaaS
applications, and third-party services—while managing delivery, security, authorization,
observability, and error-handling for you.
Note that the underlying data model for both editions of Eventarc is the same. As
a use case grows in complexity, you have the option of seamlessly transitioning from using
Eventarc Standard to using Eventarc Advanced.
Editions overview
The following is an overview of both editions. For more detailed information, see the
Eventarc Advanced overview and the
Eventarc Standard overview.
Eventarc Advanced
Eventarc Advanced is a fully managed platform for building event-driven
architectures. It lets you collect events that occur in a system and publish them to a central
bus. Interested services can subscribe to specific messages by creating enrollments. You
can use the bus to route events from multiple sources in real time and publish them to
multiple destinations, and optionally transform events prior to delivery to a target.
Eventarc Advanced is feature rich and is ideal for organizations with
complex eventing and messaging needs, particularly those grappling with managing numerous
Pub/Sub topics, Kafka queues, or other third-party messaging systems. By providing
administrators with enhanced and centralized visibility and control,
Eventarc Advanced enables organizations to connect multiple teams across
different projects.
Eventarc Advanced lets you receive, filter,
transform, route, and deliver messagesbetween different event providers and
destinations (click diagram to enlarge).
Eventarc Standard
Eventarc Standard is recommended for applications where the focus is on simply
delivering events from event provider to event destination. It lets you quickly and easily
consume Google events by defining triggers that filter inbound events according to their source,
type, and other attributes, and then route them to a specified destination.
Eventarc Standard lets you filter and
route eventsfrom event providers to event destinations (click diagram to enlarge).
