Overview
Cloud Storage pricing is based on the following components:
Data storage: the amount of data stored in your buckets. Storage rates
vary depending on the storage class of your data and location of your buckets.
Data processing: the processing done by Cloud Storage, which
includes operations charges, any applicable retrieval fees, and inter-region
replication.
Network usage: the amount of data read from or moved between your
buckets.
Anywhere Cache: temporary storage layer for your buckets.

If you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on
Cloud Platform SKUs
apply.
Dual-regions are billed to both underlying regions at the above prices. For
example, Standard storage in a dual-region comprised of Iowa and Oregon
will be billed at $0.022 per GB per month for the us-central1 dual-region SKU
and $0.022 per GB per month for the us-west1 dual-region SKU. The six
predefined dual-regions asia1, eur4, eur5, eur7, eur8, and nam4
bill usage against their locational SKUs at the prices listed.
Data storage charges are prorated to the sub-second for each object, and
data storage rates are based on the storage class of each object, not the
default storage class set on the bucket that contains them. Data storage
charges apply in the same way to live objects, noncurrent objects, and
soft-deleted objects.
In addition to the data contained in your uploaded objects, the following
count toward your monthly storage usage:
Custom metadata. For example, for the custom metadata
NAME:VALUE, Cloud Storage counts
each character in NAME and
VALUE as a byte stored with the object.
Uploaded parts of an XML API multipart upload, until the multipart
upload is either completed or aborted.
Minimum storage duration
A minimum storage duration applies to data stored using Nearline storage,
Coldline storage, or Archive storage.
The following table shows the minimum storage duration for each storage class:
Standard storage
Nearline storage
Coldline storage
Archive storage
None
30 days
90 days
365 days
If you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on
Cloud Platform SKUs
apply.
You can delete, replace, or move an object before it has been stored for the
minimum duration, but at the time you delete, replace, or move the object, you
are charged as if the object was stored for the minimum duration. See the
early deletion example to see how charges apply.
Note the following regarding minimum storage durations and early deletion
charges:
Early deletion charges are billed through early delete SKUs.
Early deletion charges apply when rewriting objects, such as when you
change an object's storage class, because a rewrite replaces the
existing object.
Early deletion charges do not apply in the following cases:
When Object Lifecycle Management changes an object's storage class.
When the object exists in a bucket that has Autoclass
enabled.
In buckets that use Object Versioning, early deletion charges apply when
a noncurrent object is deleted, not when it became noncurrent. That object
will become soft deleted if soft delete is enabled. Otherwise it will be
permanently deleted.
In buckets that use soft delete, early deletion charges apply when an
object is soft deleted. These charges are reduced based on the length of the
soft delete retention duration.
For XML API multipart uploads, a part is subject to early deletion
charges if it's not used when assembling the final object, or if the part
is overwritten by another part, or if the multipart upload is aborted.
The storage duration for each part in a multipart upload begins at the
time the upload of the part completes, and the storage duration for the
overall object begins when the object is assembled.
Tags
Each tag that you attach to a bucket is charged at $0.005 per month.
Data processing
Data processing costs consist of the following:
Operation charges for all requests made to Cloud Storage
Retrieval fees for reading data stored in certain storage classes
Inter-region replication charges for data written to dual-regions and
multi-regions
Autoclass charges for buckets with Autoclass
enabled
Storage Intelligence charges for buckets with
Storage Intelligence configured.
Operation charges
Operation charges apply when you perform operations within
Cloud Storage. An operation is an action that makes changes to or
requests information about resources such as buckets and objects in
Cloud Storage.
Operations are divided into three categories: Class A, Class B, and free.
See below for a breakdown of which operations fall
into each class.

1 The storage class for an operation is determined by the
following considerations:
When listing buckets in a project, the Class A Standard storage rate always
applies.
When an operation applies to a bucket, such as listing the objects in a
bucket, the default storage class set for that bucket determines the
operation cost.
When an operation applies to a tag, such as attaching or detaching tags,
the default storage class set for the tagged bucket determines the
operation cost.
When an operation applies to an object, the storage class of that object
determines the operation cost. The following are exceptions to this rule:
When changing the storage class of an object, either yourself or
with Object Lifecycle Management, the Class A rate associated with
the object's destination storage class applies. For example, changing an
object from Standard storage to Coldline storage using Object
Lifecycle Management counts as a Class A operation and is billed at the
Class A operation rate for Coldline storage. Changing storage classes
can have a significant billing impact, especially when a high proportion
of objects are under 1 MB in size.
When changing the storage class of an object using
Autoclass, most transitions are free. However, the Class A
Standard storage rate applies for transitions from Coldline storage or
Archive storage to Standard storage or Nearline storage.
In buckets with Autoclass enabled, operations are always
charged at the Standard storage rate.
In buckets with soft delete enabled, restore operations are always
charged at the Standard storage rate.
In buckets that use soft delete, one Class A Standard storage operation
is charged per 1,000 objects processed as part of a bulk restore operation,
rounded up so that at least one Class A operation is always billed. This is in
addition to the operations charge assessed per object restored.
Operations that fall into each class
The following table lists the operations that fall into each class for the JSON
API, XML API, and gRPC. Keep in mind the following:
Except as noted in the footnotes, each request is considered one operation,
regardless of the content sent or received as part of the request.
Tools such as the Google Cloud console, the Google Cloud CLI, and the
Cloud Storage client libraries might use two or more operations
to perform a task. For example, when you click on a bucket name in the
Google Cloud console, the system performs an operation to get the list of objects
in the bucket and a separate operation to get the metadata for the bucket.
The Google Cloud console uses the JSON API to make requests. Other tools might
use either or both the JSON API and XML API. Consult the tool's reference
documentation for information about the underlying API that it uses.

In Hierarchical Namespace buckets, iterative (recursive) folder operations are
billed as class A for each child operation. There are two types of iterative
folder operations:
Operations that create missing parent folders automatically. Each parent
folder created is considered a child operation. This includes the following
operations (and their equivalents in the XML API, if applicable):
a. storage.objects.insert
b. storage.objects.compose
c. storage.objects.copy
d. storage.objects.move
e. storage.objects.rewrite
f. storage.objects.restore
g. storage.managedFolders.insert
h. storage.folders.insert (when recursive is set
to true)
i. Complete a multipart upload (this is a POST
operation in the XML API)
The rename folder operation. Each child folder under the top-level folder
being renamed is considered a child operation.
1 A rewrite or resumable upload of a single object
performed using the JSON API or gRPC is billed as a single Class A operation,
even though these actions can require multiple requests to complete.
2 Applies specifically to Object Change Notifications. For
Pub/Sub notifications, see
Pub/Sub pricing.
3 Tag operations are not eligible for the
Cloud Storage Always Free program.
Note: Generally, you are not charged for operations that return 307, 4xx, or
5xx responses. The exception is 404 responses returned by buckets with
Website Configuration enabled and the
NotFoundPage property set to a public object in that bucket.
Retrieval fees
A retrieval fee applies when you read, copy, move, or rewrite object data or
metadata that is stored using Nearline storage, Coldline storage, or
Archive storage. This cost is in addition to any operations charges and
network charges associated with reading the data.
The following table shows the retrieval rates for each storage class:
Standard storage
Nearline storage
Coldline storage
Archive storage
$0 per GB
$0.01 per GB
$0.02 per GB
$0.05 per GB
If you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on
Cloud Platform SKUs

Retrieval fees do not apply when an object exists in a bucket that has
Autoclass enabled.
Retrieval fees do not apply when restoring soft-deleted objects.
Retrieval fees do not apply for data read from Anywhere Cache.
Inter-region replication
Inter-region replication is billed on a per-GB basis for all data written
to buckets located in a dual-region or multi-region location. Writes include
puts, rewrites, copies, and any other actions that create new objects.

Autoclass charges
The following additional charges are associated with buckets that use the
Autoclass feature:
Autoclass management fee: Buckets that have Autoclass
enabled incur a fee of $0.0025 for every
1000 objects stored for 30 days within them.
Objects smaller than 128 kibibytes are not managed by Autoclass and
are thus not counted when determining the fee.
The fee is prorated to the millisecond for each object that isn't
stored for the 30-day period.
The fee is also prorated to the millisecond when disabling Autoclass.
Soft-deleted objects do not incur this fee.
Autoclass enablement charge: Buckets that enable Autoclass
have a one-time charge for configuring existing objects to use
Autoclass. This charge applies even if you immediately disable
Autoclass and includes the following, as applicable:
Early delete charges for objects that haven't met their minimum storage
duration
Retrieval fees for objects not currently in Standard storage
A Class A operation charge for each object in the bucket, in order to
transition them to Autoclass pricing and Standard storage
Objects that are smaller than 128 kibibytes, and already stored in
Standard storage at the time Autoclass is enabled are excluded
from this operation charge
The Autoclass enablement charge does not apply to soft-deleted objects,
which retain their existing storage classes and are billed as such until the end
of their soft delete retention duration.
Network
Outbound data transfer represents data sent from Cloud Storage in
HTTP responses. Data or metadata read from a Cloud Storage bucket are
examples of data transfer.
Inbound data transfer represents data sent to Cloud Storage in HTTP
requests. Data or metadata written to a Cloud Storage bucket are
examples of inbound data transfer.
Network usage charges apply for data transfer and are divided into the following
cases:
Data transfer within Google Cloud, when data
transfer is to other Cloud Storage buckets or to Google Cloud
services.
Specialty network services, when data transfer uses
certain Google Cloud network products.
General data transfer, when data transfer is out of
Google Cloud or between continents.
Data transfer within Google Cloud
Data transfer within Google Cloud applies when you move or copy data from
one Cloud Storage bucket to another or when another
Google Cloud service accesses data in your Cloud Storage bucket.
The following cases of data transfer from a Cloud Storage bucket to
within Google Cloud are free:
Case
Examples
Notes
Data moves within the same location.
US-EAST1 to US-EAST1
EU to EU
A region is not considered the same location as a multi-region, even
if the region is within the geographic limits of a multi-region.
For data transfer out to BigQuery datasets, Cloud Storage
will consider BigQuery US to be equivalent to us-central1 and BigQuery
EU to be equivalent to europe-west4. As an example, no data transfer out charges
will be assessed when BigQuery US reads data from a bucket in us-central1,
or from a dual-region bucket with one region set as us-central1. However, data transfer
out charges will apply when BigQuery US reads data from any other
Cloud Storage bucket.
Data moves from a Cloud Storage bucket located in a
dual-region to a different Google Cloud service located in one of
the regions that make up the dual-region.
Accessing data in an NAM4 bucket with an
US-CENTRAL1 GKE instance
This case does not include bucket-to-bucket data moves.
If you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on
Cloud Platform SKUs
apply.
You can use Anywhere Cache to avoid data transfer fees associated with multi-region buckets on reads, once data is ingested into the cache.
For all other data transfer from your Cloud Storage buckets to within
Google Cloud, pricing is determined by the bucket's location and the
destination location, as defined in the following matrix:

Storage Intelligence
AI-powered Storage Intelligence provides you with insights to
help you manage and optimize storage at scale. Generate storage insights
datasets specific to your environment by querying object metadata at scale. Use
bucket relocation to minimize application downtime by
automatically moving entire buckets while preserving their bucket names. Perform
batch operations at scale using managed jobs on millions of objects.
Storage Intelligence charges apply when configuring and using various
capabilities as follows:
Standard Tier
When configured for Standard tier the Storage Intelligence Standard
Object Management Fee ($2.5 per million objects per month) applies to all
objects within the specified Organization / Folder / Project. Unless filters are
specified all buckets are included even as new ones are added. Any buckets that
are removed from Standard Tier within 30 days of inclusion incur
Storage Intelligence Early Termination Fee for the remaining duration.
Charges are amortized daily and only apply to objects that exist more than 24
hours.
Insights Datasets
These can be configured for the same Organization / Folder / Project as the
Storage Intelligence tier. When configured, daily snapshots are
delivered for all the buckets/objects that have been enabled with Standard tier.
Any number of Datasets can be configured for the same buckets and the Standard
tier fee is only applied once. BigQuery storage fees does apply for every
instance for Datasets. Typically 1 TB of Cloud Storage data generates
300 MB of metadata daily however this can vary based on custom metadata stored
within objects. Customers can configure the duration of snapshot retention. If
Storage Intelligence is disabled for a project then new snapshots will
not be delivered however the existing BigQuery data will not be deleted and will
continue to incur storage charges. Customers can delete the Datasets
configuration at any time to remove their data from BigQuery.
Storage batch operations
Storage Batch Operations is exclusively available to
Storage Intelligence customers. There are no additional charges for
using Batch Operations beyond the subscription fee of
Storage Intelligence.
Operations charges: All operations performed by Batch
Operations incur operations charges based on the storage class of the object
being acted on.
Deletions performed by Batch Operations do not incur any charges.
All transformations performed by Batch Operations, except object
deletions, incur a Class B operation charge.
All transformations performed by Batch Operations, except object
deletions, incur a Class A operations charge. This operation charge does
not apply if the object is already in the desired end state.
Bucket relocation
When using bucket relocation, a $0.04 per GB charge applies for
all data successfully moved to the destination. In addition, the following
charges apply:
Storage Intelligence: Bucket relocation is
a premium feature offered as a part of Storage Intelligence.
Storage Intelligence must be enabled on the
source bucket to use bucket relocation.
Data transfer charges: You pay inter-region data transfer
charges for moving the data from the source to the
destination region. Data transfer is charged per GB of data moved.
Operation charges: You pay one Class
A operation per object moved. Additional Class A operations are charged to
resynchronize object metadata for objects whose metadata have been updated
since the move started. This can mean up to N additional Class A operations
for an object updated N times after the move started.
Data storage charges: You pay for data
storage charges in both the source and destination locations while
bucket relocation processes the move, temporarily increasing your
storage charges. Once the move has completed, you only pay for data storage
based on the new, destination location.
Data replication charges: If the destination of the move is
a multi-region or dual-region bucket, inter-region replication charges
apply since the destination data must be replicated to a remote region.
Data retrieval charges: Retrieval fees are not assessed as
part of a bucket relocation.
Early deletion charges: You are not billed early deletion
charges for the data cleanup in the source bucket after the move.

Pricing example for Storage Intelligence
If you have 1000 objects in 1000 buckets that are distributed over 10 projects
and you enable Storage Intelligence for all 10 projects, or at
Organization level that includes these 10 projects, then you will be charged a
monthly Storage Intelligence Standard Object Management Fee of $2.5 for
the 1 million objects (1000 objects x 1000 buckets). Charges are applied to the
same project where buckets are present.
These charges are applied daily, with $/million objects rate amortized over 30
days. If you have less than a million objects then the charges are amortized so
you only pay for the set of objects that are under management for the duration
of their existence (over 24 hours).
A 30-day early termination fee which applies when a bucket is removed from a
subscription within 30 days of enrollment. Any bucket deletions do not incur
this 30-day early termination fee. If you disable Storage Intelligence
after 24 days of enablement (6 days remaining) then for example a total of $0.5
Early Termination Fee will be applied on the 25th day for the 1000 buckets that
were removed.

Anywhere Cache
Anywhere Cache pricing is based on the following components:
Cache storage: the amount of data stored in cache
Cache ingest: the amount of data written into the cache
Cache data transfer out: the amount of data read from the cache
Cache data transfer out operations: the amount of read requests served from
the cache
Cache management operations: the amount of bucket-level cache management
requests (normally not significant on bills)
The following pricing applies to any bucket where Anywhere Cache is enabled.
Anywhere Cache pricing is supplemental to the overall service pricing.
Unless explicitly stated, the Cloud Storage service prices provided
elsewhere in this document continue to apply in addition to Anywhere Cache
prices.
When reading data that is not already cached in the same zone where the data is
being read, all normal Cloud Storage prices apply for the request (for
example: Class B operations and multi-region data transfer out charges). In
addition, the cache ingest charge applies to load the data being read into the
cache. Once data is in the cache, cache storage charges apply until it is
evicted from the cache.
When the data being read in a particular zone is already cached in that zone’s
cache, cache operations charges apply for requests instead of the normal higher
priced Class B operations. Cache data transfer out charges are also assessed
based on the volume of data read.
Bucket-level cache configuration and management requests incur normal Class A or
Class B operations, per the table in the Operation section.
Please see the Anywhere Cache documentation for more detailed information on how you can control costs using Anywhere Cache.
Cache Storage Charges
Data cached by Anywhere Cache incur a per-GB, per-hour storage fee, with
charges pro-rated to the second for each byte of data. Prices are set by region
and are listed under the Anywhere Cache column under Data Storage
above.
Cache Data Processing Charges
Charge
Price
Notes
Cache ingest
$0.01/GB
Data is ingested and charged in 2 MB increments regardless of
request size, unless the end of the object is reached in which case the
ingest and ingest charges will stop at end of the object. Metadata-only
reads do not trigger cache ingest.
Cache operations
$0.0002/1K operations
Requests entirely served by the cache incur cache operations
charges. Otherwise Class B operations apply.
Cache data transfer out
$0.0008/GB
Charged for data read from the cache. This is based on the actual
size of the read request, with byte sized granularity.
Pricing notes
Storage and network usage are calculated in JEDEC binary gigabytes (GB),
also known as IEC gibibytes (GiB), where 1 JEDEC GB is 230 bytes. Similarly, 1 JEDEC TB is 240 bytes, or 1024 JEDEC GBs.
When rewriting or copying data from one Cloud Storage bucket to
another, inter-region replication charges, if applicable, are billed to
the billing account associated with the destination bucket. All other
applicable charges are billed to the billing account associated with the
source bucket.
Data transfer costs and retrieval fees are based on the amount of
data accessed, not the size of the entire object. For example, if you request
only the first 8 MB of a 100 MB Nearline storage object or if the download
connection is broken after 8 MB is served, the data transfer
cost and the retrieval fee are based on 8 MB.
Charges accrue daily, but Cloud Storage bills you only at the end of
the billing period. You can view unbilled usage in
your project's billing page in the Google Cloud console.
For compressed objects that are transcoded during download, storage
rates are based on the compressed size of the object. Data transfer rates
are based on the uncompressed size of the object.
For buckets with Object Versioning enabled, each noncurrent version of
an object is charged at the same rate as the live version of the object.
Cloud Storage also has the storage class Durable Reduced Availability (DRA) storage;
however, you should use Standard storage in favor of DRA. Standard storage
has lower pricing for operations but otherwise has the same price
structure. Standard storage also provides better performance, particularly
in terms of availability.
There are no extra costs for using the Storage Transfer Service; however,
normal Cloud Storage and external provider costs apply when using the
Storage Transfer Service. See Storage Transfer Service pricing for a list
of potential costs.
Pricing updates for Cloud Storage took effect on October 1, 2022 and
on April 1, 2023.
