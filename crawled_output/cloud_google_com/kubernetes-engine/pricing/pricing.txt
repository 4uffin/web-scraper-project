Google Kubernetes Engine pricing | Google CloudPage ContentsGoogle Kubernetes Engine pricingThis page explains pricing for compute resources, cluster operation mode, cluster management fees, and applicable ingress fees in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).GKE includes fully automated cluster lifecycle management, pod and cluster autoscaling, cost visibility, automated infrastructure cost optimization, and multi-cluster management features, like Fleets, Teams, Config Management, Policy Controller, and Fleet dashboard, at no extra cost.GKE also includes a Service Level Agreement (SLA) that's financially backed providing the following availability:99.95% for the control plane of Autopilot clusters and regional Standard clusters. 99.5% for the control plane of zonal Standard clusters.99.9% for Autopilot Pods in multiple zones.Free tierThe GKE free tier provides $74.40 in monthly credits per billing account, which is equivalent to one free Autopilot or zonal Standard cluster per month. Free tier credits are only applied to zonal and Autopilot clusters and cannot be applied to any other SKUs (for example, they cannot be applied to compute chargers or the cluster fee for Regional clusters). Unused free tier credits are not rolled over.Cluster management feeA flat cluster management fee of $0.10 per cluster per hour (charged in 1 second increments) applies to all GKE clusters irrespective of the mode of operation, cluster size, or topology. Whether it is a single-zone cluster, multi-zonal cluster, regional or Autopilot cluster, they all accrue the same flat fee per cluster.For clusters in the Extended release channel, an additional cluster management fee applies if the minor version of the cluster is in the extended support period.The following example demonstrates how the cluster management fee and free tier credit is applied for an organization’s billing accounts. In this example, the organization’s regional and zonal cluster hours are listed and the total billable amount is calculated per month, with the monthly free tier credit applied.Organization's billing accountsAutopilot cluster hours per monthRegional cluster hours per monthZonal cluster hours per monthFree tier credit used (USD)Total monthly GKE cluster management fee(at US$0.10/hour per cluster)account_174400$74.40$0account_201000500$50$100account_3100010001000$74.40$225.60ComputeFor Standard node pools and compute classes that don't use the Autopilot setting, you're billed for the nodes' underlying Compute Engine instances according to Compute Engine's pricing, until the nodes are deleted. Compute Engine resources are billed on a per-second basis with a one-minute minimum usage cost. Compute Engine offers committed use discounts that apply to the Compute Engine instances in the cluster. To learn more, see committed use discounts in Compute Engine.Autopilot modeWorkloads running in Autopilot mode have capacity provisioned based on the requirements in the workload specifications. For pricing purposes, GKE considers the following workloads to be Autopilot workloads:All workloads in Autopilot clusters Workloads in Standard clusters that request a compute class that has Autopilot enabledThe pricing for Autopilot workloads depends on the type of compute resources that the workloads request, as follows:General-purpose Autopilot workloads: Pods that target the Autopilot container-optimized compute platform (which is the default for Autopilot clusters) or the Balanced and Scale-Out built-in compute classes. These workloads use a Pod-based billing model, in which you're charged based on Pod resource requests. For more information, see the General-purpose Autopilot workloads section on this page.Autopilot workloads that select specific hardware: Pods that select specific hardware, such as accelerators or machine series, by using selectors or compute classes. These workloads use a node-based billing model, in which you're charged based on Compute Engine pricing plus an Autopilot management premium. For more information, see the Autopilot workloads that select specific hardware section on this page.General-purpose Autopilot workloadsAutopilot uses a Pod-based billing model for general-purpose workloads, which are any of the following Pods:Pods that use the Autopilot container-optimized compute platform, which is the default for Autopilot clusters. This platform is available to use in eligible GKE clusters by selecting the autopilot or the autopilot-spot built-in compute classes.Pods that use the Balanced or Scale-Out compute classes in Autopilot clusters.The Autopilot container-optimized compute platform is ideal for workloads that don't require specific hardware because of its cost effective, performant characteristics. In the Pod-based billing model, you are charged in one-second increments for the CPU, memory, and ephemeral storage resources that your running Pods request in the Pod resource requests, with no minimum duration. The Pod-based billing model has the following considerations:Autopilot sets a default value if no resource request was defined in the PodAutopilot increases values that don't meet the required minimums or CPU-to-memory ratios. Set the resource requests to what your workloads require to get the most optimal price.You're only billed for Pods that are being created or are currently running (those in the Running phase, and those with the ContainerCreating status in the Pending phase). Pods that are waiting to be scheduled and Pods that have terminated (like Pods marked as Succeeded or Failed) are not billed.You are not charged for unmodified system DaemonSet Pods, operating system overhead, unallocated space, or unscheduled Pods. Set appropriate resource requests and Pod replica counts for your workloads for optimal cost. With the Pod-based billing model, the underlying node size or quantity doesn't matter for billing.If you enable Confidential GKE Nodes, additional charges apply.

For example, you can use a compute class with Autopilot mode enabled to request a specific GPU type. For these specialized workloads, Autopilot creates nodes that have at least the requested compute capacity for the workload and bills you for the entire node. Although this node-based billing model is ideal for workloads that have specific hardware requirements, you should plan to fully utilize the compute resources that Autopilot creates.The following charges apply in the node-based billing model:The underlying VM resources, to which any applicable discounts like Compute Engine CUDs applyAn Autopilot management premium on the compute resources.When your Pods request specific hardware resources, GKE allocates predefined Compute Engine machine types that most closely fit the Pod requests (which might result in larger instance sizes than what your Pod requested). Because you're billed for the entire node, ensure that these specialized workloads efficiently use the full resources of the provisioned machines. This consideration doesn't apply to the default Pod-based billing model, which is ideal for smaller workloads (those that request significantly less resources than the size of the smallest machine size in the machine series) and workloads that don't efficiently fit into the predefined Compute Engine machine types.Autopilot node management premiums for the node-based billing modelIowa (us-central1)Johannesburg (africa-south1)Taiwan (asia-east1)Hong Kong (asia-east2)Tokyo (asia-northeast1)Osaka (asia-northeast2)Seoul (asia-northeast3)Mumbai (asia-south1)Delhi (asia-south2)Singapore (asia-southeast1)Jakarta (asia-southeast2)Bangkok (asia-southeast3)Sydney (australia-southeast1)Melbourne (australia-southeast2)Warsaw (europe-central2)Finland (europe-north1)Stockholm (europe-north2)Madrid (europe-southwest1)Belgium (europe-west1)Berlin (europe-west10)Turin (europe-west12)London (europe-west2)Frankfurt (europe-west3)Netherlands (europe-west4)Zurich (europe-west6)Milan (europe-west8)Paris (europe-west9)Doha (me-central1)Dammam (me-central2)Tel Aviv (me-west1)Montreal (northamerica-northeast1)Toronto (northamerica-northeast2)Mexico (northamerica-south1)Sao Paulo (southamerica-east1)Santiago (southamerica-west1)Iowa (us-central1)South Carolina (us-east1)Northern Virginia (us-east4)Columbus (us-east5)Dallas (us-south1)Oregon (us-west1)Los Angeles (us-west2)Salt Lake City (us-west3)Las Vegas (us-west4)Phoenix (us-west8)Show discount optionsHourlyHourlyMonthlyMonthlyItemDefault* (USD)infoConsumption model ID:7754-699E-0EBFCompute Flexible CUD - 1 Year* (USD)infoConsumption model ID:D97B-0795-975BCompute Flexible CUD - 3 Year* (USD)infoConsumption model ID:70D7-D1AB-12A4Kubernetes Engine CUD - 1 Year* (USD)infoConsumption model ID:2F93-FEF4-BD6EKubernetes Engine CUD - 3 Year* (USD)infoConsumption model ID:6E88-5C17-F3E1Spot price1 (USD)GKE Autopilot Performance vCPU Premium (vCPU)$0.004 / 1,000 hour$0.00288 / 1,000 hour$0.00216 / 1,000 hour$0.0032 / 1,000 hour$0.0022 / 1,000 hour$0.0012 / 1,000 hourGKE Autopilot Performance Memory Premium (GiB)$0.0005 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.00036 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.00027 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.0004 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.000275 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.00015 / 1 gibibyte hourGKE Performance and Accelerator PD Balanced Premium$0.000016438 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.000011836 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.000008877 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.000013151 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.000009041 / 1 gibibyte hour-GKE Performance and Accelerator Local SSD Premium$0.000012329 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.000008877 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.000006658 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.000009863 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.000006781 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.000009589 / 1 gibibyte hourGKE Autopilot Accelerator vCPU Premium (vCPU)$0.003 / 1,000 hour$0.00216 / 1,000 hour$0.00162 / 1,000 hour$0.0024 / 1,000 hour$0.00165 / 1,000 hour$0.0011 / 1,000 hourGKE Autopilot Accelerator Memory Premium (GiB)$0.00035 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.000252 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.000189 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.00028 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.0001925 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.00013 / 1 gibibyte hourGKE Autopilot T4 GPU Premium (GPU)$0.042 / 1,000 hour$0.03024 / 1,000 hour$0.02268 / 1,000 hour$0.0336 / 1,000 hour$0.0231 / 1,000 hour$0.017 / 1,000 hourGKE Autopilot L4 GPU Premium (GPU)$0.067 / 1,000 hour$0.04824 / 1,000 hour$0.03618 / 1,000 hour$0.0536 / 1,000 hour$0.03685 / 1,000 hour$0.02 / 1,000 hourGKE Autopilot A100 40GiB GPU Premium (GPU)$0.35 / 1,000 hour$0.252 / 1,000 hour$0.189 / 1,000 hour$0.28 / 1,000 hour$0.1925 / 1,000 hour$0.14 / 1,000 hourGKE Autopilot A100 80GiB GPU Premium (GPU)$0.47 / 1,000 hour$0.3384 / 1,000 hour$0.2538 / 1,000 hour$0.376 / 1,000 hour$0.2585 / 1,000 hour$0.18 / 1,000 hourGKE Autopilot H100 GPU Premium (GPU)$1.17 / 1,000 hour$0.8424 / 1,000 hour$0.6318 / 1,000 hour$0.936 / 1,000 hour$0.6435 / 1,000 hour$0.82 / 1,000 hourGKE Autopilot TPU v5 Premium$0.15 / 1 hour$0.108 / 1 hour$0.081 / 1 hour--$0.08 / 1 hour* Each consumption model has a unique ID.

These include Managed Service Mesh, Binary Authorization, Multicluster Gateway and Multicluster Ingress, Backup for GKE, GKE Extended Support and Hybrid and Multi-Cloud.Multi Cluster Gateway and Multi Cluster IngressMulti Cluster Gateway and Multi Cluster Ingress are available as standalone SKUs, and the load balancers and traffic for Gateway and MultiClusterIngress and resources are charged separately, according to load balancer pricing.Multi Cluster Gateway and Multi Cluster Ingress standalone pricing is based on the number of Pods that are considered Multi Cluster backends at a cost of $3 per backend Pod per month (730 hours). This pricing is approximately $0.0041096 per backend Pod per hour, billed in 5 minute increments.The number of backend Pods is the total number of Pods that are members of MultiClusterService resources across all GKE clusters in your project. The following example shows how backend Pods are counted:Multi Cluster Gateway only charges Pods which are direct backends of Gateway resources based on a multi-cluster gateway class. Multi Cluster Ingress only charges Pods which are direct backends of MultiClusterIngress resources. Pods which are not Multi Cluster Gateway or Multi Cluster Ingress backends are not charged. In this example, there are three MultiClusterService resources across two clusters with Pod backends. Pods that are members of Service A, B, and C are not direct backends and are not billed against the standalone pricing.Any Pod that is a member of multiple MultiClusterService resources is billed for each MultiClusterService that they are a member of. Two Pods are members of both the D and E MultiClusterService.The following table summarizes the monthly cost total for standalone billing for the two clusters in the example:MultiClusterServicePodsCost per month (USD)D3$9E4$12F1$3Total8$24For more information on how to configure Multi Cluster Ingress billing, see API enablement.Backup for GKEBackup for GKE is a separate service from GKE that can be used to protect and manage GKE data.Backup for GKE accrues fees along two dimensions: first, there is a GKE backup management fee, based on the number of GKE pods protected, and second, there is a backup storage fee, based on the amount of data (GiB) stored. Both fees are calculated on a monthly basis, similar to other GKE feature billing.Iowa (us-central1)Johannesburg (africa-south1)Taiwan (asia-east1)Hong Kong (asia-east2)Tokyo (asia-northeast1)Osaka (asia-northeast2)Seoul (asia-northeast3)Mumbai (asia-south1)Delhi (asia-south2)Singapore (asia-southeast1)Jakarta (asia-southeast2)Sydney (australia-southeast1)Melbourne (australia-southeast2)Warsaw (europe-central2)Finland (europe-north1)Stockholm (europe-north2)Madrid (europe-southwest1)Belgium (europe-west1)Berlin (europe-west10)Turin (europe-west12)London (europe-west2)Frankfurt (europe-west3)Netherlands (europe-west4)Zurich (europe-west6)Milan (europe-west8)Paris (europe-west9)Doha (me-central1)Dammam (me-central2)Tel Aviv (me-west1)Montreal (northamerica-northeast1)Toronto (northamerica-northeast2)Mexico (northamerica-south1)Sao Paulo (southamerica-east1)Santiago (southamerica-west1)Iowa (us-central1)South Carolina (us-east1)Northern Virginia (us-east4)Columbus (us-east5)Dallas (us-south1)Oregon (us-west1)Los Angeles (us-west2)Salt Lake City (us-west3)Las Vegas (us-west4)Phoenix (us-west8)HourlyHourlyMonthlyMonthlyItemRegular price (USD)1-year commitment price (USD)3-year commitment price (USD)Backup management (pods per plan)$0.001369863 / 1 hour$0.00109589 / 1 hour$0.000753425 / 1 hourBackup storage (GiB)$0.000038356 / 1 gibibyte hourNot applicableNot applicableIf you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on Cloud Platform SKUs apply.Hourly pricing varies by month. The exact hourly pricing can be calculated by dividing the monthly pricing by the number of hours in the desired month.As an example, a customer with a single backup plan in Iowa (us-central1) that backs up an average of 20 pods during a month, storing 200GiB of backup storage data in Iowa, would be charged $25.60 in fees. This $25.60 would include $20 for the month for GKE backup management (20 x $1.00 / pod-month) and $5.60 for backup storage (200 * $0.028 / GiB-month).Starting June 26 2023, new network outbound data transfer charges will be introduced for backups that are stored in a different region from their source GKE cluster. These charges will be based on the source and destination region and the number of bytes transferred for each such "cross-region" backup operation:Backup locationGKE cluster locationNorthern AmericaEuropeAsiaIndonesiaOceaniaMiddle EastLatin AmericaAfricaNorthern America$0.02$0.05$0.08$0.10$0.10$0.11$0.14$0.11Europe$0.05$0.02$0.08$0.10$0.10$0.11$0.14$0.11Asia$0.08$0.08$0.08$0.10$0.10$0.11$0.14$0.11Indonesia$0.10$0.10$0.10N/A$0.08$0.11$0.14$0.14Oceania$0.10$0.10$0.10$0.08$0.08$0.11$0.14$0.14Middle East$0.11$0.11$0.11$0.11$0.11$0.08$0.14$0.11Latin America$0.14$0.14$0.14$0.14$0.14$0.08$0.14$0.14Africa$0.11$0.11$0.11$0.14$0.14$0.11$0.14N/AExtended support periodClusters on the Extended release channel can stay on their GKE minor version and receive extended support beyond the standard support period. With extended support, you can stay on a GKE minor release, supported, for up to 24 months. You will be charged an additional GKE extended period cluster management fee after the cluster has reached the end of standard support. There is no additional charge for using the Extended release channel during the standard support period and you can upgrade to a minor version covered under the standard support period at any time. To learn more, see how to get long-term support with the Extended channel.Priced at $0.50 per cluster per hour. The GKE extended period cluster management fee is in addition to the GKE cluster management fee at $0.10 per cluster per hour, for a total of $0.60 per cluster per hour.Hybrid and Multi-CloudWhen using multi-cloud features, GKE charges based on the number of cluster vCPUs, charged on an hourly basis.A vCPU is considered "under management" by GKE when it is seen as schedulable compute capacity by the GKE control plane, meaning all vCPUs in the relevant user cluster, and excluding (for on-premises options) both the admin cluster and the control plane nodes.
