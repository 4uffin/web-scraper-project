What is Storage Transfer Service?
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Storage Transfer Service enables seamless data movement across object and file
storage systems, including:
Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Cloud Storage to Cloud Storage
On-premises storage to Cloud Storage, or Cloud Storage to on-premises
Between on-premises storage systems
From publicly-accessible URLs to Cloud Storage
From HDFS to Cloud Storage
Storage Transfer Service is optimized for transfers involving more than 1TiB of data.
For smaller transfers, see our
recommendations.
With Storage Transfer Service, you can:
Automate data transfers: Eliminate the need for manual processes and custom scripts.
Transfer data at scale: Move petabytes of data quickly and reliably.
Optimize network performance: Choose between Google-managed transfers for simplicity or self-hosted agents for granular control over network routing and bandwidth consumption.
Support diverse storage systems: Transfer data seamlessly between cloud providers and on-premises environments.
Use cases
Migrating data to Cloud Storage: Storage Transfer Service can be used to migrate
data from other cloud storage providers, on-premises data centers, or
HTTP/HTTPS URLs to Cloud Storage.
Backup: Replicate your data to Google Cloud, or create a copy of a
Cloud Storage bucket in another region
Data processing pipelines: Move data generated on other clouds, your data
center, and the edge to Google Cloud for analytics using
BigQuery or Dataproc.
Archival: Move cold data from costly on-premises storage systems to
Cloud Storage to reduce storage cost.
Benefits
Secure
End-to-end encryption protects your data in transit. Storage Transfer Service
supports TLS 1.3 for all HTTPS communication.
Data integrity validation ensures that your data is not corrupted during
transfer.
Performant
Highly-parallelized architecture accelerates transfer speeds.
Automatic retries and load balancing ensure reliable transfers.
Fully managed
No need to manage infrastructure or write code.
Focus on your applications, not data transfer.
Get started
Check to see if your
source and sink combination is supported.
There are a number of ways that you can work with Storage Transfer Service:
The Google Cloud console
REST APIs
The gcloud command-line tool
Java and Python client libraries
See Create transfers to get started.
Service Level Agreement
Storage Transfer Service does not provide an SLA, including for transfer performance or
latency, and some performance fluctuations may occur.
