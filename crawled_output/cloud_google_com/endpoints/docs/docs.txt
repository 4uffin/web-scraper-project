Endpoints is an API management system that helps you secure,
monitor, analyze, and set quotas on your APIs using the same infrastructure
Google uses for its own APIs.
The Endpoints options
To have your API managed by Cloud Endpoints, you have three options,
depending on where your API is hosted and the type of communications protocol
your API uses:
Cloud Endpoints for OpenAPI
Cloud Endpoints for gRPC
Cloud Endpoints Frameworks for the App Engine standard environment
For help on deciding which option is right for you, see
Choosing an Endpoints option.
What's next
See Endpoints features in action by doing the
Quickstart for Endpoints,
which uses scripts to deploy a sample API to the App Engine flexible
environment.
Get familiar with the deployments steps by doing one of the tutorials for
the Endpoints option that you have chosen:
Endpoints for OpenAPI: tutorials
Endpoints for gRPC: tutorials
Endpoints Frameworks for the App Engine standard environment: tutorials
