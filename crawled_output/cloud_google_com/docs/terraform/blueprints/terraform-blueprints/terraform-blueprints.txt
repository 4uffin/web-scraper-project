Terraform blueprints and modules for Google Cloud
Stay organized with collections
Save and categorize content based on your preferences.
Blueprints and modules help you automate provisioning and managing
Google Cloud resources at scale.
A module is a reusable set of Terraform configuration files that creates a
logical abstraction of Terraform resources.
A blueprint is a package of deployable, reusable modules and policy that
implements and documents a specific opinionated solution. Deployable
configuration for all Terraform blueprints are packaged as Terraform modules.
