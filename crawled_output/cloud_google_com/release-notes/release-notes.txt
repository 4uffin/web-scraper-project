1-Click Deployer: 1-Click deployer now deploys the
Sustainability module when SAP ECC or S/4 is selected.
SAP:
The CDC script now considers the L flag alongside I and U when
determining which records are updated in the raw dataset. This is to account
for situations where the pipeline is somehow re-configured after data load,
but the CDC dataset can still be reused to avoid re-processing existing data.
Column names in StockInHand views (ECC and S/4) for MATNR and
WERKS have been aligned with other views to be MaterialNumber_MATNR
and Plant_WERKS. Previous column names ArticleNumber_MATNR and
Site_WERKS still exist for compatibility reasons, but will be removed in
a future release. Customers are advised to change their upstream consumption assets accordingly.
Column names in SalesOrders_V2 views (ECC and S/4) for ERDAT and
ERZET have been aligned to new names SalesDocumentCreationDate_ERDAT,
SalesOrderItemCreationDate_ERDAT, SalesOrderCreationTime_ERZET and
SalesDocumentItemCreationTime_ERZET to account for the correct
granularity of their source table (either VBAP or VBAK) . Previous
column names CreationDate_ERDAT and CreationTime_ERZET still exist for
compatibility reasons, but will eventually be removed in a future release.
Customers are advised to change their upstream consumption assets
accordingly. Also, Sales Order Item level calendar dimensions are now added
by default.
Column names in Deliveries view for VGBEL, VGPOS, and XBLNR are
updated to InternalReferenceDocumentNumber_VGBEL,
InternalReferenceDocumentItem_VGPOS ExternalReferenceDocumentNumber_XBLNR
for more clarity. Previous column names SalesOrderNumber_VGBEL,
SalesOrderItem_VGPOS, and ReferenceDocumentNumber_XBLNR still exist for
compatibility reasons, but will eventually be removed in a future release.
Customers are advised to change their upstream consumption assets
accordingly.
Sales Order Item level calendar dimensions are now added by default.
In AccountingDocuments view as well as the downstream
AccountingDocumentsReceivables views, DoubtfulReceivables, and
DaysInArrear metrics are now positive instead of negative to align with
official SAP guidelines.
SalesFulfillment and SalesFulfillment_PerOrder views are updated
to use SalesOrders_V2 instead of SalesOrders view as their upstream
source for both ECC and S/4. The view signatures are unchanged.
ERD for both ECC and
S/4 have been cleaned up and
updated based on the latest changes.
Marketing: Cortex for Meridian reporting views adapted to TikTok, Meta,
and YouTube (DV360) to focus on top of the funnel marketing campaigns. Search
Ads data is skipped from aggregates as higher quality data is now available from
Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) Data Platform.
SAP:
Qty field data type in StockInHand views (ECC and S/4) has been
changed from STRING to NUMERIC.
Currency conversion and currency decimal shift in PurchaseDocuments_Flow
views (ECC and S/4) now align with the logic implemented in all other SAP
reporting views.
Fixed incorrect GR quantity caused by an incorrect JOIN condition.
Removed an excessive LEFT JOIN in the Unit of Measure Function and View
Utility code to avoid possible duplicate rows.
Cleaned up unnecessary date casting and ORDER BY clauses in some views
to improve performance.
Salesforce (SFDC):
Currency conversion logic is now updated to account for possible source
currency fields that are not corporate currency in the objects
(for example, Opportunities).
Updated ERD to include proper linkage to calendar dimension.
SAP: The views GLDocumentsHdr and RegionsMD are now removed as
they are no longer relevant.
Oracle builds may time out when using a private worker pool created
with default parameters.

Application Integration
Salesforce connected app requires installation for OAuth 2.0 authentication
A new security requirement from Salesforce restricts the use of uninstalled connected apps. To ensure your Salesforce triggers remain functional, you must install the connected app in your Salesforce account.
When establishing a new Salesforce trigger using OAuth 2.0 authentication, you are now required to install the connected app within your Salesforce account. This step is also necessary for existing triggers using OAuth 2.0 authentication if the connected app is not already installed, as failure to do so may cause them to stop working.
For more information, see Install the OAuth 2.0 connected app.

Configurable runtime class for container workloads. As part of gVisor integration in Google Distributed Cloud connected, you can now specify the default runtime class for container workloads at both Pod and cluster level. Cluster-level runtime class selection is a preview-level feature. For more information, see Configure the runtime class for a Pod.
Island mode networking. Google Distributed Cloud connected now supports island mode networking on secondary network interfaces. For more information, see (Optional) Configure island mode.
AppArmor sandboxing audit logs for VM workloads. Google Distributed Cloud connected now lets you enable audit logs for virtual machine workloads sandboxed using AppArmor policies. To enable audit log emission on an existing virtual machine workload, restart the corresponding virtual machine. For more information, see View AppArmor sandboxing audit logs.
CoreDNS resolution for secondary networks. Google Distributed Cloud connected now supports specifying a CIDR block for use with secondary networks at both Pod and cluster level. This allows for CoreDNS resolution on secondary network interfaces. For more information, see Network resource.
Access clusters through Connect Gateway. You can now access your Google Distributed Cloud connected clusters through Connect Gateway. For more information, see Obtain cluster credentials through Connect Gateway.
VNC support for accessing VM workloads through Connect Gateway. You can now use VNC to access your virtual machine workloads through Connect Gateway.
Security mitigations for the following vulnerabilities have been implemented in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected:
OS layer security mitigations: CVE-2025-31498, CVE-2024-48615, CVE-2016-1585.
GDC software-only security mitigations: All mitigations listed in the GDC software-only release notes up to version 1.32.100 (inclusive).
The following Google Distributed Cloud connected components have been updated:
GDC software-only has been updated to version 1.32.100. (This component was formerly known as GKE on Bare Metal and as Anthos Clusters on Bare Metal.)
Kubernetes has been updated to version 1.32.4-gke.200.
The following issues have been resolved in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected:
Machines no longer experience intermittent connectivity loss. Google Distributed Cloud connected machines no longer experience intermittent connectivity loss; the underlying rare condition that can occur with fleet credential management has been resolved.
VNC sessions through Connect Gateway are now more resilient. The stability of VNC sessions to virtual machine workloads through Connect Gateway has been improved.
This release of Google Distributed Cloud connected contains the following known issues:
The gvisor runtime class is incompatible with Symcloud Storage persistent volumes in block mode. If you set a workload that uses Symcloud Storage persistent volumes in block mode to use the gvisor runtime class, the workload fails. Symcloud Storage persistent volumes in filesystem mode are not affected.
Cilium does not differentiate between TCP and UDP protocols. Cilium does not differentiate between TCP and UDP protocols for services that use both protocols on the same port number and routes traffic for both protocols to the same backend pods. This can render such services non-functional. To work around this issue, use a different port for each protocol.
Overlapping the Pod and cluster CIDR blocks for secondary networks causes network failure. If you specify overlapping CIDR blocks for Pods and clusters using the annotations.networking.gke.io/gdce-pod-cidr and annotations.networking.gke.io/gke-gateway-clusterip-cidr annotations in the Network resource, the Google Distributed Cloud connected virtual networking subsystem might behave erratically, including loss of connectivity. Follow the guidelines in (Optional) Configure island mode to prevent this issue.
The anthos-multinet container might take up to two hours to fully start. You might intermittently experience a slower than normal startup for the anthos-multinet container (up to two hours). To remedy this issue, contact Google Support.

Bug ID
Description
N/A
Security fix for apigee-runtime.
Carbon Footprint
We have corrected an issue affecting the market-based Scope 2 emissions for the europe-west2 (London) region in the July 2025 Carbon Footprint data.
In the July 2025 methodology update, renewable energy coverage was misapplied to the Scope 2 market-based emissions in the europe-west2 (London) region. This resulted in non-zero Scope 2 market-based emissions for europe-west2. This inconsistency arose from evolving RE100 market-boundary guidance following Brexit. While RE100 guidance excludes the UK from the EU market-boundary post-Brexit, it allows for the use of previously purchased EU energy attribute certificates (EACs) with sufficiently close vintages to be applied against UK consumption in 2024. Google's application of these EACs to UK consumption results in zero Scope 2 market-based emissions in the europe-west2 (London).
We have corrected our data to align with the RE100 market boundaries guidance and our corporate environmental reporting of matched renewable energy. Scope 2 market-based emissions for europe-west2 are now correctly reported as zero for July 2025, using 2024 renewable energy coverage consistent with Google's environmental report.
To correct your historical data, please run a backfill for July 2025 in your carbon footprint export. Due to a half-month lag in our data release, you will need to backfill the data for August 15, 2025, which will then update the July 2025 data in your BigQuery table.
Data for August 2025, available on September 15, 2025, will automatically reflect this correction. Data for all previous periods remains unaffected.
Cloud Healthcare API
Accept-Encoding compression headers on DICOM frame requests that contain
uncompressed pixel data (as defined by the DICOM transfer syntax) are now
supported and can return compressed results
Note: For very large downlinks and very large files where downlink vastly
outpaces compression speed, latency may slightly increase. Compression can be
disabled by not including the header in these cases.
Cloud Load Balancing
The global and classic external Application Load Balancers implemented on Google Front-Ends (GFEs) now support HTTP/1.0 explicitly as a protocol during ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) negotiation.
Previously, when the GFEs didn't support HTTP/1.0 explicitly, the GFE would return an SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK response, disable ALPN, and fall back to using HTTP/1 (which includes HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1)
as the default application protocol. After this change, GFEs will instead return HTTP/1.0, which provides clients with positive confirmation that their advertised HTTP/1.0 was accepted.
You are not expected to make any changes with this update. If a TLS handshake with HTTP/1.0 is unsuccessful, please contact support.
Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
If a specific active query is blocked or running much longer than expected, it can block other dependent queries. Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL offers an optional feature that lets you terminate specific long-running or blocked active queries.
For more information, see Blocked active queries (Preview).
Compute Engine
Preview: H4D VMs, designed for high performance computing (HPC) workloads, are now in preview. Based on 5th generation AMD EPYC Turin with Cloud RDMA 200 Gbps networking, H4D VMs offer 192 cores (SMT disabled), up to 1,488 GB of memory, and 3,750 GiB of Local SSD. H4D is optimized for tightly-coupled applications that scale across multiple nodes and offers RDMA-enabled 200 Gbps networking.
For more information, see H4D machine series.
Identity and Access Management
IAM offers predefined roles that are tailored to specific job functions. These roles cover all of the permissions that a user might need to perform their job. This feature is generally available.
For more information, see Predefined roles for job functions.
Permission errors in the Google Cloud console contain actionable steps for remediation. For more information, see Troubleshoot permission error messages.
Security Command Center
Security Command Center has improved the automatic selection of resources when
running attack path simulations using the default high-value resource set.
Risk
Engine
uses heuristics to identify resources used for non-production purposes. To help
ensure that you have information about the most important assets, Risk Engine
calculates the attack exposure score for all other resources in the default high-value resource set
before calculating the attack exposure score for these non-production resources.
To customize the high-value
resource set, see Define and manage your high-value resource
set.
For information about Risk Engine, see Attack exposure scores and attack
paths.
Security Command Center changed how Google Cloud subnets are handled when running attack path simulations. The result is that attack paths are more accurate in relation to networking. Certain customers with specific Google Cloud subnet configurations, for example, when a VPC connector accesses a subnetwork, may see significant changes to toxic combinations, chokepoints, and attack exposure scores.
Virtual Private Cloud
You can create a VPC network that supports RDMA over Falcon transport, which lets you run AI and high performance computing (HPC) workloads on VM instances that have the IRDMA network interface type in Google Cloud, such as H4D instances. This feature is available in Preview. For more information, see RDMA network profiles.

AI Hypercomputer
Generally available: The accelerator-optimized A4X machine type, the first GPU VM to run on Arm, is available on AI Hypercomputer. The A4X machine series has the NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips attached and runs on the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 platform. Use this machine type to run your large artificial intelligence (AI) models and machine learning (ML) workloads. The A4X machine type is currently available in the us-central1-a zone.
Generally available: You can receive a notification when maintenance for an A4X reservation sub-block is scheduled, starts, or is completed. Additionally, you can now view and trigger maintenance for an A4X reservation sub-block. These features give you more control over maintenance for your A4X reservations, helping you minimize downtimes for your workloads. For more information, see Manage host events across reservations.
You can receive at least seven days of advance notice for unplanned hardware maintenance for a reservation. This feature helps you more proactively control disruptions to your workloads when unplanned maintenance is scheduled after a host error or faulty host report. For more information, see Manage hardware emergency maintenance notifications.
Generally available: You can use the following Cloud Monitoring metrics to monitor your A4X VMs, and help you identify and troubleshoot issues with your GPUs:
NVLink runtime error
Uncorrectable DRAM ECC errors
Uncorrectable DRAM row remapping count
Uncorrectable DRAM row remapping failed
Uncorrectable PCIe errors
Uncorrectable cache ECC errors
For more information, see Monitor VMs and Slurm clusters.
Generally available: You can view and manage the topology of your A4X reservations, including sub-blocks. This feature helps you better understand the topology of the VMs in your workload to further minimize network latency, as well as understand the health of your reservation blocks or sub-blocks. For more information, see
View reserved capacity.
Generally available: When you reserve capacity for creating VMs, you can specify the reservation operational mode for your reserved capacity. A reservation operational mode defines how your VMs behave after a host error or faulty host report, and it determines your level of visibility and control over the reservation's infrastructure. For more information, see Reservation operational mode.
Generally available: When you reserve capacity for creating VMs, you can specify a maintenance scheduling type for your reservations. This feature helps you minimize downtimes by letting you specify whether you want to group VMs and have synchronized maintenance scheduling (grouped), or loosely couple VMs have independent maintenance scheduling (independent). For more information, see Maintenance scheduling types.

Gemini Code Assist
Deploy apps to Cloud Run in Gemini Code Assist agent mode (Preview)
Leverage the power of Gemini CLI extensions in VS Code Gemini Code Assist agent
mode with the /deploy custom slash command. The /deploy command lets you deploy
your existing web application to Cloud Run directly from agent mode. /deploy
takes care of what used to be a multi-step process of building, containerizing,
pushing, and configuring, and then returns a public URL for your live
application.
To get started using the /deploy command, create a web application
in your workspace, install the
Cloud Run MCP server,
turn on agent mode, and then type /deploy. Your app is deployed in minutes and
accessible through a public URL. For more information, see
Use commands.

Document AI
Document AI supports two service tiers and associated quotas: provisioned and best effort tiers.
The base is provisioned tier quota, which provides 120 pages per minute for Gemini 2.0 and 2.5 Flash LLM and 30 pages per minute for Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM.
If you require more volume, best effort tier quota provides 120 pages per minute for Gemini 2.0 and
2.5 Flash and 60 pages per minute for Gemini 2.5 Pro, and is only used once the
provisioned quota has been exhausted. This applies to quotas BestEffortOnlineProcessDocumentPagesPerMinutePerProjectUS, and EU, and
best_effort_online_process_document_pages_us and eu in the console.
Best effort can get up to 240 pages per minute for custom data extractor models
v1.4 and v1.5 with a quota increase request (QIR). You can make a QIR by contacting your sales team representative.
There is no service level agreement (SLA) for best effort tier.

Apigee X
On September 4, 2025, we released an updated version of Apigee.
Apigee policies for LLM/GenAI workloads are Generally Available (GA)
Four new Apigee policies supporting LLM/GenAI workloads are now GA:
SemanticCacheLookup policy
SemanticCachePopulate policy
SanitizeUserPrompt
SanitizeModelResponse
The Apigee semantic caching policies enable intelligent response reuse based on semantic similarity. Using these policies in your Apigee API proxies can minimize redundant backend API calls, reduce latency, and lower operational costs. With this release, the semantic caching policies support URL templating, enabling the use of variables for AI model endpoint values.
The Model Armor policies protect your AI applications by sanitizing user prompts to and responses from large language models (LLMs). Using these policies in your Apigee API proxies can mitigate the risks associated with LLM usage by leveraging Model Armor to detect prompt injection, prevent jailbreak attacks, apply responsible AI filters, filter malicious URLs, and protect sensitive data.
For more information on using these policies in your Apigee API proxies, see:

Agent desktop is GA
Agent desktop is now generally available (GA). Agent desktop is a customizable interface that provides agents quick access to the information and tools they need to handle customer sessions. The desktop layout includes the agent adapter as well as configurable panels that display information or tools. You can configure a distinct desktop layout for each session type: inbound calls, outbound calls, or chats. You can then can configure which desktop layout that an agent sees when they answer an inbound call, place an outbound call, or handle a chat. You can also configure announcements to communicate updates, alerts, and other important information directly to agents. For more information, see Agent desktop.
The agent desktop provides the following capabilities:
Create desktop layouts. With agent desktop, you can create customized desktop layouts for different use cases for your human agents. These include receiving inbound calls, placing outbound calls, and handling chat sessions. Your layouts can contain call adapters, chat adapters, and wide variety of panels for other capabilities such as live transcripts, knowledge assist, disposition codes, and session data feeds. You can also configure custom panels to use as widgets that you can drag into panels. For more information, see Create desktop layouts.
Configure custom panels. A custom panel displays one or more URLs for external resources. These can be documentation, tools, or other resources. A custom panel appears as a widget in the desktop layout builder. Then, when you create desktop layouts, you can drag widgets into panels. For more information, see Configure custom panels.
Use widgets. Widgets are containers of specific functionality that you can drag into panels in the desktop layout builder. The desktop layout builder comes with a number of pre-defined widgets, such as Session Data Feed, Dispostion Codes and Notes, Knowledge Assist, and Live Transcript.
Configure desktop layouts for agents. You can configure which desktop layout that agents see when they answer an inbound call, place an outbound call, or handle a chat. You can configure this globally, at the queue level, and at the team level. Queue-level layout settings take priority over global settings. Team-level settings take priority over both queue-level settings and default settings. For more information, see Configure desktop layouts for agents.
Configure announcements. With announcements, you can communicate updates, alerts, and other important information directly to agents. Announcements appear in the agent desktop as notification banners that persist until the agent dismisses them. Announcements also appear in the agent's announcement list. For more information, see Configure announcements.

Other changes in 1.34
containerd 2.1: GKE nodes are now upgraded to containerd 2.1. This release includes performance improvements such as faster image downloads. For a complete list of changes, see the official containerd 2.1 release notes.
VPA InPlaceOrRecreate: This version introduces a new InPlaceOrRecreate mode in Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) (Public Preview) powered by In-Place Pod Resize (IPPR/IPPU) that allows automatically rightsizing workloads often without recreating the Pod. This mode ensures seamless service continuity while minimizing costs during idle periods. If you haven't used VPA with your workloads before, enable Vertical Pod Autoscaler on your cluster and then create a VPA Object for a workload.
Deprecated in 1.34
The v1beta1 gRPC API between the Kubelet and DRA drivers is deprecated in this release in favor of the v1 API. This API will continue to function but we recommend that all drivers move to the v1 API to prepare for the eventual removal of the v1beta1 API.
CNI spec version for GKE Dataplane V2 updated to v1.1.0
Starting with GKE patch version 1.34, clusters using GKE Dataplane V2 are being updated from CNI spec v0.3.1 to v1.1.0.
Action required: If you use your own CNI plugins in your GKE cluster (such as self-managed open-source Istio), you must upgrade them
to a version compatible with CNI spec v1.1.0 to prevent errors.

The Prioritized list and Admin access features have been promoted to beta and will be enabled by default. The kubelet API has been updated to report status on resources allocated through DRA.
The Sleep Action for Pod prestop lifecycle hook is now GA. This can be used to delay Pod termination for graceful shutdown.
Streaming List Response Encoding is now GA. It enables efficient handling of requests for large object collections, improving API server reliability and performance.
In-Place Pod Resize, which was in beta, is now improved by adding support for decreasing memory limits with best-effort OOM protection. Improved deferred resize retries are also added, which are now prioritized and more responsive to resources becoming available. A new ResizeCompleted event records when a resize is completed.
On clusters with GKE Dataplane V2 that are on GKE version 1.34 and later, the ptp plugin is removed from the Container Network Interface (CNI) path. Pods that are created on new nodes have interfaces named lxc[INTERFACE_HASH] instead of gke[INTERFACE_HASH]. Additionally, the CNI configuration is moving from the netd DaemonSet to the cni-writer container in the anetd DaemonSet. For more information, see Overview of GKE Dataplane V2.
GKE alpha clusters enable all alpha and the default beta feature gates, which help you to test and validate upcoming Kubernetes capabilities. You can now modify the feature gates to enable or disable differently from the default values, which provides more granular control when leveraging these experimental features. Note that alpha clusters shouldn't be used for production workloads to ensure that your workloads remain stable and performant. For more information, see Alpha clusters.

Carbon Footprint
We recently released a new technical paper, "Measuring the Environmental Impact of Delivering AI at Google Scale" and blogpost. This research establishes a more comprehensive methodology for measuring the energy, emissions, and water consumption of AI inference in a live production environment. Our goal is to promote greater transparency and encourage the industry to align on more standardized, comprehensive measurement frameworks.
Currently, the data in Google Cloud Carbon Footprint for AI services does not fully reflect this comprehensive approach, which we believe is the most transparent environmental impact assessment from AI labs today. To better align with this new, more detailed methodology, we will be updating our carbon accounting pipeline for services that use AI, such as Vertex AI.
The new methodology provides a more accurate and complete picture of the environmental impact of AI services. We anticipate that this change, which will be implemented during our next semi-annual methodology refresh, may result in an increase in the emissions data for some of our Cloud AI services. However, we believe this move to more actionable data will enable us to more readily incentivize and track optimizations for these AI services.
The updated data will be released with the January 2026 methodology refresh, which is expected to be available in mid-February 2026. We believe this is an important step toward providing you with the most accurate and actionable data possible to manage your cloud usage more sustainably.

Guest Environment
Starting with version 20250901.00, the guest agent is migrated to a new
plugin-based architecture to improve modularity. You can revert to the previous
version by setting the metadata attribute enable-guest-agent-core-plugin to
FALSE. For more information about the plugin-based architecture, see
Guest agent.
This plugin-based guest agent is available for the following operating systems:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9
Rocky Linux 9
CentOS Stream 9
Oracle Linux 9
AlmaLinux 9
With the introduction of the plugin-based architecture, the guest agent includes
the following updates:
A new command-line tool, ggactl_plugin, is available to manage and restart
the guest agent core plugin. To restart the agent, run:
ggactl_plugin coreplugin restart
For more information, see Restarting the guest agent.
All guest agent components now use a new logging framework. This framework
lets you set the logging level in the
guest agent configuration file.
For more information about the logging options, see core settings
in the configuration options table.
The workload refresh service gce-workload-cert-refresher is now part of the
guest agent's core plugin. It is no longer a separate systemd service.
The guest agent updates the metadata script runner and the Authorized Keys
binary (Windows only) to use the new, configurable logging framework.
Compatibility managers are included to facilitate the migration.
An issue is fixed where network routes were not consistently applied
(GitHub Issue #516).
The system now consistently applies network routes by monitoring the route table
and re-adding routes when they disappear.

download. To
upgrade, see Upgrade
clusters.
Google Distributed Cloud for bare metal 1.33.0-gke.799 runs on Kubernetes
v1.33.2-gke.700.
After a release, it takes approximately 7 to 14 days for the version to become
available for installations or upgrades with the GKE On-Prem API
clients:
the Google Cloud console, the gcloud CLI, and Terraform.
If you use a third-party storage vendor, check the Ready storage
partners document to make sure the
storage vendor has already passed the qualification for this release of Google
Distributed Cloud for bare metal.
The following features were added in 1.33.0-gke.799:
GA: Introduced an Envoy sidecar into the GKE Identity Service to
increase security, reliability, and performance.
GA: Added support for the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS operating system with Linux
kernel versions, such as 6.8 and 6.11. Support for Linux kernel 6.14 is
explicitly excluded.
GA: Added the ability to override the cluster-level pod density setting
for individual node pools.
Preview: Added Node Agent to give you the ability to transition from
using Ansible over SSH for cluster operations to a more secure, agent-based
model. Added bmctl
nodeagent
commands to provide a straightforward and reliable process of migrating
existing clusters to use Node Agent.
Preview: Added a bundled version of the NVIDIA GPU Operator
(version 25.3.1). The bundled operator is an open-source solution for
managing the NVIDIA software components needed to provision and manage GPU
devices.
Preview: Added Dynamic Resource Allocation, a Kubernetes API that lets
you request and share generic resources, such as GPUs, among pods and
containers. When enabled, this capability helps you run AI workloads by
dynamically and precisely allocating the GPU resources within your bare
metal clusters, improving resource utilization and performance for demanding
workloads.
Preview: Added vertical Pod autoscaling, which lets you analyze and set
CPU and memory resources required by Pods. Instead of having to set
up-to-date CPU requests and limits and memory requests and limits for the
containers in your Pods, you can configure vertical Pod autoscaling to
provide recommended values for CPU and memory requests and limits that you
can use to manually update your Pods, or you can configure vertical Pod
autoscaling to automatically update the values.
Preview: Added support for skip minor version cluster upgrades. You can
directly upgrade your cluster control plane nodes (and entire cluster if
worker node pools aren't pinned at a lower version) to two minor versions
above the current version. Added the bmctl upgrade
intermediate-version
to print the intermediate version for a skip minor version upgrade.
Surface failures from node pool status to the RecentFailures field in
cluster status.
Surface failures from failed preflight checks triggered by the cluster
controller to the RecentFailures field in cluster status.
The following functional changes were made in 1.33.0-gke.799:
Changed logging behavior so that kubeadm logs show up in the journald of the
node machine where kubeadm runs.
To help prevent stale ARP cache issues, iptables-persistent is installed
in Debian nodes.
Cluster manifests are deployed using a Kubernetes job, allowing the cluster
operator to be more responsive to cluster events.
Updated the validation checks for cluster upgrades to enforce the cluster
version skew
rules
for user clusters. If the upgrade version information for a user cluster
doesn't comply with the version skew rules, the upgrade is halted.
Updated health checks and upgrade preflight checks to inspect for kubeadm
certificate expiration.
Updated etcd version to 3.5.21.
Removed support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 as it is beyond the Red
Hat support
window.
Removed support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as it has reached the end of standard
security maintenance in May
2025.
Upgraded ansible-core to 2.16.4 to support Python 3.12.
Increased the RSA key size for Cluster API certifications to 4096 bits for
improved security.
The following issues were fixed in 1.33.0-gke.799:
Fixed an issue where restoring a cluster that has a node with a GPU causes
instability of pods on the nodes.
Fixed an issue that caused the Ansible playbook for handling Cloud Audit
Logging to fail and not complete.
Fixed an issue that caused nodes to get stuck in maintenance mode. Health
checks have been updated so that the network check job skips connectivity
checks for nodes that are in maintenance mode.
Fixed an issue where the CronJob for periodic health checks wasn't updating
after configuration changes.

Google Kubernetes Engine
You can now run GPU workloads on Confidential GKE Nodes with the A3 High
machine type and NVIDIA H100 GPUs. This feature is available in
GKE version 1.32.2-gke.1297000 and later for manual GPU driver
installation, and in version 1.33.3-gke.1392000 and later for automatic driver
installation. This enables stronger data protection and integrity for
GPU-accelerated computations running within GKE clusters and
nodes. This feature is in General Availability.
For more information, see Encrypt GPU workload data in use with Confidential GKE Nodes.
GKE version 1.33.0-gke.1276000 and later remediate a low severity
vulnerability, in which an attacker with the ability to patch Node resources by
using the Kubernetes API could change specific node labels in clusters that use
Workload Identity Federation for GKE. This could result in the attacker gaining
access to node metadata, such as the IAM service account.
To remediate this
vulnerability, a validation policy is enforced that prevents unauthorized
modifications to the node labels that control metadata protection.

Organization Policy
Certain Organization Policy managed constraints that were released on August 21, 2025 were not functioning as intended. The Organization Policy Service evaluated these constraints as if the effectiveInstanceMetadata field of the resources that they were enforced on was empty, causing them to always evaluate to either allow or deny access to the resource.
The following managed constraints were evaluated to always allow creation of resources where they were enforced:
constraints/compute.managed.disableGuestAttributesAccess
constraints/compute.managed.disableSerialPortAccess
constraints/compute.managed.disableSerialPortLogging
The following managed constraints were evaluated to always block creation of resources where they were enforced:
constraints/compute.managed.disallowGlobalDns
constraints/compute.managed.requireOsConfig
constraints/compute.managed.requireOsLogin
This issue has been corrected, and these constraints now properly evaluate the effectiveInstanceMetadata field to determine whether resource creation should be allowed or blocked.

Apigee UI
On August 26, 2025, we released an updated version of the Apigee UI.
Debug view settings are now retained when switching between transactions
When switching between transactions in the debug view the following view settings are now retained:
The state of the expand all toggle
The zoom level of the graph
The positioning of the viewport in the graph (best effort). This may be modified due to discrepancies in between the transactions
The search filter. The active match will go into an indeterminate when switching transactions.
Added Display name column to Apps table
Added a column to the Apps table to show the App display name separate from the App name. The App name column will no longer show the display name if one is set. Instead the display name will appear in the new Display name column. You can also now filter by the App name and Display name independently.

The following issues were addressed in this release:
Fixed an issue where a blank error message box appeared in the agent adapter when a call connected.
Fixed an issue where the notification icon for a new message or event in the chat adapter didn't clear after the agent viewed the message or event.
Fixed a Conversational Insights issue where conversation recordings were split into a file for the human agent segment and a file for the virtual agent segment. Now all call segments are aggregated into a single recording file, which is more useful for conversational analysis.
Fixed an issue where a single call was being reported as two separate calls after the following occurred: (1) A call was escalated from a virtual agent to a queue, (2) An agent clicked Answer in the agent adapter, and (3) The end-user hung up before the countdown was complete.
Fixed an issue where agents were unsure whether their action of declining a call was taking effect. Now, after an agent declines a call, the Decline button changes to Declining..., the Answer button is deactivated, and a message displays indicating that the call was declined.
Fixed the message that appeared in the agent adapter when an agent left a multi-party session. Instead of saying that the session will be tranferred to the remaining agents(s), the message now says that the session will be transferred to the remaining participant(s). This is because the remaining participants might not be agents.
Fixed an issue where administators were unable to monitor or barge into calls.
Fixed an issue where the Decline button didn't display or didn't work correctly in the agent adapter when the following occurred: (1) An agent was in an active call, and (2) The agent received a second call on their direct number.
Fixed an issue where clearing the Play Call Recording Message checkbox in Settings > Call > Call Details pane didn't work if the queue was configured for human agents and virtual agents or virtual agents only.
Fixed an issue where the Transfer failed error message failed to appear in the call adapter after the following occured: a transferred call wasn't answered before the unanswered call expiration time expired.
Fixed an issue where an agent on a team that was assigned to a queue wasn't able to select their desired queue to make an outbound call. We also improved the text at Settings > Call > Call Details > Queue Selection for Outbound Call to better describe the call adapter behavior.
Fixed an issue where the missed chat message didn't appear after the missed chat threshold expired.
Fixed an issue where end-users were unable to download chat transcripts containing special characters, emoji, or redacted content.
Fixed an issue with the web SDK where configuring custom system messages with empty quotes or NULL values didn't fully suppress the messages.
Fixed an issue with the web SDK where some non-English characters in downloaded chat transcripts were appearing as question marks.
Fixed an issue in Hubspot where recordings of transferred calls were failing to save.
Fixed an issue in Salesforce where the Call button in the call adapter wasn't working for outbound calls to a phone number that was associated with a previous record.
Fixed an issue where the data in reports didn't match the data in the dashboards.
Fixed an issue where virtual agent calls using Dialogflow CX failed, ending unexpectedly.
Fixed two cross-site scripting vulnerabilites in the agent adapter.
Fixed an issue where deltacast selected the agent with the longest time in the Available status instead of the agent with the longest time since their last customer interaction.
Fixed an issue where escalations from a virtual agent to a human agent failed, and audio from the last agent response before human agent escalation was truncated.
Fixed an issue where transcriptions weren't being created for IVR calls.
Fixed an issue where agents could become stuck in wrap-up status, particularly with concurrent calls or quick callbacks.
Google Kubernetes Engine
A fix is available for an issue where the device-fs-monitor component in the
Node Problem Detector generated false ReadOnlyLocalSSDDetected warnings on
nodes that did not have local SSDs. This could cause customer confusion and
distracting warnings.
The fix is available in the following GKE versions:
1.32.6-gke.1096000 and later
1.33.0-gke.1712000 and later

Google Distributed Cloud connected
The following Google Distributed Cloud connected components have been updated:
EdgeOS kernel has been updated to version 5.15.177.
GDC software-only has been updated from version 1.30.500 to version 1.31.400. (This component was formerly known as GKE on Bare Metal and as Anthos Clusters on Bare Metal.)
Kubernetes has been updated from version 1.30 to version 1.31.
Symcloud Storage has been updated from version 5.4.14 to version 5.4.16.
The following issues have been resolved in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected:
Storage is now freed immediately upon cluster deletion. After deleting a cluster, the storage used by that cluster is now freed up immediately. You no longer have to manually delete all persistent volumes in a cluster before deleting the cluster itself.
Virtual machine workloads no longer fail to restart or migrate if DHCP server address changes. If you are using DHCP to assign IP addresses to your virtual machine workloads and the IP address of your DHCP server changes, your virtual machine workloads now automatically restart and successfully complete migration.
This release of Google Distributed Cloud connected contains the following known issues:
Machines can experience intermittent connectivity loss. Google Distributed Cloud connected machines can experience intermittent connectivity loss due to a rare condition that can occur with fleet credential management. To remedy this issue, contact Google Support.
The anthos-multinet container might take up to two hours to fully start. You might intermittently experience a slower than normal startup for the anthos-multinet container (up to two hours). To remedy this issue, contact Google Support.
Virtual machine workloads cannot coexist on the same virtual network with Pods that use DHCP for IP address assignment. This is because virtual machine workloads need the IPAMMode parameter set to external to use DHCP, while Pods need the IPAMMode parameter set to internal to use DHCP. Pods with static IP address are not affected by this. This behavior is by design.
This is a minor release of Google Distributed Cloud connected (version 1.10.0).
The following new functionality has been introduced in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected:
Pause and resume cluster software upgrades. Software upgrades for your Google Distributed Cloud connected clusters now automatically pause when a maintenance window ends and automatically resume when the next maintenance window starts. For more information, see Availability best practices.
VM management in Cloud Console for GDCc servers. You can now manage virtual machine workloads running on your Google Distributed Cloud connected servers deployments through the Cloud Console. For more information, see Manage virtual machines on Distributed Cloud connected servers.
Kernel memory accounting control. You can now configure the NodeSystemConfigUpdate Network Function operator resource to exclude kernel-space memory from Pod memory usage calculation. For more information, see NodeSystemConfigUpdate resource.
Configurable per-node subnet mask size. The Network Network Function operator resource now allows you to configure the subnet mask size for each node. For more information, see Network resource.
Raw workload log export. You can now access raw (unprocessed and untagged) workload logs for your Pods for export to your own log processor. For more information, see Collect raw workload logs for external processing.
The following changes to existing functionality have been introduced in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected:
Reduced minimum internet connection bandwidth requirement. The minimum internet connection bandwidth required by Google Distributed Cloud connected to function reliably has been reduced. For more information, see Internet connection bandwidth.
Security mitigations for the following vulnerabilities have been implemented in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected:
OS layer security mitigations: CVE-2024-56664, CVE-2024-56658, CVE-2023-52664, CVE-2024-27010, CVE-2024-56647, CVE-2024-53091.
GDC software-only security mitigations: All mitigations listed in the GDC software-only release notes from version 1.30.500 up to version 1.31.400 (inclusive).
Google Kubernetes Engine
For clusters enrolled in the Extended channel, you can now use
Gateway
with GKE version 1.30 or later, or
customized sysctl configuration options.
You can now receive a patch version in a release channel as soon as the version
is available and before GKE sets the version as an auto-upgrade
target in the channel by using accelerated patch auto-upgrades. Receiving
patch versions earlier can help accelerate auto-upgrade timelines for patches,
especially for use cases such as accelerating your compliance with security
requirements.
For more information, see
Accelerated patch auto-upgrades.

You can use cross region federated queries to query Spanner tables from regions other than the source BigQuery region. These cross region queries incur additional Spanner network egress charges. This feature is generally available (GA).
Buildpacks
The Python buildpack supports Cloud Run source deployments for modern web frameworks such as FastAPI, Gradio, and Streamlit.
For Python version 3.13 and later, the Python buildpack sets the default entrypoint for Cloud Run source deployments based on the web server or framework configuration in your requirements.txt file. For more information, see Build a Python application.
Carbon Footprint
For the July 2025 semi-annual methodology refresh (released in mid-August 2025), we implemented the following improvements and updated the carbon model to version 14:
Updating Scope 1 & 3 emissions from Google's corporate footprint:
Updated Scope 1 & 3 allocation factors using latest Google company-wide data from 2025 Google Environmental Report. See the non-electricity emission sources section of methodology documentation on how we apply these Scope 1 & 3 emissions across Google products and services.
Updating inputs for Scope 2 market-based emissions calculation from Google's corporate footprint:
Updated annual renewable electricity percentage from Google's clean energy procurement, in accordance with 2025 Google Environmental Report, as an input for Scope 2 market-based emissions.
Updated annual emissions factors from latest government sources, in accordance with 2025 Google Environmental Report, as an input for Scope 2 market-based emissions. Note that Scope 2 location-based emissions are estimated using hourly greenhouse gas emissions factors. Read more about the difference in methodology between Scope 2 location-based and market-based emissions in the methodology document.
Improving data accuracy:
A data issue impacting Cloud Run emissions calculations for March 2025 has been resolved. Incorrect carbon footprint data were generated for some Cloud Run SKUs due to a bug in our data processing logic, resulting in inflated carbon emission figures for affected users.
To correct your historical data, please run a backfill for March 2025 in your carbon footprint export. Due to a half-month lag in our data release, you will need to backfill the data for April 15, 2025, which will then update the March 2025 data in your BigQuery table. Data for all other periods remains unaffected.
Updating service coverage:
Integration Connectors and Application Integration were removed from covered services of Carbon Footprint, due to potential mis-attribution of carbon to these services. We are actively investigating and working on the improvements. Once internal data mapping improves for a service, we plan to add it back.
Deprecating carbon offsets fields from schema:
The carbon_offsets_kgCO2e and carbon_footprint_total_kgCO2e.after_offsets fields have been deprecated in the Carbon Footprint schema due to Google's strategic shift from traditional carbon offsets to a direct focus on carbon removal technologies and projects. If you have already set up an export, these two fields have been set to NULL and will not be updated.
This change is in line with Google's evolving strategy for achieving its net-zero climate goals with more robust and impactful climate solutions such as carbon removal technologies. Read more about Google's progress to accelerate carbon removal solutions.
Cloud Database Migration Service
Database Migration Service now supports Private Service Connect interfaces for network connectivity in homogeneous Cloud SQL for MySQL, Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, and AlloyDB for PostgreSQL migrations. For more information, see the following pages:
Networking methods in homogeneous Cloud SQL for MySQL migrations
Networking methods in homogeneous Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL migrations
Networking methods in homogeneous AlloyDB for PostgreSQL migrations
Cloud Run
The Python buildpack supports Cloud Run source deployments for modern web frameworks such as FastAPI, Gradio, and Streamlit.
For Python version 3.13 and later, the Python buildpack sets the default entrypoint for Cloud Run source deployments based on the web server or framework configuration in your requirements.txt file. For more information, see Build a Python application.

Apigee Advanced API Security
On August 6, 2025 we released an updated version of Advanced API Security
Note: Rollouts of this release to production instances will begin within two business days and may take four or more business days to complete across all Google Cloud zones. Your instances may not have the feature available until the rollout is complete.
Availability of Shadow API Discovery for APIs in any Google Cloud project
Using Shadow API Discovery, you can find undocumented/shadow APIs in your existing cloud infrastructure. Shadow APIs pose a security risk to your system, since they might be unsecured, unmonitored, and unmaintained.
With this release, you can configure and run API observation jobs in any Google Cloud project, without needing to provision Apigee in that project. You can also centrally view the results of API observation jobs and compare discovered API endpoints and operations to APIs cataloged in API hub to identify shadow APIs.
See the Shadow API Discovery overview for information on Shadow API Discovery and how to add it to projects.
Note: Data residency is not currently supported for Shadow API Discovery. See data residency compatibility.

Enabling the advanced runtime now includes short query optimizations. This feature is in preview.

General availability support for the following integration:
Eventarc Advanced
July 31, 2025
Apigee API hub
New data source support for plugins
API hub now supports importing API metadata through new dedicated plugins for the following data sources:
Apigee Edge Public Cloud
Apigee Edge Private Cloud (OPDK)
For more information, see Plugins overview.
Push-based plugin ingestion
API hub now supports push-based plugin ingestion. This method allows for more real-time synchronization of API metadata. All new Apigee, Apigee hybrid, Apigee Edge Public Cloud, and Apigee Edge Private Cloud (OPDK) plugins are created with push-based ingestion by default.
For more information, see Plugin data ingestion methods.
Note: Rollouts of this feature will begin today, and may take five or more business days to be completed across all Google Cloud zones. You may not be able to create push-based plugins until the rollout is complete.
Create custom plugins [API only]
You can now use the Create Plugin API to create custom plugins in API hub. Custom plugins are created manually to connect API hub to a specific API data source.
For more information, see Create custom plugins.
Default Apigee plugin instance not auto-created during runtime attachment
Issue: When provisioning API hub as part of Apigee provisioning, the default Apigee X and hybrid plugin instance is not automatically created. This prevents API proxies from being auto-registered.
Workaround: You can manually attach an Apigee runtime instance and import the Apigee assets. See Attach a runtime project.
Delete plugin instance changes
API hub no longer retains any ingested metadata from a plugin after its deletion. Deleting a plugin instance also permanently deletes all the associated API data from API hub.
For more information, see Delete a plugin instance.
Provisioning changes and Apigee API proxy registration
API hub changed how it registers API proxies from Apigee and how it creates default plugin instances during provisioning.
API hub now automatically creates a default Apigee X and hybrid plugin instance and auto-registers API proxies only when you provision it as part of Apigee provisioning.
If you provision API hub directly from the API hub UI, API hub does not automatically create a default plugin instance, nor does it auto-register proxies.

For more information, see Enrich API data with custom curation in API hub.
Deprecation of pull-based ingestion for Apigee plugins
Pull-based ingestion is no longer supported for Apigee and Apigee hybrid plugins as of July 31, 2025. For existing projects that have pull-based Apigee X and hybrid plugins configured, these plugins will continue to function and will be automatically migrated to the push-based type starting August 2025.
Deprecation of Apigee proxy deployment attributes
As of July 31st, 2025, the Apigee X and Hybrid Environment and Apigee X and Hybrid Organization attributes will no longer be added to new Apigee proxy deployments. This change specifically applies when you import deployments into API hub by attaching a runtime project.
If your existing projects use these attributes in filtered search queries, we recommend updating them. To ensure your searches continue to work, use the Source project and Source environment fields as alternatives.

Cloud Load Balancing
Starting October 15, 2025, the global and classic external Application Load Balancers are improving HTTP header handling for headers with obs-fold values to comply with the RFC 9112 standard
Previously, these load balancers would forward HTTP headers with obs-fold values (those split across multiple lines, with subsequent lines starting with a space or a tab) without any changes. Starting October 15, 2025, each obs-fold will be replaced with one or more space characters (SP octets) before forwarding the message upstream. This ensures that the header is correctly interpreted as a single line, as required by the HTTP specification.
What you need to do
Review your current client applications and backend services before October 15, 2025 and ensure that they generate HTTP headers with obs-fold values in a single-line format when communicating with these load balancers.
Because the obs-fold header fields have been deprecated in RFC 9112, compliant clients and servers should already avoid using this format. However, there is a possibility that services that specifically rely on the old, non-compliant multi-line format of headers with obs-fold values might experience unexpected behavior. You should proactively check your backend service logs for any errors originating from your services due to the modified obs-fold headers.
For more information on the HTTP specification regarding headers with obs-fold values, review RFC 9112, Section 5.2: Obsolete Line Folding.

Gemini Code Assist
Inline diff (Preview)
VS Code Gemini Code Assist 2.42.0
Inline diff
is available for VS Code Gemini Code Assist 2.42.0 in
Preview. With the inline diff
view, you can visually highlight code changes directly in your editor—green for
additions, red for deletions. This feature boosts productivity by offering
immediate visibility on modifications, streamlining reviews, and enabling
precise control over integrating new code, all without leaving your current
view.
If preferred, you can
change the diff view settings to have a side-by-side diff window
instead of the inline diff.
Google Cloud Architecture Center
(New guide) Well-Architected Framework: Financial services industry (FSI) perspective: Principles and recommendations that are specific to FSI, aligned to each pillar of the Architecture Framework.
Google Kubernetes Engine
In GKE version 1.33.2-gke.1335000 and later, the
GKE Gateway controller
supports
Gateway API v1.3 CRDs.
In GKE version 1.33.1-gke.1788000 and later, you can target specific reservation
sub-blocks in a reservation block by using the
reservationSubBlock field in compute classes.
In GKE version 1.32.2-gke.1359000 and later, you can now configure
collection scheduling
for single-host and multi-host TPU node pools by using
compute classes.
Collection scheduling lets you set a Service Level Objective (SLO) for your TPU
workloads.
Control plane datastore maintenance
Starting in May, 2025, Google is performing maintenance on the internal control
plane datastore for all GKE clusters to improve scalability and
reliability. We expect to complete these improvements across GKE
by October, 2025.
This maintenance is happening gradually across all GKE clusters,
and will occur in your clusters only during configured maintenance windows. The
maintenance process is expected to take approximately 15 minutes to complete
during your cluster's maintenance window.
Expected impact
During the internal control plane datastore maintenance, the
Kubernetes API server will be unavailable for 15 minutes, regardless of
whether you use a regional cluster or a zonal cluster. During this 15-minute
period, you won't be able to interact with the Kubernetes API server for your
cluster.
Consider the following potential disruptions to your normal workflows during the
maintenance window for your cluster:
Kubernetes API unavailability: you can't use the kubectl tool or any
other Kubernetes API client to issue commands to the control plane,
regardless of whether the cluster is regional or zonal. Attempts to deploy,
modify, or query resources by using the Kubernetes API will fail during this
period.
Halted deployments: automated deployment pipelines (CI/CD) that interact
with the Kubernetes API will fail to complete tasks such as deploying or
updating applications in the cluster.
Google Cloud console limitations: operations for the cluster in the
Google Cloud console that communicate with the Kubernetes API might fail
during the maintenance period.
Delayed control plane automation: features that are managed by the
control plane, such as the cluster autoscaler, Horizontal or Vertical
Pod Autoscaling adjustments, or some node auto-repair operations might be
paused until the API server is online.
The following resources have no expected impact during the maintenance period:
Running applications: any running applications and services on your
nodes should continue to function without interruptions.
Node pool operations: existing nodes should remain connected and
operational.
Network traffic: traffic in the data plane, such as traffic to and from
your running workloads, shouldn't be affected.
What you need to do
No action is required from you for the maintenance to occur. To plan for this
maintenance, we recommend that you do the following:
Review maintenance windows: review your cluster's
maintenance window and exclusions settings
and schedule maintenance windows during periods that minimize disruptions to
your normal workflows.
Plan for Kubernetes API unavailability: if you run critical operations
in your cluster that require access to the Kubernetes API, avoid scheduling
these operations during maintenance windows.
Important: This note is incorrect. For the correct note, see the entry for
August 5, 2025.
A fix is available for an issue in which the Compute Engine Persistent Disk CSI
driver failed with an invalid cpuString error on GKE nodes that used custom
machine types. This issue prevented successful attachment and mounting of
Persistent Disk volumes on affected nodes. The fix is available in the following
GKE versions:
1.31.10-gke.1021000 and later
1.32.4-gke.1698000 and later
1.33.1-gke.1386000 and later
