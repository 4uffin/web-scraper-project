Cloud Load Balancing
A security fix was made which changes the behavior of requests and responses sent with the Transfer-Encoding: Chunked header to be more RFC 9112 compliant. The RFC states that both the chunked_body and the last-chunk fields must end in CRLF. This is now enforced.
Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
The rollout of the following minor version upgrades is complete:
Minor versions
13.21 is upgraded to 13.22.
14.18 is upgraded to 14.19.
15.13 is upgraded to 15.14.
16.9 is upgraded to 16.10.
17.5 is upgraded to 17.6.
Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL adds support for the following extensions:
Extensions
plpgsql_check 2.8 is available for PostgreSQL version 14 and later.
roaringbitmap 0.5 is available for PostgreSQL version 12 and later.
To use these minor versions and the new extensions, update your instance to [PostgreSQL version].R20250727.00_23.
If you use a maintenance window, then the updates to the minor, extension, and plugin versions happen according to the timeframe that you set in the window. Otherwise, the updates occur within the next few weeks.
For more information on checking your maintenance version, see Self-service maintenance. To find your maintenance window or to manage maintenance updates, see Find and set maintenance windows.
Cloud Service Mesh
The following rollouts have completed for managed Cloud Service Mesh:
1.21.5-asm.55 has rolled out to the rapid release channel.
1.20.8-asm.48 has rolled out to the regular release channel.
1.19.10-asm.48 has rolled out to the stable release channel.
While the managed data plane automatically updates Envoy Proxies by restarting workloads, you must manually restart any StatefulSets and Jobs.
Cloud Storage
The bucket_attributes_view and bucket_attributes_latest_snapshot_view tables in Storage Insights datasets are updated with two new fields: objectCount and totalSize. objectCount reflects the total number of objects in the bucket and totalSize reflects the total size of the bucket in bytes. The tables are automatically updated with the new fields in all existing datasets and are included in all new dataset configurations.
Compute Engine
Compute Engine enforces limits to the total baseline performance that a project's Hyperdisk Balanced and Hyperdisk Balanced High Availability disks that are in the same zone can consume at the same time. The aggregate baseline performance limit is 50 GiB/s of throughput and 500,000 IOPS, and it only applies to baseline performance. For a detailed explanation, see Concurrent consumption limits for baseline performance.

Application Integration
Salesforce connected app requires installation for OAuth 2.0 authentication
A new security requirement from Salesforce restricts the use of uninstalled connected apps. To ensure your Salesforce triggers remain functional, you must install the connected app in your Salesforce account.
When establishing a new Salesforce trigger using OAuth 2.0 authentication, you are now required to install the connected app within your Salesforce account. This step is also necessary for existing triggers using OAuth 2.0 authentication if the connected app is not already installed, as failure to do so may cause them to stop working.
For more information, see Install the OAuth 2.0 connected app.
BigQuery
You can now access snapshots of Apache Iceberg external tables that are retained in your Iceberg metadata by using the FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF clause. This feature is generally available (GA).
You can use the JSON_KEYS function to extract unique JSON keys from a JSON expression, and you can specify a mode for some JSON functions that take a JSONPath to allow more flexibility in how the path matches the JSON structure. These features are generally available (GA).
SQL code completion is now available for all BigQuery projects. To learn how to enable and activate Gemini in BigQuery features, see Set up Gemini in BigQuery. This feature is available in preview.

Google Distributed Cloud connected
This is a minor release of Google Distributed Cloud connected (version 1.11.0).
The following new functionality has been introduced in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected:
Backup for VM workloads on GDC connected servers. You can now backup and restore virtual machine workloads on your Google Distributed Cloud connected servers deployment, including scheduling. For more information, see Back up a virtual machine.
Configurable runtime class for container workloads. As part of gVisor integration in Google Distributed Cloud connected, you can now specify the default runtime class for container workloads at both Pod and cluster level. Cluster-level runtime class selection is a preview-level feature. For more information, see Configure the runtime class for a Pod.
Island mode networking. Google Distributed Cloud connected now supports island mode networking on secondary network interfaces. For more information, see (Optional) Configure island mode.
AppArmor sandboxing audit logs for VM workloads. Google Distributed Cloud connected now lets you enable audit logs for virtual machine workloads sandboxed using AppArmor policies. To enable audit log emission on an existing virtual machine workload, restart the corresponding virtual machine. For more information, see View AppArmor sandboxing audit logs.
CoreDNS resolution for secondary networks. Google Distributed Cloud connected now supports specifying a CIDR block for use with secondary networks at both Pod and cluster level. This allows for CoreDNS resolution on secondary network interfaces. For more information, see Network resource.
Access clusters through Connect Gateway. You can now access your Google Distributed Cloud connected clusters through Connect Gateway. For more information, see Obtain cluster credentials through Connect Gateway.
VNC support for accessing VM workloads through Connect Gateway. You can now use VNC to access your virtual machine workloads through Connect Gateway.
Security mitigations for the following vulnerabilities have been implemented in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected:
OS layer security mitigations: CVE-2025-31498, CVE-2024-48615, CVE-2016-1585.
GDC software-only security mitigations: All mitigations listed in the GDC software-only release notes up to version 1.32.100 (inclusive).
The following Google Distributed Cloud connected components have been updated:
GDC software-only has been updated to version 1.32.100. (This component was formerly known as GKE on Bare Metal and as Anthos Clusters on Bare Metal.)
Kubernetes has been updated to version 1.32.4-gke.200.
The following issues have been resolved in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected:
Machines no longer experience intermittent connectivity loss. Google Distributed Cloud connected machines no longer experience intermittent connectivity loss; the underlying rare condition that can occur with fleet credential management has been resolved.
VNC sessions through Connect Gateway are now more resilient. The stability of VNC sessions to virtual machine workloads through Connect Gateway has been improved.
This release of Google Distributed Cloud connected contains the following known issues:
The gvisor runtime class is incompatible with Symcloud Storage persistent volumes in block mode. If you set a workload that uses Symcloud Storage persistent volumes in block mode to use the gvisor runtime class, the workload fails. Symcloud Storage persistent volumes in filesystem mode are not affected.
Cilium does not differentiate between TCP and UDP protocols. Cilium does not differentiate between TCP and UDP protocols for services that use both protocols on the same port number and routes traffic for both protocols to the same backend pods. This can render such services non-functional. To work around this issue, use a different port for each protocol.
Overlapping the Pod and cluster CIDR blocks for secondary networks causes network failure. If you specify overlapping CIDR blocks for Pods and clusters using the annotations.networking.gke.io/gdce-pod-cidr and annotations.networking.gke.io/gke-gateway-clusterip-cidr annotations in the Network resource, the Google Distributed Cloud connected virtual networking subsystem might behave erratically, including loss of connectivity. Follow the guidelines in (Optional) Configure island mode to prevent this issue.
The anthos-multinet container might take up to two hours to fully start. You might intermittently experience a slower than normal startup for the anthos-multinet container (up to two hours). To remedy this issue, contact Google Support.

Bug ID
Description
N/A
Security fix for apigee-runtime.
Carbon Footprint
We have corrected an issue affecting the market-based Scope 2 emissions for the europe-west2 (London) region in the July 2025 Carbon Footprint data.
In the July 2025 methodology update, renewable energy coverage was misapplied to the Scope 2 market-based emissions in the europe-west2 (London) region. This resulted in non-zero Scope 2 market-based emissions for europe-west2. This inconsistency arose from evolving RE100 market-boundary guidance following Brexit. While RE100 guidance excludes the UK from the EU market-boundary post-Brexit, it allows for the use of previously purchased EU energy attribute certificates (EACs) with sufficiently close vintages to be applied against UK consumption in 2024. Google's application of these EACs to UK consumption results in zero Scope 2 market-based emissions in the europe-west2 (London).
We have corrected our data to align with the RE100 market boundaries guidance and our corporate environmental reporting of matched renewable energy. Scope 2 market-based emissions for europe-west2 are now correctly reported as zero for July 2025, using 2024 renewable energy coverage consistent with Google's environmental report.
To correct your historical data, please run a backfill for July 2025 in your carbon footprint export. Due to a half-month lag in our data release, you will need to backfill the data for August 15, 2025, which will then update the July 2025 data in your BigQuery table.
Data for August 2025, available on September 15, 2025, will automatically reflect this correction. Data for all previous periods remains unaffected.
Cloud Healthcare API
Accept-Encoding compression headers on DICOM frame requests that contain
uncompressed pixel data (as defined by the DICOM transfer syntax) are now
supported and can return compressed results
Note: For very large downlinks and very large files where downlink vastly
outpaces compression speed, latency may slightly increase. Compression can be
disabled by not including the header in these cases.
Cloud Load Balancing
The global and classic external Application Load Balancers implemented on Google Front-Ends (GFEs) now support HTTP/1.0 explicitly as a protocol during ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) negotiation.
Previously, when the GFEs didn't support HTTP/1.0 explicitly, the GFE would return an SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK response, disable ALPN, and fall back to using HTTP/1 (which includes HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1)
as the default application protocol. After this change, GFEs will instead return HTTP/1.0, which provides clients with positive confirmation that their advertised HTTP/1.0 was accepted.
You are not expected to make any changes with this update. If a TLS handshake with HTTP/1.0 is unsuccessful, please contact support.
Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
If a specific active query is blocked or running much longer than expected, it can block other dependent queries. Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL offers an optional feature that lets you terminate specific long-running or blocked active queries.
For more information, see Blocked active queries (Preview).
Compute Engine
Preview: H4D VMs, designed for high performance computing (HPC) workloads, are now in preview. Based on 5th generation AMD EPYC Turin with Cloud RDMA 200 Gbps networking, H4D VMs offer 192 cores (SMT disabled), up to 1,488 GB of memory, and 3,750 GiB of Local SSD. H4D is optimized for tightly-coupled applications that scale across multiple nodes and offers RDMA-enabled 200 Gbps networking.
For more information, see H4D machine series.
Identity and Access Management
IAM offers predefined roles that are tailored to specific job functions. These roles cover all of the permissions that a user might need to perform their job. This feature is generally available.
For more information, see Predefined roles for job functions.
Permission errors in the Google Cloud console contain actionable steps for remediation. For more information, see Troubleshoot permission error messages.
Security Command Center
Security Command Center has improved the automatic selection of resources when
running attack path simulations using the default high-value resource set.
Risk
Engine
uses heuristics to identify resources used for non-production purposes. To help
ensure that you have information about the most important assets, Risk Engine
calculates the attack exposure score for all other resources in the default high-value resource set
before calculating the attack exposure score for these non-production resources.
To customize the high-value
resource set, see Define and manage your high-value resource
set.
For information about Risk Engine, see Attack exposure scores and attack
paths.
Security Command Center changed how Google Cloud subnets are handled when running attack path simulations. The result is that attack paths are more accurate in relation to networking. Certain customers with specific Google Cloud subnet configurations, for example, when a VPC connector accesses a subnetwork, may see significant changes to toxic combinations, chokepoints, and attack exposure scores.
Virtual Private Cloud
You can create a VPC network that supports RDMA over Falcon transport, which lets you run AI and high performance computing (HPC) workloads on VM instances that have the IRDMA network interface type in Google Cloud, such as H4D instances. This feature is available in Preview. For more information, see RDMA network profiles.

Gemini Code Assist
Introducing Release Channels in Gemini Code Assist
We're rolling out Release Channels in Gemini Code Assist Standard and Enterprise
to give you more control over the features and models you access, helping us
deliver new capabilities faster. This means direct access to our latest features,
minimizing the need for sign-ups.
You can choose between the Preview Channel for early access to cutting-edge
features (no SLA) or the GA Channel for stable, fully supported features with a
standard Google Cloud SLA. Project leads and administrators can easily configure
these settings at the Google Cloud Platform project level within the Admin for
Gemini settings, making it simple to opt in your entire team to the Preview
channel if desired. Note that at launch, the two release channels have
identical features. For more information, see
Configure Gemini Code Assist release channels.
Performance and stability improvements for VS Code
Numerous performance and stability improvements have been made to the Gemini
Code Assist extension, further reducing extension crashes and related adverse
functional events.
Edit a prior prompt in VS Code
You can edit a prior prompt in Gemini Code Assist and receive a regenerated
response based on your edited prompt.
Regenerate a prompt response in VS Code
You can regenerate a prompt response to your most recent prompt, where
Gemini Code Assist re-evaluates your prompt and provides a new response.
Delete prompt and response pair in VS Code
You can delete your prompt and Gemini's response to that prompt in your chat with
Gemini Code Assist. This works as an alternative to deleting your entire chat
history, allowing you to remove a single prompt and response within a chat,
while maintaining the rest of your chat history with Gemini Code Assist.

Document AI
Document AI supports two service tiers and associated quotas: provisioned and best effort tiers.
The base is provisioned tier quota, which provides 120 pages per minute for Gemini 2.0 and 2.5 Flash LLM and 30 pages per minute for Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM.
If you require more volume, best effort tier quota provides 120 pages per minute for Gemini 2.0 and
2.5 Flash and 60 pages per minute for Gemini 2.5 Pro, and is only used once the
provisioned quota has been exhausted. This applies to quotas BestEffortOnlineProcessDocumentPagesPerMinutePerProjectUS, and EU, and
best_effort_online_process_document_pages_us and eu in the console.
Best effort can get up to 240 pages per minute for custom data extractor models
v1.4 and v1.5 with a quota increase request (QIR). You can make a QIR by contacting your sales team representative.
There is no service level agreement (SLA) for best effort tier.

agent version 20250901.00:
Corrects an issue in the OS Login module that was incorrectly handling
optional runtime systemd dependencies and causing an error log.
Fixes a bug that could cause the metadata SSH key module to enter an infinite
loop when setting up SSH keys. This occurred if an initial setup attempt failed
and the metadata server returned the SSH keys in a different order on a
subsequent retry.
Organization Policy
Preview: Eight new organization policy constraints are available to help you
enforce security best practices for Compute Engine virtual machine (VM)
instances.
These managed constraints
simplify governance for common security scenarios and integrate with safe
rollout tools like
dry-run
and
simulation,
letting you test their impact before enforcement.
The new constraints are as follows:
compute.managed.disableNestedVirtualization
compute.managed.disableSerialPortAccess
compute.managed.disableSerialPortLogging
compute.managed.disallowGlobalDns
compute.managed.requireOsConfig
compute.managed.requireOsLogin
compute.managed.vmCanIpForward
compute.managed.vmExternalIpAccess
These constraints can evaluate metadata values at the VM instance, project, or
zonal level. For more information about these managed constraints, see Managed
Constraints in the Resource Manager documentation.

Apigee X
On September 4, 2025, we released an updated version of Apigee.
Apigee policies for LLM/GenAI workloads are Generally Available (GA)
Four new Apigee policies supporting LLM/GenAI workloads are now GA:
SemanticCacheLookup policy
SemanticCachePopulate policy
SanitizeUserPrompt
SanitizeModelResponse
The Apigee semantic caching policies enable intelligent response reuse based on semantic similarity. Using these policies in your Apigee API proxies can minimize redundant backend API calls, reduce latency, and lower operational costs. With this release, the semantic caching policies support URL templating, enabling the use of variables for AI model endpoint values.
The Model Armor policies protect your AI applications by sanitizing user prompts to and responses from large language models (LLMs). Using these policies in your Apigee API proxies can mitigate the risks associated with LLM usage by leveraging Model Armor to detect prompt injection, prevent jailbreak attacks, apply responsible AI filters, filter malicious URLs, and protect sensitive data.
For more information on using these policies in your Apigee API proxies, see:
Get started with semantic caching policies

Agent desktop is GA
Agent desktop is now generally available (GA). Agent desktop is a customizable interface that provides agents quick access to the information and tools they need to handle customer sessions. The desktop layout includes the agent adapter as well as configurable panels that display information or tools. You can configure a distinct desktop layout for each session type: inbound calls, outbound calls, or chats. You can then can configure which desktop layout that an agent sees when they answer an inbound call, place an outbound call, or handle a chat. You can also configure announcements to communicate updates, alerts, and other important information directly to agents. For more information, see Agent desktop.
The agent desktop provides the following capabilities:
Create desktop layouts. With agent desktop, you can create customized desktop layouts for different use cases for your human agents. These include receiving inbound calls, placing outbound calls, and handling chat sessions. Your layouts can contain call adapters, chat adapters, and wide variety of panels for other capabilities such as live transcripts, knowledge assist, disposition codes, and session data feeds. You can also configure custom panels to use as widgets that you can drag into panels. For more information, see Create desktop layouts.
Configure custom panels. A custom panel displays one or more URLs for external resources. These can be documentation, tools, or other resources. A custom panel appears as a widget in the desktop layout builder. Then, when you create desktop layouts, you can drag widgets into panels. For more information, see Configure custom panels.
Use widgets. Widgets are containers of specific functionality that you can drag into panels in the desktop layout builder. The desktop layout builder comes with a number of pre-defined widgets, such as Session Data Feed, Dispostion Codes and Notes, Knowledge Assist, and Live Transcript.
Configure desktop layouts for agents. You can configure which desktop layout that agents see when they answer an inbound call, place an outbound call, or handle a chat. You can configure this globally, at the queue level, and at the team level. Queue-level layout settings take priority over global settings. Team-level settings take priority over both queue-level settings and default settings. For more information, see Configure desktop layouts for agents.
Configure announcements. With announcements, you can communicate updates, alerts, and other important information directly to agents. Announcements appear in the agent desktop as notification banners that persist until the agent dismisses them. Announcements also appear in the agent's announcement list. For more information, see Configure announcements.

Google Kubernetes Engine
Other changes in 1.34
containerd 2.1: GKE nodes are now upgraded to containerd 2.1. This release includes performance improvements such as faster image downloads. For a complete list of changes, see the official containerd 2.1 release notes.
VPA InPlaceOrRecreate: This version introduces a new InPlaceOrRecreate mode in Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) (Public Preview) powered by In-Place Pod Resize (IPPR/IPPU) that allows automatically rightsizing workloads often without recreating the Pod. This mode ensures seamless service continuity while minimizing costs during idle periods. If you haven't used VPA with your workloads before, enable Vertical Pod Autoscaler on your cluster and then create a VPA Object for a workload.
Deprecated in 1.34
The v1beta1 gRPC API between the Kubelet and DRA drivers is deprecated in this release in favor of the v1 API. This API will continue to function but we recommend that all drivers move to the v1 API to prepare for the eventual removal of the v1beta1 API.
CNI spec version for GKE Dataplane V2 updated to v1.1.0
Starting with GKE patch version 1.34, clusters using GKE Dataplane V2 are being updated from CNI spec v0.3.1 to v1.1.0.
Action required: If you use your own CNI plugins in your GKE cluster (such as self-managed open-source Istio), you must upgrade them
to a version compatible with CNI spec v1.1.0 to prevent errors.
Kubernetes 1.34 is now available in the Rapid channel
Kubernetes 1.34 is now available in the Rapid channel. For more information about the content of Kubernetes 1.34, read the Kubernetes 1.34 Release Notes.
New features in Kubernetes 1.34
The Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) APIs are now generally available. For more information about using DRA in GKE, see About dynamic resource allocation in GKE. The Prioritized list and Admin access features have been promoted to beta and will be enabled by default. The kubelet API has been updated to report status on resources allocated through DRA.
The Sleep Action for Pod prestop lifecycle hook is now GA. This can be used to delay Pod termination for graceful shutdown.
Streaming List Response Encoding is now GA. It enables efficient handling of requests for large object collections, improving API server reliability and performance.
In-Place Pod Resize, which was in beta, is now improved by adding support for decreasing memory limits with best-effort OOM protection. Improved deferred resize retries are also added, which are now prioritized and more responsive to resources becoming available. A new ResizeCompleted event records when a resize is completed.
On clusters with GKE Dataplane V2 that are on GKE version 1.34 and later, the ptp plugin is removed from the Container Network Interface (CNI) path. Pods that are created on new nodes have interfaces named lxc[INTERFACE_HASH] instead of gke[INTERFACE_HASH]. Additionally, the CNI configuration is moving from the netd DaemonSet to the cni-writer container in the anetd DaemonSet. For more information, see Overview of GKE Dataplane V2.
GKE alpha clusters enable all alpha and the default beta feature gates, which help you to test and validate upcoming Kubernetes capabilities. You can now modify the feature gates to enable or disable differently from the default values, which provides more granular control when leveraging these experimental features. Note that alpha clusters shouldn't be used for production workloads to ensure that your workloads remain stable and performant. For more information, see Alpha clusters.

Carbon Footprint
We recently released a new technical paper, "Measuring the Environmental Impact of Delivering AI at Google Scale" and blogpost. This research establishes a more comprehensive methodology for measuring the energy, emissions, and water consumption of AI inference in a live production environment. Our goal is to promote greater transparency and encourage the industry to align on more standardized, comprehensive measurement frameworks.
Currently, the data in Google Cloud Carbon Footprint for AI services does not fully reflect this comprehensive approach, which we believe is the most transparent environmental impact assessment from AI labs today. To better align with this new, more detailed methodology, we will be updating our carbon accounting pipeline for services that use AI, such as Vertex AI.
The new methodology provides a more accurate and complete picture of the environmental impact of AI services. We anticipate that this change, which will be implemented during our next semi-annual methodology refresh, may result in an increase in the emissions data for some of our Cloud AI services. However, we believe this move to more actionable data will enable us to more readily incentivize and track optimizations for these AI services.
The updated data will be released with the January 2026 methodology refresh, which is expected to be available in mid-February 2026. We believe this is an important step toward providing you with the most accurate and actionable data possible to manage your cloud usage more sustainably.
Cloud Composer
The following Cloud Composer versions and builds have reached their

Google Kubernetes Engine
You can now run GPU workloads on Confidential GKE Nodes with the A3 High
machine type and NVIDIA H100 GPUs. This feature is available in
GKE version 1.32.2-gke.1297000 and later for manual GPU driver
installation, and in version 1.33.3-gke.1392000 and later for automatic driver
installation. This enables stronger data protection and integrity for
GPU-accelerated computations running within GKE clusters and
nodes. This feature is in General Availability.
For more information, see Encrypt GPU workload data in use with Confidential GKE Nodes.
GKE version 1.33.0-gke.1276000 and later remediate a low severity
vulnerability, in which an attacker with the ability to patch Node resources by
using the Kubernetes API could change specific node labels in clusters that use
Workload Identity Federation for GKE. This could result in the attacker gaining
access to node metadata, such as the IAM service account.
To remediate this
vulnerability, a validation policy is enforced that prevents unauthorized
modifications to the node labels that control metadata protection.

Organization Policy
Certain Organization Policy managed constraints that were released on August 21, 2025 were not functioning as intended. The Organization Policy Service evaluated these constraints as if the effectiveInstanceMetadata field of the resources that they were enforced on was empty, causing them to always evaluate to either allow or deny access to the resource.
The following managed constraints were evaluated to always allow creation of resources where they were enforced:
constraints/compute.managed.disableGuestAttributesAccess
constraints/compute.managed.disableSerialPortAccess
constraints/compute.managed.disableSerialPortLogging
The following managed constraints were evaluated to always block creation of resources where they were enforced:
constraints/compute.managed.disallowGlobalDns
constraints/compute.managed.requireOsConfig
constraints/compute.managed.requireOsLogin
This issue has been corrected, and these constraints now properly evaluate the effectiveInstanceMetadata field to determine whether resource creation should be allowed or blocked.

Portal version 3.39 pre-release notes
Here are the pre-release notes for portal version 3.39. When we release version 3.39, we expect the new capabilities to be as shown here.
Destination queue name and session history is available in the agent adapter
The agent adapter now displays the destination queue during transfers and deflections for IVR calls. The agent adapter also displays transfer history in the Call details and Chat details tabs.
User experience changes:
The Call details and Chat details tabs in the agent adapter have a new Transfer History section.
The chat pane in the chat adapter has a new Transfers button that opens the Tranfer History pane.
Adminstrators: There's a new checkbox at Settings > Operation Management > Transfer history for turning on transfer history in the agent adapter.
Improved controls over the ordering of key-value pairs in the agent adapter and CRM records
Google Cloud CCaaS has improved controls over the ordering of the key-value pairs that appear in the agent adapter and in CRM records. Here's how the ordering controls work:
Virtual agents: When you configure session variables, you can use the new display_order_in_adapter property to specify the order that the session variables appear in the agent adapter and in CRM records.
Web SDK: Web SDK custom data is displayed in the agent adapter and CRM records in the order that the key-value pairs appear in the JSON custom data file.
Virtual agents for the SMS channel
Virtual agents are now available for the SMS channel. This lets you create virtual agents and assign them to SMS queues, offering virtual agent support to end-users in SMS chat sessions.
Search in the email channel
Agents can now search for emails in the agent adapter by keyword, session ID, or subject.
Cancel scheduled calls with the callback calls API
You can now use the callback calls API to cancel a single scheduled callback call or a list of calls.
The following issues were addressed in this release:
Fixed an issue where incoming chats took precedence over the in-progress chat.
User experience change: When a new chat appears in the agent adapter, it no longer takes focus away from the in-progress chat. The in-progress retains focus.
Fixed a web SDK issue where sensitive data sent by an end-user was redacted for both the end-user and the agent, instead of just for the agent.
Fixed an issue where the contact list in the agent adapter wouldn't load the full list of contacts.

Version 3.37 is released
All release notes published on this date are part of version 3.37.
The timing of the update to your instance depends on the deployment schedule that you have chosen. For more information, see Deployment schedules.
Restrict email transfers
You can now configure your instance to prevent users with the agent role from transferring email sessions to other agents. Agents can still assign unassigned emails to themselves, and users with the manager role can still transfer email sessions from agent to agent.
Administrators: There's a new Transfer Restrictions pane at Settings > Queue > Email > Edit / View > [queue] > Transfer Restrictions > Configure.
For more information, see Prevent email reassignment.
Skip the connecting message playback
You can now configure your instance to skip playback of the connecting message when calls are connected to agents.
Administrators: The Settings > Call > Call Details pane contains a new Skip the Connecting Message playback checkbox.
For more information, see Configure global call settings.
Workforce Management terminology update
We've updated the terminology in the Workforce Management interface to align with Google Cloud CCaaS terminology. For example, we've changed "supervisor" to "manager", "employee" to "agent", and "Supervisor Portal" to "Manager Portal".

New advanced reporting dashboards
The following new advanced reporting dashboards are available:
Missed interactions. Get data on missed interactions to help you optimize operations. For more information, see Missed interactions dashboards.
Failed sessions. Get insight into why your sessions are failing. For more information, see Failed sessions dashboards.
Screen share. Get data on your agents' Screen Share interactions with end-users. For more information, see Screen shared dashboards.

Dispositions. Get disposition information to gain insights into common end-user issues and concerns. For more information, see Dispositions dashboards.
The following issues were addressed in this release:
Fixed an issue where a blank error message box appeared in the agent adapter when a call connected.
Fixed an issue where the notification icon for a new message or event in the chat adapter didn't clear after the agent viewed the message or event.
Fixed a Conversational Insights issue where conversation recordings were split into a file for the human agent segment and a file for the virtual agent segment. Now all call segments are aggregated into a single recording file, which is more useful for conversational analysis.
Fixed an issue where a single call was being reported as two separate calls after the following occurred: (1) A call was escalated from a virtual agent to a queue, (2) An agent clicked Answer in the agent adapter, and (3) The end-user hung up before the countdown was complete.
Fixed an issue where agents were unsure whether their action of declining a call was taking effect. Now, after an agent declines a call, the Decline button changes to Declining..., the Answer button is deactivated, and a message displays indicating that the call was declined.
Fixed the message that appeared in the agent adapter when an agent left a multi-party session. Instead of saying that the session will be tranferred to the remaining agents(s), the message now says that the session will be transferred to the remaining participant(s). This is because the remaining participants might not be agents.
Fixed an issue where administators were unable to monitor or barge into calls.
Fixed an issue where the Decline button didn't display or didn't work correctly in the agent adapter when the following occurred: (1) An agent was in an active call, and (2) The agent received a second call on their direct number.
Fixed an issue where clearing the Play Call Recording Message checkbox in Settings > Call > Call Details pane didn't work if the queue was configured for human agents and virtual agents or virtual agents only.
Fixed an issue where the Transfer failed error message failed to appear in the call adapter after the following occured: a transferred call wasn't answered before the unanswered call expiration time expired.
Fixed an issue where an agent on a team that was assigned to a queue wasn't able to select their desired queue to make an outbound call. We also improved the text at Settings > Call > Call Details > Queue Selection for Outbound Call to better describe the call adapter behavior.
Fixed an issue where the missed chat message didn't appear after the missed chat threshold expired.
Fixed an issue where end-users were unable to download chat transcripts containing special characters, emoji, or redacted content.
Fixed an issue with the web SDK where configuring custom system messages with empty quotes or NULL values didn't fully suppress the messages.
Fixed an issue with the web SDK where some non-English characters in downloaded chat transcripts were appearing as question marks.
Fixed an issue in Hubspot where recordings of transferred calls were failing to save.
Fixed an issue in Salesforce where the Call button in the call adapter wasn't working for outbound calls to a phone number that was associated with a previous record.
Fixed an issue where the data in reports didn't match the data in the dashboards.
Fixed an issue where virtual agent calls using Dialogflow CX failed, ending unexpectedly.
Fixed two cross-site scripting vulnerabilites in the agent adapter.
Fixed an issue where deltacast selected the agent with the longest time in the Available status instead of the agent with the longest time since their last customer interaction.
Fixed an issue where escalations from a virtual agent to a human agent failed, and audio from the last agent response before human agent escalation was truncated.
Fixed an issue where transcriptions weren't being created for IVR calls.
Fixed an issue where agents could become stuck in wrap-up status, particularly with concurrent calls or quick callbacks.
Google Kubernetes Engine
A fix is available for an issue where the device-fs-monitor component in the

Google Distributed Cloud connected
The following Google Distributed Cloud connected components have been updated:
EdgeOS kernel has been updated to version 5.15.177.
GDC software-only has been updated from version 1.30.500 to version 1.31.400. (This component was formerly known as GKE on Bare Metal and as Anthos Clusters on Bare Metal.)
Kubernetes has been updated from version 1.30 to version 1.31.
Symcloud Storage has been updated from version 5.4.14 to version 5.4.16.
The following issues have been resolved in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected:
Storage is now freed immediately upon cluster deletion. After deleting a cluster, the storage used by that cluster is now freed up immediately. You no longer have to manually delete all persistent volumes in a cluster before deleting the cluster itself.
Virtual machine workloads no longer fail to restart or migrate if DHCP server address changes. If you are using DHCP to assign IP addresses to your virtual machine workloads and the IP address of your DHCP server changes, your virtual machine workloads now automatically restart and successfully complete migration.
This release of Google Distributed Cloud connected contains the following known issues:
Machines can experience intermittent connectivity loss. Google Distributed Cloud connected machines can experience intermittent connectivity loss due to a rare condition that can occur with fleet credential management. To remedy this issue, contact Google Support.
The anthos-multinet container might take up to two hours to fully start. You might intermittently experience a slower than normal startup for the anthos-multinet container (up to two hours). To remedy this issue, contact Google Support.
Virtual machine workloads cannot coexist on the same virtual network with Pods that use DHCP for IP address assignment. This is because virtual machine workloads need the IPAMMode parameter set to external to use DHCP, while Pods need the IPAMMode parameter set to internal to use DHCP. Pods with static IP address are not affected by this. This behavior is by design.
This is a minor release of Google Distributed Cloud connected (version 1.10.0).
The following new functionality has been introduced in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected:
Pause and resume cluster software upgrades. Software upgrades for your Google Distributed Cloud connected clusters now automatically pause when a maintenance window ends and automatically resume when the next maintenance window starts. For more information, see Availability best practices.
VM management in Cloud Console for GDCc servers. You can now manage virtual machine workloads running on your Google Distributed Cloud connected servers deployments through the Cloud Console. For more information, see Manage virtual machines on Distributed Cloud connected servers.
Kernel memory accounting control. You can now configure the NodeSystemConfigUpdate Network Function operator resource to exclude kernel-space memory from Pod memory usage calculation. For more information, see NodeSystemConfigUpdate resource.
Configurable per-node subnet mask size. The Network Network Function operator resource now allows you to configure the subnet mask size for each node. For more information, see Network resource.
Raw workload log export. You can now access raw (unprocessed and untagged) workload logs for your Pods for export to your own log processor. For more information, see Collect raw workload logs for external processing.
The following changes to existing functionality have been introduced in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected:
Reduced minimum internet connection bandwidth requirement. The minimum internet connection bandwidth required by Google Distributed Cloud connected to function reliably has been reduced. For more information, see Internet connection bandwidth.
Security mitigations for the following vulnerabilities have been implemented in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected:
OS layer security mitigations: CVE-2024-56664, CVE-2024-56658, CVE-2023-52664, CVE-2024-27010, CVE-2024-56647, CVE-2024-53091.
GDC software-only security mitigations: All mitigations listed in the GDC software-only release notes from version 1.30.500 up to version 1.31.400 (inclusive).
Google Kubernetes Engine
For clusters enrolled in the Extended channel, you can now use
Gateway

customized sysctl configuration options.
You can now receive a patch version in a release channel as soon as the version
is available and before GKE sets the version as an auto-upgrade
target in the channel by using accelerated patch auto-upgrades. Receiving
patch versions earlier can help accelerate auto-upgrade timelines for patches,
especially for use cases such as accelerating your compliance with security
requirements.
For more information, see
Accelerated patch auto-upgrades.

The Python buildpack supports Cloud Run source deployments for modern web frameworks such as FastAPI, Gradio, and Streamlit.
For Python version 3.13 and later, the Python buildpack sets the default entrypoint for Cloud Run source deployments based on the web server or framework configuration in your requirements.txt file. For more information, see Build a Python application.
Carbon Footprint
For the July 2025 semi-annual methodology refresh (released in mid-August 2025), we implemented the following improvements and updated the carbon model to version 14:
Updating Scope 1 & 3 emissions from Google's corporate footprint:
Updated Scope 1 & 3 allocation factors using latest Google company-wide data from 2025 Google Environmental Report. See the non-electricity emission sources section of methodology documentation on how we apply these Scope 1 & 3 emissions across Google products and services.
Updating inputs for Scope 2 market-based emissions calculation from Google's corporate footprint:
Updated annual renewable electricity percentage from Google's clean energy procurement, in accordance with 2025 Google Environmental Report, as an input for Scope 2 market-based emissions.
Updated annual emissions factors from latest government sources, in accordance with 2025 Google Environmental Report, as an input for Scope 2 market-based emissions. Note that Scope 2 location-based emissions are estimated using hourly greenhouse gas emissions factors. Read more about the difference in methodology between Scope 2 location-based and market-based emissions in the methodology document.
Improving data accuracy:
A data issue impacting Cloud Run emissions calculations for March 2025 has been resolved. Incorrect carbon footprint data were generated for some Cloud Run SKUs due to a bug in our data processing logic, resulting in inflated carbon emission figures for affected users.
To correct your historical data, please run a backfill for March 2025 in your carbon footprint export. Due to a half-month lag in our data release, you will need to backfill the data for April 15, 2025, which will then update the March 2025 data in your BigQuery table. Data for all other periods remains unaffected.
Updating service coverage:
Integration Connectors and Application Integration were removed from covered services of Carbon Footprint, due to potential mis-attribution of carbon to these services. We are actively investigating and working on the improvements. Once internal data mapping improves for a service, we plan to add it back.
Deprecating carbon offsets fields from schema:
The carbon_offsets_kgCO2e and carbon_footprint_total_kgCO2e.after_offsets fields have been deprecated in the Carbon Footprint schema due to Google's strategic shift from traditional carbon offsets to a direct focus on carbon removal technologies and projects. If you have already set up an export, these two fields have been set to NULL and will not be updated.
This change is in line with Google's evolving strategy for achieving its net-zero climate goals with more robust and impactful climate solutions such as carbon removal technologies. Read more about Google's progress to accelerate carbon removal solutions.
Cloud Database Migration Service
Database Migration Service now supports Private Service Connect interfaces for network connectivity in homogeneous Cloud SQL for MySQL, Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, and AlloyDB for PostgreSQL migrations. For more information, see the following pages:
Networking methods in homogeneous Cloud SQL for MySQL migrations
Networking methods in homogeneous Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL migrations
Networking methods in homogeneous AlloyDB for PostgreSQL migrations
Cloud Run
The Python buildpack supports Cloud Run source deployments for modern web frameworks such as FastAPI, Gradio, and Streamlit.
For Python version 3.13 and later, the Python buildpack sets the default entrypoint for Cloud Run source deployments based on the web server or framework configuration in your requirements.txt file. For more information, see Build a Python application.

Vertex AI Search: Custom ranking of search results (GA)
You can modify the ranking behavior of your search app using custom ranking. Custom ranking lets you provide a mathematical expression that relies on a set of model-computed signals (such as semantic relevance score and keyword similarity score) and document-based signals (such as a custom field like distance or document age). The resulting ranking of
the search results is more considered and likely matches a user's needs better than a purely embedding-based ranking.
For more information, see Customize search results ranking.

Server-sent events and EventFlows are Generally Available (GA)
Apigee supports continuous response streaming from server-sent event (SSE) endpoints to clients in real time. The Apigee SSE feature is useful for handling large language model (LLM) APIs that operate most effectively by streaming their responses back to the client. SSE streaming reduces latency, and clients can receive response data as soon as it is generated by an LLM. This feature supports the use of AI agents that operate in real time environments, such as customer service bots or workflow orchestrators. For more information, see Streaming server-sent events.
Streaming from SSE endpoints is available in Apigee and in Apigee hybrid v1.15.0 and newer.

VPC Service Controls
General availability support for the following integration:
Eventarc Advanced
July 31, 2025
Apigee API hub
New data source support for plugins
API hub now supports importing API metadata through new dedicated plugins for the following data sources:
Apigee Edge Public Cloud
Apigee Edge Private Cloud (OPDK)
For more information, see Plugins overview.
Push-based plugin ingestion
API hub now supports push-based plugin ingestion. This method allows for more real-time synchronization of API metadata. All new Apigee, Apigee hybrid, Apigee Edge Public Cloud, and Apigee Edge Private Cloud (OPDK) plugins are created with push-based ingestion by default.
For more information, see Plugin data ingestion methods.
Note: Rollouts of this feature will begin today, and may take five or more business days to be completed across all Google Cloud zones. You may not be able to create push-based plugins until the rollout is complete.
Create custom plugins [API only]
You can now use the Create Plugin API to create custom plugins in API hub. Custom plugins are created manually to connect API hub to a specific API data source.
For more information, see Create custom plugins.
Default Apigee plugin instance not auto-created during runtime attachment
Issue: When provisioning API hub as part of Apigee provisioning, the default Apigee X and hybrid plugin instance is not automatically created. This prevents API proxies from being auto-registered.
Workaround: You can manually attach an Apigee runtime instance and import the Apigee assets. See Attach a runtime project.
Delete plugin instance changes
API hub no longer retains any ingested metadata from a plugin after its deletion. Deleting a plugin instance also permanently deletes all the associated API data from API hub.
For more information, see Delete a plugin instance.
Provisioning changes and Apigee API proxy registration
API hub changed how it registers API proxies from Apigee and how it creates default plugin instances during provisioning.
API hub now automatically creates a default Apigee X and hybrid plugin instance and auto-registers API proxies only when you provision it as part of Apigee provisioning.
If you provision API hub directly from the API hub UI, API hub does not automatically create a default plugin instance, nor does it auto-register proxies.
For more information, see Project attachments and plugins.
New tutorial: Enrich API data in API hub
A new tutorial is available for enriching API data in Apigee API hub.
It shows you how to use API hub's custom curation features to automatically fetch OpenAPI specifications from a Cloud Storage bucket and associate them with their corresponding Apigee API proxies. The custom curation logic is defined using an integration in Application Integration.
For more information, see Enrich API data with custom curation in API hub.
Deprecation of pull-based ingestion for Apigee plugins
Pull-based ingestion is no longer supported for Apigee and Apigee hybrid plugins as of July 31, 2025. For existing projects that have pull-based Apigee X and hybrid plugins configured, these plugins will continue to function and will be automatically migrated to the push-based type starting August 2025.
Deprecation of Apigee proxy deployment attributes
As of July 31st, 2025, the Apigee X and Hybrid Environment and Apigee X and Hybrid Organization attributes will no longer be added to new Apigee proxy deployments. This change specifically applies when you import deployments into API hub by attaching a runtime project.
If your existing projects use these attributes in filtered search queries, we recommend updating them. To ensure your searches continue to work, use the Source project and Source environment fields as alternatives.

Actual performance varies based on the number of input and output tokens in the
request, but a typical 6-hour job can now process millions of rows. For more
information, see
Generative AI functions.
BigQuery ML now can automatically detect model quota increases in Vertex AI, and automatically adjusts the quota for any BigQuery ML functions that use those models. You no longer need to email the BigQuery ML team to increase model quota.
You can now use continuous queries to export BigQuery data to Spanner in real time. This feature is in Preview.

Cloud Load Balancing
Starting October 15, 2025, the global and classic external Application Load Balancers are improving HTTP header handling for headers with obs-fold values to comply with the RFC 9112 standard
Previously, these load balancers would forward HTTP headers with obs-fold values (those split across multiple lines, with subsequent lines starting with a space or a tab) without any changes. Starting October 15, 2025, each obs-fold will be replaced with one or more space characters (SP octets) before forwarding the message upstream. This ensures that the header is correctly interpreted as a single line, as required by the HTTP specification.
What you need to do
Review your current client applications and backend services before October 15, 2025 and ensure that they generate HTTP headers with obs-fold values in a single-line format when communicating with these load balancers.
Because the obs-fold header fields have been deprecated in RFC 9112, compliant clients and servers should already avoid using this format. However, there is a possibility that services that specifically rely on the old, non-compliant multi-line format of headers with obs-fold values might experience unexpected behavior. You should proactively check your backend service logs for any errors originating from your services due to the modified obs-fold headers.
For more information on the HTTP specification regarding headers with obs-fold values, review RFC 9112, Section 5.2: Obsolete Line Folding.

Apigee X
On July 28, 2025, we released an updated version of Apigee (1-15-0-apigee-7).
Note: This release has been rolled back to address am issue.
See entry for August 4, 2025 for the updated version number and payload.
Server-sent events and EventFlows are Generally Available (GA)
Apigee supports continuous response streaming from server-sent event (SSE) endpoints to clients in real time. The Apigee SSE feature is useful for handling large language model (LLM) APIs that operate most effectively by streaming their responses back to the client. SSE streaming reduces latency, and clients can receive response data as soon as it is generated by an LLM. This feature supports the use of AI agents that operate in real time environments, such as customer service bots or workflow orchestrators. For more information, see Streaming server-sent events.
Streaming from SSE endpoints is available in Apigee and in Apigee hybrid v1.15.0 and newer.

Google Cloud Architecture Center
(New guide) Well-Architected Framework: Financial services industry (FSI) perspective: Principles and recommendations that are specific to FSI, aligned to each pillar of the Architecture Framework.
Google Kubernetes Engine
In GKE version 1.33.2-gke.1335000 and later, the
GKE Gateway controller
supports
Gateway API v1.3 CRDs.
In GKE version 1.33.1-gke.1788000 and later, you can target specific reservation
sub-blocks in a reservation block by using the
reservationSubBlock field in compute classes.
In GKE version 1.32.2-gke.1359000 and later, you can now configure
collection scheduling
for single-host and multi-host TPU node pools by using
compute classes.
Collection scheduling lets you set a Service Level Objective (SLO) for your TPU
workloads.
Control plane datastore maintenance
Starting in May, 2025, Google is performing maintenance on the internal control
plane datastore for all GKE clusters to improve scalability and
reliability. We expect to complete these improvements across GKE
by October, 2025.
This maintenance is happening gradually across all GKE clusters,
and will occur in your clusters only during configured maintenance windows. The
maintenance process is expected to take approximately 15 minutes to complete
during your cluster's maintenance window.
Expected impact
During the internal control plane datastore maintenance, the
Kubernetes API server will be unavailable for 15 minutes, regardless of
whether you use a regional cluster or a zonal cluster. During this 15-minute
period, you won't be able to interact with the Kubernetes API server for your
cluster.
Consider the following potential disruptions to your normal workflows during the
maintenance window for your cluster:
Kubernetes API unavailability: you can't use the kubectl tool or any
other Kubernetes API client to issue commands to the control plane,
regardless of whether the cluster is regional or zonal. Attempts to deploy,
modify, or query resources by using the Kubernetes API will fail during this
period.
Halted deployments: automated deployment pipelines (CI/CD) that interact
with the Kubernetes API will fail to complete tasks such as deploying or
updating applications in the cluster.
Google Cloud console limitations: operations for the cluster in the
Google Cloud console that communicate with the Kubernetes API might fail
during the maintenance period.
Delayed control plane automation: features that are managed by the
control plane, such as the cluster autoscaler, Horizontal or Vertical
Pod Autoscaling adjustments, or some node auto-repair operations might be
paused until the API server is online.
The following resources have no expected impact during the maintenance period:
Running applications: any running applications and services on your
nodes should continue to function without interruptions.
Node pool operations: existing nodes should remain connected and
operational.
Network traffic: traffic in the data plane, such as traffic to and from
your running workloads, shouldn't be affected.
What you need to do
No action is required from you for the maintenance to occur. To plan for this
maintenance, we recommend that you do the following:
Review maintenance windows: review your cluster's
maintenance window and exclusions settings
and schedule maintenance windows during periods that minimize disruptions to
your normal workflows.
Plan for Kubernetes API unavailability: if you run critical operations
in your cluster that require access to the Kubernetes API, avoid scheduling
these operations during maintenance windows.
Important: This note is incorrect. For the correct note, see the entry for
August 5, 2025.
A fix is available for an issue in which the Compute Engine Persistent Disk CSI
driver failed with an invalid cpuString error on GKE nodes that used custom

Organization Policy
Organization policies in dry-run mode are reporting inconsistent results for the following managed constraints:
constraints/compute.managed.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes
constraints/iam.managed.allowedPolicyMembers
constraints/essentialcontacts.managed.allowedContactDomains
constraints/compute.managed.blockPreviewFeatures
If a resource inherited an organization policy in dry-run mode that uses any of these managed constraints, that dry-run policy was evaluated without using the parameters specified in the live policy. Normally, an organization policy in dry-run mode that's inherited on a resource is overridden by the live organization policy set directly on that same resource. Not evaluating the live organization policy parameters in the inherited organization policy in dry-run mode led to inconsistent results.
Our engineering team is working to resolve this issue.

This capability lets users set up log ingestion and then consume findings at an Azure management group level, rather than at the subscription level. For more information, see Configure Microsoft Azure log ingestion for management groups. This capability is available in Preview.
A new risk scoring algorithm is launched. As a result, you might see slight changes in attack exposure scores for resources and findings. The new algorithm better reflects attacker behavior and gives a fairer representation of the relative risk level of your organization. We will monitor the results of this change and might perform further adjustments, if necessary.

The Oracle JDBC driver has been updated to version 19.25. This driver is used for connections to Oracle and Oracle ADWC. NOTE: This item was updated on September 10, 2025.
For faster response time for queries in BigQuery, Looker will execute BigQuery queries by using jobCreationMode=JOB_CREATION_OPTIONAL. If BigQuery can return immediate results, it will run the query without creating a job, so the record in the Looker query history will have a BigQuery query ID instead of a BigQuery job ID. See the Understanding query performance metrics documentation page for more information about the BigQuery BI Engine metrics.
The Query Concurrency System Activity Explore is now available. This Explore can help you identify periods of high load and investigate performance bottlenecks that are related to database connection limits. Note: This feature launch was delayed and is now available in Looker 25.14. This item was updated on August 13, 2025.
An issue has been fixed where certain API calls would fail to time out and would instead run indefinitely. Note: This item was added August 18, 2025.
Looker 25.12 contains the following accessibility improvements:

An issue has been fixed where API users could view a list of users on a Looker instance, even if they didn't have the see_users permission. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where the response headers from some API calls were not set by Looker. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where exploring from a dashboard tile while editing a dashboard could result in a permissions error, even if the user had permission to view the Explore. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where the row limit in an Explore could display a blank field when the row limit was set to 5,000. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where some users were unable to create or edit BigQuery OAuth connections. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where SQL Runner would display a blank page if a user changed the visualization type after pivoting on a dimension. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where some queries to the internal database were unoptimized, affecting instance performance. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where a visualization template could fail to be displayed in the list of templates if the name contained certain unicode characters. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where invalid query killing statements could cause unnecessarily verbose log outputs. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where API users without the explore permission could access visualization templates. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where Looker could return a 500 error while retrieving dashboard details if the details contained non-UTF-8 characters. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where forecasting didn't work properly on fields that were based on JSON data. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where Looker didn't properly sanitize slash characters in git references that were used for remote dependencies. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where fields could be sorted differently when a visualization was downloaded or scheduled as a PNG. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where the all_connections API call could ignore the fields parameter. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where a map visualization would display drill links for fields that were hidden from the visualization. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where some System Activity tables were missing the element_id field. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where subtotals could be incorrectly formatted in PDF downloads when an HTML parameter was defined on the field and the "Expand tables to show all rows" option was enabled. This feature now performs as expected.
The Looker IDE now checks for subparameters in local and remote dependencies and displays a more informative error if the subparameters are missing. Local dependencies must be defined with a project subparameter, while remote dependencies require both a url subparameter and a ref subparameter.
An issue has been fixed where editing a merged query in an embedded session would open in a new tab. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where Looker could generate duplicate SQL table references if a PDT referenced a table directly as well as through a join. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where some PDT regeneration events were not tracked in System Activity. This feature now performs as expected.
When an Explore is saved as a new dashboard, Looker will create advanced filter type dashboard filters, rather than drop-down type dashboard filters, for number type parameters.
An issue has been fixed where SAML authentication could fail for a Looker (Google Cloud core) instance. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where the Looker Marketplace toggle was not being displayed in Looker core instances for users who were granted Admin permissions with an IAM role. This feature now performs as expected.
An issue has been fixed where installing multiple drivers for the same database type on a customer-hosted instance could cause Looker to display an error. This feature now performs as expected.

Performance improvement for BigQuery data sources
Report viewers may notice improved performance when the report uses a BigQuery data source.
The BigQuery connector supports short query optimized mode. In this mode, when BigQuery determines it can finish a query quickly, BigQuery prioritizes returning immediate results instead of creating a BigQuery job. Short query optimized mode may apply in the following situations:
When the data source uses Viewer's Credentials
When the data source uses Owner's Credentials but you are not the credential owner.
There is no change in user experience or report behavior for data source credential owners.
Highlight charts by filter
The Applied Filters panel now lets you click on a filter to highlight all charts that the filter applies to.

Cloud Composer
If your environment uses dag-factory package version 0.22, then you might
experience DAG failures in Cloud Composer versions that have
apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes package version 10.4.2 or later. At
the same time, upgrading the dag-factory package to version 0.23 might require
you to update your DAG code to make it compatible.
If your environment uses dag-factory version 0.22, we recommend to do the
following:
Temporarily postpone upgrading your environment until you're ready to switch
to dag-factory version 0.23. Last versions of Cloud Composer that support
version 0.22 are composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.3,
composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.23, composer-2.13.1-airflow-2.10.5, and
composer-2.13.1-airflow-2.9.3 released on May 14, 2025.
When you are ready to upgrade, update your DAGs for compatibility with 0.23.
We recommend to do this in a development environment first.
Install
dag-factory version 0.23, then check that your DAGs are parsed and are
working correctly, and update them if needed. After your DAGs are
compatible, install dag-factory version 0.23 in your production
environment and transfer the updated DAGs. Your environment can now be
upgraded to a later version of Cloud Composer or Airflow.
If your environment is already upgraded to a later version of Cloud Composer
and you experience problems, then update dag-factory to version 0.23 and
update your DAGs for compatibility with 0.23.

Apigee API hub
API hub provisioning now enables Apigee API
When you provision API hub, it now enables the Apigee API (apigee.googleapis.com) in your Google Cloud project. If Apigee isn't already provisioned, an Apigee organization is also automatically created in your project as part of the provisioning process.
API hub remains a free service. Enabling the Apigee API has no additional pricing or billing implications for your project.
For more information, see Provision API hub in the Cloud console.
API hub deprovisioning changes
Deprovisioning an API hub instance now also deletes any associated Apigee organizations from your Google Cloud project, provided those Apigee organizations have no Apigee instances.
If you deprovision an API hub instance, you can reprovision it later, but you'll need to wait 7 days before you can do so.
For more information, see Deprovision Apigee API hub.

c4d-highmem-384-metal
This is the first machine series to offer AMD-based bare metal instances. Bare metal instances let you create an instance with direct access to the machine's CPU and memory, without a virtualization layer in the middle. C4D uses Titanium to deliver more compute and memory resources for your workloads by offloading network and I/O processing from the host hardware. To learn more, see C4D machine series. For information about bare metal instances, including regional availability, see Bare metal instances on Compute Engine.
