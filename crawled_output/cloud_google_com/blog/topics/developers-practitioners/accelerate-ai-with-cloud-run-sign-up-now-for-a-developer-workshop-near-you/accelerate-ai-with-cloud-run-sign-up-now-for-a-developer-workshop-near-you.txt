With AI-assisted tools like Gemini CLI and Code Assist, an idea can become a tangible demo with astonishing speed.
But that first successful run is just the beginning. The real challenge comes next. How do you take that brilliant prototype and turn it into a secure, scalable, and maintainable production application that can serve thousands of users?
To answer that question, we're launching Accelerate AI with Cloud Run, a global, in-person developer workshop series. Forget the abstract concepts; this is a hands-on event where we'll dive deep into code, deployment, and the production-grade patterns that turn AI ideas into real-world solutions.
The Bridge from Prototype to Production
Across the globe, we're hosting these free, dynamic, full-day workshops to provide practical, code-level engagement with the tools you need to succeed. An easy entry point to AI is fantastic, but without a clear path forward, it's easy to get stuck. This workshop is the bridge.
We'll show you how to leverage Cloud Run's serverless power, GPU acceleration, and seamless integrations to build the next generation of intelligent agents. Whether you're an application developer building AI-powered features or a startup founder who needs to innovate quickly and efficiently, these workshops are your direct path to mastering production-ready AI.
What You'll Build: A Hands-On Journey
This is not a lecture. Bring your laptop, because you’ll be building a multi-component AI application from the ground up. We will guide you through the complete prototype-to-production journey, mastering the core pillars of modern AI application development:
Build a Secure Foundation: Go beyond a simple script. You’ll deploy a secure, tool-enabled server using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) on Cloud Run, creating a protected API for your agent’s capabilities.
Create an Intelligent Agent: It’s time to build the "brain." You’ll use the Agent Development Kit (ADK) to create an intelligent agent that understands a goal and can use the secure tools you just deployed to accomplish complex tasks.
Deploy for Production Scale: Take your working agent and make it production-grade. You will containerize it with Docker, deploy it to a Cloud Run instance with GPU acceleration to power advanced models, and learn to manage configurations for a real-world serverless environment.
Why This Workshop Is a Must-Attend
You can access and grow your AI opportunities through:
Deep Technical Content: Go beyond surface-level knowledge with in-depth labs created by Google's Cloud Run and AI engineering experts.
Practical Hands-On Experience: Gain real-world skills by building a complete, production-oriented AI application from start to finish.
Expert Guidance: Get your questions answered directly by the Google Cloud team in a small-group, in-person setting.
Cutting-Edge Architecture: Learn the official patterns for building the next generation of AI agents that are secure, scalable, and ready for whatever you can imagine.
