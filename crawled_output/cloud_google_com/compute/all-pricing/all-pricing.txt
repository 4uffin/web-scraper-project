Google Cloud | Google CloudPage ContentsCompute Engine pricingThis page lists all the pricing for Compute Engine.Note: This page is a list of Compute Engine pricing in a single place for convenience. It is intended for reference purposes and does not provide detailed pricing explanations. For explanations on how pricing works, see the following pages:VM instance pricingSpot VM instance pricingNetworking pricingSole-tenant node pricingGPU pricingDisk and image pricingConfidential VM pricingVM Manager pricingTPU pricingCompute Engine charges for usage based on the following price sheet. A bill is sent out at the end of each billing cycle, providing a sum of Google Cloud charges. Prices on this page are listed in U.S. dollars (USD).For Compute Engine, disk size, machine type memory, and network usage are calculated in JEDEC binary gigabytes (GB) also known as gibibytes (GiB), where 1 GiB is 230 bytes. Similarly, 1 TiB is 240 bytes, or 1024 JEDEC GBs.If you pay in a currency other than USD, the prices listed in your currency on Cloud Platform SKUs apply.You can also find pricing information with the following options:See the estimated costs of your instances and Compute Engine resources when you create them in the Google Cloud console.Estimate your total project costs with the Google Cloud Pricing Calculator.View and download prices from the Pricing Table in the Google Cloud console.View more information about costs and usage in Cloud Billing reports.Use the Cloud Billing Catalog API for programmatic access to SKU information.General-purpose machine type familyC4 machine typesIowa (us-central1)Johannesburg (africa-south1)Taiwan (asia-east1)Hong Kong (asia-east2)Tokyo (asia-northeast1)Osaka (asia-northeast2)Seoul (asia-northeast3)Mumbai (asia-south1)Delhi (asia-south2)Singapore (asia-southeast1)Jakarta (asia-southeast2)Sydney (australia-southeast1)Melbourne (australia-southeast2)Warsaw (europe-central2)Finland (europe-north1)Stockholm (europe-north2)Madrid (europe-southwest1)Belgium (europe-west1)Turin (europe-west12)London (europe-west2)Frankfurt (europe-west3)Netherlands (europe-west4)Zurich (europe-west6)Milan (europe-west8)Paris (europe-west9)Doha (me-central1)Dammam (me-central2)Tel Aviv (me-west1)Montreal (northamerica-northeast1)Toronto (northamerica-northeast2)Mexico (northamerica-south1)Sao Paulo (southamerica-east1)Santiago (southamerica-west1)Iowa (us-central1)South Carolina (us-east1)Northern Virginia (us-east4)Columbus (us-east5)Dallas (us-south1)Oregon (us-west1)Los Angeles (us-west2)Salt Lake City (us-west3)Las Vegas (us-west4)Show discount optionsHourlyHourlyMonthlyMonthlyItemDefault* (USD)infoConsumption model ID:7754-699E-0EBFCompute Flexible CUD - 1 Year* (USD)infoConsumption model ID:D97B-0795-975BCompute Flexible CUD - 3 Year* (USD)infoConsumption model ID:70D7-D1AB-12A4Compute Resource CUDs - 1 Year (USD)Compute Resource CUDs - 3 Year (USD)Predefined vCPUs$0.03465 / 1 hour$0.024948 / 1 hour$0.018711 / 1 hour$0.02183 / 1 hour$0.015593 / 1 hourPredefined Memory$0.003938 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.00283536 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.00212652 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.002481 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.001772 / 1 gibibyte hourC4 Local SSD Storage$0.000219178 / 1 gibibyte hour--$0.000138082 / 1 gibibyte hour$0.00009863 / 1 gibibyte hour* Each consumption model has a unique ID.

charges for machine types and premium images still apply to instances that you stop or Spot VMs (or preemptible VMs) during a simulated maintenance event. See the machine type billing model and premium image pricing for details.Prior to this date, the following charges apply:Simulated maintenance on instances configured for live migration incur costs for each of the following instance resources:Price per vCPU on the instance, where f1-micro and g1-small are each equivalent to 1 vCPU: $0.040Price per GB of memory: $0.010Price per GB of Local SSD space: $0.001Simulated maintenance on Spot VMs (and preemptible VMs): FreeSimulated maintenance on instances configured to stop and restart: FreeSuspended VM instancesWhen you suspend an instance, Compute Engine preserves the memory and device state. While you are not charged for the VM instance as if it were running, suspended instances still incur charges for the following:Suspended instance memory and device state.Suspended Local SSD data & metadata.Any Persistent Disk usage.Any static IPs attached to the VM instance.Note: Suspended Instance and Local SSD state are stored in Persistent Disk volumes and as such are subject to Persistent Disk pricing. All preserved state charges in this section are prorated based on a granularity of seconds. For example, if you suspended 1 GB of space for half the month, then you are charged for only half of the month.Iowa (us-central1)Johannesburg (africa-south1)Taiwan (asia-east1)Hong Kong (asia-east2)Tokyo (asia-northeast1)Osaka (asia-northeast2)Seoul (asia-northeast3)Mumbai (asia-south1)Singapore (asia-southeast1)Jakarta (asia-southeast2)Bangkok (asia-southeast3)Sydney (australia-southeast1)Finland (europe-north1)Stockholm (europe-north2)Belgium (europe-west1)Berlin (europe-west10)Turin (europe-west12)London (europe-west2)Frankfurt (europe-west3)Netherlands (europe-west4)Zurich (europe-west6)Doha (me-central1)Dammam (me-central2)Montreal (northamerica-northeast1)Sao Paulo (southamerica-east1)Iowa (us-central1)South Carolina (us-east1)Northern Virginia (us-east4)Oregon (us-west1)Los Angeles (us-west2)Salt Lake City (us-west3)Las Vegas (us-west4)Phoenix (us-west8)HourlyHourlyMonthlyMonthlyTypeDefault* (USD)Instance memory and device state$0.000232877 / 1 gibibyte hour* The Default consumption model for Compute Engine is "On Demand"Sole-tenant node pricingIowa (us-central1)Johannesburg (africa-south1)Taiwan (asia-east1)Hong Kong (asia-east2)Tokyo (asia-northeast1)Osaka (asia-northeast2)Seoul (asia-northeast3)Mumbai (asia-south1)Delhi (asia-south2)Singapore (asia-southeast1)Jakarta (asia-southeast2)Bangkok (asia-southeast3)Sydney (australia-southeast1)Melbourne (australia-southeast2)Warsaw (europe-central2)Finland (europe-north1)Stockholm (europe-north2)Madrid (europe-southwest1)Belgium (europe-west1)Berlin (europe-west10)Turin (europe-west12)London (europe-west2)Frankfurt (europe-west3)Netherlands (europe-west4)Zurich (europe-west6)Milan (europe-west8)Paris (europe-west9)Doha (me-central1)Dammam (me-central2)Tel Aviv (me-west1)Montreal (northamerica-northeast1)Toronto (northamerica-northeast2)Mexico (northamerica-south1)Sao Paulo (southamerica-east1)Santiago (southamerica-west1)Iowa (us-central1)South Carolina (us-east1)Northern Virginia (us-east4)Columbus (us-east5)Dallas (us-south1)Oregon (us-west1)Los Angeles (us-west2)Salt Lake City (us-west3)Las Vegas (us-west4)Phoenix (us-west8)Show discount optionsHourlyHourlyMonthlyMonthlyMachine typeDefault* (USD)infoConsumption model ID:7754-699E-0EBFCompute Flexible CUD - 1 Year* (USD)infoConsumption model ID:D97B-0795-975BCompute Flexible CUD - 3 Year* (USD)infoConsumption model ID:70D7-D1AB-12A4c2-node-60-240$3.445332 / 1 hour$2.48063904 / 1 hour$1.86047928 / 1 hourc3-node-176-352$8.2330336 / 1 hour$5.927784192 / 1 hour$4.445838144 / 1 hourc3-node-176-704$9.7578272 / 1 hour$7.025635584 / 1 hour$5.269226688 / 1 hourc3-node-176-1408$12.8074144 / 1 hour$9.221338368 / 1 hour$6.916003776 / 1 hourc4-node-192-384$8.9814912 / 1 hour$6.466673664 / 1 hour$4.850005248 / 1 hourc4-node-192-720$10.436976 / 1 hour$7.51462272 / 1 hour$5.63596704 / 1 hourc4-node-192-1488$13.7637984 / 1 hour$9.909934848 / 1 hour$7.432451136 / 1 hourc4a-node-72-144$3.000096 / 1 hour$2.16006912 / 1 hour$1.62005184 / 1 hourc4a-node-72-288$3.55608 / 1 hour$2.5603776 / 1 hour$1.9202832 / 1 hourc4a-node-72-576$4.668048 / 1 hour$3.36099456 / 1 hour$2.52074592 / 1 hourc4d-node-384-720$16.786610252 / 1 hour$12.086359245 / 1 hour$9.064769434 / 1 hourc4d-node-384-1488$19.957438894 / 1 hour$14.369355722 / 1 hour$10.777016792 / 1 hourc4d-node-384-3024$26.299096177 / 1 hour$18.935348676 / 1 hour$14.201511507 / 1 hourg2-node-96-384$8.355631671 / 1 hour--g2-node-96-432$8.510200978 / 1 hour--m1-node-96-1433$11.71401 / 1 hour$11.71401 / 1 hour$4.3341837 / 1 hourm1-node-160-3844$27.68964 / 1 hour$27.68964 / 1 hour$10.2451668 / 1 hourm2-node-416-11776---m2-node-416-8832---m3-node-128-1952$15.85056 / 1 hour$15.85056 / 1 hour$5.8647072 / 1 hourm3-node-128-3904$26.80128 / 1 hour$26.80128 / 1 hour$9.9164736 / 1 hourn1-node-96-624$6.2463984 / 1 hour$4.497406848 / 1 hour$3.373055136 / 1 hourn2-node-80-640$5.764616 / 1 hour$4.15052352 / 1 hour$3.11289264 / 1 hourn2-node-128-864$8.4776736 / 1 hour$6.103924992 / 1 hour$4.577943744 / 1 hourn2d-node-224-896$10.4094144 / 1 hour$7.494778368 / 1 hour$5.621083776 / 1 hourn2d-node-224-1792$14.042336 / 1 hour$10.11048192 / 1 hour$7.58286144 / 1 hour* Each consumption model has a unique ID.

Because you commit to a minimum level of resource usage when you purchase your license commitment, you have to pay the agreed-upon prices for the duration of that commitment, even if your resource usage is lower than that minimum level. As a result, to maximize the benefit of your CUDs, ensure that you use all of your committed licenses and run VMs with those licenses for 100% time of your commitment's term. To learn more about CUDs for licenses and how to purchase a commitment, see Purchase commitments for licenses.Ubuntu pro imagesThe following sections outline the license cost for using Ubuntu Pro images on Compute EngineMemoryLicense cost for memory is charged at one flat rate of $0.000127 per GB/hour in USD.vCPULicense cost for vCPU varies by the number of vCPUs that the Ubuntu Pro VM has.
