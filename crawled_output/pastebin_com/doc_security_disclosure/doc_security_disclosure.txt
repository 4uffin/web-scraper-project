Communications
All private data exchanged with Pastebin is always transmitted over SSL (which is why your
pastebin is served over HTTPS, for instance).
Backups
Every line of code we store is saved on a minimum of three different servers, including an
off-site backup.
Employee access
No Pastebin employees ever access private pastes unless required to for support reasons.
Maintaining security
We protect your login from brute force attacks with rate limiting. All passwords are
filtered from all our logs and are one-way encrypted in the database using bcrypt. Login information is always
sent over SSL.
Credit card safety
When you sign up for a paid account on Pastebin, we do not store any of your card
information on our servers. It's handed off to Braintree Payment Solutions,
a company dedicated to storing your sensitive data on PCI-Compliant
servers.
