Nancy Mace (R-S.C.).Although the focus of the hearing was supposed to be about crime and safety in the nation’s Capitol, Mace used her five minutes to try and spark a culture war by pushing a bill entitled “No DEI in D.C. Act,” which seemed to suggest that diversity, equity and inclusion were to blame for the city’s crime.Advertisement
Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) unleashing her wrath on stage during the third day of the Republican National Convention in 2024.Chip Somodevilla via Getty ImagesMace then launched into a series of laughably unhinged questions — which included Mace asking Bowser to answer “yes or no” to the incredibly nuanced topic of whether or not “D.C. government is racist.”After failing to get sound bites from an increasingly flabbergasted Bowser, Mace decided to push her anti-trans agenda by taking issue with the inclusive term “birthing people” — rather than “women” — being used in a section of the D.C. code.Advertisement
“One thing we noticed the D.C. code struggles to define is the term ‘woman,’” Mace began. “So, Mayor Bowser, what is a woman?”“I’m a woman. Are you a woman?” Bowser shot back, causing several people in the hearing to burst out laughing.“100%” Mace replied.“OK,” Bowser said flatly. “I’m a woman. You’re looking at one.”“Ok, good,” Mace said seemingly flustered.Advertisement
Many X users — much like Bowser — had a hard time wrapping their heads around whatever bigoted point Mace was trying to make. What does this have to do with anything? It's such an ignorant ghoul question.— The Great Gig in the Sky (@thegreatgig8) September 18, 2025Nancy mace really does surround her self with absolute m*rons if she thought this was a zinger— Lib Dunk (@libdunkmedia) September 18, 2025Advertisement
This is what we are paying her for? The only thing Mace is serious about is getting clicks.— ForDemocracy (@cow_belle65) September 18, 2025I’m sure this will bring down the prices of groceries, and unite our very divided country.— R.

This by no means is the first time the South Carolina lawmaker has made her anti-trans stance obnoxiously crystal clear. Last year, she tried to ban the first openly trans congressperson from using the women’s bathrooms at the Capitol. Mace’s proposed bathroom ban, however, was notably excluded from the House rules package in January.
