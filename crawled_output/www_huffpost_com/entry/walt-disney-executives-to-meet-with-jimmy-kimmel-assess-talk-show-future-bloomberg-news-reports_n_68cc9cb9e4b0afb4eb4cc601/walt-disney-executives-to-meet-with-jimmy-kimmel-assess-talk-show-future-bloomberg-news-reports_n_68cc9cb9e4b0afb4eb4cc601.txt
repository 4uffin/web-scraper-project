The late-night host prepared to make a statement, but Kimmel and Disney representatives could not find language that they agreed would not further inflame the situation, the source said.Advertisement
As the show’s 4:30 p.m. taping time approached, Disney CEO Bob Iger and Disney Entertainment co-Chairman Dana Walden agreed that the best approach would be to take the show off the air and later find a way to bring Kimmel back, the source said. Walden informed Kimmel of the decision.A representative for Kimmel did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment.Executives will meet with Kimmel to discuss the future of his program, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing three people with knowledge of the matter.Jimmy Kimmel participates in the "Jimmy Kimmel Live and 90th Oscars" panel during the Disney/ABC Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour on Monday, Jan. 8, 2018, in Pasadena, Calif.

Disney-owned ABC said it pulled Kimmel’s show off the air over comments by the late-night show host about the assassination of Kirk, a 31-year-old conservative activist and co-founder of the nonprofit Turning Point USAand a close political ally of President Donald Trump. Many in Hollywood decried the decision, saying the company was bowing to political pressure and that it was an assault on free speech.Kimmel, who has frequently targeted Trump on his comedy show, said in his monologue on Monday: “We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”As Disney wrestled with the gathering social media controversy, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, in a podcast appearance on Wednesday, said that Kimmel had misled viewers about the alleged shooter’s MAGA affiliation. Carr also raised the possibility that the FCC could revoke the broadcast licenses of local television stations that carry such “garbage.”Advertisement
“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said in an interview with conservative podcaster Benny Johnson. “These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel.”The nation’s largest local television station group, Nexstar Media NXST.O, and Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns many of ABC’s local TV affiliates, said they would stop airing the show following Kimmel’s monologue. Sinclair said Kimmel’s show would be suspended until he apologizes to the Kirk family. Nexstar and Sinclair both have merger deals pending before the FCC.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
