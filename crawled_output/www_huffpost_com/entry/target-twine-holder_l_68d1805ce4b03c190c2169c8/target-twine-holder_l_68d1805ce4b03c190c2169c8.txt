That’s why this mixed metal twine holder that looks sophisticated enough to pass down to your loved ones like an heirloom feels like a really important purchase — especially at an accessible $30 from Target. And reviewers tend to agree. With a 4.7-star rating (the majority of its18 reviewers glowing) along with claims from pleased reviewers that it’s a “stylish yet useful display piece,” it’s a tried-and-true addition to any space.$24 at Target (regularly $30)Advertisement
If twine isn’t part of your current kitchen routine, let this inventive piece be your inspiration to join the club. When cooking proteins like poultry — arguably the foundation of any satiating meal — trussing it in twine allows its legs to remain intact for even heat distribution, fall-off-the-bone tender results and even shape retention for an easier time cooking and serving your dish (especially if you’ve stuffed it with something fun like buttery herb Thanksgiving stuffing or spinach ricotta — in which case, invite me over). And when the included twine is made of cotton like this one, you can feel confident that it’s food-safe without imparting any nasty flavors into your dish. TargetThe last thing that overflowing junk drawer needs is yet another spool of thread.$24 at Target (regularly $30)Advertisement
Twine isn’t reserved for slow-roasting meats. Fasten rolled dishes like savory or sweet roulades, neatly confine bundles of herbs (or as we say in the kitchen, bouquet garni) in your cooking dish or MacGyver hanging loops to easily store utensils off hooks. Wrap gifts. Hold sandwiches together in your lunch bag. Hang fresh flowers and herbs to dry. Tie up yard trimmings. Your options for using twine span as far as your creativity. With this smart Target buy, twine, being notoriously tricky to store for the way it tends to unravel and entangle with other gadgets in your drawers if not properly confined (been there), has finally received the glow-up it’s always deserved. Positioned upright on a stabilizing felt wooden base and secured with a brass top notch, it not only serves as a statement piece for your countertops, but it dispenses smoothly and knot-free like floss. Plus, the last thing that overflowing junk drawer needs is yet another spool of thread.$24 at Target (regularly $30)Advertisement
Its mixed material composition incorporates seamlessly into whatever else is going on in your kitchen, whether your home features charming original details from centuries past or industrial metals with sleek finishes. Not sure what to grab for those new homeowners or the newly betrothed? You can bet this gift will surprise and impress, no matter their tastes, both culinary and style.At seven inches high and four inches wide and deep, it’s a low-stakes addition to countertops that you’ll be reaching for more often than you might realize — which begs the question: Why wine and dine when you can twine and dine? For more proof the Hearth & Hand with Magnolia wood and brass finish twine holder is worth the $30 spend, read more 5-star reviews from happy users. (You can also keep scrolling to see several more kitchen items that reviewers say actually make cooking fun.)Advertisement
Promising reviews: “This is a fun little useful decor piece! I love the finishes on it, it’s not cheap looking and spins so smoothly as you pull on the twine. Adds a nice touch to a craft area (or wherever you want to put it) without taking up too much space. I’m interested to see how it will be to refill it eventually but so far so good!” — Drenebean“I had been looking for an attractive yet functional way to store my twine. I did not want to put it in a drawer because I use it too frequently and I wanted it to be within arms reach. This twine holder has presented itself as a perfect solution! In addition to being functional, it is super adorbs in both an industrial factory type of way and in a country chic or boho way. Very versatile. An additional bonus is that it is portable!! I can bring my twine with me everywhere!” — Star“Stunning piece! Not only decorative but so functional! I also had no idea that the top piece has a built in cutter inside! What an amazing way to be able to cut it without scissors. I have already used it many times. Today, I tied some flowers together that I hung to dry. This item is certainly well made and is a special piece for any home, a must-have! Magnolia does it again! Highly recommend!” — PassionateJoyfulSoulAdvertisement

Each nonstick cooking layer is removable and dishwasher-safe for easy cleanup and allows you to prepare an egg directly in a designated egg pan.Promising Amazon review: "I bought this as a gift when I saw it advertised on Facebook and thought my 86 yr old mom would enjoy it. It may have been one of the best Mother's Day gifts I ever got her. Take the pre cooked sausage out of the freezer the night before and in the morning you're all set to go and eating a hot delicious sandwich five min. later. It was actually fun to use, and I think the more it is used the easier it will be to prepare. Thank you Hamilton Beach." — Kim$38 at Amazon$38 at Target5AmazonA nonstick mashing toolIf breaking up ground beef in your pan for taco night is wearing your wrist out, let this clever meat-mashing tool do the work for you.

The five non-serrated blades are also great for breaking up softer cooked vegetables, making mashed potatoes or shredding chicken breast and won't damage the bottoms of your pots or pans.Promising Amazon review: "Since I cook a lot with ground beef I got myself this utensil. I used to break down the meat with the same wooden spatula or spoon I used for stirring but it was a task I kind of dreaded. This tool makes it faster and more fun. It is sturdy, resists high sauté temperature and I can just throw it into the dishwasher right after using it. Is it necessary? No, but it makes my life better." — delasoupus$10+ at Amazon6AmazonAn herb-stripper and chopperThis helpful tool takes the onerous task of plucking herb leaves from their stems into quick work by simply feeding your fresh herb through one of the nine various-sized holes.

The Gracula is a grinder-style crusher that can mince not just garlic, but ingredients like ginger and chilis with just a few twists. Its BPA-free, food-safe construction also means it's dishwasher safe for easy cleanup. Promising Amazon review: "Could you spend half the amount for a plain garlic crusher that does the exact same thing? Sure. Would it be as fun as having a lil' Dracula sitting on your counter? Absolutely not." — Nancy$17 at Amazon8Uncommon GoodsAn automatic stirrerNever break a butter sauce again or let a creamy purée go lumpy thanks to this automatic stirrer that continually mixes contents for you.

The kitchen is so much more fun when you're not stuck stirring. I'm going to buy one for every chef on my list." — Allison$30+ at Uncommon Goods9AmazonA 4-in-1 chopping toolI think most people would agree that the least enjoyable aspect of cooking is the slicing, dicing and chopping of all the essential ingredients.

Promising Amazon review: " I can’t believe how great this thing is. Easy to use. Easy to clean. I’ve used it about five times so I hope it lasts but so far 11/10. Now I’m eating more veggies because it’s so satisfying to chop." — Kellie Rowe$30 at AmazonAdvertisement
10AmazonA corn cob peelerThere's few kitchen tasks more daunting (and potentially dangerous) than trying to cut away corn kernels from the cob. This compact, Y-shaped peeler is made with Japanese stainless steel blades and an ergonomic handle to safely and swiftly peel away kernels so you can have fresh corn whenever you want. Promising Amazon review: "Okay, I've been using a knife for many years to cut corn off the cob and it works just fine. But this gadget is so efficient that I was stunned by the difference. For my first few passes on a tough ear of corn I didn't even notice that the blade was covered by a piece of plastic meant to be removed. Still cut so smoothly, without corn flying all over the counter. Works even better without it! I could live without this gadget, but I will definitely make lots more corn recipes this summer now that I have it. It is a joy to have the exact right tool for the job." — M.
