And it‚Äôs petrifying.‚Äî Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) September 12, 2025McCain‚Äôs theory might sound legit in the confines of a conservative news bubble, but many people on social media felt obliged to point out some things she may have forgotten.For instance, progressive activist and Parkland school shooting survivor David Hogg reminded McCain that, among other things, Utah Senator Mike Lee made now-deleted jokes on social media after Minnesota Democratic state Rep.

John McCain of the patriots who tried to publicly hang Mike Pence on Jan. 6.What the fuck are you talking about @MeghanMcCain? As a national gun safety activist, I have been subjected to threats to my life and safety, by the right. Over the past 2 days, the right has been calling for war and violence against the left.
