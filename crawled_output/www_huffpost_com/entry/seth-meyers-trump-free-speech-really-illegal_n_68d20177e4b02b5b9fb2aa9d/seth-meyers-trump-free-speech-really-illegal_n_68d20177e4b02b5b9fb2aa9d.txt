“No, that is free speech. That’s like the whole point of free speech, that it’s protected even when you don’t like it,” said the “Late Night” host.Meyers proceeded to reflect on hosting the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, an event where he notably mocked Trump.“One reviewer said of my performance, ‘He had marbles in his mouth,’ and that reviewer turned out to be Donald Trump,” Meyers recalled.Advertisement
He argued that shows like his have made “plenty” of jokes about Joe Biden, pointing to times that his show aired clips of the former president falling up the stairs of Air Force One, standing still at a Juneteenth celebration at the White House or with his mouth open during his disastrous debate against Trump.“I mean, I wish he had marbles in his mouth! That was just a void, he looked like one of those carnival games where you shoot water into the clown’s mouth,” he joked.He added that making jokes about Biden was “harder” because he didn’t “talk all the time” like Trump.Advertisement
“People say Johnny Carson didn’t make this many jokes about politics but he would have if every time he spoke, Ronald Reagan did 15 minutes on how toilets don’t flush well anymore,” he quipped.Check out more of Meyers’ Monday monologue below.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
