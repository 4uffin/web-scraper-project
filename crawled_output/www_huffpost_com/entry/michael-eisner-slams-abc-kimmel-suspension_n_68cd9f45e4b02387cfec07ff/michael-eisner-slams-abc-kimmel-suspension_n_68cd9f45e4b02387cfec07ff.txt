But corporate leaders feared that his monologue would create more problems, prompting the decision by Iger and Dana Walden, the co-chair of Disney Entertainment, to preempt the show, the Journal said.Advertisement
Kimmel was reportedly scheduled to meet with ABC leaders on Thursday to discuss the future of his program, according to Bloomberg. It’s unclear how those reported discussions went.Eisner stepped down as Disney CEO in 2005 after working for the company for over 20 years.RelatedJimmy KimmeldisneyMichael EisnerLate Night Hosts Support Jimmy KimmelRadio Host Criticizes Jimmy Kimmel Over Charlie Kirk CommentsLetterman Mocks Trump And FCC Over Kimmel Ax And Gives Them A History LessonStephen Colbert Lays Into 'Autocrat' Trump Amid Fallout Over Kimmel’s Charlie Kirk Remarks Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
