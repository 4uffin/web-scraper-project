Log in to hide these messages.'South Park' Returns And Doesn't Hold Back With Ruthless Troll Of Trump, Brendan CarrThe long-running animated show hit back at the FCC chair after late night host Jimmy Kimmel's suspension.By Ed MazzaDeputy Editor, Trends, HuffPostSep 24, 2025, 11:47 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADING“South Park” returned to television on Wednesday after calling off last week’s episode hours before airtime, and didn’t waste time tackling current events. Warning: Spoilers ahead. The new episode is in part a response to last week’s suspension of late night host Jimmy Kimmel, who was pulled off the air after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr threatened ABC over his show.

Kimmel, who returned to TV on Tuesday, is never mentioned. But Carr suffers a series of painful disasters that end with him potentially losing his freedom of speech. The main theme of the episode is prediction markets. The kids in South Park are betting on Kyle’s mom, while much of the country is betting on whether Satan’s pregnancy with President Donald Trump ― introduced in the previous episode as a “demonic butt baby” ― will be a boy or girl.

Trump doesn’t want the baby and spends the episode setting traps for Satan that would kill the fetus.But it’s Carr who walks into each trap instead. When Trump puts grease on the stairs with the hope of making Satan trip, Carr falls instead, suffering serious injuries. When Trump makes Satan a soup and fills it with Plan B emergency contraception medication, Carr eats it and suffers diarrhea so explosive that he takes flight. And when Trump creates a trap using cat feces to cause a toxoplasmosis infection, Carr is buried by the litter. In the final scene, Carr was depicted immobilized in a hospital bed with a neck brace, feces pooling beneath him, and a cast keeping his right arm frozen in what looked a whole lot like a Nazi salute.

“His bones are healing, so he may regain full range of motion,” a doctor evaluating Carr states. “But if the toxoplasmosis parasite gets to his brain, I’m afraid he may lose his freedom of speech.” A tiny Vice President JD Vance ― the show has depicted him as Tattoo on “Fantasy Island” ― enters the room and admits he’s been trying to sabotage the pregnancy as he’s worried the baby will become next in line for president instead of him. And he warns Carr to stop meddling.“That baby cannot be born. And if you continue to interfere, I will make things very difficult for you,” Vance says, then echoes Carr’s own ominous words from when he threatened ABC over Kimmel: “We can do this the easy way, or we can do it the hard way.” Advertisement
“South Park” is off until Oct. 15, then returns to air biweekly until Dec. 10. The show airs on Comedy Central and streams on Paramount+ the following day. The Chairman of the FCC might lose his freedom of speech. pic.twitter.com/9aGiHHaWmp— South Park (@SouthPark) September 25, 2025RelatedDonald TrumpJimmy Kimmelj.d. vanceSouth ParkBrendan CarrTrump Loses It Over Jimmy Kimmel's Return In Unhinged New Rant, Then Threatens ABCThese Big Corporations Need Trump Cronies To OK Deals Amid Shock Kimmel DebacleJimmy Kimmel Came Back — But The Attack On Free Speech Isn’t Over Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
