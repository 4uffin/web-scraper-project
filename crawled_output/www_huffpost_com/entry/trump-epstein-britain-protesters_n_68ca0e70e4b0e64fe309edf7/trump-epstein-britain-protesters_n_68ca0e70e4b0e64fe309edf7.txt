Trump arrived in Britain late on Tuesday for an unprecedented second state visit, and will be greeted by Charles on Wednesday for a day of pomp at Windsor Castle, about 25 miles west of London.Earlier on Tuesday, protesters unfurled a massive banner featuring a photograph of Trump and Epstein near Windsor Castle, and later projected several images of the two onto one of the castle’s towers.Activist from the protest group Everyone Hates Elon put up a poster of President Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, ahead of the state visit by U.S. President Donald Trump, in Windsor, England, Monday, Sept. 15, 2025.AP Photo/Kin CheungAdvertisement
The police said in a statement four adults were arrested on suspicion of malicious communications following an “unauthorised projection” at Windsor Castle, which they described as a “public stunt”. The four remain in custody.Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Sept. 8 made public a birthday letter Trump allegedly wrote to Epstein more than 20 years ago, though the White House has denied its authenticity.The letter was also projected onto the castle, along with pictures of Epstein’s victims, news clips about the case and police reports.Advertisement
The release of the letter has brought renewed attention to an issue that has become a political thorn in the president’s side.Though he has urged his supporters to move on from the topic, appetite for details about Epstein’s crimes and who else may have known about them or been involved with him has remained high.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The birthday letter contained text of a purported dialogue between Trump and Epstein in which Trump calls him a “pal” and says, “May every day be another wonderful secret.” The text sits within a crude sketch of the silhouette of a naked woman.(Reporting by Ben Makori, Gerhard Mey and Phil Noble in Windsor; Writing by Catarina Demony; Editing by Neil Fullick) Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
