There was a wave of mass shootings, the Charlie Kirk assassination and the contentious discourse that followed, wars, inflation, tariffs, anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ legislation—the list goes on and on.Some people say the United States is in a period of “national trauma,” a psychological phenomenon in which negative events severely impact an entire group (in this case, Americans).

What we are experiencing is unprecedented. “The combination of 24/7 news cycles, social media algorithms designed specifically to keep us engaged, and genuinely challenging global events creates a perfect storm for widespread secondary trauma,” Saba Lurie, a therapist and owner of Take Root Therapy in Los Angeles, told HuffPost.Here’s how all this trauma affects us ― and what to do when everything feels like a bit too much.Your body doesn’t know the difference between trauma on a screen versus in real life.When you see a threat, your body’s stress response — aka the fight or flight system — turns on. Your adrenal glands release stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, your heart rate quickens, your blood pressure rises, and blood flow is directed to your muscles to help you either fight the threat or flee, according to Lurie.At the same time, the amygdala — nicknamed the brain’s alarm system — becomes hyperactive and starts scanning your environment for more danger. “All of this is happening because our nervous system is trying to protect us from what it perceives as a real and immediate threat,” said Lurie.Advertisement
Your body will mount this physiological response regardless of whether you witness the threat in real life or through a screen. As Lurie said, “our brains don’t really distinguish between something happening to us directly versus something we’re watching happen to someone else.” To our brains, a threat is a threat.Humans are also social, empathetic creatures. “The same mechanisms that help us connect ... make us feel as though we are experiencing what we are watching,” Lurie explained.It doesn’t help that the news disproportionately focuses on negative events, as a study from 2024 described. The media uses compelling imagery, urgent language and nonstop updates to keep us engaged and scrolling, Lurie said.Advertisement
The key issue when consuming media covering traumatic events is that we can’t actually do anything to resolve the threat, she adds. So, we keep watching and thinking about it. “We’re just left activated with nowhere for that energy to go. And our body is convinced that we are in danger, even when we are safe and sitting in a comfortable environment,” Lurie said.Fiordaliso via Getty ImagesAre you feeling the effects of "national trauma"? If you're doomscrolling, the answer is likely "yes."This kind of trauma can show up in your body.Witnessing a trauma — and especially repeated traumas — can tax both your physical and mental health. People commonly feel fatigued and worn down even if they haven’t done anything physically demanding, according to Lurie. Some people develop headaches, muscle tension and digestive problems.

If your stress response remains activated, your creativity, patience and ability to focus plummet, said Jenny Shields, a clinical health psychologist at Shields Psychology & Consulting. Mood shifts may become more common, along with irritability and sudden tears, she added.Over time, media overload can lead to anxiety, depression, hopelessness, and post-traumatic stress symptoms, including nightmares, emotional numbness and intrusive thoughts. As a result, people may avoid the news altogether or wind up constantly checking for updates. “This can make it difficult to complete assignments at work, and relationships suffer because you’re emotionally unavailable or more reactive than usual,” Lurie said.Advertisement
Eventually, your worldview might shift. Research shows serious challenges can crush the illusion of predictability and stability, making us question our existence and purpose in life. “People may begin to see the world as less safe or others as less trustworthy,” Shield said. There are ways you can feel more in control when you’re overwhelmed by the news. Though we can’t control world events, we can control how we respond and engage with them. If you’re watching the news and notice your heart rate or breathing rate speed up, it’s time to ground yourself. Consider doing a quick body scan (focus on how every body part, from your head to your toes, feels) or try a deep breathing exercise (inhale for four counts, hold your breath for another four, then slowly exhale for six counts). Another trick is the 5-4-3-2-1 technique: Identify five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one thing you can taste. “This brings your attention back to the present moment and helps your nervous system recognize that you’re actually safe right now,” Lurie said.Advertisement
Another option is to get outside and move. Walking can quiet an overactive amygdala, lower cortisol and adrenaline levels, and boost the amount of feel-good endorphins in your body, Lurie explained.Next, lean on your support system. Call a friend, go out to dinner with a colleague or visit a family member. Spending time with people who feel safe can help your body settle down, Shields said. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Finally, set some boundaries on your news consumption. Lurie recommended picking specific times to check the news. Stick to the limits by setting a timer and only looking at one or two sources you know are reliable and trustworthy. Constantly scrolling — and being constantly activated — will actually impair your ability to respond to the challenges in your life and community, according to Lurie. “At this moment in time, we are tasked with finding the balance between caring engagement and self-preservation, so that we can continue to find connection and find our way through this moment.”RelatedMental HealthNewstraumaNew Report Links Alcohol To Alarming Health Conditions— And Health Officials Are Quietly Dismissing ItWhat Alarms Doctors The Most About COVID Right NowMarjorie Taylor Greene Is Calling For This Disturbing Change, And Experts Are Sounding The AlarmThis Harmful Habit Is Often Disguised As Kindness — And You Might Be Caught In It Without Knowing Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
