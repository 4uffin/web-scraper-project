After a reporter told the president that Redford had died in his sleep Tuesday, Trump replied, “That’s a good way to go, I guess.” Despite praising the two-time Oscar winner’s body of work, Trump avoided naming his favorite Redford film.“Well, you have a lot of them … I’d say he made seven or eight great movies, they were really great. There was a period of time when he was the hottest,” he responded. “I thought he was great.”Advertisement
