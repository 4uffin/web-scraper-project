RowlingOn a recent podcast episode, the actress detailed what part of the rift made her “most upset.”By Jazmin TolliverTrends Reporter, HuffPostSep 24, 2025, 08:48 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGEmma Watson is getting candid about her complicated rift with “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling.Watson, who skyrocketed to fame after starring as Hermione Granger in the “Harry Potter” movie franchise from 2001 to 2011, previously spoke out about her support of trans rights after Rowling began spewing anti-trans rhetoric on social media in 2019, drawing ire from trans activists and “Harry Potter” fans. While appearing on Wednesday’s episode of the “On Purpose With Jay Shetty,” Shetty asked Watson about her relationship with Rowling, which remains sour after the once-celebrated laureate of children’s literature implied last year that she doesn’t plan to forgive Watson and her “Harry Potter” co-star Daniel Radcliffe for publicly opposing her comments.

Rowling also noted that the two should “save their apologies” after speaking out against her anti-trans remarks. “I really don’t believe that by having had that experience and holding the love and support and views that I have, means that I can’t and don’t treasure Jo and the person that I had personal experiences with,” Watson said. “I will never believe that one negates the other and that my experience of that person, I don’t get to keep and cherish.” She continued, “I think it’s my deepest wish that I hope people who don’t agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don’t necessarily share the same opinion with.”Advertisement
After Rowling wrote an essay defending her anti-trans beliefs in 2020, Watson and Radcliffe swiftly voiced support for the transgender community in response. “Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren’t who they say they are,” Watson wrote in a June 2020 X post. In a separate follow-up post, she added, “I want my trans followers to know that I and so many other people around the world see you, respect you and love you for who you are.” Advertisement

Rowling contested the accusations that she “hates trans people” in an X post. “The idea that women like me, who’ve been empathetic to trans people for decades, feeling kinship because they’re vulnerable in the same way as women - ie, to male violence - ‘hate’ trans people because they think sex is real and has lived consequences - is a nonsense,” she wrote in June 2020. Watson went on to tell Shetty that she’s “most upset” about the fact that a “conversation was never made possible” between her and Rowling. Shetty then asked if she would be open to speaking with Rowling, to which Watson replied, “Yeah, and I always will. I believe in that. I believe in that completely.”Advertisement
Elsewhere in the interview, Watson declared that she believes that “no one is disposable,” adding, “And everyone as far as possible, whatever the conversation is, should and can be treated with, at the very least, dignity and respect.”Watch Watson’s appearance on the “On Purpose With Jay Shetty” podcast below.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
