And while most of the time we’ve learned to temper our expectations when it comes to the skin care purchasable in a tube, one video on TikTok showing an over-the-counter eye treatment in action had me reconsidering what is possible. In the un-doctored video, a woman with prominent under-eye puffiness and visible sagging applied Peter Thomas Roth’s Instant Firmx Eye treatment to the area of concern. Almost instantly, the nondescript cream appeared to lift, firm and visibly smooth her under eyes in a way that I could describe as nothing short of magic. Or at the very least, in-office-treatment-worthy. I did some digging and tapped experts to explain this sorcery — and surprise, it really does work with the proper expectations. Best of all, this stuff rarely goes on sale but it’s 15% off at Amazon today.Advertisement
$32.30 at Amazon (regularly $38)Curious to get to the bottom of these results, I sought the guidance of Dr. Omer Ibrahim, a board-certified dermatologist at Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology. Ibrahim explained that the Firmx’s instantly tightening results are most likely due to sodium silicates, which are listed fairly high on the product’s list of ingredients.Advertisement
“These ingredients form a film on the skin that contracts once it’s dried. It essentially pulls the skin tight once the product dries down, which only takes a few seconds,” Ibrahim said.He said that throughout the day, as the skin naturally generates more oil, the film will start to wear off, losing the tightening and de-puffing effects.

$32.30 at Amazon (regularly $38)With such bold claims, you may be wondering how the product seems to have a less-than-4-star rating and its fair share of less-than-positive reviews. It’s because, as one Sephora reviewer put it, there’s “a learning curve” to the application and wear process. “You don’t just cake it on and demand perfection,” the reviewer wrote. “I like to take two small dots, about the size of a ladybug each and rub them until warm and silky. If you feel any white bits, remove them. Take the silky product, slightly heated from your rubbing, and blot it onto your skin in areas directly under and around the eye.” Advertisement
According to this reviewer, and many others, this key procedure of applying a minimal amount of product, then letting it dry completely before moving the face or moving forward with makeup, will make all the difference in a seamless finish that doesn’t leave a white residue — a complaint that many reviewers had. $32.30 at Amazon (regularly $38)UltaInstant firming before and after results with The Peter Thomas Roth Instant Firmx eye treatment.Advertisement
$26.50 at Amazon (regularly $38)This also addresses another concern that makeup wearers may have: Can this be worn beneath concealers and foundations? Based on the experiences of some reviewers, the answer is yes, just as long as you are conservative with the amount of eye treatment that you apply. It’s also important to note that some users didn’t experience as much success with their makeup application. Advertisement
Ibrahim did remind us that in-office solutions like Botox, lasers and microneedling are truly the most effective and long-term solutions to concerns like fine lines and volume loss. We also understand that this isn’t always the most feasible option for everyone, which makes lower-risk alternatives like the Instant Firmx a possible solution.You can score an on-sale tube for yourself or read any of the enthusiastic reviews down below. “All I could say when looking in the mirror after 5 minutes of putting this stuff on was, ” Oh My God” and I’m not kidding. I’m 65 in 4 months. I’ve taken very good care of my skin, but have been a sunbather as a teenager.,with two scars from skin cancer removal on my nose. USE SUN SCREEN AND A HAT LADIES! On my left side I have an indentation next to some crow feet coming down on my cheek bone. I’m telling you it was completely gone along with the crows feet on both eyes. Then suddenly gone, blue-black under colors and fine lines that smoothed out and turned nearly a white cream color, gone!! […]” —Linda (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review.)“OMG! I’ve been watching these Plexiderm commercials and was tempted since my eye bags are so pronounced these days. So instead, I started browsing eye products on Amazon and came across this product. All I can say is that it does what it says it does, for probably a whole lot less than the commercial products. See for yourself in the before and after photo that I posted. Tested it only on the right eye for comparison. You can feel it firming up within 2 minutes. Package says don’t move the area for 3 to 7 minutes till dry. Not sure how long it lasts, but wow, what a difference.” — Big D“I’ve been using this for years, and it honestly really works! It instantly firms up the skin around my eyes and smooths out fine lines like nothing else. The key is making sure your face is super clean—no lotions or anything—and using just a thin layer. I learned the hard way that liquid makeup over it doesn’t work, but powder makeup with a fine brush? Perfect! It gives me that tight, refreshed look every time. I can’t recommend this enough if you want a quick, noticeable difference in how your eyes look!” — christina“This wins a 5 star review from me for the most effective product I’ve ever purchased. If you can’t afford Botox this a a great temporary fix! You use such a small amount and literally follow the directions not to move muscles and the crows feet etc disappear like magic You can feel it working and it easily lasts all day! As other reviews mention it does take practice and I do apply foundation after it sits awhile. I use it primarily on my crows feet and my neck. They should address the issue of white residue and maybe at least add a tint of skin color just to blend easier but the stuff does TEMPORARILY make an obvious difference and that very impressive or I would never leave a review or recommend it. The price point is high but honestly the tube lasts forever. I highly recommend trying it if you have bags under your eyes on neck lines. I’m yet to find a filler that works well and would welcome any suggestions but this product isn’t a daily basis and will not change any lines permanently but when you want to look your best this is a great start! Happy days!” — Amia$32.30 at Amazon (regularly $38)The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics.
