Ashley Mixon, a beauty TikToker who is a self-proclaimed K-beauty enthusiast with a devout following, previously made a TikTok video speaking about the Korean brand Iope.Advertisement

According to her, Iope is allegedly also the brand behind famed ‚Äúcushion foundations‚Äù and other innovative beauty goods. One product in particular that TikTok has gone crazy over is their Iope Bio-PDRN Caffeine Face Shot, a serum that Mixon calls ‚Äúfiller in a bottle,‚Äù a ‚Äúhero product‚Äù and ‚Äúlifting.‚Äù $50 at AmazonAdvertisement
(Note: HuffPost reached out to Mixon and found she does receive compensation from Iope, but only from her affiliate link and not from the brand directly.)Mixon isn‚Äôt the only fan of the Bio-PDRN Caffeine Face Shot. Many reviewers claim this $50 serum has made their skin smoother, helped improve hormonal acne, reduced the appearance of fine lines and even become a replacement for Botox and prescription-strength retinoids like Tretinoin. (It should be noted, however, that dermatologists say no at-home treatment can ever be as effective as Botox.)Mixon and Iope attribute these kinds of alleged results to an ingredient called PDRN, an anti-inflammatory and tissue-repairing proprietary drug that is normally injected in the hopes of improving the overall skin appearance and skin firmness of the recipient. Normally extracted from the sperm cells of salmon, Iope‚Äôs version of PDRN is developed from plants, so the formula is completely vegan. Advertisement
In addition to plant-powered PDRN, the serum also contains a more recognizable combination of ingredients like niacinamide ‚Äî a versatile antioxidant that many swear by for everything from brightening skin to managing redness ‚Äî and probiotics, an unlikely ingredient that dermatologists have previously told HuffPost can do wonders for keeping skin healthy and strong. And if you‚Äôre wondering what caffeine is doing in your skin care and not your latte, there is some evidence to support that, due to its antioxidant properties, topical applications of caffeine may aid in reducing the appearance of wrinkles caused by sun damage. ‚ÄúIt contains 20,000 ppm (parts per million) of caffeine, which is one-eighteenth the size of collagen, so yes it does penetrate into the skin!‚Äù Mixon told HuffPost via email.

The brand says that to use the serum, just apply three to four drops after your toner and before creams and moisturizers. Mixon said that it can be used day or night and doesn‚Äôt interfere with other products or other active ingredients that you might be using.Miraculously, you don‚Äôt have to travel to Korea to get yourself a bottle of the Bio-PDRN Caffeine Face Shot. You can head right to your trusty virtual shelves of Amazon (or any of the other above listed retailers) in order to see what all the hype is about for yourself.
