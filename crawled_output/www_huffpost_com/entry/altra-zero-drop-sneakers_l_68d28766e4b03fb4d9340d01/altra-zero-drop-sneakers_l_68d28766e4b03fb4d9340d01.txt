In zero-drop styles, the heel and forefoot sit at the same height, encouraging a natural, flat-foot position similar to standing barefoot. Low-drop shoes, with the heel about four millimeters higher, still promote a more natural gait than traditional running shoes, which some find more comfortable when transitioning from conventional footwear.Advertisement
According to William Kuang, plantar fasciitis expert and director at SA Running Injury Clinic in Adelaide, Australia, the level platform of a zero-drop shoe encourages a natural midfoot strike, helping to reduce excessive loading on the kneecap, shin and forefoot. “Theoretically, this helps reduce ground reaction forces, or shock, to these regions and may ease pain from conditions such as runner’s knee, shin splints, and forefoot issues like bunions, metatarsalgia, hammertoes or neuromas.”The wider toe box can also ease forefoot issues.“[But] even in healthy individuals, Altra’s design encourages natural biomechanics — better toe splay for balance, more efficient shock absorption, and improved alignment of the foot, ankle, knee and hip,” says Kuang. It’s important to make a gradual transition from conventional footwear to low- or zero-drop shoes, starting with short walks or easy runs in your Altras and alternating with your usual shoes. “This gives the calf muscles, Achilles and plantar fascia time to adapt to the increased stretch of the zero-drop platform. Strengthening calf and intrinsic foot muscles alongside the transition further reduces injury risk,” explains Kuang.Advertisement
Here’s what to shop across the brand, designed specifically for activities like hiking, road running, trail running and long walks.1 A hiker with one of the roomiest toe boxes Featuring a zero-millimeter drop and a 100% recycled ripstop mesh upper designed for durability, Dr. Milica McDowell, physical therapist and vice president of operations at Gait Happens, recommends the Lone Peak 9 for hiking. With one of the roomiest toe boxes in the lineup, this model lets your toes splay, or spread out, naturally.
“This position is ideal for biomechanical optimization of running and walking, and allows more muscle contraction, better push off and puts less stress on the soft tissues and nerves in your feet,” says McDowell, adding that this can be especially beneficial for those struggling with arch pain, neuromas, a history of stress fractures or other inflammations in the foot and ankle. “The wider your toes can splay, the better your balance and stability.”
In women’s, this comes in 12 colorways, including dark blue, a gray-and-lime combo and taupe, in sizes 5.5 through 12. In men’s, it’s available in 11 colorways, including maroon, light gray and a blue-and-lime combo, in sizes 7 through 16.$139 at Zappos$140 at REI$140 at Altra2 A hiking shoe that delivers maximum comfort With a zero-drop and 33 millimeters of compression-molded Eva foam underfoot, the Olympus 6 Hike Low GTX is an ultra-cushioned option for hikers seeking maximum support and comfort, making it a popular choice for long-distance hikes and navigating rough terrain while keeping your feet comfortable. The roomy toe box adds extra comfort on descents and in situations where your feet tend to swell, and the Gore-Tex Invisible Fit waterproof lining keeps your feet dry. “Lug patterns and the sticky rubber improve your traction on technical and sloppy terrain during both ascents and descents,” says McDowell, adding that this can assist with better foot placement in variable conditions. She also points out that a higher ankle collar helps reduce debris from getting inside the shoe. “Depending on the wearer, it can provide a better sense of stability and comfort.”
The women’s style comes in three colorways, including dark blue and black, in sizes 5.5 through 12, while the men’s style is available in four colorways, including gray, olive, and black, in sizes 7 through 15.$200 at Zappos$200 at REI$200 at Altra3 A shoe ideal for both running and walking For road runners, McDowell points to the Torin 8 as a solid choice, balancing plenty of cushion with a natural underfoot feel. “A wide, roomy toe box provides plenty of space for natural toe splay, with underfoot protection for lots of miles on the road.” The shoe also comes in a wide width for those who need it, and is built on a zero-drop platform.With 30 millimeters of cushioning, the Torin 8 delivers plush comfort for daily runs and longer distances without feeling bulky. The breathable jacquard mesh upper adds airflow, making it a top pick for walking, too.Altra’s zero- and low-drop styles help runners move more naturally, making it easier to transfer force from heel to big toe during push-off, explains McDowell. Higher-drop shoes make this motion harder because the heel sits elevated. “All lower body alignment is affected by the heel being elevated, so if you are wearing a higher drop shoe, it places more stress on the knee, hip and low back areas, which can, over time, cause fatigue while walking or running, or even potentially lead to inflammatory issues.” Regularly wearing shoes with a high heel height can also reduce ankle mobility and stiffen the Achilles tendon and calf muscles.The women’s style comes in 13 colorways, including mint, tan and blue, in sizes 5.5 through 12. Men’s styles are available in 12 colorways, including black, taupe and light gray, in sizes 7 through 15. Men’s: $150 at REIWomen's: $150 at REI$150 at AltraAdvertisement
4 A trail running shoe with extra support For trail runners seeking extra support due to foot or ankle injury or mobility issues, McDowell recommends the Experience Wild 2. The low, four-millimeter drop and slightly rockered profile encourage an efficient heel-to-toe movement pattern. “The rocker enables the forward momentum of the shoe and takes some load off the foot and lower leg muscles and tendons,” she says.
Updated engineered mesh improves breathability, while a protective layer made of thermoplastic polyurethane provides crucial protection for the toes and added durability, shielding your feet from roots, rocks and other trail debris.
The women’s style comes in seven colorways, in sizes 5.5 through 12. The men’s version is also available in seven colorways, in sizes 7 through 15. Men's: $140 at REIWomen's: $140 at REI$140 at AltraAdvertisement
5 A shoe made for walking For McDowell, the Escalante 4 is a go-to walking shoe for a closer-to-the-ground, natural feel, offering 24 millimeters of cushioning. The Altra Ego midsole adds responsiveness and bounce without weighing the shoe down, and is also great for road running, with a zero-drop platform that promotes natural alignment and encourages a midfoot or forefoot strike.
The women’s style comes in 12 colorways, including light gray and a gray-and-teal combo, in sizes 5.5 through 12. The men’s version is available in 13 colorways, including classics like black, white and olive, in sizes 7 through 15.$130 at Zappos$130 at REI$130 at Altra6 A plush yet responsive walking shoe “On the other end of the spectrum, for those wanting more support and underfoot cushion, Paradigm 8 offers the perfect blend of natural foot positioning with its zero-drop feature, with GuideRail technology to cradle the foot and provide guidance through the gait cycle as needed,” says McDowell. The Paradigm 8 also comes in a wide width to accommodate more foot volume through the midfoot area.
With 30 millimeters of cushioning, this shoe offers a plush yet responsive ride thanks to its Altra Ego Max midsole, providing protection without feeling heavy, making it a versatile all-rounder. Lace it up for walking, commuting, easy runs or recovery days and enjoy supportive comfort.
The women’s style comes in six colorways, including navy, gray and purple, in sizes 5.5 through 12, while the men’s comes in five colorways, including taupe and gray, in sizes 7 through 15. Men's: $160 at REIWomen's: $160 at REI$160 at AltraAdvertisement
7 A running shoe designed for speed For speed and performance, the zero-drop Vanish Carbon 2 has a full-length carbon fiber plate to boost propulsion while supporting a natural, efficient stride. Its 36-millimeter stack height adds cushioning, and the reformulated Ego Pro midsole foam, about 32% lighter, delivers extra comfort without added weight. Smooth, lightweight rubber outsoles complete the design. “A smoother outsole decreases friction and energy loss on pavement, helping runners maintain efficiency. The lightweight rubber keeps the shoe responsive and reduces overall fatigue during longer road runs,” says Kuang.
The women’s style comes in four colorways, including a white-and-orange combo and a white-and-coral combo, in sizes 5.5 through 12. The men’s style is available in four colorways as well, including a blue-and-lime combo and a white-and-lime combo, in sizes 7 through 15.
