Fleischman said. “It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.”Advertisement
Fleischman went on to note that “not a single reputable study has successfully concluded that the use of acetaminophen in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children.” He added that the studies often cited as evidence face “methodological limitations,” including issues with self-reported data and a lack of control for confounding variables.

If left untreated, maternal fever and pain can be harmful, Fleischman said. Advertisement
“The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks, and can create severe morbidity and mortality for the pregnant person and the fetus,” Fleischman said. Untreated fevers during pregnancy could increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and possible birth defects, according to the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM). SMFM similarly questioned the administration’s conclusions and stressed that it stood by guidance deeming acetaminophen “an appropriate medication to treat pain and fever during pregnancy.”Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.
