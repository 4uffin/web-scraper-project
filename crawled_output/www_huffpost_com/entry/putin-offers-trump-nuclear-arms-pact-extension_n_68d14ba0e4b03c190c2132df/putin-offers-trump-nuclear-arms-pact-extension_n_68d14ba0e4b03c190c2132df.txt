The last remaining treaty between them that limits the numbers of these weapons is due to expire on February 5 next year.Advertisement
The New START treaty covers strategic nuclear weapons — those designed by each side to hit the enemy’s centers of military, economic and political power — and caps the number of deployed warheads at 1,550 on each side. Both are likely to breach that limit if the treaty is not extended or replaced.Putin Under Pressure To End Ukraine WarPutin, who said his proposal was in the interests of global non-proliferation and could help spur dialogue with Washington about arms control, has been under pressure from Trump to agree to end the war in Ukraine, something Moscow says is part of a slew of security issues that have raised East-West tensions to their most dangerous level since the Cold War.The offer, made at a time when Ukraine is trying to persuade Trump to impose harsher sanctions on Russia, was made public by Putin at a meeting of his Security Council.Advertisement

“We believe that this measure will only be viable if the United States acts in a similar manner and does not take steps that undermine or violate the existing balance of deterrence capabilities.”The proposal appears to be a unilateral change of policy by Moscow which has until now insisted it would only engage with Washington on such matters if overall ties - hampered by stark differences over the war in Ukraine - improved.There was no immediate response from Washington.Talks On Overhauling Treaty Yet To StartWith just over four months to go before the New START runs out, differences over the Ukraine mean Russia and the United States have not started talks on renewing or overhauling the treaty though Trump has spoken of his desire to do a new nuclear arms control deal, albeit with China as well.Advertisement
Beijing has rejected the idea that it should be included too.Putin said Russia would be monitoring U.S. nuclear arms and defence activity, paying particular attention to Washington’s plans to beef up its missile defences and ideas to deploy missile interceptors in space.“We will proceed on the basis that the practical implementation of such destabilising actions could nullify our efforts to maintain the status quo in the field of START,” said Putin. “We will respond accordingly.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
