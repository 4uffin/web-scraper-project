I am very excited to announce a partnership with @TPUSA to establish chapters in ALL Oklahoma high schools. Radical leftist teachers’ unions have dominated classrooms for far too long, and we are taking them back. pic.twitter.com/3sihJX3sUv— Ryan Walters (@RyanWalters_) September 23, 2025Walters’ announcement comes after Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, took over the organization following his fatal shooting at Utah Valley University. It’s unclear if the widowed Kirk will continue to echo her husband’s thinking against immigrants, Muslims and the LGBTQ+ community or will move the organization further to the right.“We have seen the outpouring from parents, teachers, and students that want to be engaged in a meaningful work going on at Turning Point,” Walters said. “They want their young people to be engaged in a process that understands free speech, open engagement, dialog about American greatness, a dialog around American values.”Advertisement
As of this afternoon, in the past 6 days, TPUSA has received 54,000+ requests from high school and college students nationwide to start a chapter or get involved with an existing chapter.This is just the beginning. @tpusastudents— Turning Point USA (@TPUSA) September 16, 2025In an interview with local Fox affiliate KOKH-TV, he warns there will be repercussions for schools that refuse to have a Turning Point USA chapter.“I mean, we would go after their accreditation. We would go after their certificates. So yeah, they would be in danger of not being a school district if they decided to reject a club that is here to promote civic engagement,” Walters said. “Absolutely, they would be violating the law. They would be violating the rules set forth to them by our agency. So yeah, everything would be on the table in that scenario.”Advertisement
This is not the first move Walters has made to push the Oklahoma school system to the right. Last year, he appointed Chaya Raichik, the creator of the right-wing social media account Libs of TikTok, to the state’s library media advisory board.“Chaya is on the front lines showing the world exactly what the radical left is all about — lowering standards, porn in schools, and pushing woke indoctrination on our kids,” Walters said at the time.The GOP school official was recently investigated by the Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office after two members of the state’s board of education claimed they saw images of naked women on a TV screen in his office. No charges were filed, and Walters called the accusations a “witch hunt.” Advertisement
During his tenure, Walters pushed a more right-wing agenda for the school systems, saying he would allow ICE into public schools and mandate them to incorporate the Bible into their lesson plans for grades five through 12.Ryan Walters, Oklahoma State Superintendent announced plans to establish Charlie Kirk's Turning Point USA chapters in high schools.AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
