“I personally think it would be best if Brendan Carr had just probably stayed off television yesterday and let the market do the work,” said Ingraham in an appearance on Fox News’ “America’s Newsroom.”“I think the market is becoming very efficient with far-left comedians. I think their audience is shrinking, their influence is very narrow and these station groups were reacting to the audience.”After FCC-approval-seeking Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair pulled Kimmel’s show from its ABC affiliates, Carr — who suggested that his agency could revoke affiliates’ broadcasting licenses the “easy way or the hard way” hours earlier — took to social media to thank the companies.Advertisement
He later celebrated ABC suspending Kimmel’s show with a gif from “The Office,” according to CNN’s Brian Stelter.Carr joins a number of other MAGA figures who are delighted over the suspension.Trump FCC Chair Brendan Carr threatens ABC and Disney over Jimmy Kimmel’s Charlie Kirk comments:“We can do this the easy way or the hard way… There’s actions we can take on licensed broadcasters. It’s long past the time that… Comcast and Disney say ‘We’re not gonna run Kimmel… pic.twitter.com/Zk86HS74wW— Republicans against Trump (@RpsAgainstTrump) September 17, 2025Kimmel sparked right-wing criticism when he remarked on the suspect in the Kirk assassination case during Monday’s monologue.Advertisement
“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” he said.Ingraham argued that Kimmel has the right to “hate anyone he wants” and “say anything he wants,” but he doesn’t have the right to be on ABC if the network decides it’s not making money or offends half or more of its audience.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

She went on to cite the Communications Act of 1934 — which has an obscure provision allowing presidents to shut down broadcasters in the interests of a “national emergency” or “national security” — before suggesting that “failure to serve public interest” could be grounds to cancel or revoke a broadcast license.RelatedFox NewsJimmy KimmelLaura IngrahamfccBrendan CarrEx-Bush Aide Says Kimmel Suspension Is Leading To 'Corrupt' Trump's Sinister PlotCanceled ‘Kimmel’ Guest Drops Scathing Reality Check On TrumpTrump Celebrates Kimmel's Show Getting Pulled — And Targets Other HostsJimmy Kimmel Speaks Out After ABC Suspension Over Charlie Kirk Comments Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
