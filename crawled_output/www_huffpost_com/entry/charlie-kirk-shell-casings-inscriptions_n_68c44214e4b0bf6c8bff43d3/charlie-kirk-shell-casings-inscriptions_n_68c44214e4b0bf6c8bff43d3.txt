Here's What They Mean.Despite what the Wall Street Journal initially reported, none of the inscriptions spread "transgender ideology."By Ryan GrenobleSenior ReporterSep 12, 2025, 02:26 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGShell casings recovered along with the weapon used to assassinate Charlie Kirk suggest the shooter was deeply familiar with internet meme culture, with three of the four casings inscribed with online lingo the average person would find inscrutable.Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (R) relayed the writing to reporters at a press conference Friday, where he also confirmed 22-year-old Tyler Robinson had been arrested as the prime suspect in the shooting.Advertisement
Earlier reporting, spread most prominently by The Wall Street Journal, described the casings as “engraved with transgender and antifascist ideology.” It’s unclear how the Wall Street Journal drew that conclusion, with the outlet citing an “early bulletin” that was shared among law enforcement. While two of the casings certainly allude to fascism, one potentially favorably, none of the messages are even remotely related to trans people.According to Cox, a single fired casing, belonging to the bullet that hit and killed Kirk, read, “Notices bulges. OwO, what’s this?”Advertisement
The phrase references a meme popularized around 2015 parodying furries, in which one furry notices the “bulge” in another furry’s pants and reacts with wide-eyed surprise, as denoted by the “OwO” emoticon, according to Know Your Meme.It’s unclear what the shooter’s intended message is here. Likely it’s just “shitposting” ― meaning there’s no clear message at all, only deliberate absurdity.Three other, unfired, rounds were also found at the scene, also bearing their own inscriptions, according to Cox.Advertisement
One was inscribed with, “Hey fascist, catch!” along with a series of arrows: ⬆️➡️⬇️⬇️⬇️While Gov. Cox said the phrase “speaks for itself,” there’s a bit more to it than that. Gamers quickly linked the arrows to the button sequence in a game called “Helldivers 2,” that airdrops a bomb. In the game, players role-play as fighting on behalf of a fascist state ― not against it.Cox said another bullet read, “If you read this you are gay, lmao.”This one also falls under the purview of shitposting, with an extra dash of online trolling. The phrase has seen wide use as an ironic (and, yes, queer-phobic) joke for many, many years.Police tape hangs in front of Utah Valley University following the fatal shooting of political activist Charlie Kirk during an event at the campus on September 12, 2025 in Orem, Utah.

And the fourth bullet ― bearing what would seem to be the only non-online message of the bunch ― read, “Oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao.”The phrase appears to reference an Italian folk song which originated with 19th-century rice paddy workers. In the WWII era, it morphed into resistance song sung by Italians opposing fascism, though an investigation by George Mason University found this is mostly apocryphal.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

According to The Verge, the phrase pops up in a variant of “Helldivers 2” and “Hearts of Iron IV,” a WWII strategy game, as well as “Far Cry 6.”Advertisement
On Friday afternoon, the Human Rights Campaign called for the Wall Street Journal to formally retract its story, accusing the outlet of peddling “rumors with incomplete and untrue details” for the purpose of “inciting rage.”“Rage is what makes this country a tinder box,” HRC press secretary Brandon Wolf said in a statement. “People’s rush to lob hot takes and click bait is not how we are going to get out of this deeply divided, dangerous era. News outlets and people with platforms have to do better.”Related shootingUtahMemescharlie kirkshell casingsAmerica's Horror: The Rise Of Political ViolenceCharlie Kirk Shooting Suspect Captured, Trump And Utah Authorities AnnounceCharlie Kirk Lit The Path For Trumpism And A Far-Right AmericaTrump Pours Gas On The Flames With Incendiary Statement On Charlie Kirk Assassination Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
