However, authorities said the suspect didn’t shoot ICE agents; he killed an immigrant detainee and wounded two others before taking his own life.Vance had a suggestion for how such tragedies could be prevented.“If you want to stop political violence, stop telling your supporters that everyone who disagrees with you is a Nazi,” he said.Vance: "If you want stop political violence, stop telling your supporters that everybody who disagrees with you is a Nazi." pic.twitter.com/7ubTH3pvbr— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 24, 2025Advertisement
Unfortunately for Vance, his suggestion set him up for mockery in a way he apparently did not see coming.During Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, Vance told a former roommate from Yale Law School that Trump could become “America’s Hitler.”Since then, Vance has either changed his mind about Trump or decided it was worth setting aside his misgivings in exchange for political power.Advertisement
Still, many people on social media felt obliged to remind Vance of that one time he called his current boss a Nazi.the only major politicians who’ve called trump hitler: j.d. vance and rfk jr. https://t.co/i4QiLOOcR7— Marlow Stern (@MarlowNYC) September 24, 2025Nothing says "I’m not a Nazi" like angrily demanding people stop calling you one.— 𝕊𝕦𝕟𝕕𝕒𝕖_𝔾𝕦𝕣𝕝 (@SundaeDivine) September 24, 2025Advertisement
