“Now, obviously, everybody watching is only thinking about my mustache right now,” he began, before explaining that he was conducting a “social experiment” to see how the world has changed over the last eight decades.“After World War II, for the last 80 years, everything has been a paradigm of, is it Hitlerian or is it Captain America?” Jones explained, eventually claiming, “The Democrats and the colleges and the think tanks and the [Anti-Defamation League], they then say that white men are Hitler.” Jones’ “social experiment” may have been inspired by Vice President JD Vance, who went viral on Wednesday after he demanded Americans stop using the word “Nazi” as an insult.Advertisement
The right-wing troll said that “a lot of people are sick of” the use of “Nazi” as a perjorative, but conceded: “but they’re not very sophisticated and have not actually studied that Hitler was a very kleptocratic, totalitarian, megalomaniacal individual.”“It doesn’t mean some of the forces he was opposing were good, either,” he added.Jones then suggested that his Hitler ’stache was a total babe magnet.“I went to a gas station, I went in a grocery store this morning, and it was spectacular, being a white guy that has German features — classical German features — and with a Hitler mustache, and it was very interesting,” Jones said.“I could tell you it had a wild effect on women,” he continued. “I thought they were about to start throwing their panties at me. And they didn’t know why... Lex-Luthor-meets-Adolf-Hitler looks with blue eyes, and they just didn’t know what to do. They’re like, melting.”Advertisement
Jones also showed off the ’stache on social media, claiming the hairstyle matches the policies of the Democratic Party.You can see the video ― and the ’stache — below.Though Jones seemed pleased with his new look, that didn’t stop things from getting hairy on social media for the conspiracy theorist.Advertisement
