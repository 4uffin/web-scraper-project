Raul Grijalva — has won a special election in Arizona’s seventh district, narrowing Republicans’ slim House majority even more. Grijalva beat out Republican Daniel Butierez, a business owner, in a contest on Tuesday, securing 71% of the vote to her competitor’s 28%, as of that evening.Advertisement
Grijalva has described herself as a progressive champion, running on a platform of defending Medicaid, protecting abortion access and fighting for environmental justice. She’s also denounced Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) tactics as “inhumane” and been a vocal critic of Israel’s offensive in Gaza, describing it as “genocide.”Supporters attend a primary election-night party for Democratic U.S. congressional candidate Adelita Grijalva at El Casino Ballroom on July 15, 2025 in South Tucson, Arizona.

Grijalva will take over the historically blue seat held by her late father, who passed away in March from complications related to cancer treatments. Advertisement
She’ll also be the first Latina lawmaker Arizona has elected to Congress. Grijalva’s win gives Democrats 214 votes in the House to Republicans’ 219. This means Republicans can only afford to lose a handful of votes on contentious bills or measures. That dynamic is significant, as Republicans try to keep their fractious conference united on issues ranging from the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files to government funding. Grijalva could provide the pivotal 218th vote needed to bring legislation that pushes the Justice Department to disclose the Epstein files to the floor.Grijalva has said she would sign the petition aimed at forcing a vote on the bill. “This is as much about fulfilling Congress’ duty as a constitutional check on this administration as it is about demanding justice for survivors,” she said. “The days of turning a blind eye to Trump must end.”Advertisement
Her win also adds to the Democratic Party’s successes in recent special elections.It comes just weeks after former Congressional staffer James Walkinshaw similarly won a House seat in another reliably left-leaning district previously held by the late Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). Democrats have also seen strong performances in a series of state and Congressional legislative races thus far this year.“My dad left really big shoes to fill, but I stand on my own two feet in my more than two decades of public service to Arizona, and I’m proud to be supported by leaders and organizations that are leading the progressive movement,” Grijalva previously told ABC News.
