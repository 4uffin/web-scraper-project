But for Mariska Hargitay, a pixie cut led to her almost being fired from “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.”The actor opened up about the cut in question during an interview with Allure, published on Wednesday.Advertisement
“My hairstylist had a glass of wine and I really should have known better,” she said, joking that “Maybe he’d thought I’d be aerodynamic when I was chasing perps. I have no idea.” “We went real short — shorter than anticipated,” Hargitay said. “I almost got fired.” Despite the hubbub at the time, the actor says she now sees the cut as “easy, cool, and cop-like.” Mariska Hargitay as Detective Olivia Benson in season 3 of "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit."NBC via Getty ImagesKeri Russell is yet another actor who knows how a haircut can impact a person’s trajectory ― and popularity ― on a show.

She famously cut her hair for her hit show, “Felicity,” after creator J.J. Abrams floated the idea. “J.J. called me over the summer,” Russell said in a 2017 interview with W Magazine. “We had shot the first season of Felicity, and he said, ‘We’re coming up with the storylines for next year. We have this idea that the boyfriend breaks up with you, and then like college girls go ― you would go and cut your hair because of this big breakup. Would you be willing to do that?’” Russell said she agreed to make the change, which was then met with “crazy backlash.” 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

I did not expect all the hysteria.
