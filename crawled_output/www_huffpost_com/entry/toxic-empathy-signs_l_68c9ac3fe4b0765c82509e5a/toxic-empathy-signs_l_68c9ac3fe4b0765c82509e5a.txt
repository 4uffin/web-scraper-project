Here's how to know when it's been crossed.By Vivian ChungSep 19, 2025, 07:00 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGEmpathy, whether in a friendship or a romantic relationship, draws on our own experiences to help others feel seen, heard and less alone, strengthening trust and building the capacity to support one another.“Healthy empathy respects the autonomy of each person’s timeline for processing, problem-solving or responding. It is different from sympathy in that we feel with a person, instead of feeling sorry for a person,” explained adult psychotherapist Rebecca Love.Advertisement
At its core, healthy empathy also involves strong boundaries that separate our emotions from someone else’s. But the balance tips when we step in to solve another person’s problems or take too much responsibility for their feelings, shifting into what’s called “toxic empathy.”“It’s a state of overidentifying and over-responsibility for another’s emotional state, well-being or problem-solving, to the detriment of your own relationships, self-care and sense of peace,” Love said.While excusing someone’s behavior because you recognize their pain and understand their struggles may come from a caring place, consistently overidentifying with another person’s feelings or problems can ultimately harm both you and them.

Here’s how to spot when empathy crosses that line, and how to set boundaries that protect your well-being while still supporting others.Signs You Might Be Experiencing ‘Toxic Empathy’Even if it’s not obvious at first, a few signs can reveal when empathy has shifted into overidentifying, or toxic empathy.Perhaps the biggest red flag is constant people pleasing. Prioritizing others’ needs can blur your own sense of self, leading you to merge yourself into another person’s problems.Advertisement
“People pleasers may struggle to see their worth or value outside of exhaustively helping others by solving their problems,” Love said.Another sign you’re experiencing toxic empathy is losing sight of other people’s autonomy. You may begin imposing solutions to their issues, as this pattern often creates a sense of responsibility for fixing others’ problems.“They may frequently offer unsolicited advice and feel personally offended or angry if the person doesn’t welcome or follow it,” Love explained.Advertisement

When your own past painful experiences haven’t been addressed, shared experiences can feel triggering. “Overidentifying and overextending can be a way for a person to act out what they wished had happened for them,” she explained.

Low self-esteem can also play a role, as constantly going to extremes to help others may reflect a belief that worth is tied to self-sacrifice or always stretching past their own limits for those around them.Boundaries are another key factor. “Understanding where we end and others begin is an important ingredient of healthy empathy,” Love said. Without clear boundaries, people may struggle to say no, even at the expense of their own well-being, and may experience others’ stress or pain as if it were happening directly to them.Advertisement
Those who regularly overidentify with and carry the moods of others often end up feeling chronically overwhelmed. They may struggle to experience genuine joy or even grow resentful, despite wanting to help. “Over time, empathy without regulation may lead to emotional blunting — a protective shutdown that shields the individual from overload but also dampens positive emotional experiences,” said Michael G. Wetter, diplomate of the American Board of Professional Psychology and founder of Wetter Psychological Services. Toxic empathy can also take a mental toll, showing up as compassion fatigue, heightened anxiety or depression. “When one’s sense of self becomes too enmeshed with the emotions of others, decision-making suffers, and identity confusion may emerge,” Wetter said.Advertisement
And it doesn’t stop with the mind. The body gets caught in the cycle, too. “Toxic empathy can keep the stress-response system chronically engaged. Elevated cortisol, disrupted sleep, headaches, gastrointestinal problems, muscle tension, and fatigue are all common,” said Wetter, noting how these physical effects can chip away at health and resilience.There are also consequences for the person on the receiving end. Beyond blurring boundaries and roles, loss of agency is a major concern. “When someone overidentifies with your pain, it can feel like they’re taking ownership of your healing, which may leave you feeling helpless or dependent,” said licensed therapist and nervous system educator Courtney Shrum.

The recipient may also experience emotional guilt. “If you sense that sharing your feelings ‘costs’ the other person too much, you may stop opening up, which deepens isolation instead of connection,” Shrum added.How To Stop Feeling Toxic EmpathyIf you think you might have fallen into a cycle of toxic empathy, experts say there are practical ways to shift out of it. Shrum recommended starting with somatic check-ins, pausing a few times during the day to notice physical signs of overwhelm, such as shallow breathing, muscle tension or fatigue. “Your body signals overload before your mind does. Checking in helps you catch the moment empathy tips into self-abandonment so you can reset,” Shrum said.Advertisement
She also suggested externalizing responsibility by reminding yourself that the story you’re hearing belongs to the other person and isn’t yours to solve. A simple trick is to jot this reminder on a sticky note or in your phone and revisit it after emotionally heavy conversations. “Naming the boundary between self and other retrains your nervous system to care without carrying,” Shrum said.After a tough conversation, it also helps to commit to one simple activity you enjoy, whether that’s journaling, listening to music or stepping outside for a bit of movement, essentially creating a recovery ritual.

“These rituals discharge leftover activation in your nervous system, bringing you back to baseline so empathy doesn’t become exhaustion,” Shrum explained.While empathy is essential for building safe, supportive connections, it’s important to set habits early on that keep it from tipping into unhealthy territory.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

This means regularly checking in with yourself to see if you’re listening with care or starting to carry the other person’s feelings as your own. “That pause helps you shift from absorbing someone’s feelings to supporting them without abandoning yourself,” according to Shrum.RelatedMental Healthempathyboundariessympathy4 Signs You're Experiencing Compassion Fatigue Due To, Well, Everything‘Collective Effervescence’ Is More Common Than You Think — Here’s Why It HappensThis Subtle Communication Habit Might Be Silently Killing Your Relationship5 Things Empaths Bring Up Most In Therapy Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
