It is the ideal autumnal bag, with a lovely silhouette and fabrication that looks incredibly high-end and much more expensive than it actually is.$55+ at Gap (regularly $70)Advertisement
GapThe bag is available in four different colors.The moment the air feels even remotely crispy, I get the shopping itch. Show me a new pair of trousers, fresh shoes or even a lovely new pair of socks and you can bet my interest is piqued. I’m especially drawn to accessories like purses, which is how I found this beauty. There’s nothing like a fresh new bag to tote around all the day’s essentials. Gap has been on a stylish roll lately; you’ll be hard-pressed to find me wearing anything other than its barrel leg jeans — the bags in this nostalgic brand’s collection are no exception. Available in four chic colors, this bag is made with super-soft faux suede fabric that looks and feels like the real thing, elevating the appearance of this slouchy tote. Advertisement
It features a top handle with a rounded opening that reveals a remarkably spacious interior, complemented by a convenient smaller pocket. On any given day, I have my 15″ laptop, notebook, book, neck fan, wallet, headphones, coin purse, a pouch holding emotional support lip balms, sunglasses, a claw clip and hand sanitizer in there, with plenty of room to spare. Given that I have a 30-minute commute on foot, it’s vital that the bag itself not add more weight to my daily haul. I’m thrilled to report that the tote is super lightweight, despite its solid construction. The strap is thick enough to provide ample support and doesn’t slide off my shoulder even when wearing jackets, though time will tell if it’s a nuisance come puffer jacket season. I own the dark brown color, which was restocked this week after a lengthy absence, but I now have my eye on the steel blue hue (which happens to be on sale) — it reminds me of Maison Margiela’s icy white, painted-leather totes and bags. Unsurprisingly, this elegant bag has gone viral on TikTok multiple times. Advertisement
All of the colors are incredibly versatile, but there’s something extra wearable about the dark chocolate shade. It’s an easy way to lean into autumnal hues and embrace the hygge of it all. It has a truly timeless silhouette that will always look fabulous, making it a great investment for seasons to come. The fabric and construction give the tote a luxurious vibe — it could absolutely pass as a designer bag.$55+ at Gap (regularly $70)HuffPost/Lourdes Avila UribeThe author with her Gap vegan suede slouchy tote.Advertisement
I am not the only one vehemently singing the praises of this bag. Reviewers are thrilled by how multifunctional, stylish and practical it is. Take a look for yourself and snag it while you can; it’s a sophisticated staple that deserves a spot in your rotation. Promising reviews:“A very stylish and practical bag! The minimalist design, soft material, and versatile color make it a perfect everyday accessory. Spacious yet elegant, it’s great both for work and casual outings. An absolute must-have in any wardrobe!”″ — anonymous“I can’t stop buying these bags. The first time I went searching for the Brown, I came across the Chocolate, but that wasn’t the best part, they were both on sale 50% off, guess what I did, I bought both, that was back in November 2024. Now I see on line they have more colours this time around. Burgundy my favorite colour, but I always if they have Black I will forever buy the Black. Went to pick up my Black one that I got a discount on, only for the sales associate to tell me the Burgundy was on sale 60% off, what did I do, I ordered it immediately as they didn’t have it available in store. These purses are so good, they are big enough to hold whatever you need, and look so chic. Total win all around.” — Sandra L.“Super cute, love how big it is & can hold all my Mom stuff lol” — anonymous“You won’t regret this purchase. I like this bag so much that I got another one in steel blue. It’s stylish, goes with everything! Best of all, it is light.” — anonymous“Looks designer without the price tag! The bag is beautiful!
