“How does a 22-year-old become so filled with hate?” Lake asked. “Five years earlier, I was told he was a Trump supporter. And we sent our kids off to college, and they brainwashed him.” The MAGA darling’s theory about Robinson’s liberal college indoctrination doesn’t make much sense when looking at the accused assassin’s actual education.He attended Utah State University as a pre-engineering major for just one semester before enrolling in an electrical apprentice program at Dixie Technical College, according to The New York Times.Advertisement
Kari Lake floated an easy-to-debunk conspiracy about Charlie Kirk's alleged killer during a prayer vigil for the late political activist on Sunday.

Kirk’s own conservative crusade was anchored in the idea that American colleges and universities were “indoctrination zones.” In 2012, he founded a network of conservative college groups called Turning Point USA, which a kept a “Professor Watchlist” of faculty it accused of pushing “leftist propaganda.”In a 2022 Fox News op-ed, he wrote, “I firmly believe that most—if not all—the destructive ideas that are now eating away at the foundation of American society originated on college campuses.”When he was shot and killed at Utah Valley University last Wednesday, Kirk was in the middle of one of his signature campus political debates.Advertisement
While Kirk was one of the nation’s most high-profile conservative figures, Robinson’s exact motives and political beliefs still remain unclear. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (R) initially told The Wall Street Journal that the suspect was “deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology” but declined to offer any specifics.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
