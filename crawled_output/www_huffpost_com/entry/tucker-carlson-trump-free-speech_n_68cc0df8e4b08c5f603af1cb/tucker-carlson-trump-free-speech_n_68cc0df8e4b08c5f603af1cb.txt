And I pray that that’s his legacy.”Advertisement
He then equated freedom of speech with freedom of conscience and “the right of other people to make up their own minds about the basic questions of what is right or wrong.”Forcibly silencing that is akin to telling people they’re “meat puppets,” said Carlson.“If you don’t acknowledge the right of other people to do that, and if you take steps to prevent them from doing that, what are you really saying? You’re really saying, ‘I don’t think you have a soul,’ I think you’re a meat puppet I can control, I think you’re an animal, maybe sub-animal. You’re a slave, you’re a person to whom I can dictate belief.”Tucker Carlson speaks at a panel session during the World Government Summit in Dubai on February 12, 2024.

“It’s dark,” Carlson emphasized. “There’s nothing darker than that.”The right-wing podcast host then cut to a clip of Bondi musing about “hate speech” in the wake of Kirk’s death. “There’s free speech and then there’s hate speech,” Bondi said, “and there is no place — especially now, especially after what happened to Charlie, in our society.”Carlson gave Bondi the benefit of the doubt in his response, but warned justified civil disobedience would follow if the Trump administration tried to criminalize speech:Advertisement
You hope a year from now, the turmoil we’re seeing in the aftermath of his murder won’t be leveraged to bring hate speech laws to this country. And trust me, if it is, if that does happen, there is never a more justified moment for civil disobedience than that – ever, and there never will be. Because if they can tell you what to say, they’re telling you what to think, there is nothing they can’t do to you because they don’t consider you human.President Donald Trump on Monday said he’s “not so sure” about Americans’ First Amendment rights, and threatened to bring racketeering charges against left-leaning groups whose messages he disagrees with.Bondi, in turn, promised a crackdown on what the administration considers “hate speech.”Asked Tuesday by ABC’s Jonathan Karl if he could clarify the difference between hate speech and free speech, Trump instead attacked Karl himself.Advertisement
“What do you make of Pam Bondi saying she’s gonna go after hate speech? I mean, a lot of your allies say hate speech is free speech,” Karl asked.“[I] should probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly,” Trump replied. “You have a lot of hate in your heart. Maybe they’ll come after ABC.”TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
