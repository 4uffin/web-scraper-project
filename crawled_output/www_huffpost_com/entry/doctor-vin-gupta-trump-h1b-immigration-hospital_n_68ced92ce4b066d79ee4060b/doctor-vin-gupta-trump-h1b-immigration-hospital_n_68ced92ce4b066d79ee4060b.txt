Gupta: The impacts of this—H-1B visas, fees going up, supply going down—are ultimately going to show up once Trump is out of office.It takes anywhere from 4-6 years for a resident to graduate, get skilled, and get credentialed. So the policies going into effect today are going… pic.twitter.com/OQ6Dd86aZi— Acyn (@Acyn) September 20, 2025The president on Friday signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visas meant for highly skilled foreign workers who fill difficult-to-hire jobs in the U.S., sometimes for a below-annual wage. Per Axios, the fee could be paid by either the visa holder or their corporate sponsor. Prior to Friday’s proclamation, the average H-1B visa administrative fees totaled around $1,500, according to the BBC.Advertisement
Gupta told MeidasTouch’s Ben Meiselas that “we need foreign medical graduates, across the spectrum, wherever they’re coming from, to care for an aging society.”Meiselas cited a social media post from critical care doctor and podcaster Nick Mark, who said the fee would be “devastating” for the medical field due to the large numbers of medical residents in hospitals who are “international medical graduates.”Gupta’s aforementioned policy effects on the “medium term” point to the fact that it takes “anywhere from four to six years for a resident to graduate, get skilled, and get credentialed.”Advertisement
“It’s going to show impacts once Trump’s out of office, just like NIH cuts,” he warned.

Same thing that’s happening with immigration more broadly, in our farms and other places,” Gupta said. “Physically, we’re just not going to have enough people to care for the demand and medical services that every American is going to need at some point.”Advertisement
Gupta mentioned that the “irony” is that the policy is “probably going to impact red states more than blue states,” saying that in red states, there are more community hospitals, rural hospitals and “frankly, more places where American medical grads tend not to gravitate towards.”Gupta went on to say foreign medical graduates will likely pursue training and careers in countries where “they’ll get paid,” “be more welcome,” and “their path will be a lot easier.” RelatedDonald TrumpHealthImmigrationmedicineElected Officials, Dozens Of Protesters Arrested At Manhattan Immigration FacilityImmigration Judge Orders Mahmoud Khalil Be Deported To Algeria Or SyriaSouth Korean Workers Detained in Georgia Immigration Raid Return Home On Charter PlaneTrump Reportedly Backs Musk In Support Of Visas Amid MAGA Turmoil Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
