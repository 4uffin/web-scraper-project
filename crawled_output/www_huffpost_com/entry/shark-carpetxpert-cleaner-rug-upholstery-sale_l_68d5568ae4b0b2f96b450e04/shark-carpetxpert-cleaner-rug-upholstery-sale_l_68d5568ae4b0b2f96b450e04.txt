Get it on sale for a limited time.Maybe you had way too many glasses of wine (or, in my case, way too much coffee) and toppled your glass over a precious rug. Or, maybe your new puppy soiled your carpet and you’re on a mission to get that sweet renter’s deposit back. Or you could simply be clumsy. Whatever the case, we found a way to handle those stubborn stains and sat-too-long messes from your upholstery, carpets and fabrics — and it’s 39% off as part of an early surprise ahead of Amazon Prime Big Deal Days on October 7 and 8.Folks are calling this Shark CarpetXpert HairPro rug and upholstery cleaner a “miracle machine” due to its ability to literally erase stains away. Reviewers say this cleaner has worked on everything from puppy accidents and cat food splatter to mattress urine stains and the hyper-specific problem of residual pet pig smells. It even made one reviewer’s 15-year-old carpet look brand new! If you’ve got at-home stains nagging at your mind, we think this machine is well worth a shot while it sits at the lowest price it’s been all year.Advertisement
$199.99 at amazon (regularly $329.99)This cleaning machine is made for lifting stubborn stains and even the odors that go along with them.AmazonMade for tackling those set-in stains.Advertisement
Unlike the super popular Bissell Little Green, this stain-lifter is an upright machine meant to operate like a vacuum cleaner. You just load the tank with a small amount of cleaning solution (included) and water, turn the machine on and scrub away. The bottom head uses a high-pressure spray and powerful suction to soak away dirt, grime. Its suction, meanwhile, snatches up pet and human hair and doubles as a way of drying up excess carpet moisture. It has tools for further reach and doesn’t get tangled with hair.After pulling out its hose, just attach one of two tools to spot treat furniture and upholstery, making it perfect for pet beds, couches, area rugs, ottomans, doormats and more. The crevice tool digs deep into hard-to-reach spots, while the bristle tool concentrates pressure so you can gently scrub away more stubborn stains.The head on the machine also has an anti-tangle brush, so it resists twirling any follicles and jamming during use. Also, the suction is strong enough to pull both dirty water and hair into its water tank for easy cleaning.Advertisement
And reviewers swear it’s perfect for households with pets.Cats, dogs and even pigs don’t stand a chance to this thing, according to reviews. Reviewers also say they’ve removed cat and dog urine from carpets, even when they’ve been stuck on for years.“This machine received daily use for several weeks,” says one in particular. “I shampooed my entire house and nearly every piece of furniture sometimes more than once. It removed 10+ year old stains, residual smell of pet pig and pet rat urine (iykyk), chicken coop muck and mud, grease and softball sized amounts of embedded fur. I don’t think I’ve ever been so impressed!”$199.99 at amazon (regularly $329.99)Advertisement
Grab this carpet-saving cleaner while it’s nearly 40% off and take a look below to read other promising testimonials. “Shark CarpetXpert Hair Pro - This is the most well designed carpet shampooer I have ever used. Aside from that, it performs incredibly well! I love the Shark vacuums and decided to give them a try for a shampooer. It had been several months since my carpet was last cleaned and we also took in a rescue dog that was not house trained shorty after it arrived. This machine received daily use for several weeks. I shampooed my entire house and nearly every piece of furniture sometimes more than once. It removed 10+ year old stains, residual smell of pet pig and pet rat urine (iykyk), chicken coop muck and mud, grease and softball sized amounts of embedded fur. I don’t think I’ve ever been so impressed! We are seriously hard on our carpet. We live on a farm with live stock, pets and kids. I’ve bought nearly every brand of shampooer out there. All of the major brands and most popular models. This machine absolutely blew them out of the water! Our carpet is 15 years old and looks BRAND NEW! The only possible downside for some might be the smaller tank. I have a shoulder injury and don’t mind the lighter weight of this one. It cleans so well that I don’t even mind emptying the tank more frequently. My carpet is fully dry in 1-2 hours! I can’t even explain how nice it is that you can easily clean every single part of this machine. 5 stars! Highly recommend! Bravo to the people that designed this one!” — Shannon Newsome “This is a miracle machine. Worth every penny. I’ve had this for a couple months now, and this has completely erased signs of 3 nasty puppy accidents that I thought we might have never recover from. We go through the cleaning solution fairly quickly, so buying the big replacements is absolutely worth it. The machine is very easy to take apart and clean. No leaks. Looks nice. It’s not too heavy and still feels like a sturdy, high quality machine. I like that it comes with a stand and extra attachments.” — Kat “My Bissell carpet cleaner just broke so I bought this during prime days.I have a long haired cat who mainly occupies the downstairs of my house which is all carpet. He on occasion hacks up hairballs and what not or will run his butt along the carpet if his you-know-what is in his fur. Sometimes my 1yr old will spill the cats water or the cats wet cat food has splattered for whatever reason. So I always have a shampooer in my house and have always shampooed my carpets in general.So far It’s done very well the few times I’ve used it. Its cleaned any stains up even old ones I couldn’t get up in the past. I haven’t had to pretreat, where with my bissel I would have to. It’s very light and easy to maneuver around. My last two carpet cleaners,Hoover and Bissell, were bulkyMy favorite is the hose/spot cleaner attachment is all there and ready to go. My last two were separate, so you had to go get the hose and hook it up and take it off, which was not convenient imo. I also like that it has a dry only option so you can really make sure your carpet is dry. Which brings me to the suction, it’s strong. My Bissel was not as good.I like the hair collector basket in the dirty water canister. It’s easy to remove the canisters for tossing out the dirty water, and cleaning it, or refilling cleaner canister. It is sort of loud, not any louder than the other carpet cleaners I’ve had but I don’t really care about that personally.Overall I’m pleased with this purchase it’s, kind of expensive but it works exceptionally well. I feel it’s worth it with the results I’ve gotten and ease of use. Plus it will last along time.” — Mia Giamarco$199.99 at amazon (regularly $329.99)The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics.
