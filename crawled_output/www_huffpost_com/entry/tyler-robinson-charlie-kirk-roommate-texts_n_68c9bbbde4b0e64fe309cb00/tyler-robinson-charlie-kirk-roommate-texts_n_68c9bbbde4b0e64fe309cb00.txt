I think they already swept that spot, but I don’t wanna chance it....Robinson: I’m wishing I had circled back and grabbed it as soon as I got to my vehicle. … I’m worried what my old man would do if I didn’t bring back grandpas rifle … idek if it had a serial number, but it wouldn’t trace to me. I worry about prints I had to leave it in a bush where I changed outfits. didn’t have the ability or time to bring it with. … I might have to abandon it and hope they don’t find prints. how the fuck will I explain losing it to my old man. …only thing I left was the rifle wrapped in a towel.Utah County Attorney General Jeff Gray speaks during a press conference after charges were filed against Tyler Robinson.GEORGE FREY via Getty ImagesTruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
