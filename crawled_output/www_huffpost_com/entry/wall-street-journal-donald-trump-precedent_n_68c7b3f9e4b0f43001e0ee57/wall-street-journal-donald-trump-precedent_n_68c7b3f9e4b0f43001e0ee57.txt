Which there will be, maybe as soon as 2029,” it said.Advertisement
Miran will only take an unpaid leave of absence from his role as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers and return to it after, the Journal said, noting he won’t be “independent” and will likely just do Trump’s bidding.“A tragedy of the Trump years is the failure of Republicans to look beyond short-term tactical political calculations to the implications of their decisions for the long term,” added the board, which despite its conservative leanings has become an unrelenting critic of some of Trump’s policies in recent months.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
