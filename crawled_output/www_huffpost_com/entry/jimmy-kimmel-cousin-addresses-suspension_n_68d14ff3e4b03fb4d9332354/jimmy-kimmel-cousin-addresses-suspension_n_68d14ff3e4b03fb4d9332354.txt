“I wish I could say anything. There are a couple of bombshells still there,” Iacono said. “So I’m feeling good. We’re going to be all right. Everything’s going to be just fine.”ABC on Wednesday announced Kimmel’s show would be preempted “indefinitely” after Brendan Carr, the commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission, threatened the network and its affiliates that there would be consequences unless ABC took action to discipline the comedian over his criticism of conservatives’ response to Kirk’s assassination.“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr told podcaster Benny Johnson.Iacono added that he and his family spent time with Kimmel and his family following what he described as a “tumultuous week,” before recalling an exchange Kimmel had with one of Iacono’s children.Advertisement
“My kids, I think they felt weird approaching him at first. And my middle guy, Jack, who is a junior in high school, breaks the ice and says in his deadpan way says, ‘Hey, some kids at school say it’s not right what happened to you,’” Iacono said. “And so Jimmy says, ‘Well, what did you say?’ He’s like, ‘I said, yeah, I think you’re right.’”Iacono recalled, “And Jimmy’s like, ‘Well, next time tell them, I’m not too worried about what happens. My cousin Jimmy is an excellent dancer.’”From Left: Jimmy Kimmel and Sal Iacono present the AP Offensive Player of the Year Award at the NFL Honors show at the YouTube Theater on Feb. 10, 2022, in Inglewood, California.Michael Owens via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
