When A Minnesota Lawmaker Was Assassinated"This is a good time to remind ourselves of the two Democratic Minnesota lawmakers who were shot just a few months ago. And Trump didn't lower the flags for them or any school shooting."Morgan Sloss‚Äî BuzzFeedSep 14, 2025, 08:00 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTEditor‚Äôs Note: While we can‚Äôt endorse what X has become, we can bring you the worthwhile moments that still exist there, curated and free of the surrounding chaos.Andrew Harnik / Getty ImagesOn Wednesday, conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University.truthsocial.comShortly after the news of the shooting broke, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, writing, "We must all pray for Charlie Kirk, who has been shot.

Trump continued, "No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Melania and my Sympathies go out to his beautiful wife Erika, and family. Charlie, we love you!"Advertisement
Chip Somodevilla / Getty ImagesTrump ordered the flag to be flown at half-staff until Sept. 14 "as a mark of respect for the memory of Charlie Kirk." Additionally, the president announced on Thursday morning that he'll be awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously to Charlie, calling him "a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty, and an inspiration to millions and millions of people."Steven Garcia / Getty ImagesIn June, Melissa, a Democratic Minnesota representative and her husband, Mark, were shot and killed in their home by a gunman disguised as a police officer.

God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!"Advertisement

I'm not calling him. Why would I call him? I could call and say, 'Hi, how you doing?' Uh, the guy doesn't have a clue. He's a mess. I could be nice and call, but why waste time?" Unlike former president Joe Biden and former vice president Kamala Harris, Trump did not attend Melissa's funeral, reportedly choosing to go golfing instead that day.Here's what people are saying about the double standard: x.comOne person wrote, "The entire right-wing is going to go absolutely ape shit over the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

And Trump didn't lower the flags for them or any school shooting," another said.Advertisement
