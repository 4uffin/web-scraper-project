The move has also sparked an intense conversation about censorship.Advertisement
“You can’t go around firing somebody because you’re fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian criminal administration in the Oval Office. That’s just not how this works,” Letterman said at The Atlantic Festival.The comedian said he “mercilessly” attacked multiple presidents in his 30-plus years on late night TV and heard bupkis from regulatory bodies ― suggesting that’s the way it should be for comedians roasting public figures.“The point is, beating up on these people, rightly or wrongly, accurately or perhaps inaccurately in the name of comedy, not once were we squeezed by anyone from any governmental agency, let alone the dreaded FCC,” he said.Advertisement
The former “Late Show” host called out FCC boss Carr for his menacing tone in recent comments.“This guy [at] the FCC said, ‘We can do things the easy way. We can do things the hard way.’ Who is hiring these goons? Mario Puzo?” Letterman cracked, referring to “The Godfather” author.David Letterman to Jeffrey Goldberg on Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension: “You can’t go around firing somebody because you’re fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian—a criminal—administration in the Oval Office.
