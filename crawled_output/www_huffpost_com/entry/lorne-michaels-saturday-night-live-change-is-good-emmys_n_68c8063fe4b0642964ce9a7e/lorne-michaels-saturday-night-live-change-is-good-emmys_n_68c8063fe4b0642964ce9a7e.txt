“The show has always brought people in from new, different ages and different generations, and it has to, it’s how it revives itself,” he said. “It’s always hard when people leave, but there’s a time for that. And our audiences always stay relatively young, more so now with TikTok.”“Change is good,” he continued. “And the people we’re bringing in, I’m really excited about.”But it was people on the way out who spurred much buzz lately.Cast veterans Ego Nwodim and Heidi Gardner headlined the turnover. Michael Longfellow, Emil Wakim and Devon Walker also departed.Advertisement
The 50th anniversary season was the most-watched in three years ― spurred in part by it being an election year, according to Michaels.But like the man said, change has always been part of the show’s brand. “I won this award for the first time 50 years ago, in 1975,” he said. (It was actually at the 1976 ceremony.).20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
