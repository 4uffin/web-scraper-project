Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and FBI Director Kash Patel traded verbal blows during an extraordinary clash at a Senate hearing on Tuesday.Patel faced questions from senators about the investigation into Charlie Kirk’s killing and the case against sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as one of the nation’s top law enforcement officers went before the Judiciary Committee.Advertisement
The former podcaster has received fierce criticism for social media posts following the conservative activist’s death that erroneously claimed the FBI had caught the suspect in Kirk’s shooting, even though it was the wrong person. Patel has also provoked the ire of the MAGA world over failing to release more documents on Epstein, who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.At the hearing, the New Jersey Democrat lashed out at Patel’s leadership of the law enforcement agency, claiming Patel was overseeing a “generational destruction” of the FBI.Advertisement
Booker said he believed Patel was “not going to be around long,” as President Donald Trump “will cut you loose.”After Patel hit back at Booker’s “rant of false information,” the exchange descended into a shouting match. “Your time is over,” yelled Patel, who also called Booker an “embarrassment.”As the back-and-forth became more and more unintelligible, Booker told Patel: “You don’t tell me my time is over.”Advertisement
“I am not afraid of you,” the fired-up Democrat added.For several moments, the Republican chairman of the committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley, pounded his gavel as he struggled to gain control of the two men.Watch the exchange below:TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
