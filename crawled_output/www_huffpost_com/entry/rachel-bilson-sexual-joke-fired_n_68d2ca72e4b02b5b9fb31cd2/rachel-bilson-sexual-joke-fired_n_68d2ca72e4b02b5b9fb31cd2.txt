Absolutely," Bilson said.By Carly LedbetterSenior Reporter, HuffPostSep 23, 2025, 02:34 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGRachel Bilson is speaking out about losing a job for being a little too open about some of her bedroom preferences. “The OC” star said on Nicole Byer’s “Why Won’t You Date Me” podcast last week that she was shocked to lose work after making raunchy comments while on a friend’s podcast two years ago.

“Did I want to fight it? Absolutely,” Bilson said of the situation. “Look, I can see both sides. When you take something out of context and you read something as a standalone comment, it can come off a certain way ― sure.”But the 44-year-old actor said that she was just “joking around” when she made the comments. “I said something like, ‘I like to be manhandled,’” Bilson shared, adding that her co-host said the same word. “Look, I can see both sides.

“But because I used that word in whatever context, they just took that out of the conversation. It didn’t sound great,” she admitted. “But I think it was a very conservative company so they weren’t comfortable talking about sex at all, in general.”Bilson first spoke about losing the gig back in 2023, when she said she voiced “I wanna get fucking manhandled” in a “joking manner” where it’s OK to “give control or take control in the bedroom.” 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
