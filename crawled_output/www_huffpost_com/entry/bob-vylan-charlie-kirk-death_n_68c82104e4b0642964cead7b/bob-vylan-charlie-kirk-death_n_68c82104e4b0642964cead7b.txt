“The pronouns — was/were. ’Cause if you chat shit, you will get banged. Rest in peace, Charlie Kirk, you piece of shit!” he declared.The duo, which has repeatedly criticized Israel and been outspoken in their support for Palestinians, has previously been met with controversy for leading a “death to the IDF” (Israel Defense Forces) chant at Glastonbury festival this year.The chant, which followed the BBC’s decision not to broadcast the pro-Palestinian hip-hop group Kneecap’s performance, led to the duo being dropped by their talent agency, placed under local criminal investigation, and resulted in the U.S. Department of State revoking their visas for a fall tour.Advertisement
Kirk had a history of anti-Palestinian comments, including claims that Palestine does not exist, that Gazans shouldn’t be allowed to come to the U.S., that Israel isn’t starving Gazans and that Hamas — not Israel — is at “fault” for the deaths of women and children in the territory a few weeks after the Oct. 7 attacks.Bobby Vylan’s comments on Kirk have since led to the Poppodium 013 music venue in Tilburg, Netherlands, canceling the duo’s Tuesday concert.Bobby Vylan of British duo Bob Vylan performs in front of a Palestinian flag at Glastonbury festival in June.

The venue wrote that while it stood by the rapper’s anger over “genocidal violence” perpetrated by Israel in Gaza, his statements on Kirk “clearly cross a line,” per a statement translated by Google.Bobby Vylan, in a video shared to social media Sunday, claimed that Kirk’s death wasn’t “celebrated” at any point during the Amsterdam concert but acknowledged that he called the late right-wing activist a “piece of shit.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Go find me something that proves that we were celebrating his death. You’re not going to find it because it didn’t happen,” said the rapper, who added that a lone reporter went to the show with the “sole purpose of finding something to report.”Advertisement
He went on to add, “Calm down.”On Monday morning, the rapper claimed that the duo’s show in Nijmegen, Netherlands, is still on as scheduled.RelatedMusichip hopcharlie kirkbob vylanEric Trump Says Charlie Kirk's Murder Has 'Awoken That Sleeping Enemy'Greg Gutfeld Mocks Fox News Colleague For Blunt Comment About Charlie KirkTed Cruz Filmed Whitewashing Anti-Charlie Kirk GraffitiSharon Osbourne Wants This Band's Visa Revoked After They Got Political At Coachella Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
