A letter a relative sent to Elon Musk around 2010 included the same allegations.In 2023, the then 5-year-old son Errol Musk shares with his former stepdaughter (same stepdaughter mentioned above) reportedly told family that his father had groped his buttocks.Errol Musk, who has not been convicted of any crimes related to the allegations or investigations, strongly denied the accusations in a response to questions from the Times.Advertisement
