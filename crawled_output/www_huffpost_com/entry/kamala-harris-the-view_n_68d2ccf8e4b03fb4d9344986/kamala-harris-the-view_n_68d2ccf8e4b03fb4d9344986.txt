Speaking on “The View,” where she’d declined to describe any policy differences she had with then-President Joe Biden, Harris said Tuesday she didn’t realize voters might have liked her to separate herself from the unpopular president.

“I’m a loyal person, and I didn’t fully appreciate how much people wanted to know there was a difference between me and President Biden,” Harris said. “I thought it was obvious, and I didn’t want to offer a difference in a way that would be received or suggested to be a criticism.”Harris joined “The View” as part of a media tour promoting her new campaign memoir, “107 Days,” in which she described her October 2024 appearance on “The View” as a mistake that blew up in her face.During that interview, co-host Sunny Hostin had asked Harris if she would have done anything differently than Biden in the past four years, to which she replied, “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”Advertisement
Harris devotes a chapter of her memoir to that episode. “I had no idea I’d just pulled the pin on a hand grenade,” Harris wrote in her book, obtained by HuffPost before its official release Tuesday. “I wasn’t braced for the explosion that was coming.” Harris wrote that her aides were aghast and tried to get her to revisit the question, but she didn’t, and the Trump campaign used the moment in an ad to “shackle” her to Biden.“The way I heard Sunny’s question was that it was asking me to be critical of Joe. I’ve never believed you need to elevate yourself by pushing someone else down. To do so would have been to embrace the cruelty of my opponent,” Harris wrote. Advertisement
Hostin suggested on Tuesday that it was pretty obvious Harris had damaged her campaign. Biden had dropped out of the presidential race after a terrible debate performance, after all, and public polling at the time showed voters wanted Harris to differentiate herself. “In the moment, I knew,” Hostin said. She asked if Harris thought the interview tipped the election, but Harris said no, pointing instead to high inflation as the likely biggest contributor to her loss.
