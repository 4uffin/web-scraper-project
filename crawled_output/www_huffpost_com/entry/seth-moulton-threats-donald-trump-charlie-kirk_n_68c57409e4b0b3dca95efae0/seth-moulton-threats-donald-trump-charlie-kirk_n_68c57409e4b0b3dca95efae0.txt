When asked about uniting Americans after the shooting, Trump told “Fox & Friends” Friday he “couldn’t care less” about doing that.Advertisement
Other right-wing commentators were quick to call for revenge after Kirk’s assassination. Fox News host Jesse Waters, conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer and others called for a crackdown on the left, even before the identity of the suspect was known.RelatedDonald TrumpPoliticsCrimecharlie kirkseth moultonElizabeth Warren Slams Anti-Democrat Rhetoric In Wake Of Charlie Kirk's DeathGOP Lawmaker Calls Out Trump's 'Over The Top' Rhetoric After Charlie Kirk KillingGov.
