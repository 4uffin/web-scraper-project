When asked about uniting Americans after the shooting, Trump told “Fox & Friends” Friday he “couldn’t care less” about doing that.Advertisement
Other right-wing commentators were quick to call for revenge after Kirk’s assassination. Fox News host Jesse Waters, conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer and others called for a crackdown on the left, even before the identity of the suspect was known.RelatedDonald TrumpPoliticsCrimecharlie kirkseth moultonDemocratic Senator Warns Of Campaign To Crush Dissent In Wake Of Charlie Kirk’s DeathElizabeth Warren Slams Anti-Democrat Rhetoric In Wake Of Charlie Kirk's DeathTrump Keeps Blaming ‘The Left’ For Political Violence – After Stoking It For Years Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
