“It hit me hard this morning when I read that Bob was gone,” Fonda, who shared a six-decade friendship with the fellow Oscar winner, said in a statement to Entertainment Weekly and E! News. “I can’t stop crying. He meant a lot to me and was a beautiful person in every way.” The “Klute” star concluded her statement by urging people to keep Redford’s style of patriotism alive. “He stood for an America we have to keep fighting for,” Fonda said.Outside of his legendary acting and directing career, the “All the President’s Men” star was outspoken about his liberal political views and longstanding support for the Democratic Party. He was even awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by former President Barack Obama in 2016 in recognition of his decades of activism for environmentalism.Advertisement

He added that “our shared tolerance and respect for the truth, our sacred rule of law, our essential freedom of the press and our precious freedoms of speech — all have been threatened by a single man.”During the 2020 presidential campaign between former President Joe Biden and Trump, Redford endorsed Biden in an op-ed for CNN. In the piece, Redford wrote about how Trump was actively dividing the country.Redford and Fonda pose for a studio portrait for their 1967 film, “Barefoot in the Park.”Silver Screen Collection via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
“Instead of a moral compass in the Oval Office, there’s a moral vacuum,” Redford wrote. “Instead of a president who says we’re all in it together, we have a president who’s in it for himself. Instead of words that uplift and unite, we hear words that inflame and divide.” He added, “Four more years would accelerate our slide toward autocracy. It would be taken as a free license to punish more so-called ‘traitors’ and wage more petty vendettas—with the full weight of the Justice Department behind him.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The two were beloved for their chemistry and seemed to sincerely enjoy working with one another.“It’s easy,” Redford told Today in 2017 what it’s like working with Fonda. “We’ve done many films over the years so it just worked out that way, that there was not a lot of discussion, we didn’t have to talk about a lot. Things just kind of fell into place between us, and there wasn’t much more to think about.”Relatedjane fondapatriotismrobert redfordTrump Has Telling Reaction To Robert Redford's Death After The Actor Called Him 'Dictator-Like'Jane Fonda Shares What 'Woke' Means To Her During SAG AwardsSocial Media Flooded With Heartfelt Messages Following The Death Of Robert Redford Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
