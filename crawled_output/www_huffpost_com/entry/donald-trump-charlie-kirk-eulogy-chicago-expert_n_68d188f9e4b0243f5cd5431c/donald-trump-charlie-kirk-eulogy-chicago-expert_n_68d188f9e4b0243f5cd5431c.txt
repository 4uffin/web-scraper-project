A Christian Leader Has Thoughts.The president amplified his threats during his politicized speech at Kirk's memorial service. One religious leader weighs in on Trump's tribute.By Kimberley RichardsSenior Reporter, Life TrendsSep 22, 2025, 06:23 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGPresident Donald Trump unleashed several attacks against who he at times referred to as “radical left lunatics,” during his eulogy for Charlie Kirk at a memorial service on Sunday. And one Christian leader says he’s “deeply concerned.” The president was one of the many speakers who were in attendance at the service, which was held at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Kirk, an influential right-wing activist who founded conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10.Advertisement
In his 40-minute tribute for Kirk, Trump closed out the service by talking about the late activist’s journey in politics, their friendship, and the 31-year-old’s influence on energizing young conservatives on college campuses. But he did not miss the opportunity to attack his opponents, highlight his political goals and controversial tariff policies, and to make clear that he apparently has no intention of unifying the nation, as the country grapples with extreme divisiveness and attacks on free speech in the wake of Kirk’s killing. Trump said in his speech that he sometimes describes people on the left as “radical left lunatics.” He referenced ABC’s decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel’s late night show after the host criticized conservatives’ reactions to Kirk’s killing. The president mocked Kimmel, without saying his name, insisting that he “had no talent.” (On Monday, Disney announced that it was bringing “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” back on air.) While speaking about Kirk’s killing, Trump made claims, without evidence, about “networks of radical left lunatics” who “perpetuate political violence,” even though political violence affects both Democrats and Republicans.Advertisement
Trump also unapologetically said that he hates his opponents, and that he doesn’t want the best for them. Within minutes of his speech, he amplified his ongoing threats to send federal troops to Chicago amid his supposed mission to fight crime in the country’s third-largest city — even as violent crime rates overall in Chicago have fallen.He claimed that Kirk, who was raised in a suburb of Chicago, told him before he died: “Please sir, save Chicago.” “We’re going to do that, we’re going to save Chicago from horrible crime,” Trump told the crowd on Sunday, before he again later referenced plans to send troops to Chicago, saying his administration will do so while having “Charlie very much in mind.” Advertisement
As it relates to Trump unleashing threats at Kirk’s memorial service to send troops to Chicago, Rev. Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, president and CEO of Interfaith Alliance and an ordained Baptist minister, said: “Americans know that Donald Trump has a troubled relationship with the truth.”“The President dishonors all victims of political violence by suggesting he will take further authoritarian action that will surely divide and harm more communities,” he told HuffPost. (Raushenbush was formerly the executive editor for HuffPost’s Religion section.)Overall, Raushenbush emphasized that a memorial service should be a solemn affair — and that Trump “trampled on that solemnity” with his highly politicized speech.

“We desperately need leaders in American political life to bring us together to address political violence, not sow the seeds of yet more division,” he continued. Raushenbush said that the purpose of a eulogy is to honor the person who died, to celebrate their life and to bring comfort to those who are grieving their death.But Trump’s eulogy was bizarre. “Trump’s eulogy bizarrely staked out his opposition to Jesus’ mandate to love our enemies,” he said, adding that it’s “another example of how little he understands or cares about essential Christian teachings.” Advertisement
Raushenbush emphasized that political and religious leaders should be leading the country toward nonviolence.“As we rightly condemn all acts of political violence, we must also condemn all acts of political malice,” he said. “I’m deeply concerned about more violence in this country and it’s incumbent on all our political and religious leaders to do everything in our power to lead the country towards nonviolence and a democracy for and by all the people.”RelatedDonald Trumpchicagocharlie kirkEulogyDonald Trump Jr. Does A Chillingly Accurate Impression Of His Dad During Charlie Kirk Memorial SpeechTrump Proudly Separates Himself From Charlie Kirk As A Certified HaterTrump Promotes Hate At Kirk Memorial Ahead Of Traveling To UN General Assembly: Live UpdatesCharlie Kirk Lit The Path For Trumpism And A Far-Right America Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
