Writer Molly Wadzeck Kraus posed a question on X, formally known as Twitter, in August, asking adults what little things their parents did that made their childhood feel magical — things they still look back on now with “such fondness and clarity.” Lots of folks chimed in with their own stories. I saw a TikTok recently about little things parents did to make childhood magical. Things adults remember now with such fondness and clarity. I can’t find it again so I’m opening it up here. What’s something your parents did that brought magic to your childhood?— Molly Wadzeck Kraus (@MWadzeckKraus) August 23, 2024Advertisement
Psychotherapist Andrea Dorn, founder of Bloom Therapy and Wellness Center in Columbia, South Carolina, said these kinds of magical moments from childhood tend to be memorable because they “involve out-of-the-ordinary experiences that leave emotional imprints that go far beyond the event itself.”“They stand out because they often make a child feel a sense of significance and awe and allow them to feel seen, valued and loved in a way that ordinary, more routine experiences may not,” Dorn, author of the children’s book “Welcome to Therapy: a Mindful Introduction to Counseling for Kids,” told HuffPost.“Whether it’s a special tradition, an unexpected adventure, or a simple, heartfelt gesture, these moments stay with us because they evoke feelings of security, belonging and wonder, and these are emotions that positively shape our sense of self, our memory, and how we view the world,” she continued.

This X thread inspired us to ask the HuffPost audience to share the little magical moments created by the parents and caregivers in their lives. Read their sweet stories below: Responses have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.1. “My mom would set up our tent downstairs or create a ‘beach picnic’ in our living room during cold Minnesota winters when we couldn’t go on vacations to warm destinations.” — Karolyn S. 2. “My dad used to tell me he could stop the rain but only at certain points. We had two overpasses over the road to our neighborhood. When we went under the rain would ‘stop’ when he said it would.” — Sara A. Advertisement
3. “On the night of our birthdays growing up, before we went to bed, my mom would come lay in bed with each of us kids and tell us all about the events of the day we were born. What the weather was like, what song was playing in the delivery room, how excited she and my dad were to meet each of us. She tells us sentimental things and hilarious things. She remembers so many little details! I’m almost 46, and I still ask her every birthday to tell me about the morning I was born. Any time I hear Chuck Mangione’s song ‘Feels So Good,’ I know that was the moment my mom met me for the first time.” — Kate F.4. “When I lost a tooth, my mother would sprinkle baby powder on the bedside table so we could see the tooth fairy’s footsteps. Once I fell asleep, she would walk through the powder with her fingertips so it would look like tiny footsteps. I absolutely believed in the tooth fairy!” — Suzanne P. 5. “We lived in rural Wisconsin where the snow would pile up over winter. My mother would dig out forts with steps and benches or build walls with a plastic snow block maker. She would sculpt huge animals — I distinctly remember a turtle — and would also create sledding hills. She must have spent hours creating these wonderful play areas for my sisters and me.” — Kendra Q.Advertisement
6. “My dad said ‘yes’ to as many things as possible. He said you are only a kid once so let’s make the most of it. Yes to movies on weeknights, basketball in the park, yes to family drives on Sundays, yes to ice cream, friends coming over, concerts, going to all the games, etc.” — Rachael L.7. “We are from Minnesota where winters get very cold. We had electric blankets on our beds. My mom would put my pajamas under the blanket. So when I would go to bed, my pajamas and sheets were nice and warm.” — Mamie F.8. “Christmas! My parents made it magical, including candy canes on the fireplace, to gifts wrapped in all different colors and our stocking hung on our bedroom door knob. They certainly made it special!” — Suzanne C.Advertisement
9. “My mom told me that the moss that grew around one of the big trees in our yard was actually ‘fairy beds’ and fairies lived there. I would sit outside and try to find fairies for hours.” — Logan T.10. “My mom would wake me up in the middle of the night to play in the snow or to watch a meteor shower. She painted scenes on my walls and stars on my ceilings and scrawled book quotes on my door. She wrote me letters from fairies detailing their adventures in fairyland and asking me questions all about myself. She remains the most magical woman I know.” — Sara M. 11. “On Sundays, my dad and I would go to the matinee at the cinema to see cartoons. After that, we’d feed the ducks in a nearby park and then have a cheeseburger with a Coca-Cola. These things were not widely available in the ’70s, so they were a treat.” — Giedre D.Advertisement
12. “My mother let us play outside in the rain in our bathing suits and swim in the puddles as long as there was no lightning or thunder. I got so dirty and loved her for it.” — Sherrill L.13. “My grandmother would have me, my brother and my cousin up for a week’s vacation every year with her and my Grandpop. Sometimes at night we would get scared, and she would come in with ‘magic pixie dust’ and sprinkle it over us to put us to sleep. Worked every time. I still have a vial of her pixie dust at home.” — Jenna F. Image taken by Mayte Torres via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
The takeaway here: You don’t need to do anything particularly extravagant to make magic for a child. “In fact, magic can often be found in the small, intentional moments that break the routine in simple ways,” Dorn said. “It’s about being present and making your child feel truly seen.” Parents and caregivers should not feel pressure to create “perfect” moments, Dorn stressed.“The most magical experiences often arise spontaneously when you’re engaged and enjoying time together,” she said. “It’s less about perfection and more about showing up with love, curiosity and willingness to engage in whatever opportunities for ‘magic’ might come your way.” Advertisement
Making magic for a child isn’t always about doing something extra either — sometimes it’s about slowing down enough to notice the magic that’s already around us, Dorn said. And adults can benefit greatly from this, too. “As grown-ups, we often get caught up in the busyness of life and forget to experience that sense of wonder ourselves,” Dorn said. “By allowing yourself to engage in magical moments that present themselves, you not only create connection and lasting memories for your child, but you can also engage with the part of yourself that enjoyed these magical moments in your own childhood.” RelatedKidsthe good lifechildhood15 Reasons Parenting A Teen Is Actually Pretty GreatWhat Makes A 'Core Memory'?Feeling Guilty You Didn't Relish The Baby And Toddler Years?
