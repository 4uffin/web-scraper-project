Future you will thank you. And read on for promising reviews of Crest 3D Whitestrips.“My dentist stated that over the counter products are pretty much as effective as in-office products now. My fiance and I purchase these strips and saw immediate and significant differences in the color of both of our smiles. There were so many strips provided in this packet that both of us were able to use these to the point that we were both happy with our results and still had more left over to continue to use for maintenance in the future. So even though it might feel expensive, this pack could last the two of us for at least a year. […]” — AAndC (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review here.) “I got these bc my teeth were super stained from coffee and tea, and I was very self conscious of it, but literally after using just the 1 hour express ones that it comes with (it comes with 2 of them) I used one today and one 2 days ago, my teeth are GLOWING they aren’t yellow anymore and they are actually white for once, I was skeptical at first but these actually work Scarily well, they do make my teeth a little more sensitive right after using and that slowly fades over the next few hours.” — Donnie
“My bottom teeth are pretty crowded, and gnarly. I have a 4 tooth upper bridge where my front 2 teeth had been knocked out on a fall when I was 7. I wasn’t sure if these whitening strips would work on my teeth. I am on day 5 of using the using the strips, and I can tell already that my permanent teeth are lightening up! They look better now, than after a cleaning at my dentist! I have to kind of tuck the strips onto my bottom teeth, bc they are so crowded, but they work! I haven’t noticed any teeth sensitivity yet, buy my gums are a tad irritated from the strips. Nothing so troublesome that I would discontinue using them. I’m very happy with this purchase.” — MaRyan R. Looking for more dental upgrades? Check out these dental products that actual dentists can’t live without, as reported by HuffPost Shopping writer Erica Kam.1AmazonThe Oral-B iO Series 9 electric toothbrush (29% off)Dr. Bronwyn Hagan of New the York-based practice Fitzsimons & Hagan Dentistry recommends an electric toothbrush over a manual one and named the Oral-B iO Series 9 electric toothbrush as a favorite."My favorite feature of the iO toothbrushes is their ability to tell you whether you are brushing too hard, too soft, or just right," she says. "I was shocked by how hard I myself was brushing when I first started using it, and now I love seeing it light up green for 'just right.'" She adds that the Series 9 in particular lets you see on an app if you are covering all the surfaces of your teeth.The holy grail toothbrush with comes seven different cleaning modes, three extra brush head and a travel case. It's 29% off for a limited time.$199.99 at Amazon (regularly $279.95)2AmazonOr the Davids fluoride-free nano hydroxyapatite toothpasteFor folks who want a fluoride-free toothpaste option, Hagan's pick is this Davids nano hydroxyapatite toothpaste for sensitive teeth. It's naturally sourced, vegan, whitening and comes in two flavors: peppermint or orange vanilla.$9.95 at Amazon3AmazonA Cocofloss Cocobrush manual toothbrushEven though Hagan prefers that her patients use an electric toothbrush, she still has a suggestion for those who want a manual toothbrush. "Cocofloss has a wonderful, soft toothbrush," she says. "The bristles feel great on your gums."The Cocobrush has thousands of micro-bristles that are designed to be 75% finer than a standard toothbrush and an angled brush head to reach under the gum line. It comes in four colors.$9 at CocoflossAdvertisement
4AmazonCocofloss woven dental flossYou've probably heard this from your own dentist before, but you can't skip on floss — and yes, that means string floss. "Water flossing is great, but it does not replace traditional floss or floss picks," Hagan says. "That mechanical debridement of your teeth and gums is important."One of her favorites is this kid-friendly string floss from Cocofloss, which is also great for adults. "I love a good grippy floss," she says. "It is a little thicker, so it’s great at pulling out all that gunk, but the best part is all the flavors! My team and I love the strawberry, pineapple and watermelon flavors the most."$9.99 at Amazon5AmazonCrest cavity protection toothpaste"Look for a toothpaste that has an active ingredient like fluoride or nano hydroxyapatite, otherwise you might as well just brush with good old water," Hagan says. "I personally use toothpaste that contains fluoride, for its anti-cavity properties."She recommends this Crest cavity protection toothpaste, which contains fluoride. It has the ADA (American Dental Association) seal of acceptance, and with regular brushing, can help prevent cavities before they become an issue.3-pack: $5 at Walmart3-pack: $4.99 at Target6AmazonOr a pack of Colgate Extra Clean toothbrushesDr. Joke Alesh, a dentist in Rhode Island, previously told HuffPost she buys these seriously affordable Colgate toothbrushes in bulk for the convenience of changing her toothbrush every month. They're a great option, especially if you don't see yourself remembering to change the brush head on an electric toothbrush as often as you should."When it comes to tooth brushing, the most important thing to me is the bristles," Alesh said. "Flattened, worn bristles do not effectively displace plaque. I know I wouldn't change expensive or complicated brush heads as often."$4.44 at AmazonAdvertisement
7AmazonCariFree's anti-cavity oral maintenance rinseDr. Inna Chern, a dentist at New York General Dentistry in Manhattan, recommended this CariFree fluoride mouthwash in previous HuffPost Shopping coverage. "My practice uses the CariFree mouthwashes as they balance pH, help dry mouth and aid in balancing bacterial load/aiding in gingivitis prevention," she said. The rinse improves tooth sensitivity, is alcohol-free and contains xylitol to help with tooth remineralization and reduce plaque buildup. Get it in three flavor options.$17.99 at Amazon8AmazonThe Waterpik Sonic Fusion 2.0 combo water flosser and toothbrush"I recommend water flossers to certain patients, like those who have many implants or a lot of bone loss," says Hagan, who adds that she doesn't use water flossers herself very often because "I’m a busy mom and don’t have time to add yet another item into my morning and nightly routines."Still, there are options out there for those who want to add this step to their routine. "If my patient is really resistant to flossing and wants to try a water flosser, Waterpik has a really neat product that is a combination toothbrush and water flosser," Hagan says.She's talking about the Waterpik Sonic Fusion 2.0, which has three cleaning modes, two toothbrush speeds, a two-minute brushing timer and 10 pressure settings for the water flosser component. You can use it to brush, floss or do both at once by just pressing a button, making this a great option if you're in a similar boat as Hagan and may not always have the time to devote to this extra step.$178.97 at AmazonThe Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics.
