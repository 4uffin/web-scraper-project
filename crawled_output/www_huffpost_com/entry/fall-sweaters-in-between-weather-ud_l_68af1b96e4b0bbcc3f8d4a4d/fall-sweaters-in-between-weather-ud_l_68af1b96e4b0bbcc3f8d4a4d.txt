1AmazonAn essential cotton blend V-neck sweaterScore: 4.4 out of 5 stars; 24,217 ratings at AmazonThis classic-fitting V-neck sweater promises to be lightweight, comfortable and never bulky so it's perfect for a nearly fall climate. It's made from a cotton-modal blend, comes in 31 colors and sizes XS-6X.Promising review: "This turned out to be one of my favorite light weight sweaters. It’s prefect for cool fall evenings or worn layered with something else in the winter. I wear mine often times with a down vest during winter months. I have this same sweater in black also. I love that it’s a v-neck sweater. It’s not overly fitted which is my personal preference, not bulky either. It’s comfy and flattering and comes in a variety of colors so chances are I’ll get another one….or two. Washes very well, no noticeable shrinkage, and holds it shape." — Debra Kirby$11+ at Amazon2AmazonA J.Crew-lookalike cardigan that our editor swears byScore: 4.4 out of 5 stars; 14,384 ratings at AmazonShopping managing editor Emily Ruane is a big fan of this delicate-yet-functional Amazon cardigan that she said is a dead ringer for one popular J.Crew cardigan that's nearly double the cost (and completely sold out). Made from a lightweight cotton blend and available in over 25 colors, this classic button-up is sure to be your next favorite basic. Find it in sizes XS-6X.$15 at Amazon3AmazonA long layering cardiganScore: 4.4 out of 5 stars; 23,815 ratings at AmazonAnother Amazon essential basic is this open-front cardigan that's perfect for layering and a mid-thigh length. It's made from a cotton-modal blend, comes in 20 colors and sizes XS-6X. Reviewers note that this is especially ideal for traveling.Promising review: "I wanted something I can cram into my personal item for the plane. You know how after 30 minutes being herded like cattle, it's 95 F in the jetway? You sit on the tarmac for the obligatory 45 minutes and the flight attendants are about to pass out in their polyester uniforms, so as soon as your flight is clear to take off the air handler comes on and suddenly you could store popsicles in economy class? This is the garment you want on hand... It's well sewn and drapes gracefully should you wish to conceal something like a passport wallet on a string or a well-trained chihuahua. It comes down a bit past your hips and gives the vague impression of a blazer. I think the weave is dense enough to pin a brooch or an ID tag onto without destroying it... I'm off to buy another one while they're on sale. If you're a traveler who gets cold, or just want something a bit more stylish than a sweatshirt to keep you warm, get one of these." — Aunt Mary [Note: This review has been edited for length.

I wear them a lot and they are the most quality pieces of clothing in current wardrobe. Thick fabric, not as long as they appear in photos." — CoffeeFreakz$29 at AmazonAdvertisement

7QuinceA cashmere boyfriend cardiganScore: 4.8 out of 5 stars; 2,595 reviews at QuinceReferred to by Quince as the "boyfriend cardigan," this relaxed-fit button-up is knit from the brand's signature and supremely soft Mongolian cashmere and features a fisherman rib detailing. You can find it in eight colors and sizes XS-XL.Promising review: "I’ve had this cardigan for a few months now and it is one of the coziest cardigans I own. It is def an investment and I was second guessing keeping it but I’ve worn my money’s worth at this point. I wear it both at work and lounging around the house pretty regularly. This cardigan is oversized already so I could have sized down but ended up just keeping my normal size. It’s a nice capsule piece and it does pill over time so have a fabric shaver handy." — Kat$140 at QuinceRelatedshoppingFashionStylefallsweatersRun To Amazon For An Affordable Take On This Classic Luxury SweaterWe Found The Perfect Under-$35 Travel Cardigan At Target11 Tools To Keep Your Cashmere And Wool Looking Fresh All Winter LongGenuinely Stylish Cardigans From Amazon That Won’t Cost A Fortune Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
