But the show returned Tuesday, drawing a massive 6.3 million viewers to the broadcast and more online. The comeback didn’t sit well with Barr — whose revival of her own show was canceled in 2018 after she posted a racist remark about former Obama White House adviser Valerie Jarrett on social media.Advertisement
“I got my whole life ruined, no forgiveness, and all of my work stolen and called a racist for time and eternity, for racially misgendering someone,” Barr told NewsNation in a Tuesday interview ahead of Kimmel’s return to late night television. “It just shows how they think. It’s a double standard.”The return of late night host Jimmy Kimmel (left) to ABC has angered actor Roseanne Barr.Getty ImagesDuring the interview, Barr was asked what she anticipated he might say during his comeback. “I think he’ll cheer himself on,” she said.She went on to mock the size of Kimmel’s fan base, claiming that all “2,000” of his supporters would “feel heartened ... like they won another battle against Trump and the people of the United States.” Barr added that viewers would likely see Kimmel’s returns as a “big celebration” and predicted the host would “double down” — viewing it as a “victory.”Advertisement
Barr said that after her own controversy made headlines, she was “erased from history.”Barr said she was "erased from history" after she made a racist remark on social media about former Obama White House adviser Valerie Jarrett in 2018.Steven Ferdman via Getty ImagesShe then claimed this situation would have “never happened” to Kimmel if he had “defended” her when she was in the hot seat. The comedian went on to praise Nexstar for its decision to not air Kimmel on its affiliate stations even after the show’s return.
