Evans and Njera PerkinsSep 14, 2025, 07:00 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTSeth Rogen in "The Studio" and Tramell Tillman in "Severance."Apple TV+The 2025 Emmy Awards honored the best of television in its annual ceremony, with comedian Nate Bargatze as a first-time host for the show on Sunday night.Apple TV+’s “Severance,” which became one of the most talked-about dramas earlier this year, picked up a few awards. Tramell Tillman, who stars as Mr. Milchick on the psychological drama, made history with his win: He became the first Black actor to win Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama. “Severance” star Britt Lower won Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama.Advertisement
It was a big night for the first-season series at the ceremony.HBO Max’s “The Pitt” nabbed several big awards: Noah Wyle won his first Emmy for his role as Dr. Robby; he was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama for five consecutive seasons in the hit medical drama “ER.” Katherine LaNasa was also awarded her first Emmy after a star turn as nurse Dana Evans in “The Pitt.” The medical drama also garnered the top award for Outstanding Drama Series and dedicated it to healthcare workers.The ceremony was dominated by wins for “The Studio,” Apple TV+’s hit freshman comedy. The comedy set a new record by nabbing the most comedy wins in one ceremony, including Outstanding Comedy Series. Seth Rogen, who starred in and co-created the series, picked up several statuettes at the ceremony, including Outstanding Lead Actor in A Drama and Outstanding Writing For A Drama Series (along with his co-creator Evan Goldberg).“Adolescence” nearly swept the awards show in the categories for Outstanding Limited Series/Anthology or Movie. Owen Cooper, who had a remarkable turn in Netflix’s limited series “Adolescence,” became the youngest male winner in an acting category after winning Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Anthology for his role as Jamie Miller, a 13-year-old who is arrested for the murder of a young girl at his school. Actors Stephen Graham and Erin Doherty and director Philip Barantini also nabbed awards for the limited series.Advertisement
HuffPost blogged the Emmy Awards on Sunday night. See all the moments you might have missed below.Sep 14, 2025, 8:53 PM EDTNjera PerkinsKevin Winter via Getty ImagesHannah Einbinder Finally Wins Her First Emmy For Her Role In ‘Hacks’Finally, after four seasons of being nominated, Hannah Einbinder won her first Emmy for her role as Ava Daniels on “Hacks.” Crazy that it took so long, but this award was long deserved. Aside from Deborah (and Megan Stalter’s Kayla), Ava is the comedic heart of the show and it’s about time she got recognized. I’m also happy that Einbinder went over the 45-second time limit to not only soak in her moment, but also slip in “fuck ICE” and “Free Palestine” mentions before she left the stage. She made this win count.
