Evans and Njera PerkinsSep 14, 2025, 07:00 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTSeth Rogen in "The Studio" and Tramell Tillman in "Severance."Apple TV+The 2025 Emmy Awards honored the best of television in its annual ceremony, with comedian Nate Bargatze as a first-time host for the show on Sunday night.Apple TV+’s “Severance,” which became one of the most talked-about dramas earlier this year, picked up a few awards. Tramell Tillman, who stars as Mr. Milchick on the psychological drama, made history with his win: He became the first Black actor to win Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama. “Severance” star Britt Lower won Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama.Advertisement
It was a big night for the first-season series at the ceremony.HBO Max’s “The Pitt” nabbed several big awards: Noah Wyle won his first Emmy for his role as Dr. Robby; he was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama for five consecutive seasons in the hit medical drama “ER.” Katherine LaNasa was also awarded her first Emmy after a star turn as nurse Dana Evans in “The Pitt.” The medical drama also garnered the top award for Outstanding Drama Series and dedicated it to healthcare workers.The ceremony was dominated by wins for “The Studio,” Apple TV+’s hit freshman comedy. The comedy set a new record by nabbing the most comedy wins in one ceremony, including Outstanding Comedy Series. Seth Rogen, who starred in and co-created the series, picked up several statuettes at the ceremony, including Outstanding Lead Actor in A Drama and Outstanding Writing For A Drama Series (along with his co-creator Evan Goldberg).“Adolescence” nearly swept the awards show in the categories for Outstanding Limited Series/Anthology or Movie. Owen Cooper, who had a remarkable turn in Netflix’s limited series “Adolescence,” became the youngest male winner in an acting category after winning Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Anthology for his role as Jamie Miller, a 13-year-old who is arrested for the murder of a young girl at his school. Actors Stephen Graham and Erin Doherty and director Philip Barantini also nabbed awards for the limited series.Advertisement
HuffPost blogged the Emmy Awards on Sunday night. See all the moments you might have missed below.Sep 14, 2025, 11:31 PM EDTNjera Perkins and Erin E. EvansFXFinally, The Emmys Decide That ‘The Bear’ Is Not FunnyAfter years of us shouting about “The Bear” committing category fraud, it seems Emmys voters have finally listened. For the first time in what feels like forever, the FX kitchen series didn’t dominate the comedy categories Sunday night. In fact, quite the opposite happened, as “The Studio” and “Hacks” divvied up the awards, and rightfully so. In the end, “The Bear” ended up missing out on all 13 of its nominations, including Outstanding Comedy Series.I can’t say I’m not thrilled about the outcome. Don’t get me wrong, I love “The Bear,” but perhaps this sweep by “The Studio” tonight will teach the show to start submitting for a more appropriate category moving forward, aka drama, where it belongs! I will say it does suck that the “Napkins” episode, directed by Ayo Edebiri, lost because that was a brilliant episode of television. And considering that “The Bear” actually dialed up the comedy this most recent season, it’ll be interesting to see where it gets nominated next year. Either way, a lesson was learned tonight. — NjeraWhat I've also had to remind myself is that this Emmy season, it was Season 3 that was up for nominations. It was an overall lackluster season — aside from that "Napkins" episode that Edebiri directed. Season 4 fared way better in my book, so there's always next year. Here's hoping that FX and the show's creators and producers decide to put it up for the Drama categories. PLEASE, chef! — ErinAdvertisement
Sep 14, 2025, 11:24 PM EDTErin E. EvansAlan Cumming Has Perfect Answer For Who Should Be On ‘The Traitors’Alan Cumming has won a couple Emmy Awards for his incredible hosting gig on the hit reality series “The Traitors.” He gives the most snappy directions and snide commentary throughout the riveting series. But it’s his answer to a question about casting on “The Traitors” that particularly takes the cake.“I’m sure our president would be good on the show. We have a lot of chaos and turmoil and treachery, so maybe he’d like to come and be paid for that,” he told reporters in the press room for the Emmy Awards. He quickly moved on to the next question."Hacks" star Hannah Einbinder also alluded to the chaos in the country; she said "f**k ICE" in her acceptance speech for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy.Alan Cumming floats his dream addition to "The Traitors": "I'm sure our president would be good on the show.

Sep 14, 2025, 11:23 PM EDTNjera PerkinsHBO‘The Pitt’ Wins Emmy For Outstanding Drama SeriesThe way I shouted in my living room once “The Pitt” was announced! I’ve recommended this show to everyone I know because everything about it is amazing, from the writing to the acting to the fantastic ensemble cast. This is one of the few dramas that sincerely captivated audiences this year, so I’m so happy “The Pitt” took this home.Advertisement
Sep 14, 2025, 11:16 PM EDTNjera PerkinsAllen J. Schaben via Getty Images‘The Studio’ Wins Emmy For Outstanding Comedy Series“The Studio” just extended its historic Emmy-winning streak with the biggest comedy win of the night. With the instant success of the show, it’s no surprise that the Apple TV+ series won for Outstanding Comedy Series, even with contenders like “Hacks,” “Abbott Elementary,” “Shrinking” and others. Lucky for all of us, another season is on the way, and hopefully, it’s just as captivating as its debut.On Sunday, "The Studio" won 13 Emmys and broke the record for most wins for a comedy series in one night.It had already broken the record — set by "Ted Lasso" in 2021 — for most Emmy nominations for a freshman comedy, with 23 nominations.Advertisement
Sep 14, 2025, 11:11 PM EDTErin E. EvansVALERIE MACON via Getty Images‘The Late Show With Stephen Colbert’ Wins Outstanding Talk Series“The Late Show” was probably one of the most anticipated wins of the night, considering all the drama surrounding Stephen Colbert’s shocking cancellation. The late night host was gracious in accepting his award — his first win in the talk series category — and dedicated part of his speech to the late night genre, more specifically to the direction of his show over the last 10 years, which he said he set out to make about love.“I don’t know if I ever figured that out, but at a certain point, I realized that in some ways we were doing a late night comedy show about loss,” Colbert shared. “And that’s related to love, because sometimes you only truly know how much you love something when you get a sense that you might be losing it.”“Ten years later, in September 2025, my friends, I have never loved my country more desperately,” he added, in reference to his show ending. “God bless America. Stay strong, be brave, and if the elevator tries to bring you down, go crazy and punch a higher floor.”Advertisement

Sep 14, 2025, 11:00 PM EDTErin E. Evans and Njera Perkinsvia Associated PressNoah Wyle Wins His First Emmy After Decades In Hollywood For Hit Series 'The Pitt'Noah Wyle, who portrays Dr. Robby on the hit HBO series "The Pitt," has just won the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama.This is Wyle's first Emmy after being nominated several times for Outstanding Supporting Actor for another medical drama, "ER." I'm so happy for this win! Wyle is an incredible actor. — ErinNoah Wyle’s Emmy win has been such a long time coming! He earned several Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series back in the ‘90s for “ER,” but this win marks his first-ever, and as the lead of his hit medical drama. This is the best full-circle moment he could’ve asked for. And, of course, he shouted out health care workers clocking in tonight during his acceptance speech. He so deserves this! — NjeraAdvertisement
Sep 14, 2025, 10:15 PM EDTNjera PerkinsKevin Winter via Getty Images‘Last Week Tonight With John Oliver’ Wins Outstanding Writing For A Variety SeriesFor the 10th year in a row, “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” won for Outstanding Writing For a Variety Series. Daniel O'Brien, senior writer on the show, celebrated the win and fellow nominees onstage, saying how honored he is to share the category with “all writers of late night political comedy while that is still a type of show that’s allowed to exist.”The subtle dig comes after the cancellation of CBS’ “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” and looming concerns over the fate of late night TV as the Trump administration continues to target media. Many have speculated that Colbert’s cancellation was due to him criticizing a settlement between Trump and CBS’ parent company, Paramount Global. Colbert himself referenced the axing of his show earlier at the Emmys when he joked about looking for a new job once his show concludes next year.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post misstated the number of years in a row "Last Week Tonight" won the award.

But a Beyoncé Emmy win would’ve been so much more fun. Or another one for Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show — then again, we probably would’ve just gotten more tired Drake jokes from that.

Bravo. The writing team won for "The Studio" episode "The Promotion."Like I said before, “The Studio” may very well sweep for comedy tonight. It’s already broken the record for most awarded comedy at the Emmys ever. I haven’t seen this much buzz over a new comedy since the breakout days of “Abbott Elementary,” so it is certainly on a roll.

That style decision made by Philip Barantini helped him clinch this win for one of the most talked-about shows of the year. “Adolescence” is still up for the Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series category.Advertisement

It makes sense that Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg won this award. They really captured lightning in a bottle with their show. I wouldn’t be surprised if they swept the rest of these comedy categories tonight.Advertisement

When Hannah Einbinder finally nabs her first Emmy for her role? Einbinder told E! host Heather McMahan that the HBO Max series will end with its next season. “We’re going to start [filming] next week, and knowing it’s the last season is really bittersweet,” Einbinder said on the Emmys red carpet. “But I think it’s right, you know? It’s nice to do something as many times as it should be done. Not overstay your welcome. Rip it and do it and laugh and cry.”I’ll be crying next year on that finale for sure.
