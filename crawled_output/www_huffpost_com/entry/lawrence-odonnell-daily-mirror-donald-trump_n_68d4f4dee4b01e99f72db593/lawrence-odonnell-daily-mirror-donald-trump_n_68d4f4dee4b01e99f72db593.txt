In one subheadline, the tabloid described Trump as the “world’s most powerful man-baby,” a brutal description that O’Donnell went on to use to taunt the president with again and again during his monologue.It also summarized Trump’s wild address: “Trump rants to UN about climate, migrants, Gaza, Sadiq’s ‘sharia London,’ escalators, marble floors and teleprompters…”Watch here:Advertisement
The Mirror has used its cover to rip Trump on multiple occasions, notably asking of Americans following his 2024 election win over Democratic rival Kamala Harris: “WHAT HAVE THEY DONE… AGAIN?”When Trump fell out with onetime “first buddy” Elon Musk, the newspaper described the feud as “BABIES AT WAR.” It also shredded a Trump 2024 diatribe as “Deluded. Deranged. Dangerous.”RelatedDonald TrumpLawrence O'DonnellDaily MirrorEric Trump’s Wild Tale Of Watching His Father Stop A War Raises EyebrowsTrump’s Biden White House Troll Spirals Into Awkward Epstein FlashbackRobert De Niro Goes Into Full Mafia Mode In Brutal Kimmel FCC SpoofLawrence O’Donnell Shows Exact Moment Trump Was ‘Humiliated’ By 2 People At Once Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
