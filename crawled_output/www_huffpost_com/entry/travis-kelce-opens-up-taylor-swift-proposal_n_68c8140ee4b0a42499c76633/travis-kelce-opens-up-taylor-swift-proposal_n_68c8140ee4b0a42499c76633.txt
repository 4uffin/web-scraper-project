He said he gets “giddy” saying the word and, when asked what advice he’d give to those looking to pop the question to their partner, stressed that “you’ve got to know your” significant other.“You can’t let how somebody else does it make you feel like you need to do it that way,” he said. “Know your partner, know who you’re doing it for, and do it for the right reasons, baby. Everything else will be beautiful.”RelatedTaylor Swift Travis Kelceproposalscelebrity engagementsFox SportsStephen Colbert Turns Emmy Win Into A Love Letter To AmericaEmmys Appears To Slip In Subtle Dig At Sydney Sweeney Moments Before She Goes OnstageJohn Oliver Curses Out Emmys Host Over His Speech Time Limit Scheme💍 Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Are Engaged: See The Post That Melted Down The Internet Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
