Experts reveal the secrets to why it worked.By Monica TorresSenior Reporter, Work/LifeSep 23, 2025, 01:54 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGTerry was once the biggest “Disney adult,” she said. Terry is a Las Vegas cake decorator who customizes Mickey Mouse ears to fund her Disney theme park vacations, and has made the global entertainment brand part of her marriage.“My wedding was a Disney cruise wedding. I have four tattoos, they are all Disney. My wedding ring has Mickey Mouse on it,” said Terry, who asked not to share her full name for privacy. “There is not a single room, including the bathroom, that does not include Disney in some way, shape or form.“Advertisement
But Disney’s decision to suspend late night TV host Jimmy Kimmel after lobbying from FCC commissioner Brendan Carr has ended Terry’s lifelong support for the brand.Last week, Disney’s leadership indefinitely suspended ABC’s late night program “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” following Kimmel’s remarks on conservatives’ reactions to right-wing activist Charlie Kirk’s death. Carr denies threatening to revoke anyone’s broadcasting licenses if they didn’t deal with Kimmel, but for many Disney fans, the damage is done. Terry said Disney’s response to Carr’s involvement was why she canceled her Disney+ online subscription. Advertisement
“It was Disney obeying in advance,” she said. “Disney is so big and so powerful and has so much money, they’re one of the only people that can fight this. And they didn’t. They chose not to. That says a lot.” Terry joins a growing movement of people across America who canceled their Disney and Disney-owned platforms like ESPN and Hulu subscriptions to protest what critics say is Disney caving on free speech. Since Kimmel was pulled off air, online searches on how to cancel Disney+ subscriptions have spiked as the company’s stock fell. Some people say they have even canceled their upcoming Disney vacations. Terry, for one, says she has no plans to go to a Disney theme park or buy tickets for a new Disney movie ever again, even though this decision is “painful.”Did this immense public pressure work? Just five days after Kimmel’s suspension, Disney announced that “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” will go live once more. In a statement, Disney said Kimmel’s remarks were “ill-timed,” but the company had decided to return the show to air on Tuesday following “thoughtful conversations” with Kimmel. Advertisement
Why This Disney Cancel Movement Shows The Power Of Collective Dissatisfaction Illustration: HuffPost; Photos: GettyConsumer boycotts don't always work, but this one led to an action many Disney fans wanted. It might be because Disney was experiencing significant public pressure. For a boycott to be successful, a targeted company needs to notice the boycott’s reputational and financial damage, said Koen Pauwels, a professor of marketing at Northeastern University. He cited the 2018 National Rifle Association boycott that had Delta and Enterprise ending their partnerships with the NRA, and the 1950s Montgomery bus boycott as two historic examples.And in this case, “Disney clearly noticed, as many stars joined the boycott,” Pauwels said. Major Hollywood guilds for writers and actors protested the suspension outside Disney-owned studios. In a signed letter with the American Civil Liberties Union protesting Kimmel being pulled off air, 400 of the biggest celebrities in Hollywood called out Disney’s decision, including Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Even actors starring in Disney-distributed shows like Tatiana Maslany urged people to cancel their subscriptions to Disney services.Advertisement
Disney did not answer HuffPost questions about how many Disney+ subscribers have cancelled since Kimmel’s suspension. But in Terry’s view, what people who are not celebrities did mattered too. Disney saw “the [subscription cancellation] numbers, and it was big enough to scare them, which is good,” Terry suggested about Kimmel’s reinstatement, which she called a “push in the right direction.“For a boycott to be successful, there also needs to be a specific action the targeted company can take to lift it, Pauwels said.

Unlike the one-day “economic blackout” to avoid nonessential shopping from earlier this year, “the demand was specific and feasible for Disney to execute: put Jimmy Kimmel back on air,” Pauwels explained. “That does not mean it was easy to decide, but at least it gave the impression that doing so would alleviate the damage.”Maclyn Clouse, a finance professor at the University of Denver’s Reiman School of Finance, said he doesn’t think the Disney+ subscription numbers mattered as much as the fact that ending Kimmel’s suspension could “put out the fire now.”“It was an easy way for Disney to get out of it. They can say, ‘Look, we suspended him for a few days. We’ve talked with him a lot. We think he’s going to settle down a bit, and all of you people can resubscribe and redo your vacation plans if you canceled, and we’ll be back to normal,’” Clouse said. Advertisement
Where A Disney Boycott Goes Next For some Disney fans, it’s grown bigger than Kimmel. That, too, is normal. Pauwels said many past successful boycotts have also continued to hurt the company’s reputation and profits, even after the boycott officially ends. Despite Kimmel’s reinstatement and her love for Disney’s shows and parks, Terry still won’t pay to support Disney just yet. “It’s not about Kimmel, it’s about the actions that were taken because of Kimmel,” she said.Pauwels said that whether a brand recovers after a boycott depends on if they can show that they are authentically learning from public feedback.

To that end, Terry said she would invite Disney leadership to watch the company’s movies like “A Bug’s Life.” “You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up. Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one,” the grasshopper antagonist in the movie warns.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
