No ICE agents were hurt in the incident.Advertisement
In the aftermath, President Donald Trump blamed the attack on “radical left terrorists,” while Vice President JD Vance attributed the violence to “a violent left-wing extremist” who was “politically motivated to go after law enforcement.”The president and vice president’s comments prompted Collins to ask about White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller describing the Democratic Party as a “domestic extremist organization” last month.While Noem wouldn’t outright agree with Miller, she did call Democrats’ positions “extreme.”Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, here on Aug. 22, chose her words carefully while briefing CNN's Kaitlan Collins about a Wednesday attack on an ICE detention center in Dallas.Chip Somodevilla via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
“Well, we certainly have seen Democrats out there take extreme positions and support radical criminal organizations,” the former governor of South Dakota told Collins, claiming Democratic politicians have shown “support of terrorists such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua.”When Collins pressed for an answer, Noem swerved again, telling her, “I would love to see these Democrats denounce these criminals.”TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

Asked for a yes or no answer, the secretary refused to budge.“Their views are extreme and they don’t align with the American people at all,” she said.RelatedDemocratic PartyCNNextremismKristi Noemimmigration and customs enforcementU.S. Citizens Caught Up In ICE Raid That Kristi Noem Bragged About On Social Media: Reports1 Detainee Killed And 2 Others Critically Injured In Dallas ICE Facility, Homeland Security SaysActing ICE Director On Dallas Shooting Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
