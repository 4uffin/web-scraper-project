“He did not hate his opponents; he wanted the best for them,” he said of Kirk. “That’s where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent, and I don’t want the best for them. I’m sorry. I am sorry, Erika.”Trump, at the memorial, says where he disagrees with Charlie Kirk in that he hates his opponent and doesn’t want the best for them pic.twitter.com/fVk0V6GqWT— philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) September 21, 2025Trump also used his remarks to tout a slew of political goals and cited Kirk’s purported support of them prior to his death.

In one instance, he previewed an announcement he’ll make tomorrow about autism, which Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly pushed misinformation about as a condition to be cured.“[Charlie] would have been front-row center. We’ll be missing him tomorrow,” Trump said. In another instance, he spoke about how Kirk was from the suburbs of Chicago and described his backing for plans to allegedly address crime in the city, even as local lawmakers have vocally opposed this effort.“One of the last things he said to me is, ‘Please sir, save Chicago,’ We’re going to do that. We’re going to save Chicago from horrible crime,” Trump said. Advertisement
Trump went on to reiterate his attacks on “the left” while touting the inquiries his administration is making into liberal organizations in the wake of Kirk’s killing. “The Department of Justice is also investigating networks of radical left maniacs who fund, organize, fuel and perpetrate political violence, and we think we know who many of them are, but law enforcement can only be the beginning of our response to Charlie’s murder,” Trump said, despite authorities not sharing any evidence thus far linking Kirk’s shooting to left-leaning groups.
