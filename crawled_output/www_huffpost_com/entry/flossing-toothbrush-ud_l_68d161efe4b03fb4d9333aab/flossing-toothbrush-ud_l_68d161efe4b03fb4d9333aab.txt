It truly feels like I had just gone to the dentist and they deep cleaned my teeth themselves."By Haley ZovickianStaff Writer, HuffPostSep 23, 2025, 07:00 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTAmazonThe Dr. Plotkas Mouthwatchers flossing toothbrushes from Amazon.2-Pack: $10 at Amazon“I can’t shut up about this toothbrush,” writes a reviewer named Susanna, who took the words out of my mouth.Advertisement
The toothbrush in question? The Mouthwatchers flossing brush. Reviewers can’t believe they’re waxing eloquent about a manual toothbrush, and I can’t either. But this isn’t your run-of-the-mill dental product.Designed by Boston-based dentist Dr. Ronald Plotka, the brush’s genius lies in its top layer of extra-thin bristles, 10 times thinner than typical bristles. This feature helps clean deeper, yet gently, into grooves and gums. The result is a super-clean, “like leaving the dentist clean” feeling after every go-round — so much so that reviewers, to their surprise, are getting excited about brushing their teeth and describing the toothbrush as “magic.” Same here. I’d been eying this brush for months, putting off trying it due to my intense dislike of spending money. Once I finally did, I wished I’d done so sooner.Advertisement
2-Pack: $10 at AmazonAmazonThe Dr. Plotka's Mouthwatchers toothbrushes have a super-thin top layer of bristles that emulate flossing.Rarely does an item elicit an actual wow from me. Yet, as a reviewer named Christie writes, “Here we are.” Advertisement
Within about a week of switching from a regular brush to this one, my previously coffee-stained teeth looked markedly whiter, my plaque was less visible and my gums looked healthier.My mouth also feels remarkably cleaner, a result that reviewers echo. I can’t help but feel that this model is toothbrushing the way it should be.One reviewer named Cole sums it up nicely: “Ever since I started using Dr. Plotkas I simply cannot tolerate another brand of toothbrush ... I recently traveled and did not switch out my travel brush with this product. I felt like I was brushing my teeth with rubber spikes. It was the longest week ever.”Advertisement
2-Pack: $10 at AmazonReviewers’ families are a little taken aback by this fervor (as may be my editor, whom I’ve pestered about this life-changing toothbrush for longer than I’m proud of). But no matter: It’s only a matter of time before everyone else becomes stalwarts, too, reviewers say. “I have converted everyone in my family,” writes Cole, and another person says they plan to gift the brushes to family members “so they’ll stop looking at me like I’m a little bit off for talking about my toothbrush.”It’s a clear new staple for me, and more than worth the extra few dollars.Grab a two-pack of the flossing toothbrushes to try for yourself. Still thinking? More reviews below:“I’ve tried various types of toothbrushes over the years, both electric and manual and this brush is by far the best! It does feel bigger in my mouth than most others, BUTTT it cleans SOOO well! Dare I say better than any electric brush I’ve ever tried. My teeth feel like I’ve just had a professional cleaning!” — amanda.park“Ok, I never leave reviews, but this one is worth it. I almost returned these toothbrushes before using them solely based on the fact that they don’t look very special. My name-brand toothbrush looks fancier. But I read the reviews again and decided to keep them. To my surprise, this is the best toothbrush I’ve ever used. I have severe plaque issues and had a dentist appointment a few weeks ago, so I’m trying to keep my teeth as clean as possible. I use special toothpaste, special mouthwash, and brush and floss twice a day. I’ve tried every toothbrush under the sun. Seriously, I will be ordering these frequently, as the bristles, clean my teeth so well and are gentle on my very sensitive gums. My partner even commented how clean his teeth felt after the first brush. So, there ya go. That’s my honest review of an ugly, yet highly-effective toothbrush that I’ll be purchasing again very soon. Cheers!” — Shaye“This cleans so well yet is gentle enough for my older lightly receding gums. The bristles are very fine and cleans between teeth a bit. Don’t know how deep so I’m continuing to use my floss. It’s got a good bigger rubberized grip which makes this comfortable to hold. Does not slip. My gums love the brush too! I don’t travel much but if needed can slip it into a plastic travel case. I’ll be stocking up on these!” — Babs“I never thought I would write a review for a toothbrush, but this is the best toothbrush I have ever bought. It feels sturdy and yet so soft and makes my teeth feel so clean. I will definitely buy more!” — Katie McPhetersWant to see some other hygiene products that real dentists recommend? Keep scrolling to read shopping writer Erica Kam’s recent roundup of tooth products that professionals vouch for. 1AmazonThe Oral-B iO Series 9 electric toothbrushDr. Bronwyn Hagan of New the York-based practice Fitzsimons & Hagan Dentistry recommends an electric toothbrush over a manual one and named the Oral-B iO Series 9 electric toothbrush as a favorite."My favorite feature of the iO toothbrushes is their ability to tell you whether you are brushing too hard, too soft, or just right," she says. "I was shocked by how hard I myself was brushing when I first started using it, and now I love seeing it light up green for 'just right.'" She adds that the Series 9 in particular lets you see on an app if you are covering all the surfaces of your teeth.The holy grail toothbrush with comes seven different cleaning modes, three extra brush head and a travel case.$300 at Amazon2AmazonLumineux teeth whitening stripsHagan also recommends these Lumineux whitening strips for people with sensitive teeth. They're non-toxic and peroxide-free, instead using natural ingredients like coconut oil and Dead Sea salt. The box comes with seven treatments that work in much the same way as the Crest strips: Apply them for 30 minutes once a day for four days, and then once a week after that or as directed by your dentist.$23 at Amazon3AmazonOr the Davids fluoride-free nano hydroxyapatite toothpasteFor folks who want a fluoride-free toothpaste option, Hagan's pick is this Davids nano hydroxyapatite toothpaste for sensitive teeth. It's naturally sourced, vegan, whitening and comes in two flavors: peppermint or orange vanilla.$10 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonA Crest 3D Whitestrips teeth whitening kitIf brushing alone isn't giving you the white smile you want, Hagan named the Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects Plus teeth whitening strip kit — a HuffPost reader favorite — as one of the "great at-home options for whitening." She mentioned it's especially good for folks who have never whitened their teeth before. The kit comes with 24 treatments that you can apply daily for 45 minutes to an hour before peeling them off. The brand claims they can remove over 25 years of stubborn stains, leaving you with a brighter, whiter smile.$50 at AmazonAdvertisement
5AmazonA Cocofloss Cocobrush manual toothbrushEven though Hagan prefers that her patients use an electric toothbrush, she still has a suggestion for those who want a manual toothbrush. "Cocofloss has a wonderful, soft toothbrush," she says. "The bristles feel great on your gums."The Cocobrush has thousands of micro-bristles that are designed to be 75% finer than a standard toothbrush and an angled brush head to reach under the gum line. It comes in four colors.$10 at Cocofloss6AmazonCocofloss woven dental flossYou've probably heard this from your own dentist before, but you can't skip on floss — and yes, that means string floss. "Water flossing is great, but it does not replace traditional floss or floss picks," Hagan says. "That mechanical debridement of your teeth and gums is important."One of her favorites is this kid-friendly string floss from Cocofloss, which is also great for adults. "I love a good grippy floss," she says. "It is a little thicker, so it’s great at pulling out all that gunk, but the best part is all the flavors! My team and I love the strawberry, pineapple and watermelon flavors the most."$10 at AmazonAdvertisement
7AmazonCrest cavity protection toothpaste"Look for a toothpaste that has an active ingredient like fluoride or nano hydroxyapatite, otherwise you might as well just brush with good old water," Hagan says. "I personally use toothpaste that contains fluoride, for its anti-cavity properties."She recommends this Crest cavity protection toothpaste, which contains fluoride. It has the ADA (American Dental Association) seal of acceptance, and with regular brushing, can help prevent cavities before they become an issue.3-pack: $5 at Walmart3-pack: $5 at Target8AmazonOr a pack of Colgate Extra Clean toothbrushesDr. Joke Alesh, a dentist in Rhode Island, previously told HuffPost she buys these seriously affordable Colgate toothbrushes in bulk for the convenience of changing her toothbrush every month. They're a great option, especially if you don't see yourself remembering to change the brush head on an electric toothbrush as often as you should."When it comes to tooth brushing, the most important thing to me is the bristles," Alesh said. "Flattened, worn bristles do not effectively displace plaque. I know I wouldn't change expensive or complicated brush heads as often."$4 at Amazon9AmazonCariFree's anti-cavity oral maintenance rinseDr. Inna Chern, a dentist at New York General Dentistry in Manhattan, recommended this CariFree fluoride mouthwash in previous HuffPost Shopping coverage. "My practice uses the CariFree mouthwashes as they balance pH, help dry mouth and aid in balancing bacterial load/aiding in gingivitis prevention," she said. The rinse improves tooth sensitivity, is alcohol-free and contains xylitol to help with tooth remineralization and reduce plaque buildup. Get it in three flavor options.$18 at AmazonAdvertisement
10AmazonThe Waterpik Sonic Fusion 2.0 combo water flosser and toothbrush"I recommend water flossers to certain patients, like those who have many implants or a lot of bone loss," says Hagan, who adds that she doesn't use water flossers herself very often because "I’m a busy mom and don’t have time to add yet another item into my morning and nightly routines."Still, there are options out there for those who want to add this step to their routine. "If my patient is really resistant to flossing and wants to try a water flosser, Waterpik has a really neat product that is a combination toothbrush and water flosser," Hagan says.She's talking about the Waterpik Sonic Fusion 2.0, which has three cleaning modes, two toothbrush speeds, a two-minute brushing timer and 10 pressure settings for the water flosser component. You can use it to brush, floss or do both at once by just pressing a button, making this a great option if you're in a similar boat as Hagan and may not always have the time to devote to this extra step.$179 at AmazonRelatedshoppingDental HealthbathroomPersonal CareI Track Sales For A Living And These Are The Prime Day Deals You Need To Know AboutI'm A Frugal Shopping Writer.
