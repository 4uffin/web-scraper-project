Cuomo mocked Democrats for pointing to data from the Anti-Defamation League to make their point. An analysis from the nonprofit states that the “great majority of extremist-related murders” in recent years have been “connected to some form of right-wing extremism.”“‘There is no statistical evidence that the left is anywhere near as violent in politics. The ADL, everybody’ — that’s your argument?!” Cuomo said derisively. “Right after Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck by a guy who thought he was standing up for his trans lover? He just shot him in the neck!” Kirk was fatally shot Sept. 10 while speaking to students in Utah. According to prosecutors, the 22-year-old suspected shooter was in a romantic relationship with his roommate, whom they called a “biological male.” Yet the suspect’s political affiliations are not clear. According to police, he sent texts to his roommate describing having had “enough of [Kirk’s] hatred.” Advertisement
Chris Cuomo told Democrats to "change the game" to get back in power.John Lamparski via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration’s increased attacks on the left following Kirk’s assassination have sparked concern, even among some Republicans, that Trump and his allies are trying to weaponize outrage over the killing to silence political opponents. Cuomo predicted that a change will soon be coming and warned Democrats not to “become what you oppose.” Advertisement
“Change the game. Don’t let the game change you,” he said. “Don’t become what you oppose. There is going to be a change in what this country wants and expects from its leaders, and it’s coming soon, and it is not going to be to the benefit of who is in power now.” “You’re going to make the case that it’s all about the right? How stupid do you have to be? It’s not about stupidity. It’s about convenience,” Cuomo said. “You’re so desperate for clickbait. You’re so desperate to be relevant, to be in the mix, that you say whatever is going to get you the clicks. Change the game.”TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
