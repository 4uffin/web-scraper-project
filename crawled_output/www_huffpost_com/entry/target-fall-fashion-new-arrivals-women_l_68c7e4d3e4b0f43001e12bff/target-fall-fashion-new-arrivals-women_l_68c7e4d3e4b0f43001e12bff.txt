And just as I was unable to resist the siren song of the holiday toy catalogues that would start showing up en masse every October, I now find myself powerless against the allure of new fall fashion.As both an in-store and online regular at Target, it’s been hard to ignore their seasonal selections, and I’ve spotted some excellent picks in my frequent visits to the store. They range from reliable basics to classic pieces with an on-trend twist, with more than a few items that could easily be mistaken for pieces from much higher-end brands.Advertisement
In true Target form, everything is also beyond reasonably priced — which is why it’s important to act fast, because we suspect steals like these will be hard to keep in stock. To save time, I’ve compiled my list of top must-haves below. So get to it, before it’s too late!1RetailerA staple sweater: A New Day slim fit cozy knit sweaterYou can never have too many classic-fit crew neck sweaters — and since these are just $25 a pop, you can definitely stock up. They’re soft with a hint of stretch and come in five different colors, including a quintessentially fall camel and a sleek cream-and-black stripe. Shoppers note they have a tendency to pill, but it’s nothing a little fabric shaver can’t handle. Get in sizes XS-4X.$25 at Target2RetailerA summer-to-fall sweater dress: Universal Thread women’s ribbed sweater dressAs far as I’m concerned, a sleeveless sweater dress is appropriate only during the summer-to-fall transition, when it’s hot enough to go bare-shouldered during daylight hours, but still brisk enough at times that a chunky knit, no matter how minimally cut, won’t leave you soaked in sweat. That time is now, and this is the dress.$32 at Target3RetailerAn adorable pair of Mary Janes: Universal Thread velvet ballet flatsUnless you look closely, you’d be hard-pressed to spot the differences between these Universal Thread flats and a trendy Flabelus pair. They both have a soft, velvet-touch upper with a coordinating trim, adjustable strap, flattering almond toe, and durable rubber outsole. Unlike the designer version, the Target pair also has a memory foam insole — and a price tag that’ll save you more than $100. Get these in whole and half sizes 5.5-12.$40 at TargetAdvertisement
4RetailerA denim top with a romantic twist: Universal Thread poet button-down shirtA denim button shirt is perfect for fall, but also a bit predictable. This one stands out from the crowd, thanks to a collarless banded neckline, voluminous sleeves, and gathered cuffs that give a truly poetic flare. It’s the perfect accompaniment to some hot cider and a walk through fall leaves. Get in sizes XS-4X.$35 at TargetAdvertisement
5RetailerA mixed-media fleece: All In Motion bomber jacketThe high-pile knit, pieced synthetic patch detailing, and zippered chest pocket on this All In Motion fleece are definite callbacks to The Northface’s classic Denali jacket — except this one has more moderny, boxy cut and quilted zipper placket that gives this sportswear piece a definite streetwear vibe. Get this one in sizes XS-XXL.$45 at Target6RetailerA transitional cardigan: Wild Fable elbow sleeve crew neck cardiganThis cardigan, made from a cotton-poly blend, has a slightly cropped, slightly boxy fit, and breezy elbow-length sleeves that give it a T-shirt-esque quality. It’s perfect for early fall, when you’re simply aching for sweater weather but still dealing with the occasional lingering summer temp. Get in sizes XXS-4X.$30 at TargetAdvertisement
7RetailerAn statuesque wrap skirt: A New Day wrap column skirtThe wrap on this just-short-of-maxi-length skirt is elegant enough for the office, but also cut to show just a little bit of leg for some after-hours or weekend wear. The subtle A-line shape and wide elastic waistband also offer across-the-board appeal. Get this sleek staple in sizes XS-4X.$35 at Target8RetailerA romantic, designer-looking henley: Universal Thread button down shirtThe smocked front and back yokes and beautifully drapey slub texture give this otherwise simple button shirt some major Dôen vibes for a mere fraction of the price. Buy both colors (black and white) in sizes XS-XXL, but note that this one is selling fast and sizing is limited in the white pictured here.$30 at Target9RetailerPull-on pants in an subtly on-trend shape: Universal Thread mid-rise barrel leg The of-the-moment barrel cut on these cotton-blend pants is actually very subdued — they straddle the line between straight and wide leg, but with a flatteringly subtle tapered ankle — so you can count on wearing them well after the trend has passed. They’re non-stretch so they hold their shape, and have a forgiving elastic waistband. They’re also quite similar to this Anthropologie pair, except you can get four for the price of one. Get these in sizes XS-4X.$35 at TargetAdvertisement
10RetailerA designer-style suede tote: Universal Thread slouchy faux suede handbagThere are lots of big name brands offering fortune cookie-shaped hobo totes just like this one. Unfortunately, those big names are all but guaranteed to come with even bigger price points. This unstructured, oversized tote gets the job done, with hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars to spare.$35 at Target11RetailerSporty pants with universal appeal: All In Motion high rise wide leg pantsThese Lululemon-esque pants, available in sizes XS-XXL, fit the bill whether you’re working out, hanging out, or heading out (of town — they’re perfect in-flight attire). They’re super stretchy, moisture-wicking and quick drying, and have a flattering high waist and full, wide leg. They’re also already very popular (close to 300 5-star reviews), so act fast.$32 at Target12RetailerA casual canvas topper with a touch of attitude: Wild Fable canvas utility jacketThis fall-weight jacket is equal parts feminine (especially in pink) and tough, with a slightly cropped cut and shiny-lined hood combined with utility-style patch pockets and bomber-style cinching at the hem and cuffs. Carhartt makes a similar style, which is fine, if you want something more expensive and less cute…$45 at TargetAdvertisement
13RetailerA dramatically different trench: A New Day faux suede trenchThe classic cotton gabardine is quintessentially fall – but why go with just quintessential when there’s also something this eye-catching? This revamp from A New Day has all the trappings of your standard trench — double-breasted button front, notched color, vented back and storm flap, waist-cinching belt — plus richly colored faux suede for an altogether head-turning effect (especially in this luscious sapphire blue). It's available in sizes XS-4X.$55 at Target14RetailerStraight-leg pants with a bit of stretch: A New Day high-rise cropped pantsIf Everlane’s utility straight leg pants and dream pants had a baby, A New Day’s high-rise cropped pants would be it. Made of stretchy and soft yet substantial Ponte di Roma fabric, they have a straight leg that flares slightly at the ankle. But taller customers take note: The 25½” inseam is definitely on the short side, so they might be slightly too cropped for some. Get these in sizes 0-16.$40 at Target15RetailerAnother straight-let pair, but for longer legs: Universal Thread utility pantsAnother seemingly Everlane-inspired pair, these zero-stretch cotton/lyocell pants have a very flatteringly structured straight leg and cargo-cut front pockets that look sleek instead of bulky. They also have a 31-inch inseam, which is perfect for tall shoppers who don’t want to look like they’re preparing for a flood. Get them in sizes 0-30 and in four colors.$40 at TargetAdvertisement
