“On the night Charlie was shot, a 4.1 earthquake struck Utah. In scripture, 40 represents trials; 41 signifies a shift. It hit at 5:57 local time, 7:57 Eastern,” the post read. “Acts 7:57 describes Stephen, the first martyr, stoned as the crowd silenced his truth. The Bible says the earth trembles when God is angry. That night, as a voice was silenced, the ground groaned.”Karoline Leavitt had a one-word reaction to the post.InstagramA 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck near Vernal, Utah, about 150 miles from Orem, where the conservative activist was gunned down earlier in the day.Advertisement
Charlie Kirk was speaking at Utah Valley University when he was fatally shot in the neck. Karoline Leavitt shared a scripture-filled post that attempted to connect an earthquake to God's anger over the murder.The Salt Lake Tribune via Getty ImagesLeavitt, a devout Catholic, has advanced spiritual assertions for other violent events as well.She shared a post attributing the shooting of children at a Minneapolis church in August to a “demonic force.”“There is a demonic force moving when a transgender maniac sprays bullets at pews of Catholic school children,” a conservative lifestyle magazine wrote. “Shame on the progressive leaders and lawmakers who make this about the man in the White House, the second amendment or so-called trans bigotry.”Advertisement
Leavitt said in March she believed in “spiritual warfare” that manifested when Trump was grazed by a bullet at a campaign rally in 2024.“I think there were certainly evil forces, and I think that the president was saved by the grace of God on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, and he’s in this moment for a reason,” Leavitt told The Christian Broadcasting Network.PowerOurJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour membership fuels reporting that informs, inspires, and holds power accountable.
