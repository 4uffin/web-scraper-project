Kimmel, who was suspended last week over comments about the suspect in the Charlie Kirk assassination, spoke directly to the Trump supporters who want him off the air permanently because of his constant jokes about the president.

“I talk about Trump more than anything because he’s a bully. I don’t like bullies,” Kimmel said. “I played the clarinet in high school, OK? So I just don’t like him.”But he didn’t stop there. Just one day after Trump threatened ABC for allowing him back on the air, Kimmel got very specific on just what kind of bully he sees the president as. “Donald Trump is an old-fashioned ’80s-movie-style bully, taking your lunch money ― and if you give it to him once, he’ll take it again,” he said. “Two things he loves, lunch and money.”Advertisement
Kimmel continued:“He will take that peanut butter and jelly sandwich your mom cut in half like a triangle for you. He will gobble it up in front of your face, and then he’ll eat your little Ziploc bag of Oreos, too. And he’ll take the note your mother put in your lunchbox and he’ll read it aloud to everyone. ‘Oh, look! Mommy woves her widdle boy.’ And then he’ll smile with a bunch of cookies in his teeth.And he’ll grab you by your nipples, and he’ll twist them until you have two holes in your Le Tigre shirt ― because your parents couldn’t afford an Izod ― and he’ll stuff you in a locker and he’ll stomp on your Trapper Keeper and slam the door.”“This is Donald Trump,” he said. “He does it to everyone.” He compared rooting for Trump to rooting for the bully Biff Tannen in “Back To The Future,” noting that the character was actually based on Trump.“And this is who people are cheering for?” Kimmel said. “I don’t know about you, I’m with Marty McFly.” Advertisement
Trump has frequently attacked late night hosts for making jokes about him, and during his first term, reportedly tried to have Kimmel censored. He attacked all of the hosts ― most frequently Kimmel ― during rants on the campaign trail last year, and over the summer celebrated the news that “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert had been canceled, then warned that the others would be next. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
