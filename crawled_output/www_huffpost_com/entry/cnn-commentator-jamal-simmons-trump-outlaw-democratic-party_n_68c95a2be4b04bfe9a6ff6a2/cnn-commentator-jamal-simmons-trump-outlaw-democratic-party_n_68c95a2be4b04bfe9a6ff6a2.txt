Collins noted Monday that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said he wished “more” Democrats had joined Sunday’s vigil for Kirk in Washington, D.C.“I don’t think that we should interpret giving people time to grieve for Charlie Kirk with saying people ought to be supportive of Charlie Kirk,” said Simmons, noting that people can express their “vehement disagreement” with Kirk’s beliefs “in whatever way they want to.”He noted that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller vowed to punish “left-wing organizations” whose nebulous “domestic terror movement” supposedly contributed to Kirk’s killing, however, after Trump said unnamed groups are “already under investigation.”Advertisement
“So the question arises in my mind, is the president of the United States going to outlaw the Democratic Party?” said Simmons. “Is that where we’re headed? Is the president of the United States going to unleash the Justice Department on the Democratic Party?”Asked if this is actually a reasonable concern, Simmons replied, “It’s absolutely a concern.”He continued, “The president has shown that he’s willing to use the Department of Justice to go after his political enemies … And now his deputy chief of staff, who’s really the policy director at the White House, is calling the Democratic Party an extremist organization.” Advertisement
While a suspect in last week’s shooting at Utah Valley University has been captured, a motive remains unclear. A conservative chorus has nonetheless blamed Democrats and media, with Miller vowing to “channel all of that anger” at a vague, predetermined enemy.“That raises very real questions about a two-party democratic system in this country, even though obviously we’re all concerned about all the big issues the president raises, like crime and terrorism and those things,” Simmons told Collins.PowerOurJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour membership fuels reporting that informs, inspires, and holds power accountable.
