When I went to reach into my toiletry bag for my prescription steroid cream, designated for such emergencies, I realized I had forgotten it in my medicine cabinet all the way on the other side of the country. After rummaging in my friend’s bathroom drawers, desperate for a solution, I found the Avène Cicalfate+ restorative protective cream, a French treatment lotion that I would eventually find out has a hearty reputation for helping those with the most troubled and sensitive skin. $26 at Amazon$26 at Dermstore$28 at TargetAdvertisement
Immediately upon its application, the Avène cream felt soothing on the unbearably itchy and burning patches on my fingers and hands, which were already starting to develop those red, scaly patches and raised bumps consistent with my atopic dermatitis. I even applied it around my lips, which were more chapped than usual from the harsh New York winds. With the urge to itch magically alleviated, I knew that my skin might have an opportunity to heal, and at the very least, not get worse.I continued to apply the richly-textured cream throughout the week, noticing that my eczema was improving and my skin was significantly more hydrated than before I started using it. But for as thick as the cream went on initially, it didn’t dry down to be overly greasy on the skin. Rather, it felt like a welcome layer of comfortable protection, and I was able to still use my hands normally. Advertising itself as a restorative barrier cream, it makes sense that the Avène Cicalfate acts as a shielding and isolating layer to compromised skin. And, according to the brand, the formula also works by improving the conditions that are optimal for damaged skin to recover by employing protein-rich postbiotics and a copper-zinc-sulfate complex.

AmazonThe Avène Cicalfate+ Restorative Protective Cream has 45 skin care uses in one product. Gently enough even for babies, this cream also features Avéne’s signature thermal spring water inclusion, a skin-softening ingredient used across all the brand’s products that promises to calm and treat skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, acne, rosacea and others. After doing a bit more research, it was validating to see that others who had similarly chronic cases of skin irritation found the Avène Cicalfate to be equally effective as I did, with some Amazon customers going so far as to call it a “holy grail” for dry, irritated skin and “THE skin care product.”Advertisement
“This stuff has saved my skin. Currently trying to get through a Retin-A purge without my skin barrier falling apart, and this has helped so much. My skin no longer feels hot and itchy and new breakouts have stopped,” one Amazon reviewer wrote.Another reviewer surfaced the cream’s potential for making skin look younger.“My skin is hydrated, DEEP forehead wrinkles are minimized, and my rosacea is the most tame that it’s ever been,” they wrote. “After one week, I’ve tossed out creams from Beekman, F.A.B., and Biossance because this humble cream outperforms them all.”While the Avène Cicalfate is cheaper than the above-mentioned creams, $26 a tube is still a considerable expenditure for cream, but its potential uses number an astonishing 45, which makes this a truly versatile product for the price of one formula. Use it to treat razor burn, diaper rash, scrapes, post-surgical scarring and much more. Advertisement
See all the ways others have used this cream down below, or grab a tube for yourself to have in case of your next skin flare-up or breakout. $26 at Amazon$26 at Dermstore$28 at TargetPromising Amazon reviews:“I’ve been using this for close to a year and it is amazing for my super sensitive and dry skin. I have perioral dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and rosacea and live in Minnesota with bitter cold and the heater running over half the year. Cicalfate cream doesn’t flare any of these and it helps reduce redness and completely resolves dry skin. I use about a pea size amount AM and PM,, apply to dry skin, massage in, then mist with the Avene thermal water spray. Although the cream is thick, the slight white cast absorbs within a few minutes. I do not wear foundation so I don’t know how this affects it.it doesn’t burn my eyes and I’m a contact lens wearer. A big tube of cream lasts me the better part of a year.” — LA and BM“Friends, this is THE skincare product! This is like superfood for your skin. My skin is hydrated, DEEP forehead wrinkles are minimized, and my rosacea is the most tame that it’s ever been. It’s a little heavy so I use it as my night cream. After one week, I’ve tossed out creams from Beekman, F.A.B., and Biossance because this humble cream outperforms them all. I have combo skin with very few blemishes or breakouts, for reference.User note: shake the bottle before using it. The water does separate but you can mix it back up in your hand.” — Amanda Zimmerman“I was doing a little research to find affordable great moisturizer to use with trentonin. It’s a holy grail! I was using skin ceuticals triple lipids and it’s fabulous but very expensive. This product feels so good being absorbed into the skin. Drys great with no greasy feel. I could feel a difference in just one application. I can’t wait to see how well it continues to hydrate my skin. It’s great for sensitive skin and soothes dry irritated skin from retinoids! Be aware a lil product goes a long way! Don’t overthink this product it’s worth the hype! Just buy it!” — SGR“This stuff has saved my skin. Currently trying to get through a Retin-A purge without my skin barrier falling apart, and this has helped so much. My skin no longer feels hot and itchy and new breakouts have stopped. It does have a greasiness to it. However, because it is much less thick than other occlusive moisturizers, applying a mattifying bb cream on top (Ive been using tart) during the day will make it look like any other weightless moisturizer underneath. However, unlike the lighter daytime moisturizers I was using (e.g. cereve AM) I never feel that itchy tightness mid-day as long as I apply this in the morning.” — Ashley Fisher$26 at Amazon$26 at Dermstore$28 at TargetTo learn more about all of the products I use to keep my eczema at bay and how I use them, read on to a collection from previous HuffPost coverage. 1AmazonA healing hand creamTrue to its brand name, this hand lotion is actually like gold to me. I have countless tubes of it lying around the apartment, in the car and in my purse because it does such an incredible job of instantly calming eczema-related irritation and extreme dryness. Unlike other severe-dryness-formula hand creams that feel like a sensory nightmare on my skin, Gold Bond's healing hand cream soaks perfectly into the skin without leaving behind any kind of greasy finish. And like the claim on the tube, it genuinely does last through hand-washing and acts as a kind of undetectable moisture seal. It's enriched with seven intensive moisturizers, three vitamins essential to skin barrier health and aloe, a welcome ingredient for soothing inflammation.$4 at Amazon$5 at Target2AmazonA quick-relief colloidal oatmeal treatmentEarlier this year, I had the opportunity to try Murad's recent line of eczema-targeted products, and this was one standout product from the collection that I continued to buy after my original tube was empty. According to Murad, this fast-acting treatment features a formulation that was inspired by steroid creams. It boasts a high concentration of 5% colloidal oatmeal to ward off irritation and extend the time between flare-ups.For the greatest effectiveness, I like to use this the second I start to feel the familiar beginnings of an itch or irritation, which means I can prevent a rash from reaching its full potential. I found the texture to be comforting, cooling and not sticky like topical steroid creams that just sit on the skin. Because it sinks in so well, I had no problem layering this underneath other products like hand creams, Aquaphor or even makeup, something that I wouldn't normally be able to do without experiencing pilling or separation.$48 at Amazon$36 at Murad3SephoraA soothing hypochlorous acid skin sprayWhile it's true that Tower 28's SOS Daily Rescue Spray is marketed as a facial product, I've found it incredibly helpful for dramatically calming the skin on my hands, arms and other areas that become affected by eczema outbreaks. In fact, the first time I spritzed this on my skin, I was immediately asking myself what kind of redness-reducing magic did it contain? Well, it turns out it's an ingredient that, up until that point, I'd never heard of called hypochlorous acid, an acid naturally produced by our body's immune system that can instantly soothe stressed-out skin. This pH-balancing mist is reportedly great for acne and rosacea, too, and can even help support the skin's natural barrier, something that becomes severely compromised during an eczema outbreak. I use this every morning and night between my skin care products to help trap in moisture and optimize absorption, as well as use regularly on my hands whenever I feel a flare-up coming along and before applying a steroid cream or Murad's colloidal oatmeal treatment.$12+ at Amazon$12+ at Sephora$12+ at Tower 28 BeautyAdvertisement
4AmazonA healing ointmentWhen I was first prescribed topical steroids for eczema many years ago, my dermatologist suggested I always follow up with a layer of an occlusive product such as Vaseline or Aquaphor. Much like the "slugging" trend that Vaseline and similar formulas have become synonymous with, my dermatologist explained that doing this would help prevent moisture loss and help seal in the active ingredients underneath. To this day, I still follow this technique whether I'm using a steroid product or Murad's colloidal oatmeal treatment, because I've found it can really help to maximize the impact of the product that I'm using. This is especially beneficial when trying to limit my use of a steroid. I prefer using Aquaphor, a petroleum-based product that also contains glycerin, provitamin B and lanolin for added hydration and nourishment.$13 at Amazon$17 at Target$13 at Walmart5AmazonA pair of moisturizing gel-lined glovesOne of the most essential products in my eczema-relief kit is a pair of gel-lined washable gloves like these, which are also infused with nourishing ingredients like jojoba seed oil, olive oil and vitamin E. I used them nearly every night to help seal in moisture and products while also preventing any Aquaphor or hand creams from getting on my sheets. I also prefer gel-lined gloves over most standard cotton versions because they don't snag on cracked or flaking skin, they won't absorb product and I feel like they do a better job of keeping my skin hydrated.$15 at Amazon6AmazonA shea butter-based African black soapFinding the right soap for my hands or body that won't trigger or exacerbate irritation has been a notorious uphill battle, but about five years ago, I stumbled upon this bar of soap at my local pharmacy and it's been a bathroom staple of mine ever since. This cleansing bar has a base of shea butter, a welcome ingredient for eczema-related skin care because it not only deeply moisturizes, but it also soothes and offers anti-inflammatory benefits. The formula also contains calming aloe and oat, along with hydrocotyle asiatica, a homeopathic ingredient that can help relieve itching, flaking and rash-like skin.$6 at Amazon$6 at Walmart$7 at TargetAdvertisement
7AmazonAn anti-scaling coal tar treatmentArguably one of the strangest products I've tried in the name of eczema relief, MG217 is a thick Vaseline-like ointment that features an extra-strength formulation of 2% coal tar. Apparently, topical coal tar is one of the oldest remedies for atopic dermatitis (another term for eczema) and other inflammatory skin conditions such as psoriasis due to its ability to reduce scaling, flaking, redness and irritation of the skin, while also imparting some antibacterial benefits. This medicated formula is additionally fortified with vitamins A, D and E, all of which can also help to improve the skin's compromised barrier and reduce flakiness. I typically use MG217 once a month or whenever my eczema becomes more severe, and only at night. I use it completely on its own and not in conjunction with any other products and after applying a liberal layer, I always pop on either my gel-lined gloves or just a pair of reusable cotton gloves since this product does stain sheets and clothing. Warning: This product smells exactly like the inside of an auto repair shop. However, I do notice a fairly significant reduction in irritation and flaking after I use it, so it makes it all worth it, in my opinion.$14 at Amazon8AmazonA sensitive skin-friendly laundry detergentVery early on in my eczema "career," I learned that the kind of laundry detergent I use does matter when it comes to potential skin irritation. Ultra-fragranced and heavily dyed formulas have always made my itching and redness worse, or in some cases, have even been to blame for instigating a flare-up. A couple of years ago, I started using this Arm & Hammer dye-free liquid laundry soap based on the recommendation of board-certified dermatologist Dr. Julie Russak. This sensitive skin-friendly formula is hypoallergenic, free from any potential skin irritants and is compatible with all washing machines and temperatures.$12 at Amazon$14 at Target$14 at WalmartRelatedshoppingskincareEczemaThis ‘Holy Grail’ French Moisturizer Deeply Hydrates Wrinkles — And It’s 30% OffPeople With Stubborn Skin Issues Say This Balm Brings Real ReliefThis $8 Collagen Treatment 'Deserves 6 Stars' For What It Does For Super Thin Hair Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
