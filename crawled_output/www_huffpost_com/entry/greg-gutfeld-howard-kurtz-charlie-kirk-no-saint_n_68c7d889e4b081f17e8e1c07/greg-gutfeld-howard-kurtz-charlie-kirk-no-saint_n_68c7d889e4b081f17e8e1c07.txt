She noted there is “violent extremism” on both the right and left but claimed that violence on the left has been disproportionately under-reported.Advertisement
“I’m glad you mentioned it’s not unique to one side or one party,” Kurtz replied. “Charlie Kirk was not a saint. He said two years ago it’s worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so we can have the Second Amendment, but his murder makes this feel like a very dangerous time.”As the comment spread on social media in a video clip, Gutfeld chimed in with a dig at Kurtz’s new status at Fox News. His show is now off the air after 12 years, but he will remain with the conservative channel as a political media analyst.Advertisement
Gutfeld, who hosts his own show on Fox News, wrote on X: “Maybe we can tune in next week for a clarification....oh wait...”maybe we can tune in next week for a clarification....oh wait... https://t.co/4zBNWiCgG4— GregGutfeld (@greggutfeld) September 14, 2025PowerOurJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour membership fuels reporting that informs, inspires, and holds power accountable.

But some media figures and others who were critical of Kirk or perceived to not properly mourn his death have paid the price in job loss and online abuse.Advertisement
