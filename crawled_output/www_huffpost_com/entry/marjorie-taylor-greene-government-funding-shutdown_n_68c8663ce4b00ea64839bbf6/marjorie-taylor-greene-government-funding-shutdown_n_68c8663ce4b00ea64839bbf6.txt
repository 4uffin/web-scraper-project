Maybe this time will be different?By Arthur DelaneySenior Reporter, HuffPost and Igor BobicSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPostSep 15, 2025, 04:33 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGWASHINGTON ― In what has become an all too familiar play for attention on Capitol Hill, several House Republicans signaled Monday they’d vote against a GOP plan to fund the government ahead of an October deadline, threatening their party’s leverage against Democrats in the coming showdown over spending.Reps. Thomas Massie (Ky.), Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), Warren Davidson (Ohio) and Victoria Spartz (Ind.) all said they would oppose a so-called “continuing resolution” to fund the government at current levels while lawmakers work on a more detailed plan for federal agencies.Advertisement
House Republicans routinely threaten to vote against their own party’s high-priority legislation only to reverse their positions and fold under pressure from President Donald Trump. Spartz, in particular, has been one of the worst offenders, issuing ultimatums that she often walks back. With every lawmaker present, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) can lose only two Republican votes in the House and still pass legislation without help from Democrats.Republican leaders appear to be hoping for a replay of the government funding fight from March, when House Republicans passed a funding bill with no Democratic support and jammed Senate Democrats, forcing them to keep the government running with no concessions. Johnson told reporters Monday that he’s also hoping to add extra funds for lawmakers’ security to the bill in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which has sparked fears in Congress about members’ safety.Johnson’s plan hinges on Republican holdouts once again abandoning their demands for fiscal conservatism, as they did in March. It was the first time House Republicans had approved government funding without Democratic votes in years. Only Massie voted no. Advertisement
House conservatives, with Massie as the sole exception, have become known for folding. During the drafting of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act over the summer, for example, House hardliners insisted they would vote no at every stage of the process, making grandiose statements about the horrible amount of deficit spending envisioned by the legislation, only to wimp out like clockwork during late-night roll calls. It’s not clear if the same dynamic will play out this time. Greene, one of Trump’s biggest boosters on Capitol Hill, has said for months she would oppose a continuing resolution, or CR, for funding the government beyond September. She said Monday continuing government funding at current levels would essentially continue policies enacted under President Joe Biden ― even though Republicans passed massive funding increases for immigration enforcement and the military this summer. “I can’t wait to see how voting for the CR becomes a Trump loyalty test,” Greene wrote on X. “When in all actual reality, it’s a disloyalty to him by passing a Biden policy laden omnibus.”Advertisement
Greene will get a chance to prove her loyalty soon. Shortly after she and her other two GOP colleagues announced their opposition to the bill, Trump urged all Republicans to support it, keeping the government funded until Nov. 20.“In times like these, Republicans have to stick TOGETHER to fight back against the Radical Left Democrat demands,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Democrats have called on Republicans to join them in bipartisan talks, warning that the GOP will be at fault if the government shuts down without them. They’ve also said that they can’t support a bill that doesn’t include key health care provisions. Some Democratic lawmakers want to roll back Trump’s historic cuts to Medicaid and extend expanded tax credits for people who get their insurance through the Affordable Care Act ― both provisions that top Republicans have called a nonstarter.Advertisement
Democratic leaders haven’t gone as far in their demands, though they’ve also named the issue of health care in general as a starting point for negotiations. “We’re totally united. The Republicans have to come to meet with us in a true bipartisan negotiation to satisfy the American people’s needs on health care. Or they won’t get our votes,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said after a meeting with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) last week. Schumer also told The Associated Press that “things have changed” since he allowed a similar GOP bill funding the government through the Senate in March. During that spending fight, Schumer first said Democrats would filibuster the bill but then allowed it to proceed on the grounds that a shutdown would give Trump even more power to lay waste to federal agencies.

Now, Schumer argues the effects of a shutdown wouldn’t necessarily be worse because of how the Trump administration has already dismantled federal programs and agencies. “It will get worse with or without it, because Trump is lawless,” Schumer told the news organization. If Republicans can muster enough votes to pass the short-term funding bill in the House, they’ll need at least seven Senate Democrats to join them to break a filibuster and get it to Trump’s desk. Already, Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) has suggested he will vote to keep the government open, chiding members of his party who are making demands over government funding. It’s not clear yet if enough of his colleagues will join him.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
