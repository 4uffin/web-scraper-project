Josh Shapiro (D) on Thursday called out President Donald Trump for blaming Charlie Kirk’s killing on the rhetoric of the “radical left,” noting that his response “missed the mark.”In an interview with ABC News Live, Shapiro said Trump should have spoken out against political violence coming from all sides.Advertisement
