TMZ wrote that a family member revealed Johnson “had been recently struggling with mental health issues and the possible effects of CTE that he could not overcome.”Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a brain condition caused by repeated head trauma. A study last year found that about one third of NFL alums believe they have CTE, though it can only be officially diagnosed in death.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
