Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has asserted that free speech — even if it’s “evil and bigoted and wrong” — is protected under the First Amendment of the constitution amid controversy over the assassination of right-wing political activist Charlie Kirk.While speaking at Politico’s AI & Tech Summit in Washington on Tuesday, Cruz said that the First Amendment “absolutely protects hate speech” before declaring that the people who cheered for the death of Kirk are not “immune from the consequences.” Advertisement
“The First Amendment absolutely protects speech. It absolutely protects hate speech,” Cruz said. “It protects vile speech. It protects horrible speech.” Cruz continued, “What does that mean? It means you cannot be prosecuted for speech, even if it is evil and bigoted and wrong.”Cruz went on to condemn the “people on the left” who have been celebrating Kirk’s death. “We have seen, as you noted, across the country, people on the left — not everybody, but far too many people — celebrating Charlie Kirk’s murder,” he said. “We’ve seen teachers in high schools and elementary schools posting online, celebrating. We’ve seen university professors posting. In my view, they should absolutely face the consequences for celebrating murder.”Advertisement
Cruz then pointed to an example of a university student who dresses up in a Ku Klux Klan outfit to incite the killing of Black people. “Under the First Amendment, you cannot be prosecuted for that, so you will not go to jail for doing that,” he explained. “But you know what? You absolutely can be expelled for that, and you should be.”Cruz’s comments came after dozens of disparaging social media posts about Kirk’s death have sparked discourse online, resulting in multiple businesses and other organizations axing employees who publicly mocked or made negative remarks about Kirk.

“We have seen ... far too many people celebrating Charlie Kirk’s murder,” Ted Cruz said. “In my view, they should absolutely face the consequences for celebrating murder.”Getty ImagesCruz called the “naming and shaming” of Americans engaging in hate speech a “part of a functioning and vibrant democracy.” Kirk was shot while speaking with students at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. Tyler Robinson, the alleged 22-year-old shooter, was charged with aggravated murder on Tuesday. Robinson was also charged with felony discharge of a firearm and obstructing justice. Advertisement
Meanwhile, Attorney General Pam Bondi faced scrutiny after she said during Monday’s episode of “The Katie Miller Podcast” that the Justice Department “will absolutely target” anyone who attacks others with hate speech following Kirk’s death.Bondi later clarified her comments in an X post Tuesday.

For far too long, we’ve watched the radical left normalize threats, call for assassinations, and cheer on political violence. That era is over.” Bondi added: “Free speech protects ideas, debate, even dissent but it does NOT and will NEVER protect violence.” Advertisement
Cruz defended Bondi’s comment against the backlash while speaking to Politico, claiming to Politico that her words were “misconstrued.”RelatedTed Cruzfree speechcharlie kirkExperts Sound The Alarm About The Effect Charlie Kirk's Death Is Having On Free SpeechSuspect In Kirk Killing Charged With Aggravated Murder As Prosecutor Says DNA Found On Gun TriggerRead Tyler Robinson's Alleged Texts After Charlie Kirk ShootingTrumpworld Turns On Pam Bondi Over Talk Of 'Hate Speech' Crackdown Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
