General Assembly.Advertisement
“Man, you know I’ve heard a lot about these globalists over the years, but I didn’t realize their MO was to just burn you with soft pranks,” Meyers quipped.“Teleprompter down, escalator off. When the president was talking, someone tied his shoelaces together! Are they a shadowy cabal or Kevin from ‘Home Alone?’” On Wednesday evening, Trump used social media to name the escalator episode among three “very sinister events” that took place at the U.N. this week.Advertisement
He declared that he and first lady Melania Trump avoided a “disaster” by not falling “forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first.” He then called for the arrest of anyone behind the stopped escalator.A spokesperson for the U.N. previously linked Trump’s videographer to bringing the escalator to a halt, suggesting that they may have “inadvertently triggered” a built-in safety function while walking backward up the escalator to capture his arrival.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
