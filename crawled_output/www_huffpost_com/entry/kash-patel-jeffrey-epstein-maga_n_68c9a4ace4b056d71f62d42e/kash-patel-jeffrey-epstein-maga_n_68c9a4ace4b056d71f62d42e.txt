The FBI director was asked by Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), “Who, if anyone, did Epstein traffic these young women to besides himself?”Patel replied: “There is no credible information, none. If there were, I would bring the case yesterday that he trafficked to other individuals.”The comments echo the Justice Department’s controversial July memo that stated there was no evidence of an Epstein “client list.”Advertisement

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Patel awkwardly tried to qualify the claim.“I never said Jeffrey Epstein didn’t traffic anyone else,” he said, seemingly contradicting his earlier statement. He then appeared to accuse Schiff of putting words in his mouth:Advertisement
“That’s not what I’m saying,” he said. “That’s what you’re saying, and you can say whatever you want.”Schiff further noted that when U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviewed longtime Epstein collaborator Ghislaine Maxwell in July, a transcript shows she said some of the “cast of characters” who surrounded Epstein are now “in [Trump’s] Cabinet.” Blanche, who used to be President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, failed to follow up.Patel’s claim would also seem to be undercut by the Epstein victims themselves, many of whom have testified to the contrary.Advertisement
Trump himself said he had a falling out with Epstein because he “stole” Virginia Giuffre as an employee from his Mar-a-Lago spa when she worked there as a teenager.Maxwell offered Giuffre a job as Epstein’s masseuse, which led to years of sex trafficking and abuse.RelatedDonald Trumpjeffrey epsteinkash patelTrump Implies Epstein Poached Virginia Giuffre From Mar-A-Lago SpaLawmakers Rally With Epstein Victims In Push To Release FilesWhat On Earth!
