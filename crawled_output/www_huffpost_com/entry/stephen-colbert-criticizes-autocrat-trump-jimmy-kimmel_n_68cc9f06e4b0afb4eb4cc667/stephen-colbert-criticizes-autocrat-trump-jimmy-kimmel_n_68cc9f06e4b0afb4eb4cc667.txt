ABC pulled “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” two months after Colbert announced in July that CBS was canceling his show, “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” Advertisement
“That is blatant censorship,” Colbert said during a taping of his show in New York City on Thursday, referring to Kimmel’s suspension. ”With an autocrat, you cannot give an inch.” “If ABC thinks that this is going to satisfy the regime, they are woefully naive,” he added.Colbert said: “And to Jimmy, just let me say: I stand with you and your staff 100%.”Watch the video here:Kimmel’s suspension began after he made comments about Kirk’s Sept. 10 killing, the suspected shooter, and Trump supporters during Monday’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”Advertisement
“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said.Stephen Colbert and Donald Trump.Getty ImagesABC announced Wednesday that it would be pulling Kimmel’s show off the air “indefinitely” following his comments about Kirk’s death. Nexstar was the first to announce Wednesday that it would cease airing the late night show for its ABC affiliates. Advertisement
News that CBS plans to cancel Colbert’s show after May 2026 came just days after the talk show host publicly slammed CBS’s $16 million settlement with the Trump administration as a “big fat bribe.”CBS agreed to the settlement after Trump filed a lawsuit over a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris that aired during the 2024 presidential election. Trump alleged the interview was deceptively edited.The network said in a statement at the time that its “agonizing decision” to cancel Colbert’s show was “purely a financial” one and “not related in any way to the show’s performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.”Advertisement
Meanwhile, Kimmel publicly showed support for Colbert after the cancellation news. “Love you Stephen,” Kimmel wrote in a July 17 Instagram story alongside a clip of Colbert on “The Late Show.” Kimmel then blasted CBS for its decision.
