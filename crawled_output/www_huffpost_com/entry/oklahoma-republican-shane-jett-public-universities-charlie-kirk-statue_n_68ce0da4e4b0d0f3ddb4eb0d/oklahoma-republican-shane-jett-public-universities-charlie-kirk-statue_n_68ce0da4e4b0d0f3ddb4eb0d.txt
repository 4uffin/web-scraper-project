Shane Jett (R) — who leads the Oklahoma Freedom Caucus — looks to honor Kirk by establishing a “Charlie Kirk Memorial” plazas that would be built in “highly visible and easily accessible” locations at public campuses, per the bill. The bill states that “each institution of higher education within The Oklahoma State System of Higher Education” would be required to have such a plaza completed by March 2028.Advertisement
The statues of Kirk would see him either sitting at a table with an empty seat across from him or they would feature the MAGA activist and his wife holding their children. The legislation also calls for signs “commemorating Charlie Kirk’s courage and faith” and explaining his role as a “voice of a generation, modern civil rights leader, vocal Christian, martyr for truth and faith, and free speech advocate.”New bill filed in Oklahoma that says every public university in the state must have a "Charlie Kirk Memorial Plaza" with a statue of Kirk and his family. pic.twitter.com/WGWxzW9efw— Jeffrey Sachs (@JeffreyASachs) September 19, 2025Advertisement
Other pieces of legislation filed by Jett include a bill that looks to designate Kirk’s birthday, Oct. 14, as “Charlie Kirk Free Speech Day” and a resolution that would require the state legislature to recognize and honor Kirk.Oklahoma state Sen. Ally Seifried (R) filed a similar resolution earlier in the week that directs the chamber to honor Kirk, as well.The bills and resolutions are set to be considered by the legislature when the body reconvenes in February.Advertisement
Jett’s push for statues on public campuses arrives after David Keyes, a former adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, shared an AI-generated image of a “Charlie Kirk Free Speech Plaza” on X. The post has over 10 million views on the platform, as of Friday night.“Every American university should have one of these,” Keyes wrote.Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.

Ron DeSantis in 2023 — plans to commission a privately-funded statue of Kirk that it hopes to stand for the college’s “commitment” to “defend and fight for free speech and civil discourse in American life.”Advertisement
