While presenting during the ceremony Sunday at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, Colbert teasingly whipped out a vintage headshot while quipping about looking for a new job. Advertisement
As the audience repeatedly chanted his name as he hit the stage to present the award for Best Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, Colbert said, “While I have your attention: Is anyone hiring? Because I got 200 very well-qualified candidates with me here tonight who will be available in June.” “I also brought my own resume here tonight. I haven’t had a chance to update my headshot in a bit, but I think it still works.” Colbert, who won an Emmy for talk series later in the show, then handed his resume to Emmy nominee Harrison Ford, who was in the audience, and asked him to give it to director Steven Spielberg.Advertisement
Colbert first announced that CBS decided to cancel “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” in July, with the news of its cancellation sparking a joyful reaction from President Donald Trump, who was frequently mocked on the show. “I absolutely love that Colbert’ got fired,” Trump wrote in a July 18 post on Truth Social.

CBS’ decision to nix Colbert’s program came two weeks after Paramount Global announced that it would pay Trump $16 million to settle his lawsuit tied to “60 Minutes.”Many of Trump’s critics, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), insinuated that CBS’ cancellation of Colbert’s show could be linked to the Paramount settlement. “CBS canceled Colbert’s show just THREE DAYS after Colbert called out CBS parent company Paramount for its $16M settlement with Trump – a deal that looks like bribery,” Warren wrote in a July 17 post on X, formerly Twitter.Advertisement
She added: “America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons.” Meanwhile, CBS called the cancellation of “The Late Show” a “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.”“The Late Show,” which premiered in 2015 and is scheduled to end in May 2026, scored its first Creative Arts Emmy Award last Sunday. The accolade was given in the Outstanding Directing for a Variety Series category.RelatedStephen ColbertEmmysStephen Colbert Breaks Format With Heartfelt Plea After Charlie Kirk AssassinationStephen Colbert Burns Trump With A Brutal Warning About His 'Cankles''Google It!': Stephen Colbert Torches MAGA Rep.
