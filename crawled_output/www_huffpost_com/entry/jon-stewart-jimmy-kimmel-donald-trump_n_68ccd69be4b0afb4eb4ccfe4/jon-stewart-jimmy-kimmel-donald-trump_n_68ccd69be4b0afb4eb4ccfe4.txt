Log in to hide these messages.Jon Stewart Responds To Jimmy Kimmel Suspension In The Most Brutally Sarcastic WayThe comedian delivered a very different version of "The Daily Show."By Lee MoranEuropean correspondent, HuffPostSep 19, 2025, 12:38 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGJon Stewart made a rare midweek appearance on “The Daily Show” Thursday night to wade into the controversy over ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late night program.Stewart, who usually only hosts on Mondays, opened the show in front of a gold-emblazoned, Trump-style backdrop to deliver what he described as the latest episode of a “fun, hilarious, administration-compliant show.”Advertisement
Adopting a mock state TV persona, Stewart offered nervous praise of President Donald Trump and his recent state visit to the United Kingdom.“If you felt off these last couple of days, it’s probably because our great father has not been home,” Stewart sarcastically began. “For father has been gracing England with his legendary warmth and radiance.”Stewart continued, saying that Trump “wowed the English with charm, intelligence, and an undeniable sexual charisma.”Advertisement
Stewart also admired the “perfectly tinted” president who “dazzled his hosts, the British royal family.”The host faux scolded himself at times when he realized he hadn’t toadied up enough to Trump, before all the show’s correspondents appeared on screen at the end ― holding microphones emblazoned with an image of Trump’s face ― to pay tribute to the “glorious” leader, and conclude with a musical number.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
