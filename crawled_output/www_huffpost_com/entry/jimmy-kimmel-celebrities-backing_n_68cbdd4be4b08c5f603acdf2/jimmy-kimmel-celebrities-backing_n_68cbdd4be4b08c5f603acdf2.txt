Kimmel had said: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”“This isn’t right,” Ben Stiller said of Kimmel’s suspension on X, formerly Twitter.This isn’t right. https://t.co/mVJ8308w1k— Ben Stiller (@BenStiller) September 17, 2025Alison Brie, on Instagram, called it “unreal” and “very scary.”Jamie Lee Curtis shared Kimmel’s comment in April that: “I don’t think anybody should be canceled. I really don’t.”Advertisement
Henry Winkler wrote that Kimmel’s humor and “insights are important to keep showing us who we are.”Halsey responded to the news: “We’re in the ‘tell on your friends and neighbors’ ‘extreme censorship’ ‘indistinguishable propaganda’ part of the fascism in case it wasn’t clear.”Singer-songwriter John Legend shared a post by David Frum, a former George W. Bush speechwriter turned Donald Trump critic, that read: “How dare you call us fascists just because our appointees threaten government retaliation against broadcast networks if their comedians don’t say what we want them to say.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
