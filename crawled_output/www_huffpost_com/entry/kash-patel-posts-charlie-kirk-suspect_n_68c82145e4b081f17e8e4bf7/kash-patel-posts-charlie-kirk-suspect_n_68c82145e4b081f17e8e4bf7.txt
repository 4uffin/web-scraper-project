On Wednesday evening, Patel posted on X that “the subject” in Kirk’s killing was “in custody.”The post has more than 38 million views on the social media site.But Patel’s declaration ran contrary to a statement by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (R), who told a press conference minutes later only that a “person of interest” had been taken into custody.Around 90 minutes after his initial post, Patel wrote another message saying the “subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement,” meaning the actual suspect was still at large. FBI directors have not historically used social media to provide scattershot updates in high-profile cases.Advertisement
Appearing on “Fox & Friends” on Monday, Patel was asked about what host Brian Kilmeade characterized as the “we got him” posts.“Could I have worded it a little better in the heat of the moment? Sure,” Patel replied. “But do I regret putting it out? Absolutely not.”He added that he would “challenge anyone out there to find a director that has been more transparent and more willing to work with the media on high-profile cases, or any case the FBI is handling, than we have been under my leadership.”Advertisement
Kirk, a prominent right-wing influencer, was shot in the neck while speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem.The suspect in Kirk’s killing has been identified as a 22-year-old from Washington, Utah.PowerOurJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour membership fuels reporting that informs, inspires, and holds power accountable.
