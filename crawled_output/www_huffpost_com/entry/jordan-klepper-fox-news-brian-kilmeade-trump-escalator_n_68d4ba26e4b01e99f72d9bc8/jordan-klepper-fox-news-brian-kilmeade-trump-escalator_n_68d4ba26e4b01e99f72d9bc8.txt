“We’re making ellipses feel sinister now?” quipped Klepper before launching into a conspiratorial tangent. “What are these dots? What are they hiding? And don’t get me started on semicolons! Are you a period or a comma? Pick one!”He then asked how Kilmeade could be an “expert” on escalators before tossing to more of the host’s remarks on “Fox & Friends” where he claimed that it’s been nothing but smooth sailing when he gets on the moving staircases.“I do a lot of shopping, go to a lot of malls, go to the second floor where the men’s stuff is, you know, because you walk in on the first floor. Never happened to me!” Kilmeade declared.Advertisement
Fox News’ Peter Doocy, who appeared for a live hit outside the White House, bluntly replied: “Uh, that’s great.”Klepper’s audience got a kick out of Doocy’s response.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
