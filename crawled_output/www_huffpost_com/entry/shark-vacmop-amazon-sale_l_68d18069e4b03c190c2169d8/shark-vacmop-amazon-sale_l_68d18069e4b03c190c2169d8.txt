Thankfully, this Shark combines a vacuum and mop into one cordless device, helping you work smarter, not harder.Instead of sucking crumbs inside a removable bag or filter you need to tap-tap-tap over a waste bin, the VacMop locks it above its disposable cleaning pad, and once it’s full and dirty, you just press a button to release it over the trash, no touching required. Several reviewers say it’s helped them keep their places clean without the hassle of bending over, and its lightweight and cordless operation makes easier to use than a Dyson stick vacuum, one particular reviewer raves. Or, just take it from reviewer Melissa Foster: it’s “my favorite floor cleaning tool of all time.” Well, you’ll be happy to know that it’s 40% off right now in lavender or green on Amazon, knocking its price to just $59.99, the lowest price it’s ever been.Advertisement
lavender: $59.99 at Amazon (Regularly $99.99)green: $59.99 at Amazon (Regularly $99.99)It comes loaded with everything you need.The Shark VM252 VacMap comes packaged with a charger, four replaceable VacMop filter pads and 12-ounces of cleaning fluid. Those pads are great for dry dusting or sweeping floors and assisting with vacuuming when turned on. It’s also thick enough to absorb liquid, and you can spray its cleaning fluid with a button located on its handle. Two LED lights at its base help better see the messes you’re cleaning— another cool feature — and no filters means it doesn’t require maintenance.AmazonThe Shark VacMop Pro is safe on practically all types of hard floors.Advertisement
Reviewers say its pads last for a long, long time. As for its VacMop pads, reviewers say they last for quite a while. “For under $100 its suction power is amazing and one pad last forever,” says reviewer Moxie94. “I replaced a pad after numerous uses only because I had cleaned up some high traffic areas and the pad itself was very dirty but I couldn’t believe the little compartment that holds the debris was still working! It packs extremely full, yet continues to have incredible vacuuming power!”And it stows away easily.“The vacuum stores dirt efficiently so you can go longer with a pad than expected, says BTV. “I sucked up half a crushed hamburger bun and it was shoved so tightly in the back corner I had to use a kabob stick to get it out. I go through 2-3 pads a month with daily spot cleaning and weekly routine cleaning.”lavender: $59.99 at Amazon (Regularly $99.99)green: $59.99 at Amazon (Regularly $99.99)Advertisement
This cordless, easygoing hybrid vacuum mop is on sale at the lowest price we’ve seen in months, so if you’re looking for a 2-in-1 solution to your cleaning woes, jump on this deal pronto and read on for more promising reviews.“I’m currently 8.5 months pregnant and have a 2 and 4 year old who demand snacks regularly and sneak them all over the house despite my best efforts. Our classic broom, mop, and cordless handheld vacuum just stopped being a practical option for me about a month ago because I can hardly bend down anymore. We live in a 900 sq ft ranch style duplex with all hardwood flooring and an HVAC system that is way too big for our unit, so dust spews out our vents like a leafblower.The VacMop is the single best, most convenient household item I think I could have purchased right now. It is super powerful, I just have to press a different button to switch to mop mode, and I don’t have small children pulling out the cord every time I try to vacuum. The run time is about 10 minutes but that’s enough time for me to cover the whole main level. Probably not ideal if you live in a house with tons of square footage.” — Mar (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review here.) “This thing is really awesome for light and quick clean up. (Think spilled baby food, pet accidents, or light dirt that comes in on shoes.) I also love it for a quick refresh on the bathroom floors after hubby shaved his beard. I use this more than my Dyson because it’s so light and convenient. If you have hardwood this is the key to keeping your floors dust bunny free.” — Amazon Customer “How have I lived without this? For under $100 its suction power is amazing and one pad last forever. I replaced a pad after numerous uses only because I had cleaned up some high traffic areas and the pad itself was very dirty but I couldn’t believe the little compartment that holds the debris was still working! It packs extremely full, yet continues to have incredible vacuuming power! Upon opening, it took me a couple minutes to figure out that you cannot run the vacuum and the spray at the same time. The only negative I can find is that you have to hold in the button the whole while you are vacuuming and my hand does get a little tired. Other than that, I am in love with this little vacuum/scrubber!!!! Another awesome thing for me is that you literally pop off the pad and throw it away with all of the vacuumed up debris right inside of the pad. I have three other vacuums (yes- I love clean floors!) and all of them I have to disassemble and empty out the collection- all of the cat hair, food crumbs, dust, and sometimes, it sprinkles a bit on the floor around the garbage can or sticks in the compartment and you have to dig it out. You don’t ever have to touch it again once it’s been sucked up and it does not fall back out! No filters to replace either. Just- WOW!!!” — Moxie94 (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review here.) “This thing is LEGIT!! My husband bought it for me as a surprise to make my life easier and at first I was skeptical as to wether I needed it. I already had a norwex mop (which I love), a roomba (which I love), and of course, a broom for sweeping in between roomba runs. Uh WOW! This thing makes cleaning up after meals/kids messes easy and fun! The kids love using it to help out and I find myself calling floor duty just so I can use it ;)” — Rachel & Austin Holt (This review has been edited for length.
