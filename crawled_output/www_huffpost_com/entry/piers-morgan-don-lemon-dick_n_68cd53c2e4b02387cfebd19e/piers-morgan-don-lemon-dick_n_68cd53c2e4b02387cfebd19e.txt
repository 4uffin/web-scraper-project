(Watch the video below.)The host called former CNN personality Don Lemon a “complete dick,” sending their conversation downhill. (The dialogue below has been edited for brevity.)The two discussed cancel culture in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s death, with Morgan noting that people in many professions celebrated the killing (and some reportedly lost their jobs). “What should happen to those people?” he asked.Advertisement
Lemon condemned the celebration and said freedom of speech does come with consequences in business. But he concluded he didn’t believe in canceling people.Morgan asked Lemon if he was a victim of cancel culture, with Lemon eventually answering in the affirmative.Morgan, also a former CNN anchor, then cued up a CNN video of Lemon suggesting that GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley was past her prime. The comment, for which he was suspended, was among other reported instances of misogyny before he was terminated in 2023.Advertisement
Lemon told Morgan that his firing was not a subject they had agreed upon for their interview. “I don’t appreciate being ambushed,” he added.“Ambushed?” Morgan said. “Hang on one second... Let’s just be crystal clear about what’s just happened. You brought up the subject of cancel culture. I asked you, ‘Did you feel your departure from CNN was an example of that?’ And you answered the question.”A shouting-over match commenced as Lemon accused Morgan of being disingenuous.“Did you invite me here to interrupt me?” Lemon continued.“I think you’re being a complete dick, if I’m honest with you,” Morgan sniped.“OK,” Lemon said, laughing uncomfortably. “Well, that’s very kind and respectful of you.”“It wasn’t intended to be kind or respectful,” Morgan shot back.“I could respond in kind, but I won’t because I think that I am ― I think I am above that,” Lemon said.Advertisement
Then, Morgan replied, “I don’t understand why you’re playing the victim card when you yourself mentioned cancel culture.”“I’ve given you your moment,” Lemon declared. “This is gonna go viral, so please, enough. Yes, you do. Otherwise, you wouldn’t do this. You would be a respectful journalist.”The two continued to exchange words before Piers stated, “I don’t think I’ll take lectures on being a respectful journalist from you, Don, I won’t!”Advertisement
The interview didn’t improve from there. It’s been a rough week for Lemon. Last week, he was doing a man-on-the-street interview when his subject called him a “fucking moron.”Fast-forward to 39:00 for Lemon and Morgan’s tense back-and-forth:20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
