Because crepey skin is very thin and lacks elasticity, it can be at higher risk for tearing or bruising, which can make treating it important to prevent infection, beyond aesthetic concerns.Luckily, many skin care products on the market aim to treat crepey skin by smoothing and firming it, but there’s one reviewer-beloved cream on Amazon you may not have heard of. Don’t worry, we won’t gatekeep: The DerMend Specialized Fragile Skin moisturizing cream is available on Amazon, and it may just be one of the best crepey skin moisturizers we’ve come across.Advertisement
$29 at AmazonThis moisturizing cream, meant for mature skin, contains all kinds of skin-nourishing ingredients: hyaluronic acid and ceramides for hydration, glycolic acid to exfoliate and retinol plus niacinamides to help improve the appearance of crepey wrinkles. It can be used on both the face and body, and can smooth and tighten sagging in addition to its hydrating qualities.For the best results, you’ll want to apply the cream wherever you have crepey skin two times a day, once in the morning and once at night (or according to your dermatologist’s instructions, if they vary). And yes, this cream does come dermatologist-recommended: Multiple reviewers say the reason they bought it in the first place was because their doctors told them to.Advertisement
Reviewers also noted that while results aren’t instantaneous, sometimes taking several weeks for visible improvements, the improvements are noticeable and worth both the effort and the slightly higher price of the cream. Plus, a little goes a long way with this stuff, according to several pleased shoppers, so the 4.5-ounce tube should hopefully last a while.With a 4.4-star average rating across more than 4,600 reviews, it’s fair to say that this cream is trusted for reducing the appearance of crepey skin, as well as the easy bruising that can result from it. Below, check out more rave reviews about the popular DerMend moisturizer, or scroll just a bit farther to shop it on Amazon and start waving your crepey skin goodbye.“I began using this morning and night for a month and wow do I notice my fragile thinning skin on my arms looking healthier and younger. Best part is that my skin has toughened up enough not to tear and bruise as it used too. I’m using it now at least once daily after showering. Great ingredients and my dermatologist told me to continue. It works well on my sensitive skin and I have much less noticeable bruising from bumps due to blood thinners.” — Bella“My husband lost a lot of weight - over 100 lbs and wtih that also lost a lot of muscle mass. His skin is very thin and the smallest bump will rip his skin. He arms were TERRIBLE looking to the point that he would only wear long sleeves in Texas. A dermatologist recommended this and he was HIGHLY SKEPTICAL and has now asked me to set this up for subscribe and save! Not only does it help to moisturize his skin - it helps protect it and when he does get a cut, it appears to heal faster wtihout the skin discoloration. This is TRULY one of the best products we’ve tried in any capacity recently.” — Amazon customer“My forearm skin has improved significantly. It’s smoother and more resilient. I use it morning and night and protect my arms with gloves when I drive. I would say the change in just 1 month is 75%! Will continue to use.” — Kati G“My doctor suggested I try this for my arms, which were always looking so bad. I wore long sleeves constantly. This has made my skin completely turn around. I can actually wear short sleeves again. It may be expensive, but it works as well worth the price.” — Boonester“It smooths without being greasy. It’s helping with spots already, and I’ve only been using it for a few days. I thought it was vastly overpriced before I bought it, but I’m going to be a repeat customer. You get what you pay for.” — Lisa L.$29 at AmazonLooking for more help with crepey skin? Try these dermatologist-recommended products for your neck:1AmazonA popular skin barrier-strengthening creamBoard-certified and Texas-based dermatologist Dr. Seemal R. Desai at Innovative Dermatology previously spoke to HuffPost specifically about crepey skin and suggested the ever-favorite CeraVe moisturizing cream as a good hydrator for this particular skin concern."I recommend moisturizing with thick emollients, which helps to replace the ceramides and lipid concentration in the skin, which can help with overall skin hydration," Desai said. "I really like the CeraVe moisturizing brand line, and I recommend the creams over lotions. One of my favorite moisturizers in the entire world, and one I recommend to patients every day, is the CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. It’s a rich, non-greasy and fast-absorbing cream that releases a steady stream of moisturizing ingredients, including essential ceramides and hyaluronic acid. It’s also fragrance-free, so it’s great for even the most sensitive skin types.”$13+ at Ulta$6+ at Target16-ounce: $16 at Walmart2DermstoreA neck cream with a blend of five peptidesDr. Elaine F. Kung, board-certified dermatologist and founder of Future Bright Dermatology in New York, suggested the Nectifirm firming neck treatment (containing the famed antioxidants C and E) by Revision Skincare, a brand whose product offerings have been suggested to us before.The formula features plant extracts and five different peptides which Kung explained are amino acids used as the building blocks for collagen production in the skin. The result is skin that appears more lifted, feels firmer and more resilient.$115 at Dermstore$115 at Amazon3AmazonA highly rated retinol cream"Retinol has been scientifically proven to thicken both the epidermis and the dermis," Kung said. "It also stimulates the production of collagen and elastin within the dermis." In order to find a suitable retinol-containing product we turned to a previous suggestion from Dr. Y. Claire Chang, a board-certified cosmetic dermatologist at Union Square Laser Dermatology.This rapid wrinkle repair cream by Neutrogena uses an accelerated retinol complex to promote cellular turnover. It also contains a hydrating dose of hyaluronic acid, an ingredient suggested by Kung, and can be suitable in treating crepey skin.Note that if you're new to retinols, they do have the potential to cause mild flaking and irritation in the first couple weeks of use. They can also cause skin to be more sensitive to the sun, so it's important to wear sunscreen.$29 at Amazon$31 at UltaAdvertisement
4AmazonA collagen-boosting serumSpeaking of collagen and its essential role in skin elasticity, Kung also recommended this supercharged collagen-boosting serum formulated to make complexions dewy and plump so lines look less obvious and skin feels less dry. It uses a brand-exclusive 10% peptide complex as well as soothing aloe, collagen and hyaluronic acid, an tried-and-true humectant that helps to draw moisture into the skin to keep it hydrated. $40 at Amazon$40 at DēpologyAdvertisement
5DermstoreA peptide and retinol neck complexDr. Navin Arora, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Borealis Dermatology in New York, as well as Kung, suggested this neck-specific formula by SkinCeuticals, a clinical skin care brand that frequently comes with dermatologist's stamp of approval for their effective formulas. "[It's] an amazing combination of retinol and peptides that is specifically formulated to tighten delicate neck skin," Arora said of this daily cream that contains a 0.2% concentration of slow-release retinol, a time-honored ingredient that accelerates the skin's cellular turnover rate, promoting collagen production. Hydrating seed oils are supplemented with a 5% glaucine complex, a plant-derived ingredient that can support skin's natural resistance to premature aging. $136 at Dermstore6Skinbetter ScienceA cream that targets three main neck skin concernsAccording to Arora, the Techno Neck Perfecting Cream by Skinbetter Science is popular product that improves crepiness, dryness, sagging, laxity and texture in the skin of the neck and décolleté. "A key ingredient is heptapeptide-7, a targeted peptide that supports the skin's collagen network," he said. The formula contains a smart combination of hydroxy acids and a uniquely formulated form of vitamin A that's similar to retinol, but won't cause excess irritation. You can also expect a whole host of ingredients that can improve the look and feel of skin from niacinamide, a faithful brightener, squalane, an emollient to help skin retain moisture and a targeted peptide to plump fine lines.$155 at Skinbetter ScienceAdvertisement
7Alastin SkincareAn elastin- and collagen-promoting neck complexRecommended by Kung, Alastin's Restorative Neck Complex claims to be a "next-generation skin tightener" that's specifically designed to address crepey skin on the neck and chest while also fighting redness and discoloration. The product's power lies in a blend of active peptides that work to support the production of collagen and elastin. There's also the addition of phytoene and phytofluene, two powerful antioxidants that protect the skin from collagen-depleting stressors. $158 at Alastin Skincare8SephoraA brightening and firming vitamin C serum"Vitamin C is a cofactor in collagen synthesis. Its antioxidant properties help protect skin cells from sun and environmental damage," Kung said, of this well-studied ingredient that can do everything from evening skin tone to addressing dullness and fine lines. Though Kung didn't recommend a specific vitamin C-containing product, New York City-based board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Brendan Camp previously suggested this 15%-concentrated serum by Dr. Dennis Gross. It also features lactic acid, a chemical exfoliant that can help address irregular skin texture and increase product absorption thereby enhancing antioxidant potential.$87 at Sephora9DermstoreA derm-trusted tinted sunscreenBoth Kung and Arora stressed the importance of prevention when it comes to managing crepey skin, specifically when it comes to the damaging potential of the sun."Use sunscreen with zinc and titanium oxide," Kung said. "UV exposure breaks down collagen and elastin in skin that help it stay tight and firm. Once these fibers break down, the skin can loosen, thin and wrinkle."Camp (along with several other dermatologists in the past) previously suggested this sunscreen from Elta MD, which according to him, can also shield skin from visible UV rays in overhead lighting because of its tinted formula. The zinc oxide- and octinoxate-based formula features SPF 46 along with high-purity niacinamide, a well-known anti-inflammatory that reduces redness and helps to restore damaged skin.$46 at Amazon$46 at DermstoreAdvertisement
10AmazonA UPF 50+ -infused neck scarfWhile on the topic of sun protection for your neck, Camp previously said that you should consider wearing a scarf or neck gaiter made of lightweight UPF fabric. "Ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) fabrics provide protection by blocking the sun’s rays. Sun scarves and neck gaiters can complement an SPF moisturizer," he said.Based on his suggestion, we found this gender-neutral bandana made from a soft and cool UPF fabric blocks 98% of the sun's harmful UVA and UVB rays. It comes in four colors like black, apricot and white.$25 at AmazonRelatedshoppingBeautyskin care wrinklesReviewers Love These $13 Patches For Smoothing ‘Crepey’ Under-Eye SkinReviewers All Over The Internet Say This $10 Crepe-Reducing Moisturizer Is Legitimately EffectiveReviewers Say This Affordable, Line-Reducing Moisturizer 'Really Works'This Reviewer-Beloved Cream Smooths And Tightens Crepey Skin — And It's On Amazon Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
