WongSenior Culture Reporter, HuffPostSep 15, 2025, 04:16 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGIt’s official: Kelsea Ballerini and Chase Stokes have ended their relationship after nearly three years together. A representative for Ballerini confirmed to People Sunday that the country musician and Stokes, an actor best known for his starring role on Netflix’s “Outer Banks,” had split. Advertisement
“They’re two adults who gave it their all and tried to do everything they could to make it work, but ultimately couldn’t,” a source close to the couple told the outlet. “It happens.”Still, the news caught many fans off-guard, given that Stokes had acknowledged Ballerini’s 32nd birthday with a carousel of sweet photos on Instagram just two days prior.“Although you keep saying you’re not excited for 32, id say I’m lookin forward to more of this,” the caption read. “Happy birthday my love.”Advertisement
Fans were quick to point out the curious timing of Stokes’ post in the comments. “Guys I need answers. Who else is here looking for ANSWERS!?” one person wrote.

About a month later, Ballerini appeared on the “Call Her Daddy” podcast where she acknowledged she was “having fun” after her divorce and confirmed she’d slid into Stokes’ DMs. Advertisement
“I’ve never really dated; I don’t know how it works. I’m like, ‘Let’s just put ourselves out there; let’s just vibe.’ And it’s been fun,” she explained. “I’ve never seen his show, but I just knew of him, and I just swan-dove right on in.”Around the same time, Stokes told People that he and Ballerini had been “spending some time together.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

“I think we’re two and a half years in, so [the relationship] looks a lot different now than it did in the beginning,” she told the outlet. “I don’t know, I think we’re really similar — and in the ways that we’re different, that’s where we challenge each other. … I just want all the good things in the world for him.”RelatedCelebrity SplitsKelsea Balleriniouter banksThis Actor-Athlete Power Couple Just Called Off Their Engagement After 5 Years TogetherJodie Turner-Smith Shares Cryptic Message Amid Joshua Jackson Custody DramaChris Appleton Breaks Silence On Split From ‘White Lotus’ Star After 6 Months Of MarriageTravis Kelce’s Famous Ex Raises Eyebrows With Cryptic Post After Taylor Swift Engagement News Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
