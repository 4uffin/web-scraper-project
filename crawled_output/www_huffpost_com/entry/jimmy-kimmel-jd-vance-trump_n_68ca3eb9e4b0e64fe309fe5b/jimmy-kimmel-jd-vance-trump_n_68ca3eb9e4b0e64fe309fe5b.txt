“While our side of the aisle certainly has its crazies, it is a statistical fact that most of the lunatics in American politics today are proud members of the far left,” Vance said, falsely. Kimmel wasn’t about to give the vice president a pass. “And by statistical fact, he means complete bullshit,” he said, pointing out that the Justice Department itself has concluded that the far right is the greatest source of domestic terror and extremist violence.But that report recently vanished from the department’s website, Kimmel noted. “Here’s a question JD Vance might be able to answer: Who wanted to hang the guy who was vice president before you?” Kimmel asked. “Was that the liberal left or the toothless army who stormed the Capital on January 6th?”Advertisement
