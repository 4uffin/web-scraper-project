Podcast giant Rogan says in the video: “I definitely don’t think that the government should be involved, ever, in dictating what a comedian can or cannot say.”“That’s fucking crazy,” he rails in another bit of the supercut.The montage will run for a week, from Sept. 25, across 28 YouTube channels, including those of the male viewership-skewing hosts Rogan, Singh, Dillon, Kill Tony, Theo Von, and Andrew Schulz, according to a press release shared with HuffPost. The NFL, UFC and ESPN College Football channels will also reportedly be targeted.Watch here:Advertisement
“The ad seizes on recent criticism of Trump from many leading right-wing figures who previously supported him, due to his hypocritical attacks on free speech,” the release said.“The administration’s recent actions represent a major attack on freedom of speech, a core constitutional freedom and a pillar of democracy that enjoys broad support by Americans across the ideological spectrum,” it added.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
