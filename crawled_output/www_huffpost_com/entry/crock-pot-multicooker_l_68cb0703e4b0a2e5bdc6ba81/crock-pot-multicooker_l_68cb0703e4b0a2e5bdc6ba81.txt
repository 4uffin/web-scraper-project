Few kitchen gadgets are more foolproof than a trusty Crock-Pot; it’s the easiest way to make a truly delicious meal without spending the entire day in the kitchen. One of the brand’s more recent innovations is a slow cooker game-changer, allowing you to cook multiple meals or dishes simultaneously in the same cooker.$180 at AmazonAdvertisement
AmazonIt's a dual-sided slow cooker that can feed a crowd.This dual slow cooker takes everything we love about the OG Crock-Pot and doubles it, using ingenious technology that allows you to use different temperatures and cook functions at the same time. It is easily programmable and gives you the ability to sear foods and cook them in the same pot, creating incredibly flavorful outcomes without a lot of mess. It essentially replaces over 30 cooking gadgets and appliances — which means it’s never been more delightful to cook a full meal from scratch without the use of separate pots, pans or steamers. Whether you’re a busy parent trying to get a low-effort, healthy meal on the table, are entertaining guests or don’t have much time to cook in the evening after a busy day at the office, the Crock-Pot multimeal multicooker is a must-have.Advertisement
One reviewer said it makes a great gift, while another pointed out that it’s perfect for potlucks. The consensus is that this tool is set to become your new best friend, and it’s practically essential for those who have different food preferences within the same household. The multicooker can slow cook, sear, sauté, bake, steam and even cook rice — and thanks to the magic of Crock-Pot, everything is ready at the same time. Each nonstick pot holds 3.7 quarts, which makes enough food for about four people. Best of all, it’s a breeze to clean thanks to the ceramic-coated pots that can easily be wiped out. More than one reviewer pointed out that it’s aesthetically pleasing enough to leave out on the counter, while another said that it’s great for small kitchens.Advertisement
$180 at AmazonTake a look at what a few satisfied shoppers have to say about this ultra-convenient cooking tool and pick one up for yourself. Boasting 4.7 out of 5 stars at Amazon, it’s unlikely you’ll regret adding it to your cookware repertoire.Promising reviews: “Durable and functional. My new best friend! Soup on one side...cook chicken on the other. Next time. Sauté vegetables one side...cook rice on the other. Very easy to use and clean. The size is great. I use this and it works well with the right heat temps. Great value for the flexibility, plus it looks good on the counter!” T. Green“I am loving my new multi cooker! Each side is still large enough for me to cook a small roast or chili and enjoy the option of having two different meals to be ready at the same time. It will come in very handy for a family gathering!” — Kelli23“This is the real deal! This good buddy takes the crock pot to the next level. It is perfect for small to large families. I love being able to cook two things at once on their own times!! Also I bought “one pot” the accessory liner so you can take the two halves out and insert it to cook the one large meal too!! I hope they come out with more accessories for it! You can do so much with it. I cooked a corned beef on one side and then cook bacon that I added cabbage to and steamed to have cabbage and corned beef for an example of a meal. Can’t wait to do all my fall soups and stews now that fall is here!!” — MSLADYINC“Excellent for many reasons! Heats quickly and both sides are large enough that you can just use one for a meal that feeds multiple people. It’s nice enough to leave on a counter top if you don’t have the space to store it. So far, I’ve made a chicken and broccoli pasta, I slow cooked the chicken for 6 hours on one side, then made the pasta on the other. You can boil pasta with the sauté feature. I cooked the broccoli in a microwave and threw it in with the pasta before serving. I haven’t tried the rice steaming feature but will do that next. Having the double pot feature is excellent for entertaining.” — Amazon customer“To be able to sear those short ribs before adding my ingredients was incredible to do. I love this double crockpot. It is fabulous! Highly recommend. To cook two times a week and have four separate meals and leftovers is great.” — Amazon customer“This Crockpot Multimeal Multicooker has officially turned me into a kitchen wizard (minus the magic wand). I can throw in anything—soup, stew, rice, even yogurt—and it’ll cook like it’s been slaving over the stove for hours, but without me lifting a finger. It’s like having a personal chef who doesn’t complain about the dishes. The “set it and forget it” feature is a game-changer because I can finally stop pretending I’m a celebrity chef on a cooking show. Whether you’re looking for a slow-cooked masterpiece or a quick meal on a busy day, this thing’s got your back. Bonus: It makes you look like you have your life together, even if your laundry pile says otherwise.” — Kayla$180 at AmazonIf you’re still not convinced, take a look at these other popular slow cookers from previous reporting and see if you can find one that’s the best fit for you.AmazonOne of the highest-rated, no-frills optionsScore: 4.6 out of 5 stars and 12,999 ratingsThe Crock-Pot 3-quart round manual slow cooker strikes a balance between size and function.
