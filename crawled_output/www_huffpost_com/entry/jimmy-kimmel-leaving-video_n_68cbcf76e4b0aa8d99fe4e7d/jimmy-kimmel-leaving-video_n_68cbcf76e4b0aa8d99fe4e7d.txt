But he ended it ducking into a vehicle in his civilian clothes without taping an episode, a video from Wednesday showed. (Watch it below.)After ABC announced the suspension of “Jimmy Kimmel Live” amid threats from the Federal Communications Commission and affiliate groups, Kimmel, wearing a baseball cap and carrying a backpack, was filmed exiting the Hollywood studio and being guided into a vehicle, according to a clip from The Associated Press.Advertisement
The footage also showed workers removing equipment, a news reporter doing a live shot, a woman running, and a protest in front of a sign reading “Trump Must Go Now!” outside of the studio.“Jimmy Kimmel did nothing but point out some of the hypocrisy of these fascists, and for this he is being canceled and he is being threatened,” one of the demonstrators said.Advertisement
Kimmel, a persistent critic of President Donald Trump and his allies, angered broadcast officials when he said this about Charlie Kirk’s assassination on Monday:“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
