It’s “not helpful,” he said.“Leaders cannot call their political opponents ‘Nazis’ and ‘fascists’ and ‘enemies of the state’ because they disagree with their policy priorities. I mean, this is something we should have learned in grade school,” Johnson told reporters. “This type of language spurs on depraved people, deranged people, who take that as a cue and this tragic phenomenon played out this week in Utah.”Watch here:Footage of Johnson’s remarks shared on X, formerly Twitter, went viral as critics brought receipts and more about Trump:Advertisement
