On Monday’s show, Kimmel criticized the response to the killing from people on the right, a statement that’s drawn the ire of conservatives and threats of penalties from Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr. “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said. “In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving.”Jimmy Kimmel participates in the "Jimmy Kimmel Live and 90th Oscars" panel during the Disney/ABC Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour in Pasadena, Calif.via Associated PressAdvertisement
Earlier on Wednesday, while speaking in an interview with YouTuber Benny Johnson, Carr suggested that ABC and Disney should take action over Kimmel’s comments, and added that the FCC could penalize individual broadcasters that air the late night program. The FCC can impose fines and review the licenses of individual broadcasters if the agency believes that they aren’t operating in the public interest, Carr said. ABC’s announcement followed a statement from Nexstar Media Group, which said it would be pulling Kimmel’s program from affiliates that it operates over concerns about his Kirk comments. Advertisement
“Mr. Kimmel’s comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located,” Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar’s broadcasting division, said in a press release. “Continuing to give Mr. Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time, and we have made the difficult decision to preempt his show in an effort to let cooler heads prevail as we move toward the resumption of respectful, constructive dialogue.”Brendan Carr, a Federal Communications Commission commissioner, speaks during a Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation committee hearing to examine the Federal Communications Commission on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, June 24, 2020.via Associated PressAccording to Variety, Nexstar’s actions come as it is also seeking FCC approval for a major merger it’s pursuing.Advertisement
ABC’s decision is the latest to raise concerns about press freedom as Trump has called for the revocation of it and NBC’s licenses, and as he’s sued The New York Times over claims of defamation.Trump, who’s previously attacked Kimmel, celebrated ABC’s move on Wednesday and urged NBC to similarly drop late night shows featuring Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT.”Advertisement
