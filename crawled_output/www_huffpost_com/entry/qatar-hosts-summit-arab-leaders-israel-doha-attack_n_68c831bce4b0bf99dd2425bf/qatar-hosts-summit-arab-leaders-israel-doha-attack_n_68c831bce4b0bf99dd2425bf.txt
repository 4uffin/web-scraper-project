But the group has few ways to restrain Israel as its war in the Gaza Strip grinds on.Israel launched its invasion of Gaza in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, and since then it has also retaliated against the militant group and other members of Iran’s so-called Axis of Resistance elsewhere, including in Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and now Qatar. That’s led to wider anger among Mideast nations already enraged by the over 64,000 Palestinians killed during the war in Gaza — and a growing concern that the U.S. commitment to protect Gulf Arab states may not be strong enough.Advertisement
However, it remains unclear just what the summit will be able to achieve. Significant tensions among the nations meeting could blunt cooperation — and they also have few levers they can pull. Condemnations from countries that Israel considers enemies, like Iran, will mean little. Meanwhile, the nations attending that have diplomatic recognition deals with Israel may be reluctant to sever ties.“Considering the deep tensions between the Gulf states and other regional actors, assembling the summit in less than a week, especially given its scale, is a notable achievement that underscores a shared sense of urgency in the region,” the New York-based Soufan Center said. “The key question is whether ... (the summit will) signal a shift toward more consequential measures against Israel, including diplomatic downgrades, targeted economic actions and restrictions on airspace and access.”Qatar’s ruler offers fiery speechJournalists watch Qatar's ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, deliver the opening speech for an Arab-Islamic summit to discuss the Israeli attack on Hamas in the Gulf country's capital of Doha, on Sept. 15, 2025.Noushad Thekkayil/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
Qatar’s ruling emir opened the summit by accusing Israel of not caring about its hostages held in Gaza and instead only working to ”ensure Gaza is no longer livable.” Israel has said the goals of its war include bringing all the hostages back and defeating Hamas.“If Israel wishes to assassinate the Hamas leaders, why then engage in negotiations?” Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani asked. “If you wish to insist on the liberation of hostages, why then do they assassinate all negotiators?”The speech was unusually fiery for the 45-year-old ruler of Qatar, which has served as key mediator in an effort to reach a ceasefire in the war.Advertisement
“There is no room to deal with such a party that’s cowardly and treacherous,” he added. “Those who work consistently to assassinate the party in these negotiations will certainly do everything to ensure the failure of these negotiations. When they claim that they seek the liberation of hostages, that’s a mere lie.”Sheikh Tamim also denounced Israel over what he called the “genocide” it is committing in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies it is committing genocide. It says Hamas is prolonging the war by not surrendering and releasing the hostages.A variety of regional leaders attended the summit, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Syria’s interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa.Advertisement
Iran, which hit a base in Qatar in June, is attending the summitThis handout image provided by Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows a preparatory meeting in Doha on Sept. 14, 2025, on the eve of an Arab-Islamic summit organized in response to Israel's unprecedented strike on Hamas leaders in the Gulf country.Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs/AFP via Getty ImagesAfter the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites in June, Iran struck Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, a major hub for American forces — a move that angered Qatar. Nevertheless, Iran sent President Masoud Pezeshkian to attend Monday’s meeting. Before leaving Tehran, Pezeshkian noted the wide breadth of nations Israel has attacked since Oct. 7.“This regime has attacked many Islamic countries,” he said. “It does whatever it wants, and unfortunately, the United States and European countries also support these actions.”Advertisement
Writing on the social platform X, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi added: “Iran stands with Qatar and indeed all Muslim brothers and sisters, particularly against the scourge that is terrorizing the region.”Araghchi and Pezeshkian did not mention Iran’s attack on Qatar and received an honor guard welcome when landing in Doha.Qatar has been key in Israel-Hamas ceasefire talksU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio appears at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the latter's office in Jerusalem, on Sept. 15, 2025.

Qatar, an energy-rich nation on the Arabian Peninsula that hosted the 2022 World Cup, long has served as an intermediary in conflicts. For years, it has hosted Hamas’ political leadership at the request of the U.S., providing a channel for Israel to negotiate with the militant group that has controlled Gaza for years.But as the Israel-Hamas war has raged on, Qatar increasingly has been criticized by hard-liners within Netanyahu’s government. Netanyahu himself has vowed to strike all those who organized the Hamas-led attack on Israel in 2023. And since last week’s strike, the Israeli leader has doubled down on saying Qatar remains a possible target if Hamas leaders are there.On Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump offered renewed support for Qatar.“We’re with them. You know, they’ve been a great ally,” Trump said. “A lot of people don’t understand about Qatar. Qatar has been a great ally, and they also lead a very difficult life because they’re right in the middle of everything.”Advertisement
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in Israel on Monday for meetings with Netanyahu and other Israeli officials to express America’s concern over the attack on Qatar and talk about Israel’s planned new offensive on Gaza City.Rubio declined to address Israel’s strike while speaking to journalists in Jerusalem, but said that America wanted to work with all its partners in the region on stopping Hamas and reaching a ceasefire in the war.“We’re going to continue to encourage Qatar to play a constructive role in that regard,” Rubio said.Netanyahu again added that Israel’s decision to attack Qatar “was a wholly independent decision by us.”Advertisement
Netanyahu faces increasing pressure from the Israeli public to end the war and bring home the 48 hostages still held in Gaza, whom 20 are believed by Israel to still be alive.The Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to the abduction of 251.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It says around half of those killed were women and children.Advertisement
The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts view its figures as the most reliable estimate of war casualties. Israel disputes them but has not provided its own. Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
