Grab it before the deal it's gone.By Kevin CortezShopping EditorSep 20, 2025, 07:00 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTAmazonThis MagSafe wallet straps your cash to your iPhone.I’m one of those people who frequently taps their pockets to ensure they’ve got their essentials — keys, wallet and smartphone — before heading out the door. If I tap a pocket expecting to feel one of those three items and it turns out empty, I do what’s natural to me: I freak the hell out.But if you share my misplacement anxieties and instant freak-outs about it, you’ll probably appreciate this solution: A MagSafe-compatible wallet. Rather than checking to see if you have your wallet and iPhone, this magnetic card holder attaches directly to your phone to combine them both. In other words, your phone is your wallet and your wallet is your phone, and that’s that. We found a slim, suede wallet that connects to your FindMy app, which will help you always find your wallet in case you misplace it. Many reviewers are calling it functional, stylish and even “life-changing.”Advertisement
$60 at AmazonA minimalist’s dream, this wallet is slim and has enough space to carry a few cards, thus, reducing bulk on your person. It’s compatible with the FindMy app, which lets you track your wallet’s place even when it’s not attached to your iPhone, and it’s made of a suede-like leather that feels and looks great. Reviewers say the magnet is ultra-strong and won’t detach easily, in case you’re sliding it in and out of your pocket all day. While it’s available in several colors, take note that the lowest price right now is only on its blackberry colorway with the taupe option following closely behind.$60 at AmazonAdvertisement
Nab this functional iPhone wallet while it’s on sale and take a look below to see how reviewers love theirs for daily use.“I’m probably over-exaggerating, but it’s really changed the way I go about my day-to-day. I got to the point where I was carrying a set of keys (two car key fobs, plus other keys for business and mail), a traditional wallet, and my iPhone. As you can imagine, not only were my pockets bulging, but my iPhone was getting scratching up more than my wallet was taking abuse. While this “wallet” only holds three cards, I carry my driver’s license, a personal credit card, and business credit card. The latter two are only b’c some gas station and restaurants don’t take NFC payment. Otherwise, I’m using Apple Pay from my watch and phone. I’ve essentially slimmed down my traditional wallet and rely on Apple Pay now more than ever. I keep a small wad of cash ($10+/–) in my car and each of my bags just in case of emergency. My pockets are lighter than ever. I can find this wallet if I ever lose it using Find My. And my keys now only make holes in my pockets, no more scratches on my conventional wallet or phone.” — paloaltan “I love Wallet! It’s made my life so much easier. Instead of carrying around a bulky wallet, I just stick this thing on the back of my phone, and boom—all my cards and cash are right there when I need them. It’s more of a dark blue color rather than black. Still, it looks really good though. Overall, I’m really impressed with this wallet. It’s convenient, easy to use, and it looks good. If you’re tired of lugging around a big wallet, give this thing a try. You won’t regret it!” — Logan “I really love this Apple wallet! The material feels high-quality, and it has a nice texture that looks great. The magnet is super strong, so it stays attached to my phone without slipping. It holds a few cards perfectly and doesn’t make my phone feel bulky. One of my favorite features is that it connects to the Find My app, which gives me peace of mind if I ever misplace it. I’ve been using it every day, and it still looks brand new. If you’re thinking about getting one, I’d definitely recommend it!” — Sguest11 “The Apple MagSafe Wallet is the gold standard—period. It never comes off your phone unless you want it to, and the cards? They slide out perfectly every time. No more struggling like a doofus in line, biting and yanking at stuck cards. This wallet is tight, feels premium, and just works. Yeah, it’s pricey, but you’ll forget that the moment you realize how much you love it. Grow up and get it—you won’t regret it.” — D “I don’t typically review things, but this wallet is just fantastic. I’ve resisted getting one for a long time, since I didn’t feel like I needed one, but after trying some cheaper 3rd party ones I was turned off the concept all together. None of the other ones I tried fit the 13 mini properly and just stuck out the side. Also none had a great finish. I decided to give this one a try and I’m shocked by how well it fits and how nice it feels. Holds a few cards and an ID perfectly for just grabbing your phone and not needing to worry about a wallet. Finish feels nice and bonus of being able to use with FindMy. We’ll see how this holds up, but so far I’m very impressed.” — P.
