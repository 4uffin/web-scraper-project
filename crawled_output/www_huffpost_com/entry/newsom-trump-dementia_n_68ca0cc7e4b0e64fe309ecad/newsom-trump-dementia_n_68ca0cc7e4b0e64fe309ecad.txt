Log in to hide these messages.'Take Your Dementia Meds': Gavin Newsom Fires Back At Trump With New List Of 'Lies'Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker also speculated about the president's neurological health during a separate conversation.By Ed MazzaDeputy Editor, Trends, HuffPostSep 16, 2025, 11:20 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGPresident Donald Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) traded barbs on social media on Tuesday, with plenty of name-calling. Trump trashed Newsom as “Newscum” ― a name he often uses for the governor ― while Newsom’s press office accused the president of suffering from dementia.Advertisement
At least one other Democratic governor, Illinois’ JB Pritzker, also suggested the president may have “some” dementia during an unrelated discussion on Tuesday. Trump lashed out at Newsom in a lengthy post on Truth Social, claiming the governor is “is in final stages of approval” for low-income housing in the “super luxury” Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles after the devastating fires earlier this year. He also claimed Newsom “allowed their houses to burn” by “not accepting” water from the Pacific Northwest. Advertisement
Neither claim is accurate; Newsom over the summer announced funding to rebuild low-income housing lost to the fires, and Trump’s water claims have been repeatedly debunked. Newsom and his press office team, who have been trolling Trump and other right-wing figures on X, say they found five lies in Trump’s statement. “Take your dementia meds, grandpa. You are making things up again,” they wrote, along with a fact-check: Advertisement

Elsewhere on Tuesday, Pritzker dropped the “d” word during a discussion of Trump’s threats to send the National Guard into Chicago, as he has done in Washington, D.C., ostensibly to fight crime. But he said Trump hasn’t been consistent in his statements about the city. “Sometimes, he forgets,” Pritzker said. “I think he might be suffering from some dementia. The next day, he’ll wake up on the other side of the bed and stop talking about Chicago.”He added: “It’s hard to believe anything he says.” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) on President Donald Trump flip-flopping on whether he is sending the National Guard to Chicago:"I have said before that you can't take anything he says seriously from one day to the next ... Sometimes, he forgets. I think he might be suffering… pic.twitter.com/v2owSHmTsk— Heartland Signal (@HeartlandSignal) September 16, 2025Advertisement
