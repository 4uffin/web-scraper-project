“They’ve all gone out of their way to say, ‘Isn’t it horrible what happened to Jimmy Kimmel?’” said Dowd, the chief strategist of George W. Bush’s 2004 reelection campaign.Dowd later accused “Morning Joe” hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski of “basically saying they were glad” he was terminated on their show the day after he got the boot.“And now today, they’re talking about how awful it is for our country that somebody like Jimmy Kimmel can’t say what he said, and he is indefinitely suspended, and not an iota about what their employer just did to another employee,” he continued.Advertisement
Following threats from President Donald Trump’s administration, ABC’s decision to pull Kimmel’s show off the air has sparked outrage from late night hosts old and new as well as others who have sounded the alarm over the move, calling it an attack on free speech.In the days since ABC’s decision, MSNBC has featured takes from the likes of presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who called the move “Nixonian” in nature, and conservative writer Matt Lewis, who remarked on the right’s new “cancel culture.”MSNBC has zero moral authority to talk about cowardice of Disney, ABC, or Republicans for bending the knee to MAGA when they did exact thing in their termination of me and others.

Dowd was fired in the wake of comments he made after Kirk’s shooting but prior to reports that he had died. Referring to Kirk as a “divisive” figure, he told MSNBC’s Katy Tur, “You can’t stop with these sort of awful thoughts you have, and then saying these awful words, and not expect awful actions to take place. And that’s the unfortunate environment we’re in.”Dowd’s firing sparked a flood of people facing consequences over their comments about the assassination.Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.
