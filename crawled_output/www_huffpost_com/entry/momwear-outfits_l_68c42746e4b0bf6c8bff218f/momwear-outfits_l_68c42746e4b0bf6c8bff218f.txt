When you’re the mother of a newborn, you’re lucky to fit in brushing your teeth and taking a shower the same day. As time passes, you’re in need of a few reliable items to form what stylist Liz Teich calls a “momiform” that will take you from home to work to piano recital to school conferences to ... wow, no wonder you’re tired.But take heart. “Momwear” is a trend-setting topic among fashion stylists, who’ve noticed that different generations have chosen to emphasize certain looks and pieces. “Mothers are leaders in fashion, they really are,” said stylist Ivy Coco Maurice. “They’re also walking history books, and there’s so much you can learn from them.” Advertisement
Here are the signs you might be wearing a momiform, based on your generation.The one style everyone chooses, at least at first: roomy, comfy athleisure“The commonality of clothing choices for mothers, especially new mothers, is athleisure wear, including leggings, tanks, lightweight jackets and ballcaps,” said stylist Nikki Steele. Most stylists, unsurprisingly, aren’t fans of the off-to-the-gym look and offer an alternative. “Some moms overlook that you can be just as comfortable in non-athleisure pieces that work for you, yet feel stepped up a notch,” Teich chimed in. But you know what? You do you.MoMo Productions via Getty ImagesThe leggings and the oversized T-shirt are a dead giveaway.Advertisement
“With most of my mom clients, no matter which generation, there’s a consensus of easy outfit pairings, comfort, durability and functionality,” said stylist Sandra Veum. Moms of all ages appreciate plenty of pockets, layering options for long days and a diaper bag or mom “go bag” that’s sleek but spacious enough to carry all the gear needed throughout the day. And shoes, while cute, must always be comfortable enough to allow for playground sprints, games of tag and treks through the school parking lot.If you’re ready to wear more than just leggings, you’ll find that some super-comfy clothes have been rebranded for a coolness factor, said Tracey Panek, a fashion historian for Levi Strauss & Co. She mentioned the marketing effort behind what many now call “mom jeans.” She said, “When Levi’s introduced a new high-waisted ‘mom jean’ in 2016, they called it the ‘Wedgie.’ It made the jeans sound edgier and cooler than calling them mom jeans. Personally speaking, I don’t want to be criticized for wearing ‘mom jeans,’ and I’ve found that marketing seems to matter more to moms.“As a mother of three children, I’ve purchased roomier-fitting ‘boyfriend’ jackets and jeans and felt cool doing so,” Panek said. “If the same clothes were labeled as ‘mom’ fits, I would probably remove the label, like women used to do with Levi’s jeans label, since it revealed one’s waist size. We women and mothers prefer to keep those facts to ourselves.”Advertisement
Mom styles differ by generationEach generation has its favorite “go-to” items, Steele said, outlining the favorite wardrobe pieces of each age group. “For Gen Z, it’s a hoodie. For millennials, it’s leggings. For Gen X it’s jeans and for Boomer grandmas, who are usually the best dressed of them all, it’s a button-down, probably in white,” she said.“I find that Gen Z and millennials have the biggest shock when they become moms,” Teich said. “They lean hard into wearing leggings and a sweater or sweatshirt, and they have a focus on comfort that often sacrifices style.”Teich added, “Gen X and Boomers tend to have invested in better quality items over time, which makes it much easier to curate a wardrobe. But like other generations of moms before them, they tend to have forgotten investing in quality basics for their closet, so they’ll have great one-off pieces that don’t work with other items in their wardrobe, so they tend to reach for the same things.”Advertisement
These older clients, she said, “tend to resist tucking in tops.” And she noted a blast from the past they insist on clinging to. “They just aren’t letting go of the long top [and] skinny pant look, even though it can be unflattering,” she said. “It adds bulk where we don’t want it, especially as we age.”Ryuichi Sato via Getty ImagesBehold, the classic Boomer white button-down.Dressing for the ’gram (young moms) vs. Pinterest inspiration (older moms)One of the biggest generational divides comes down to the importance these moms place on social media dictating their style. The influence of social media seems to weigh more heavily on younger moms. “What I do see is that Gen Zs and millennial moms feel more pressure to follow ‘mom looks’ and guidelines from social media,” Veum said. Top mom-fluencers for this younger set include Jodie Marie Slater, Aimee Song, Eva Chen and Sai De Silva.Advertisement
Pop culture is also influencing moms’ fashion choices, and Maurice has clocked what’s being called grandmillennial style, or the “granny-chic” rebellion. “Millennial moms are returning to the ’90s,” Maurice said. “I see lots of oversized clothes that would be right at home on ‘Full House’ or ‘Family Matters’ episodes. It’s very much an Aunt Becky look with flats, polka dots and lots of yellow and cream colors.”When it comes to older Gen X and Boomers, Veum noted that they often skip scrolling and shop at their preferred stores for inspiration. “They approach social media, often Pinterest, more for inspiration than strict rule-making about dressing a certain way,” she added.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

By the time moms want to finally spend time on themselves, they’ve forgotten what that even looks like. I love helping clients regain their style back and feel good about themselves while still conquering the many roles of a being a great mom.”Advertisement
