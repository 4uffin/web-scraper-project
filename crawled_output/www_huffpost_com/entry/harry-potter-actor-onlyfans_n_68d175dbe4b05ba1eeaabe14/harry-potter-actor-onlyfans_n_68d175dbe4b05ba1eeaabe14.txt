Jessie Cave, who appeared as Lavender Brown in the series and is best known for being Ron Weasley’s girlfriend for a short time, wrote about her experience on her Substack.Advertisement
She aptly titled her entry “Only Wingardium Nakediosa,” a play on the famous Harry Potter spell, “wingardium leviosa.” Jessie Cave, from left, Emma Watson and Bonnie Wright pose during the photocall of "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" on July 6, 2009, in London.Dave M. Benett via Getty Images“I found out that I didn’t get booked for a Harry Potter convention recently, as I’m now doing OnlyFans,” she said in her post last week, which also celebrated six months on the OnlyFans platform.Advertisement
“They explained it was because it’s a ‘family show and OnlyFans is affiliated with porn,’” Cave said. She explained that “This was baffling to me as some actors who do conventions (most actors, actually) have done TV and films in which they’ve done sex scenes and nudity. I’m just playing with my hair!” Despite the controversy, Cave said she isn’t “upset about the prospect of no more Harry Potter conventions.” Advertisement
“There’s going to be a new cast now and it’s a different time. Plus, I have done conventions for over 15 years and have enough photos and wizard memorabilia,” the 38-year-old added.

She wrote about her new career venture, and finding it both freeing and empowering, on both her Instagram and her most recent Substack entry. “I’ve taken control of my own career, and I’m not relying on anyone but me to make things happen,” she said in a post on Monday. “It’s going to be harder this way, but more fulfilling. I won’t be waiting for emails or validation and it’s exhilarating, I can breathe again.”Relatedharry potterOnlyFansNew ‘Harry Potter’ Star Responds To Calls For Him To Leave The Series Over J.K.
