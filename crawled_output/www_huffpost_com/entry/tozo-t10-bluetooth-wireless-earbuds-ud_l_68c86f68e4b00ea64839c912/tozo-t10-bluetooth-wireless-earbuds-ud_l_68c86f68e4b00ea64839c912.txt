Finding the perfect pair is crucial, but that doesn’t make it any easier to accept the steep prices of many headphones, which can be well over $100. You might be pleased to know, then, that we found a pair of wireless earbuds with hundreds of thousands of rave reviews — and they start at just $20.$20 at AmazonAmazonThe Tozo T10 wireless earbuds.Advertisement

And despite the cheap price, many reviewers say they’re comparable or even work better than more expensive AirPod models, especially when it comes to the sound quality. You can thank the ORIGX professional tuning and acoustic technology for that, as well as the Tozo app that lets you fine-tune the audio to your liking with 32 preset modes.The T10s, which come in two sizes and six colors, can last for up to 10 hours on a single charge. The charging case can give the earbuds up to 45 hours of juice before it needs a charge itself. The earbuds are sweat-, water- and rain-resistant, so taking them to the gym or out and about is, well, no sweat. Some reviewers even put them through the washing machine and proudly reported that they still work just fine.When it comes to fit and convenience, the T10s also excel. Many reviewers note the comfort of the T10s’ various silicone tips for a snug, personalized fit. The earbuds also have a smart touch control to make it possible to switch songs, take calls and adjust the volume with a single touch. They also connect via Bluetooth to smartphones, laptops and more with a simple setup.Advertisement
Multiple reviewers highlighted Tozo’s excellent customer service if they ever ran into issues, and honestly, at a price this low, what do you have to lose? Give the Tozo T10s a try by clicking the link below, and check out some of the many, many gushing reviews from happy shoppers who agree that these earbuds are an absolute steal.$20 at Amazon“I cant speak for how long these will last but for $25 I don’t care if they only last me 6 months. They blow my AirPods out of the water from a sound quality perspective, comfort everything! I got these because I was sick and tired of my AirPods falling out at the gym whenever I bent down. Figured I’d get something inexpensive that I wouldn’t mind getting battered around a bit - not really expecting much from them other than that they would stay in ears better. Super impressed by the sound quality and how they stay out during a sweaty workout. These will replace my AirPods in every other use and 100% would recommend” — Ashleighh92“These are hands down the best earbuds, and quite possibly headphones, I’ve ever had. The sound quality is comparable to headphones I’ve had in the $100+ range, and is adjustable in app which I think is honestly really cool. They also came with multiple sizes of the.... silicone cover things?? Idk what they’re called, but it was really appreciated because I need two different sizes; this was a major part of the rating as it made them by FAR the most comfortable earbuds I’ve ever used. Plus the battery life is excellent, and the case charges fast. I used these on a 14 hour drive without any issues. The waterproofing is also really cool and works as advertised.Also, the customer service was absolutely incredible. They were very nice and direct about what they could do and were able to solve my issue in a matter of like 5 emails.If you need earbuds I’d definitely recommend these :)” — Jacob McBeth“This is my second pair of TOZO Earbuds, and I’m more than satisfied with this version, T10. I also still use my T6 version. They are the most comfortable earbuds that I’ve ever used, as most don’t fit and leave my ear canals sore and tender. The cost is unbeatable, and the first pair has lasted me through about four years, doing exercise, falling into water, etc. I love this brand!” — robyn easley“I have had these now for well over a year and use them almost daily. Props to the longest battery life EVER, and for being small enough to fit in my little purse! I have dropped in the shower multiple times and each time, they continue to work. After one particularly rough drop the back of my right earbud (the flat part) broke away from the earbud (in 1-inch deep water even), I just picked it back up, wiped it off, popped it back in place, and went on about my way with no problems! These are the BEST I’ve ever had and I will probably purchase another pair when I end up losing one of these at some point... They don’t have the ambient sound feature (at least not on my phone) so when someone talks to me I have to turn whatever I’m listening to off/down or remove one from my ear, but other than that, they are 100% perfect for what I needed.” — JF$20 at AmazonFor more headphone options, check out this roundup of HuffPost reader favorites by shopping writer Griffin Wynne:1AmazonJBL Vibe wireless earbudsAnother quality name in the audio world, JBL's popular earbuds offer up to 32 hours of battery life, with eight hours of direct play via the earbuds alone and 24 hours of charge with the case. And if you ever forget to charge them, you can speed-charge for two hours of listening time in just 10 minutes. They’re hands-free, meaning the ergonomic shape will stay in your ears, helping you fade out external sounds and get totally into whatever you’re listening to. Make calls on the go with a “VoiceAware” program that lets you limit how much of your own voice you hear as you talk. These earbuds are water and dust-resistant, perfect for taking on the trail, mowing the lawn or using while working out or working at your desk. Per Amazon, the JBL brand has low return rates, and over 100,000 customers have rated JBL items highly. If you’ve been looking for a high-quality pair of headphones at an almost drugstore price, we recommend snagging a pair of JBL wireless buds.Promising review: "These are without a DOUBT the best earbuds I have ever owned. That sound quality is PHENOMENAL. The amount of bass is unbelievable. And the fact that you can use the app which has an equalizer you can adjust yourself. Also, if you lose them the app can show you where to look. All around great buy.” — Nelson Eugene Perry$35 at Amazon2AmazonTozo T10 waterproof earbudsThese waterproof earbuds have racked up 245,000+ 5-star ratings and an overwhelming number of positive reviews on Amazon that attest to their versatility, durability, sound quality and also the fact that they perform just as well as pricier options. Don't stress about charging, as these keep a charge for over 40 hours and have an IPX8 waterproof rating, meaning they can be submerged in up to one meter of water for up to 30 minutes.Promising review: "These are great and I have 2 pair. I found out they are truly waterproof because I dropped them in the hot tub and they were down for about 5 minutes while I looked for them. It was a big deep public hot tub. Found them, shook them off and let them dry. They still worked perfectly." — Arike Ifaremi $20 at Amazon3BoseAn open-ear option from an iconic brandBose made quite a splash when they first released their Ultra Open Earbuds in 2024 and the adoring reviews have been rolling in ever since. Water-resistant and designed to fit like a cuff around your ear, find the color that speaks to you and queue up your favorite playlist.Promising review: "Good sound quality, They stay on your ear real well. I use them while biking and they don't fall off. Only took a day to get used to. These are open headphones so just remember, no sound cancelling and these aren't going to be the greatest for loud environments, but they are great for their normal use." — Kobbs1$229 at BoseAdvertisement
4AmazonA pair of colorful over-ear budsCome for the fun colors, but stay for the comfort and sound quality. This over-ear option has up to 40 hours of listening time between charges and controls on the earbuds for easy listening.Promising review: "I love these headphones !!! So comfortable to wear and stays on your ear well and comfortable. Seeing they are sports related and are water resistant I have even worn them in the shower as long as I’m not washing my hair. Case recharges them when docked and auto connect when removed. Definitely recommend to anyone who loves music in the background without having everyone hearing it. Wearing one at the time gives one on standby for when you want to switch ears and you can still hear everything else going on around you. Great product and very well made, quality product" — Charlie Suzy$26 at Amazon5AmazonSecond-generation Apple AirPodsWithout a doubt, the consistent top-selling headphones here at HuffPost are the second-generation Apple AirPods. If you use a Mac computer or have an iPhone or iPad, these wireless earbuds automatically turn on and connect seamlessly between them. Truly, go from listening to music on your computer to taking a call on your phone in seconds without any fuss about disconnecting and reconnecting. They're Siri-enabled with a built-in microphone, five hours of direct playtime and an over 24-hour battery life with the charging case. Promising review: "AirPods are fantastic! They offer a seamless connection with my devices and deliver crisp, clear sound quality. The battery life is impressive, and they’re comfortable to wear for extended periods. The built-in mic provides excellent call quality, and the convenience of the charging case makes them perfect for on-the-go use. If you’re looking for reliable and high-performing wireless earbuds, AirPods are a top choice!" — Mayshin Keltner$190 at Amazon6AmazonOr Apple AirPods Pro 2nd generation wireless earbudsUpgrade your workout, daily commute and general podcast listening with a pair of second-generation AirPods Pros. With active noise cancellation and transparency mode, these AirPods can let you get totally absorbed in your music or let some noise through so you can be safe while out and about. They're water- and sweat-resistant so you can wear them in the rain or during a high-intensity jog. Best of all, they come with four different-sized silicone tips, only take an hour to charge and have up to six hours of playtime with active noise canceling. Made with Apple's H2 chip, these headphones have dynamic noise cancellation and personalized spatial audio, meaning the sound moves with your head and fits your personal ear shape. These have six hours of direct listening time and 30 hours with the charging case. Promising review: "AirPods Pro 2 are amazing. The Adaptive Transparency mode is absolute magic. I can wear it on the NYC subway and the terrible train noise is muted, but I can still hear the conductor's through the speakers or even chat with someone next to me. Noise Cancellation mode is also fantastic when the world is just too noisy. They are also usually much cheaper on Amazon than they would be if you bought directly from Apple. Pro tip: if you find concerts or movie theaters too loud, wear these and just don't play music. It's a great use of Adaptive Transparency mode and will really cut the loud sounds down." — Andrew$199 at AmazonAdvertisement
7AmazonOr the third-generation Apple AirPodsA third great option from Apple, these third-generation pods offer personalized spatial audio, which basically means the sound being transmitted fits your unique ear shape, head movements and your surroundings. Enjoy the "audio share" feature that lets you pair up multiple sets of AirPods — the modern equivalent of giving your friend the other wired bud. You'll also get Apple's new "pinch-perfect" feature, meaning you can control what you're hearing by quickly moving your fingers on the bud or say “Hey Siri” to activate phone controls. Both the AirPods and charging case are sweat and water-resistant. Plus, you'll get six hours of direct listening time and up to 30 hours with the case. Promising review: "My husband bought me these as my push present and I really like them. The sound quality is really good I love all Apple products. This time around the headphones are comfortable on my ears and they do fall of easily. Very light weight case." — Gaby Villanueva$135 at Amazon8AmazonAnker open-ear earbudsNo, you're not looking at some sort of futuristic earring — you're looking at a pair of open-ear headphones, and yes, that's a real thing. Rather than being pushed into your ear, this style from Anker is designed to attach to your cartilage, wrapping around the ear and sealing off the canal to play sound into it. They're meant to have a little give, but will keep their shape as you wear them walking, working out or lounging.Promising review: "So far I have worn these for about 5 hrs straight and can't even feel they are there, which is a record for me. I usually take my ear buds out after a couple of hrs max (probably why I lose them so much)! I also like to be able to move them around on my ear without removing them if need be! The sound is really nice don't have to feel like I have to such them up my ear drum to hear the bass. I recommend 10/10 so far, plus I think I'm starting a new ear accessory trend at work already talked a few people into buying them!" — ANGELA$40 at Amazon9AmazonBeats flex connected earbudsConnected to each other but wireless for your device, this set from Beats really gives you the best of both worlds. The earbud heads are magnetic and can stick to each other for easy storage or to keep them around your neck when they're not in your ears. The battery lasts for up to 12 hours between charges, with a built-in microphone and on-device controls that let you control your sound on the move. Best of all, these headphones have audio sharing letting you connect your sound with other pairs of Beats or AirPods. Promising review: "I have no interest in fully wireless earbuds as I know I'll lose them right away. Finding these Beats wireless earbuds that wrap behind the neck are perfect. I bought my first pair a few years ago when looking for an affordable option and I use them almost daily (my second pair is for keeping in my suitcase). I like that I can wear one (leaving one ear free to hear around me) or two, or I can let them both fall around my neck where a small magnet connects them, turns the sound off, and keeps them from falling off. I can control everything on the lightweight comfortable headset." — CarMela$40 at AmazonAdvertisement
10AmazonJBL Tune noise-cancelling ear budsLooking for noise-canceling, sweat-resistant wireless earbuds with a long battery life? You came to the right place.

They are a GREAT value for the money. I didn’t wamy to spend hundreds of dollars on more expensive options and the JBL reviews were positive. I am very pleased with the sound quality, bass, connectivity, and battery life. I usually get more than 12 hours of continuous use before charging. I recently compared the JBLs against the Apple pods and the JBLs were vastly better sounding.” — john$88 at Amazon11AmazonBeats Studio Pro overear headphonesWhen Oprah put these Beats Studio Pro over-ear headphones on her Favorite Things 2023 list, we knew they had to be good. The priciest option on the list, they boast superior audio quality and spatial tracking that automatically moves with you and adjusts the sound. Enjoy an impressive 40 hours of battery life with complete noise cancelation or transparency mode that gives you some sounds. Promising review: "I had beats a few years ago, and I liked them back then - I definitely like the new ones even more now. They have great sound, amazing noise cancellation, and sit super comfortably on ears. Battery lasts an insane long time, I had them on for 12 hours straight for my flight I they still had half charge left. They also look very stylish and I look forward to matching them to my new iPhone." — Randella$292 at AmazonRelatedshoppingTechheadphonesThe Best Noise-Cancelling Headphones You Can Get On AmazonYour AirPods Are Nastier Than You Knew, But This $8 Kit Will HelpThe Best Ear Hook Earbuds For People Who Always Lose Their HeadphonesThese Affordable Earbuds Might Be The Highest-Rated Tech We've Ever Seen Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
