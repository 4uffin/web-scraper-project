Kotb writes that she felt like “everything had shifted” and that the couple’s “‘us’ felt different.” During a session, Kotb wrote she “looked around at all the people who’d shared their raw truth” and she “felt so moved by their honesty.” “They deserved the same from me. So, I said it. I told the truth about why I had come,” she said in a book excerpt shared by Today.com. Advertisement
“‘I am a total phony in my relationships,’ I said. ‘I’m a pretender,’” Kotb admitted.

When asked by Today.com what she meant by identifying as a “pretender,” the author elaborated. “I think sometimes you know that a relationship is — I would say good — but you think to yourself it’s not deepening,” she shared.“I loved Joel then, and I love Joel now. I just had to remind myself that it was a different kind of love,” Kotb added. “You can still love and admire someone and not want to be in a relationship, a long-term relationship that way, personal relationship.” Advertisement
Kotb and Schiffman were first linked in 2013 and got engaged in November 2019. They share two adopted daughters: Haley and Hope.

“It’s not like something happened,” Kotb shared at the time. “They say sometimes relationships are meant to be there for a reason, for a season, or for a lifetime. And I feel like ours was meant to be there for a season.”RelatedengagementsToday ShowHoda KotbJenna Bush Hager Reveals The 1 Phrase A Boss Told Her Not To Use On-AirHoda Kotb Gets Emotional After Jason Segel's Stunningly Heartfelt ComplimentChelsea Handler Explains Why She Felt She Had 'No Choice' But To Split From Jo Koy Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
