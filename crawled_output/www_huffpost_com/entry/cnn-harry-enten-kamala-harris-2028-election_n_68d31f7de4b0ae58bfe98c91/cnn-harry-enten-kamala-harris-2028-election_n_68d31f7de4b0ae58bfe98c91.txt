Enten pointed to the former vice president’s net favorable rating (percent of those in favor minus percent not of those not in favor), which has dropped from -5 in October 2024 to -13 this month, according to Fox News polling.Among independents, that figure is at -37, per the poll.“If you can’t win independents, you can’t win the election,” Enten said.“And the bottom line is, with those in the center of the electorate, those who are the most up for grabs, she is way, way, way underwater. She is definitely swimming with the fishes.”Enten turned to early polling on potential 2028 Democratic presidential nominees that shows Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents have put Harris — who told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Monday that a 2028 run isn’t her “focus” at the moment — on the “back burner” in recent months.Advertisement
Back in April, 28% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents indicated that Harris was their top choice to be the party’s nominee in 2028. That figure has since dropped to 19%.The same demographic, meanwhile, has increasingly indicated that California Gov. Gavin Newsom is their top choice to be the party’s 2028 nominee, rising from 8% in April to 21% this month.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

He noted that while Harris had a 58% share of California’s vote in the 2024 election, 42% of voters in the state said they’d be “excited” if she ran for president again, according to a Politico poll from August.RelatedDemocratic Partykamala harrisCNNHarry Enten2028 electionsKamala Harris Breaks Silence On Potential 2028 Presidential CampaignKamala Harris Speaks Out On Why She Lost To TrumpKamala Harris Offers Lukewarm Endorsement For Zohran Mamdani's Mayoral BidCNN Data Chief Names The 1 Way Dems Look Like A 'Complete And Utter Mess' Ahead Of 2028 Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
