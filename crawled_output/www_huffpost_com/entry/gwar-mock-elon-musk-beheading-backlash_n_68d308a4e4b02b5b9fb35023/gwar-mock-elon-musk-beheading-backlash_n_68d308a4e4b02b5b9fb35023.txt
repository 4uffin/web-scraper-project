At another point in the performance, GWAR disemboweled an effigy of President Donald Trump.While faux executions are a standard part of GWAR’s schtick, some denounced the shock-rockers for their act.“This is incitement. They know exactly what they’re doing,” conservative social media agitator, Libs of TikTok, cried in an X post. “Democrats can’t help themselves. They love promoting violence.”Advertisement

Representatives for the self-appointed “Scumdogs of the Universe” scoffed at the suggestion they were inciting violence in a statement to the New York Post.“Normalizing violence? Humans don’t need GWAR for that,” it read. “There is nothing normal about the Looney Toon violence acted out on a GWAR stage. GWAR is absurdist spectacle. GWAR is to violence what the New York Post is to journalism. Ridiculous.”RelatedDonald Trumpelon musklibs of tiktokGwarPetition Calls For Statue Of GWAR’s Oderus Urungus To Replace Robert E.
