We had, like, a joke — there’s a cummerbund, and I forgot what it... I don’t know. All right, please welcome two-time Emmy nominee Sydney Sweeney,” Bargatze said.Advertisement
Sweeney walked up to announce the nominees without acknowledging the joke. Sydney Sweeney on the red carpet at the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Sept. 14, 2025.

Steven Cheung, White House communications director, weighed in on X to denounce the backlash as “cancel culture run amok.”Advertisement
