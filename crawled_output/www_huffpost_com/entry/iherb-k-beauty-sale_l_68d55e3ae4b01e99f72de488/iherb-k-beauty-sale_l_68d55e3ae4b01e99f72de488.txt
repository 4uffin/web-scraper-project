Whether it’s sunscreen that’s actually pleasant to wear or serums that make my skin look like glass, very few brands do it better in terms of innovation and high-quality ingredients at an affordable price (in my opinion).As a regular online consumer of the stuff, I’m always pleased to learn when a state-side retailer offers authentic K-beauty – as is the case with iHerb, a company that I had tagged as a destination only for natural supplements and essential oils. It turns out this hidden gem of a shop has a fruitful selection of Korean-made skin care and makeup, including many of my favorite brands and products. Advertisement
To sweeten the deal, iHerb is currently having its 29-year anniversary sale, which can help you save 29% on select, rotating inventory for a limited time. Some items are also eligible for a discount when you apply our exclusive code – 29AVHUFFPOST – at checkout. (We’ve indicated which of those items are on sale in the list ahead.)1iHerbA pore and wrinkle care essence with retinoidsUsing a brand-exclusive form of retinol called Reti-A, this concentrated essence targets enlarged pores and blackheads while smoothing the appearance of fine lines. This is due to retinoids' ability to promote collagen production, leading to skin that's smoother, plumper, and with a more even tone. And if retinol has caused you a lot of irritation in the past, this is a hydrating and gentler formula compared to other retinol-containing products. Use code 29AVHUFFPOST at checkout. $22 at iHerb with coupon code (regularly $28)2iHerbA plumping skin booster with six different peptidesDermatologists have previously told HuffPost that certain peptides can boost collagen production and elastin, which in turn can improve skin texture, firmness and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. This skin booster serum by Cosrx — the makers of the famous snail mucin essence — is packed with six different peptides to plump and renew the skin. The lightweight formula targets other skin concerns, like hyperpigmentation and dryness, and contains a unique ingredient called adenosine, which might have anti-aging benefits.Pre-order: $22 at iHerb3iHerbA magic and viral cushion foundationVideos of this unique K-beauty cushion foundation in skin-perfecting action have rapidly spread across social media in the past several months.

4iHerbA blackhead-removing deep-clean cleansing oilMost Korean skin care routines start off with an oil-based cleanser to effectively break down and remove sunscreen, makeup and impurities from skin before following up with a more traditional cleanser. This cleansing oil by Anua was made popular for targeting clogged pores and those stubborn nose blackheads, while claiming to help balance sebum production over time. This irritation-free formula contains a nourishing blend of vitamin E, plant extracts, seed oils, and, like most of Anua's products, heartleaf extract to help soothe red, troubled or acne-prone skin.$21 at iHerbAdvertisement
5iHerbA skin-plumping PDRN collagen gel sheet maskSourced from salmon DNA, PDRN is the latest Korean-loved ingredient for targeting volume loss and reduced elasticity. These popular gel masks start off opaque and become transparent as all of the infused goodness absorbs into the skin, leaving behind a complexion that's hydrated and glass-like. They have a concentrated infusion of PDRN, moisture-trapping hyaluronic acid and a low molecular weight collagen that can actually penetrate deeper into the skin for greater efficacy.Use code 29AVHUFFPOST at checkout.

$16 at iHerb with coupon code (regularly $20)8iHerbAn intensive repair cream, perfect for troubled skinThe Pyunkang Yul intensive repair cream is historically one of my favorite wintertime moisturizers for treating my chronically dry, red and irritated skin. In fact, every time I use it, I'm shocked that this very luxurious-feeling and slightly medicated formula costs less than $20. The ultra-hydrating shea butter base is packed with a copper tripeptide complex, an ingredient that's been proven to promote collagen production. In addition to several popular ingredients found in Korean formulas, like tree peony bark extract, this indulgent cream contains ceramides, which are essential for maintaining a healthy skin barrier.

I often throw the Clean It Zero balm into my cleanser rotation, especially the nourishing formula, which is "enriched with ginseng root and soybean peptide to provide extra hydration and nourishment to dry skin," according to the brand. This sorbet-like formula starts off as a solid and emulsifies into a rich, milky oil that melts away even waterproof mascara.

10iHerbA delightful birch juice sunscreen that feels like a sooting moisturizerLike many Korean sunscreen formulations, this hydrating daily sun cream by Round Lab is lightweight, non-greasy, fast-absorbing and doesn't leave a white cast.

Inside this pore-refining formula lies houttuynia cordata, an anti-inflammatory extract that may be able to calm troubled skin, whether it's caused by acne, rosacea, or other conditions. $23 at iHerb12iHerbA famous and deliciously effective snail mucin serumThis wouldn't be a K-beauty roundup with the Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence because, at this point,it has reached cult-like status and is probably one of the best-known products in Korean beauty.
