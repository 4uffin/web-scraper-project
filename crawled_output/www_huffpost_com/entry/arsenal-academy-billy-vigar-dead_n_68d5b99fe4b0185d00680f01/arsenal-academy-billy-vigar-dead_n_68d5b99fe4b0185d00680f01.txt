However, the efforts proved unsuccessful and he passed away early Thursday.Advertisement
“Our deepest condolences go out to the Vigar family and his many friends at this extremely difficult time,” Arsenal said in a statement. “Quick, powerful and fiercely determined... everyone at Arsenal Football Club is deeply sorry to hear of the tragic passing.”Vigar, a former Arsenal academy player, joined full-time for the 2020/21 season. He later spent time on loan with Derby County’s under-21s and Eastbourne Borough before joining Hastings United on a free transfer in 2024. He signed for Chichester City last month.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
