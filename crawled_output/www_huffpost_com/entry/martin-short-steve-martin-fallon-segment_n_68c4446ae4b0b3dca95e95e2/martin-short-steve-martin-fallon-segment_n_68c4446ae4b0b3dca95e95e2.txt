Several internet users were outraged that Fallon had platformed Gutfeld on his show, with one person writing, “Fallon has always been a ‘yes to everyone’ man,” and another saying, “There is no defense of this.”Nbc / Getty ImagesWell, it now seems like actors Steve Martin and Martin Short were also among those unhappy with Fallon for hosting Gutfeld on his show.Kevin Winter / Getty ImagesThis week, Short, Martin, and their “Only Murders in the Building” costar Selena Gomez appeared on Fallon’s show for a wide-ranging chat — and things got off to an awkward (but hilarious) start when the comedic duo immediately delivered a politically-charged roast.The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon / NBCAdvertisement
“Jimmy Fallon, or as the Epstein files know you as, ‘redacted,’” Short joked, to which Fallon awkwardly laughed and said, “That is interesting.”The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon / NBCShort continued by quipping, “Look how handsome you are! Your smile is like an email from Trump — all caps.”The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon / NBCAnd then, Martin chimed in. “I know we’re just being funny here, but honestly, of all the late-night hosts, I’ll miss you most… When you are deported to Uganda,” he said.The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon / NBCAdvertisement
As Fallon continued to awkwardly laugh at the jokes, Short appeared to shade him for having Gutfeld on his show. “Well, I just love [your] show, I wish I could see it more. But, you know, it’s on so late, and I’m kind of a Gutfeld guy,” he said.The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon / NBCTo this, Fallon did not laugh, and instead quickly muttered, “Oh yeah, interesting,” before swiftly moving the conversation along. Awkward!The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon / NBCNeedless to say, Short and Martin’s roast of Fallon has landed pretty well with internet users. One person wrote, “fallon looked incredibly uncomfortable the entire time and i love that,” while another added, “Love to see Fallon get really really really uncomfortable.”The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon / NBCAdvertisement
“Shout out to Steve Martin and Martin Short for running out of fucks to give long ago,” one user said.“You can see how uncomfortable Jimmy is, probably two of his heroes/mentors too just roasting him on his own show,” someone wrote, while one more person quipped, “He sure is having a hard time fake laughing this time.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
