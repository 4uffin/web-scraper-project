“Look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr told podcaster Benny Johnson last week. “These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or, you know, there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”Mamdani believes that canceling the town hall, which had reportedly been in the works over the past few weeks and was planned for Thursday, will be an effective way to highlight but also counter Trump’s crackdown on dissent, amNewYork noted. He also wants to shed light on the impact a potential permanent cancellation of Kimmel’s program would have on the show’s staff, it added.“We simply cannot accept any capitulation to Donald Trump’s attacks on our fundamental freedoms,” Mamdani said in a statement. “Now is the time for leadership that fights back with action, and collectively, we must use every tool at our disposal to send a message to Washington and corporate powers alike: our freedom to speech is not a bargaining chip.” Advertisement
