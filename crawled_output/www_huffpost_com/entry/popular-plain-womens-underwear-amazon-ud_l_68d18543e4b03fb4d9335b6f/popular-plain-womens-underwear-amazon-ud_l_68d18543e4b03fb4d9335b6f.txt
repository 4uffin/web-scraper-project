If you like your underwear soft, moisture-wicking and affordable, then we found the perfect pairs for you on Amazon in the form of this $22 5-pack of reviewer-adored cotton underwear.$22 at AmazonAdvertisement
Crafted from 95% combed cotton and just 5% spandex, these undies are designed to prevent sweat with their breathable fibers. Plus, the high-waisted, full-coverage silhouette promises to hug the body without any uncomfortable cutting. And get this: The wide crotch is intended to make room for pads and prevents bulkiness. No frills, tight waistbands, or scarce fabric — these may just be the ultimate comfort panties.This $22 5-pack has also garnered quite the loyal fanbase with a 4.6-out-of-5 star rating across more than 30,000 reviewers on Amazon — many of which are mothers and plus-size folks.Amazon reviewer Jasmine writes, “These underwear are great quality and amazing for postpartum.” She adds, “I bought these because I wanted something that was comfortable, high waisted and supportive. I’m so glad I made the purchase because it was exactly what I was looking for. The long pads that you wear after birth fit perfectly in the underwear. Now I use these garments as my period underwear. I would definitely recommend them.”But they’re not just fit for mothers, others love them too. “I’ve been seeking organic cotton underwear in plus-size for a while and have been disappointed repeatedly,” Amazon reviewer DR DeLuis writes. She continues, “These, however, seem to live up to their promises. The next day I washed the rest of these and found (so far) that they’re very comfortable, soft, stretchy without being baggy, and don’t irritate my sensitive skin. I’m definitely a fan and suggest giving these a try if you’re a comfort seeker…”What they lack in grandeur, these cotton undies make up for in practically everything else. They’re soft, roomy, and the perfect everyday panty. Plenty more Amazon reviewers have great things to say:“I purchased these based on reviews and they live up to the hype! I’m chunky with most of my excess weight on the front side and I wear higher waist panties because I have a problem with things rolling down. These don’t do that. After wearing the first pair overnight I went and ordered more. These are perfect. They never rolled down off of my belly and they haven’t dug in on the legs and middle area. They are soft and super comfortable! I wear a size 18 in jeans and ordered a size XL and the fit is perfect. I even feel like they have some tummy control in them.” — Amazon Customer“These high-waisted cotton brief undies are fantastic! The material is soft, breathable, and extremely comfortable for all-day wear. The high waist provides excellent coverage and support, making them perfect for everyday use. They fit true to size and retain their shape even after multiple washes. I appreciate the quality and comfort these undies offer. Highly recommend them for anyone looking for reliable and comfy underwear!” — RJ G.“When I opened the package I was concerned they’d be too tight like compression garments, but they aren’t. I just had surgery and was concerned they’d be too tight for my incision areas. They are fitted but not too much. Very soft and comfortable. I also bought the other color available.” — Julia“They fit great and are very comfy! I really like these panties. First the price is great compare to others. Secondly, the quality and fit are good. Lastly, they wash without losing their shape.” — Lorraine D.“After having a c-section I needed a pair of underwear that would be high enough to cover the incision and help tuck the extra skin. They are super comfortable and they don’t get loose or flimsy after washes. Will be buying more!” — Bri KincartRelatedshoppingWomen's UnderwearThe Most Comfortable, No-Frills Women's Underwear You Can Buy On AmazonThe Best And Worst Types Of Underwear To Keep You Healthy Down ThereThis Men’s Workout Underwear Is Actually Supportive, According To ReviewersThis No-Frills Amazon Underwear Has An Astonishing Number Of Reviews Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
