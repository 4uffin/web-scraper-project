Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done,” Trump wrote in a Wednesday Truth Social post. “Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! President DJT.”Advertisement
ABC’s decision followed conservative outcry over comments Kimmel made that Republicans were seizing on the shooting death of Charlie Kirk to score political points. It also came in the wake of threats by Trump-aligned Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, who urged ABC and Disney to take action over Kimmel’s remarks and warned that the agency could punish individual TV stations as well. “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said on his show Monday night. “In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
