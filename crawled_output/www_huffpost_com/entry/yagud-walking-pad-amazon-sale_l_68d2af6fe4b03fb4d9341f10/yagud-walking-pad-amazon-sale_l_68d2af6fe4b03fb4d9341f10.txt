Don’t beat yourself up: Try a walking pad instead. Sometimes known as an under-desk treadmill, it’s a portable machine that lets you get some movement from the comfort of your air-conditioned home. If you’re curious about trying one of these home devices for yourself, we just spotted a popular model from the brand Yagud currently on sale at 18% off. That knocks its price to just under $85!That’s a solid price for what one reviewer says has been a “total game changer for my energy and focus.” (According to multiple previous HuffPost reports, there is indeed a correlation between walking and back pain relief, so these reviewers’ reports are expert-backed!)Advertisement
$84.98 at Amazon (previously $103.28)AmazonThe Yagud walking pad goes up to 3.8 miles per hour, letting you do a variety of movements on it. And when you're done, it easily stores away.Whether you stick it under your standing desk or use it in front of your TV, reviewers say this handy pad has inspired them to be more consistently active, and in doing so, feel better in their bodies. “This walking pad has suited my needs perfectly; I was looking for something that would take up very little space, and could go mostly in the living room to use while watching TV, but was also easily movable if needed,” explains one reviewer. “It’s the perfect size for behind the couch, and easily tips to roll if I want to push it under a bed for storage, and is very lightweight to move alone, but I haven’t moved it yet, because after 2 months, I still use it constantly! It is such a good motivator to jump off the couch even for a few minutes at a time while watching TV.”The pad weighs only 36 pounds (with a weight capacity of 265 pounds) and goes up to 3.8 miles per hour. Easy to use out of the box, it also comes pre-assembled with a non-slip belt for steady movement, plus a silicone layer to reduce impact on knees, ankles and joints.Several users say this pad fits underneath their beds and sofas for easy storage. The wheels make it simple to move around the home, while the quiet running sound makes it un-disruptive during the day. (Though some mention the treadmill demands a plastic under-mat, for extra stability.) Advertisement
The LED display gives real-time numbers on your time, distance, steps and more, while the remote control lets you adjust the speed as you’re moving. $84.98 at Amazon (previously $103.28)Still need a little more info? Read on for more promising reviews from walkers and runners happy with their Yagud walking pad.“I decided to buy this walker because of the weather. Neither I, nor my Dog, enjoy walking in the rain. This unit resolves the issue for me. There are a couple of things you have to take into consideration. If you have ever used a tredamill, the walking surface is shorter that that of a treadmill. The Walking Pad provides multiple ‘speed’ opitons which you will need to figure out by Titration. That is finding the right speed for your gait. This may take time, but it is the solution to making this a walking pad a dream come true. The other consideration would be your sense of balance. There are no handles for you to grasp, so along with testing speed against gait, you have a third factor balance. All in All it is a dream come true, it just takes a bit of time to make it work for you. I’m in love with it and my dog is happy just to watch me.” —
MmeFroufrou “This walking pad has suited my needs perfectly; I was looking for something that would take up very little space, and could go mostly in the living room to use while watching TV, but was also easily movable if needed. It’s the perfect size for behind the couch, and easily tips to roll if I want to push it under a bed for storage, and is very lightweight to move alone, but I haven’t moved it yet, because after 2 months, I still use it constantly! It is such a good motivator to jump off the couch even for a few minutes at a time while watching TV. It doesn’t make much noise, doesn’t even require turning TV up. I followed the instructions for oiling it and centering the belt, and it’s never given me an issue. I love the remote and the digital readout to easily speed up/down, and track my progress. I can’t imagine even using it at it’s max speed just while watching TV and without having handrails, but for what I wanted it for and walking at a decent 2.8-3.0 pace, it is absolutely perfect. For the price, I am thrilled with this purchase!” —
Dr. RRizzo “I did a lot of comparisons when thinking about buying this walking pad. Price is usually my first consideration then reviews. I also had to consider size. An inch or two would have made a difference and this one ended up being perfect for my space. Overall this had the best reviews and price both which is hard to find. I have been using this walking pad since April and so far it has worked out well. The only thing negative for me is not having anything to hold on to like a regular treadmill, but this is perfect when you don’t have the room for anything else.
I keep it out because I use it often but it could easily fit under the bed too. I am happy with this purchase and surprised that functions as well as it does being so small and slim.” — Tracy “I’ve been using this Walking Pad Treadmill in my home office for a few weeks now, and it’s been a great addition to my daily routine. It’s compact and fits easily under my desk, which is perfect for my small space. The setup was super easy— basically plug and play-and the remote control makes it very convenient to start, stop, and adjust the speed while working.The LED display is clear and shows the basics like speed, time, and distance. It’s not super advanced, but it does the job well. The treadmill is surprisingly quiet, so l can use it during video calls without any distractions.If you’re looking for a simple, portable treadmill to keep moving during your workday or even to use casually at home, this one is definitely worth considering. It’s not for intense running, but for walking and light jogging, it works great.” —
