Einbinder, who took home the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy, started off her acceptance speech by joking that she was committed to the narrative of losing, but that winning was “punk rock” too.Advertisement
Einbinder thanked the creators of “Hacks” as she realized that she was going over the time limit with her speech, forcing a donation for the Boys & Girls Club of America tied to the award show to be reduced more and more as her speech continued. “I’ll pay the difference!” Einbinder shouted, as she began to wrap things up.Einbinder, a longtime Philadelphia Eagles fan and activist, then seized the moment to end her speech by getting political. “Go Birds, fuck ICE and free Palestine,” she shouted before departing the stage.

Einbinder expanded on her speech in the press room backstage after winning her Emmy. “I thought it was important to talk about Palestine because it’s an issue that’s very dear to my heart,” she said, adding that she also has friends working in Gaza right now. “I feel like it is my obligation as a Jewish person to distinguish Jews from the state of Israel because our religion and our culture is such an important and long-standing ... institution that is really separate to this sort of ethno-nationalist state,” Einbinder added. Einbinder wasn’t the only one to bring up Palestinians at the Emmys, as Meg Stalter made a statement on the red carpet by carrying a bag that read “cease fire.” Advertisement

“I am talking about the IAGS, the International Association of Genocide Scholars, who study thoroughly genocide and has declared it is a genocide,” he added. “That’s why we ask for a commercial and diplomatic blockade and also sanctions on Israel to stop the genocide.
