Kimmel’s return came nearly a week after his monologue about slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk drew the ire of Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, prompting his suspension. The move was roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. Advertisement
Meanwhile, a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas left one detainees dead and two others critically injured. While a motive was not immediately clear, Vice President JD Vance and other members of the Trump administration were quick to allege the shooting was an attack on the immigration enforcement agency. The Department of Homeland Security said no law enforcement officers were injured in the shooting.See previous updates here, and read the latest below:TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

41 minutes agoLi ZhouRandy Holmes via Getty ImagesDisney Is Steeling Itself For Retaliation From Trump: BloombergDisney is steeling itself for potential retaliation from Trump, now that ABC has brought "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" back on the airwaves, Bloomberg reports.Those concerns follow threats made both by the president and by his FCC Chair Brendan Carr.On Tuesday, Trump suggested that he could take legal action against ABC over the decision to air Kimmel, and previously, Carr had said that the FCC could review stations’ broadcast licenses over concerns that they aren’t serving the “public interest.”“There’s actions that we can take on licensed broadcasters,” Carr said in an interview last week. “And frankly, I think that it’s sort of past time that a lot of these licensed broadcasters themselves push back on Comcast and Disney and say, ‘Listen, we are going to preempt. We are not going to run Kimmel anymore until you straighten this out because we, licensed broadcaster are running the possibility of fines or license revocations from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion.’”Bloomberg reports that Disney had anticipated that the administration could go after the broadcast TV licenses it has, though it believes it has strong legal footing to fight back against these types of efforts.Disney also has business deals that need regulatory approval, however, which the administration could try to block, Bloomberg adds.ABC, Disney, the White House and the FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

3 hrs 18 mins agoRyan GrenobleTrump Makes No Mention Of Victims In Statement On Dallas ICE ShootingMore than 6 hours after a sniper shot three detainees at an ICE facility in Dallas, Trump finally acknowledged the violence on social media — yet made no mention of the victims.Instead, the president echoed the line propagated by senior administration officials earlier in the day that this was actually an attack on ICE.No law enforcement officials were injured in the attack.Earlier Wednesday, FBI Director Kash Patel shared what he claimed to be evidence of an ideological motive for the attack: Unspent shell casings from the scene, one of which appears to have “ANTI-ICE” scrawled on it in ballpoint pen. (A second shell casing also appears to potentially have writing on it, but it’s been turned from view.)Trump seized on the casing to preemptively ascribe a motive in the shooting and blame “Deranged Radical Leftists” for the violence.“It has now been revealed the deranged shooter wrote 'Anti-ICE' on his shell casings. This is despicable!” Trump wrote. “The Brave Men and Women of ICE are just trying to do their jobs, and remove the ‘WORST of the WORST’ Criminals out of our Country, but they are facing an unprecedented increase in threats, violence, and attacks by Deranged Radical Leftists.”Trump closed with a pledge to sign an executive order this week “to dismantle these Domestic Terrorism Networks” in line with his previous declaration naming the antifa movement as a terrorist organization.Advertisement

4 hrs 44 mins agoLydia O'ConnorVance Denies Trump Administration Pressured Disney To Suspend KimmelDespite the threatening comments made by FCC chairman Brendan Carr, Vance denied the Trump administration put any pressure on Disney to pull Jimmy Kimmel off the air."What is the government action that the Trump administration has engaged in to kick Jimmy Kimmel or anybody else off the air? Zero," Vance told reporters in North Carolina. "What government pressure have we brought to bear to tell people that they're not allowed to speak their mind? Zero."Ahead of Disney suspending Kimmel, Carr said on a right-wing podcast that "there’s going to be additional work for the FCC" if Disney didn't take action against Kimmel and called for broadcasters to preempt his show. Kimmel's late night show, which returned Tuesday, remains preempted by Nexstar and Sinclair, which own multiple ABC affiliates. Though the broadcasters have explicitly said that decision was in response to Kimmel's remarks about Charlie Kirk, Vance tried to paint it as a business decision and took a dig at Kimmel."To the extent that he's not back on the air, it's because he's not funny and has terrible ratings," he claimed.Advertisement

Gavin Newsom and other Democrats of encouraging violence against law enforcement when they've criticized Trump's immigration policies."When Democrats like Gavin Newsom ... say that these people are part of an authoritarian government, when the left wing media lies about what they're doing, when they lie about who they're arresting, when they lie about the actual job of law enforcement, what they're doing is encouraging crazy people to go and commit violence," Vance said.His remarks come after a shooter killed two detainees and critically injured another at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas. FBI Director Kash Patel released a photo on social media showing that a bullet found at the scene was inscribed with the words “ANTI-ICE.""You don't have to agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies, but if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell," Vance said.JD Vance: "When Democrats like Gavin Newsom say these people are part of an authoritarian government, when the left-wing media lies about what they're doing and who they're arresting and the actual job of law enforcement, what they're doing is encouraging crazy people to go and… pic.twitter.com/xRR3TjpnER— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 24, 2025Advertisement

Large, high-quality studies from many countries have all reached the same conclusion. Original studies suggesting a link were flawed and have been discredited," the WHO said in a statement.The statement did not explicitly reference Trump or any other members of his administration responsible for health policy.Advertisement

7 hrs 45 mins agoRyan GrenobleDHS, FBI, Cruz, Vance Rush To Cast Reported Shooting Of ICE Detainees As Attack On ICEFederal officials have thus far declined to confirm what multiple news outlets and local law enforcement have reported: That ICE detainees were among the three people shot at an ICE facility in Dallas.Instead, representatives for DHS and FBI, alongside Vice President JD Vance and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R), rushed to cast the shooting as an attack on ICE itself, with little evidence backing the suggestion at the time.Police sources told Fox Dallas and other outlets that the sniper died from a self-inflicted gunshot would after shooting three detainees. No ICE agents were injured.Despite these facts — or perhaps in deliberate ignorance of them — Vance responded by calling for an end to attacks on law enforcement.“The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop,” Vance said in a statement. “I’m praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families.”In her own statement on the shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed “there were multiple injuries and fatalities” while conveniently omitting the injured party.“While we don’t know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them,” she continued, perpetrating the falsehood that ICE — not immigrants — was attacked. “It must stop.”At a press conference, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Joe Rothrock stopped short of mentioning the victims, and suggested repeatedly that the attack was motivated by anti-ICE sentiment. He said "rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that were anti-ICE in nature."FBI Director Kash Patel went one step further and shared what he claimed to be evidence of an ideological motive for the attack: Unspent shell casings from the scene, one of which appears to have “ANTI-ICE” scrawled on it in ballpoint pen. A second shell casing also appears to potentially have writing on it — but it’s been turned from view.Notably, the FBI famously botched its presentation of shell casings recovered from the scene of Charlie Kirk’s murder earlier this month, claiming they bore “trans ideology” when further investigation revealed they did not.In his statement Wednesday, Patel also portrayed the shooting as a “despicable, politically motivated attack against law enforcement.” While he called on people to “pray for the injured and deceased,” he again failed to specify who, exactly, was injured. The obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop. I'm praying for everyone hurt in this attack and for their families. https://t.co/wEN3sqyGyQ— JD Vance (@JDVance) September 24, 2025See More Updates Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
