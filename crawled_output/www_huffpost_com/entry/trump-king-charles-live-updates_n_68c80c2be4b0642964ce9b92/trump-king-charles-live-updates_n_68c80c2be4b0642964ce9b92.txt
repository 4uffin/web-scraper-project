The move was roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. Advertisement
Trump has also turned up the heat on Attorney General Pam Bondi, calling her out for not swiftly bringing criminal charges against his political rivals, including New York State Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), amid his push to seek retribution from his adversaries.Meanwhile, Trump is in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, where about 150 members have said they will vote in favor of the recognition of a Palestinian state. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed the push as “largely symbolic.”Watch Trump’s remarks at the UN here:Advertisement

Santiago via Getty ImagesTrump Mocks United Nations During Speech To United NationsTrump began his speech at the UN by commenting on the teleprompter, which he said was broken. Looking down at his prepared remarks, he rattled off a list of things he believes he accomplished in the first eight months of his second term, from trade deals to a strong stock market. Once he got to his usual claim of having “ended seven wars,” though, the tone of his remarks took a turn.“It’s too bad I had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them,” Trump said. “I never even received a phone call from the United Nations.”He went on to describe an apparent incident with the building’s escalator.“All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that stopped right in the middle. If the first lady wasn’t in great shape, she would have fallen. But she’s in great shape. We’re both in good shape, we both stood,” Trump said.“These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,” he joked.Advertisement

The operation was reportedly captured on hidden cameras, but the investigation was shut down after Trump took office. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that Homan didn't take the money, but Homan himself didn't deny it during a Fox News appearance. "I did nothing illegal," he said. House Judiciary Committee Democrats led by Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said in a letter to the DOJ and FBI the reporting by MSNBC and others offered "powerful evidence that Mr. Homan may have committed multiple federal felonies, including conspiracy to commit bribery." Justice Department spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Advertisement

I look forward to meeting with you when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for," he continued.The meeting was originally set to take place Thursday.Advertisement

General Assembly, the U.S. Secret Service was quietly dismantling a massive hidden telecom network across the New York area — a system investigators say could have crippled cell towers, jammed 911 calls and flooded networks with chaos at the very moment the city was most vulnerable.The cache, made up of more than 300 SIM servers packed with over 100,000 SIM cards and clustered within 35 miles of the United Nations, represents one of the most sweeping communications threats uncovered on U.S. soil. Investigators warn the system could have blacked out cellular service in a city that relies on it not only for daily life but for emergency response and counterterrorism.Read more:Advertisement

"I always believed that if push came to shove, those titans of industry would be guardrails for our democracy ... And one by one by one, they have been silent. They have been, you know, yes, I use the word feckless," Harris said during a Monday interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow.Harris called on "titans of industry" to stand up to the president and cited boycotts as an effective tool to pressure them. "Perhaps it's because they want a merger approved, or they want to avoid an investigation," Harris said of corporations bowing to Trump. "But at some point, they've got to stand up for the sake of the people who rely on all of these institutions to have integrity and to at some point be the guardrails against a tyrant."Advertisement

Gavin Newsom's efforts to engage in redistricting in the state, emphasizing that Democrats needed to "fight fire with fire" as Republicans have gerrymandered maps in states like Texas. "It is absolutely the right way to go," Harris said in an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on Monday. "We tend to play by the rules. But I think this is a moment where you got to fight fire with fire."She also alluded to comments she made about Newsom in her new book, "107 Days." At one point, Harris wrote about Newsom failing to return her call as she tried to consolidate support for her presidential candidacy. "By the way, Gavin has a great sense of humor," she said. "You know, he's going to be fine."Advertisement
9 hrs 49 mins agoLi ZhouThe Washington Post via Getty ImagesHarris Elaborates On Buttigieg Excerpt In New BookIn a Monday interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, former Vice President Kamala Harris elaborated on an excerpt in her new book, "107 Days," that described how former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was her top pick for vice president.In that passage, she reportedly wrote that Buttigieg “would have been an ideal partner — if I were a straight white male.”"We were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man. Part of me wanted to say, Screw it, let’s just do it. But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk," Harris wrote, according to The Atlantic. Buttigieg responded to the excerpt by saying he and Harris hadn't discussed concerns about his sexual orientation. “My experience in politics has been that the way that you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you’re going to do for their lives, not on categories,” he added.Maddow asked Harris to weigh in on his response and how she viewed that decision. "With you running, as you know, you're the first woman elected vice president. You're a Black woman and a South Asian woman elected to that high office, very nearly elected president, to say that he couldn't be on the ticket effectively because he was gay. It's hard to hear," Maddow said. "No, that's not what I said. That he couldn't be on the ticket because he is gay. My point, as I write in the book, is that I was clear that in 107 days, in one of the most hotly contested elections for president of the United States against someone like Donald Trump, who knows no floor, to be a Black woman running for president of the United States, and as a vice-presidential running mate, a gay man. With the stakes being so high, it made me very sad, but I also realized it would be a real risk," Harris said.Harris added that the decision wasn't borne of prejudice and said she was potentially being too cautious in her thinking. "I think Pete is a phenomenal, phenomenal public servant. And I think America is and would be ready for that," she said. Advertisement

Sep 22, 2025, 6:46 PM EDTLi ZhouBloomberg via Getty Images‘Irresponsible’: Medical Experts Push Back On Trump Claims About Tylenol, Pregnancy And AutismThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists disputed Trump’s announcement linking Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism and slammed the administration’s guidance as “irresponsible” and “unsettling” in a Monday statement.“Today’s announcement by HHS is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children,” ACOG President Steven J. Fleischman said. “It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.”Fleischman went on to note that “not a single reputable study has successfully concluded that the use of acetaminophen in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children.”And while Trump argued that there's no “downside” if people abstain from Tylenol use while pregnant, Fleischman stressed that maternal fever and pain can be harmful if left untreated.“The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks,” he said.The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine similarly questioned the administration’s conclusions and stressed that it stood by guidance deeming acetaminophen “an appropriate medication to treat pain and fever during pregnancy.”Advertisement
Sep 22, 2025, 5:48 PM EDTLi ZhouSAUL LOEB via Getty ImagesTrump Cites Amish People While Pushing Anti-Vax ClaimsTrump repeated a number of anti-vax claims Monday, suggesting there are groups of people who don't utilize vaccines and who have "no autism.""I think I can say there are certain groups of people that don't take vaccines and don't take any pills that have no autism," Trump said during a White House event that attempted to link the use of Tylenol during pregnancy to autism, despite a lack of clinical evidence. "Is that a correct statement, by the way?" he paused to ask. "There are some studies that suggest that yeah, with the Amish, for example," Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. added.It's a point that Trump has made before and one that's been disproven by research. "Several studies have found that rates of autism within the Amish community are comparable to that of the general population, while other studies have indicated that the reclusive community’s cultural sensitivities around reporting may prevent autism from being identified early in Amish youth," The New Republic's Ellie Quinlan Houghtaling wrote in February.

Sep 22, 2025, 5:39 PM EDTSara BoboltzTrump Hammers Tylenol: 'You'll Be Uncomfortable'The president repeatedly told Americans not to take Tylenol while pregnant, using the brand name instead of the active ingredient, acetaminophen.“I just recommend strongly that you don’t use Tylenol unless it’s absolutely necessary,” he said.“I just want to say it like it is. Don’t take Tylenol. Don’t take it,” he said. “Fight like hell not to take it.”He urged pregnant women to "tough it out" instead of taking the painkiller. "Don't take Tylenol. There's no downside. Don't take it. You'll be uncomfortable, it won't be as easy, maybe. But don't take it," he said. "If you're pregnant, don't take Tylenol. And don't give it to the baby after the baby is born."Trump later added: "Everything I said, there's no downside to doing it. It can only be good."Advertisement
Sep 22, 2025, 5:06 PM EDTSara BoboltzTrump Goes Full Anti-Vaxxer, Announces Link Between Tylenol Use And Autism Despite Lack Of EvidenceThe president convened reporters to announce that his administration believes taking Tylenol during pregnancy is linked to autism, despite a lack of clinical evidence and contrary advice from leading U.S. health organizations.“Acetaminophen, which is basically commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good."The announcement was expected, as Trump has been teasing it for weeks. He said he was concerned about rising autism rates even before he entered politics.Trump went on to cast enormous doubt on the safety of childhood vaccinations, going so far as to suggest that avoiding the shots can decrease a child's risk of developing autism, as well.“They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies, it’s a disgrace,” Trump said. “I think it’s very bad. Looks like they’re pumping into a horse. You have a little child, a little fragile child, and a vat of 80 different vaccines, I guess, and they pump it in.”Advertisement

As a First Amendment guy, myself, I think he’s probably got it right. You don’t have to like what somebody says on TV to agree that the government shouldn’t be getting involved here," McConnell, the former Senate GOP majority leader, said in a social media post.Advertisement
