Kimmel’s return came nearly a week after his monologue about slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk drew the ire of Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, prompting his suspension. The move was roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. Advertisement

While a motive was not immediately clear, Vice President JD Vance and other members of the Trump administration were quick to allege the shooting was an attack on the immigration enforcement agency.

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. "Rarely are the corruption documents made public by the perpetrators," added Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) in a post on X, which cited a Truth Social message Trump shared over the weekend. In his Truth Social post, Trump pressured Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against Comey and others who've investigated him in the past. "The targeting of the President’s perceived enemies continues," Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) wrote in a post on X. "This is dangerous."Advertisement

"We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn't either.

4 hrs 21 mins agoSara BoboltzTrump Floats Conspiracy Theory About His OpponentsThe president shared a conspiracy theory about his opponents after falsely claiming that cities like Portland had been taken over for years by left-wing radicals, despite a complete lack of evidence. “We’re looking at the funders of a lot of these groups,” he said. “You know, when you look at the signs, and they’re all beautiful signs, made professionally, these aren’t your protesters who make the sign in their basement in the evening because they really believe it. These are anarchists and agitators — professional anarchists and agitators.”(It should be noted that Trump’s supporters, like those of other politicians and activist groups, held professionally printed signs at many of his rallies over the last decade.)“And they get hired by wealthy people, some of whom I know, I guess. Probably know,” he went on. “And wouldn’t know it at dinner with them, everybody’s nice, and then you find out that they funded millions of dollars to these lunatics.”His remarks came as he signed a national security memorandum about “anti-fascist” activism directed at Attorney General Pam Bondi, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

The move would supposedly further deter crime. "It's very interesting. Capital punishment, capital city. It's capital, capital, capital,” Trump commented. It may be difficult, however, to convince a Washington jury to agree the death penalty should apply in any given case. Pirro has already encountered uncooperative juries in recent weeks as she attempted to charge anti-ICE protesters in the district.Advertisement

The other two followed.But federal Medicaid is not available to undocumented immigrants by law. The officials appear to be referring to certain state Medicaid programs, which use state funding to cover health care for some low-income and disabled immigrants who lack permanent legal status. California, Colorado and Illinois have such programs, and the Trump administration has pledged to investigate them despite insisting on the importance of states' rights to self-governance in other arenas, such as abortion or public school education.

Denver Police don’t cooperate with ICE, thereby encouraging immigrants to report crimes to local authorities instead of avoiding them for fear of getting deported.The ad goes on to tout ICE’s signing bonus of up to $50,000, and student loan forgiveness.Denver Police Chief Ron Thomas isn’t too concerned."I think that that's a terrible job for terrible pay," he told Axios Denver earlier this week, adding he’s “not worried in the least” about officers getting lured away.The outlet noted DPD’s salary range of $71,633 to $110,204 annually is also much higher than ICE’s ($49,739 to $89,528).A DPD spokesperson told Denver7 that to the best of their knowledge “we have not lost any officers to ICE as part of their new signing and retention bonus program.”“The Denver Police Department does not currently offer signing bonuses,” the statement continued. “However, if you do a side by side comparison of the lowest starting salaries, new DPD officers earn nearly $22,000 more annually than new ICE deportation officers, and Denver Police officer wages increase significantly each year to the point that, currently, officers earn more than $110,000 annually just four years after graduating from our Academy.”Advertisement
