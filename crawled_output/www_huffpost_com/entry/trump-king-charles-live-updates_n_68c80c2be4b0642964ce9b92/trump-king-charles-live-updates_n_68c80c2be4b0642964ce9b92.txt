Late night host Jimmy Kimmel was suspended last week by ABC after his Kirk monologue drew the ire of Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr. The move was roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. Advertisement
Trump has also turned up the heat on Attorney General Pam Bondi, calling her out for not swiftly bringing criminal charges against his political rivals, including New York State Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), amid his push to seek retribution from his adversaries.Meanwhile, Trump is traveling to New York this week to attend the United Nations General Assembly, where about 150 members have said they will vote in favor of the recognition of a Palestinian state. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed the push as “largely symbolic.”The president is also expected to announce that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy could be linked to autism, while many scientists remain skeptical of any link between the two.Advertisement

"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show’s potential return."The decision is in line with indications it made last week, when the company released a statement saying: "Regardless of ABC’s plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform."Advertisement

1 hr 9 mins agoLi ZhouBloomberg via Getty Images‘Irresponsible’: Medical Experts Push Back On Trump Claims About Tylenol, Pregnancy And AutismThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists disputed Trump’s announcement linking Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism and slammed the administration’s guidance as “irresponsible” and “unsettling” in a Monday statement.“Today’s announcement by HHS is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children,” ACOG President Steven J. Fleischman said. “It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.”Fleischman went on to note that “not a single reputable study has successfully concluded that the use of acetaminophen in any trimester of pregnancy causes neurodevelopmental disorders in children.”And while Trump argued that there's no “downside” if people abstain from Tylenol use while pregnant, Fleischman stressed that maternal fever and pain can be harmful if left untreated.“The conditions people use acetaminophen to treat during pregnancy are far more dangerous than any theoretical risks,” he said.The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine similarly questioned the administration’s conclusions and stressed that it stood by guidance deeming acetaminophen “an appropriate medication to treat pain and fever during pregnancy.”Advertisement
2 hrs 7 mins agoLi ZhouSAUL LOEB via Getty ImagesTrump Cites Amish People While Pushing Anti-Vax ClaimsTrump repeated a number of anti-vax claims Monday, suggesting there are groups of people who don't utilize vaccines and who have "no autism.""I think I can say there are certain groups of people that don't take vaccines and don't take any pills that have no autism," Trump said during a White House event that attempted to link the use of Tylenol during pregnancy to autism, despite a lack of clinical evidence. "Is that a correct statement, by the way?" he paused to ask. "There are some studies that suggest that yeah, with the Amish, for example," Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. added.It's a point that Trump has made before and one that's been disproven by research. "Several studies have found that rates of autism within the Amish community are comparable to that of the general population, while other studies have indicated that the reclusive community’s cultural sensitivities around reporting may prevent autism from being identified early in Amish youth," The New Republic's Ellie Quinlan Houghtaling wrote in February.

Don’t take Tylenol. Don’t take it,” he said. “Fight like hell not to take it.”He urged pregnant women to "tough it out" instead of taking the painkiller. "Don't take Tylenol. There's no downside. Don't take it. You'll be uncomfortable, it won't be as easy, maybe. But don't take it," he said. "If you're pregnant, don't take Tylenol. And don't give it to the baby after the baby is born."Trump later added: "Everything I said, there's no downside to doing it. It can only be good."Advertisement
2 hrs 49 mins agoSara BoboltzTrump Goes Full Anti-Vaxxer, Announces Link Between Tylenol Use And Autism Despite Lack Of EvidenceThe president convened reporters to announce that his administration believes taking Tylenol during pregnancy is linked to autism, despite a lack of clinical evidence and contrary advice from leading U.S. health organizations.“Acetaminophen, which is basically commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism,” Trump said. “So taking Tylenol is not good. I’ll say it. It’s not good."The announcement was expected, as Trump has been teasing it for weeks. He said he was concerned about rising autism rates even before he entered politics.Trump went on to cast enormous doubt on the safety of childhood vaccinations, going so far as to suggest that avoiding the shots can decrease a child's risk of developing autism, as well.“They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies, it’s a disgrace,” Trump said. “I think it’s very bad. Looks like they’re pumping into a horse. You have a little child, a little fragile child, and a vat of 80 different vaccines, I guess, and they pump it in.”Advertisement

Ted Cruz's (R-Texas) concerns about Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr threatening to revoke broadcast licenses from networks like ABC News over comments made by late-night TV hosts about conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated last week."Well, my colleague, Ted Cruz, said it looked just like Goodfellas. As a First Amendment guy, myself, I think he’s probably got it right. You don’t have to like what somebody says on TV to agree that the government shouldn’t be getting involved here," McConnell, the former Senate GOP majority leader, said in a social media post.Advertisement

We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”Read more:Advertisement

"These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel or, you know, there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead."Advertisement

"They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!"Advertisement

(Trump would apparently be open to the idea.) Another asked whether the White House was concerned about a supposed rise in acts of violence by trans people. (They are.)But no one who was called upon had a question about the new H-1B restrictions, which sparked confusion and alarm as employers attempted to make sense of how the rules would apply to their workers. The White House offered clarifications after the initial announcement was made, but it remains unclear why officials gave conflicting statements.Advertisement

Specifically, Trump wants to see officials involved in his various indictments and impeachment hearings punished. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” the president wrote on Saturday.Asked about his threats of retaliation, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed that the actual weaponization of government power happened under the Biden administration.“We are not going to tolerate gaslighting from anyone in the media or anyone on the other side,” she said.Advertisement

9 hrs 1 min agoSara BoboltzAnother GOP Senator Backs Ted Cruz’s Trump CritiqueSen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) piped up Monday to say that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) had made an “important” critique of Trump and his FCC chair, Brendan Carr, after they successfully pressured ABC to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.Since Kimmel was unceremoniously yanked from the airwaves last week, most Republicans have shied from speaking out.“As Americans, we must cherish and protect free speech,” wrote Young, who sits on the Senate Commerce Committee with Cruz.He shared a link to a Wall Street Journal editorial board piece that praised the Texas senator and Sen. David McCormick (R-Pa.), who said he agreed with Cruz last week.“These are Senators with solid conservative credentials defending an important principle of liberty that conservatives embraced before President Trump’s second term,” the Journal’s editorial board said in the piece, titled "Ted Cruz's Finest Hour."“As Mr. Trump and his appointees escalate their use of government to punish opponents and coerce business, Republicans will have to decide if they want to rubber stamp this misuse of regulatory and prosecutorial power," they wrote.Cruz said on his podcast Friday that while he feels no love for Kimmel, booting the late-night host in response to threats from Carr was a “dangerous” step, as Democrats could opt to use the same power in the future, against conservatives.Advertisement
10 hrs 13 mins agoAndy CampbellIt Looks Like Trump Is Going To Claim Link Between Tylenol And AutismTrump told crowds at Charlie Kirk's memorial on Sunday he believes his administration "found an answer to autism" and that he'd follow up with an official announcement today.He suggested to reporters after the service that his big announcement follows an unsubstantiated claim that Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and the HHS have pushed over the last month: That there's a link between autism and acetaminophen — the active ingredient in Tylenol — taken during pregnancy.Asked Sunday to confirm that he was making the link, Trump told reporters, "We’re going to do it tomorrow, but I think it’s a very big factor."As NBC News reports, a recent study found no link between Tylenol and autism. And a spokesperson for Kenvue — which makes Tylenol — rejected the notion."We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism," the spokesperson told NBC News.Advertisement

"That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent and I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry, Erika."Trump also previewed an announcement he'll make tomorrow about autism, which his Health and Human Services secretary has repeatedly pushed misinformation around as a condition to be cured.See More Updates Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
