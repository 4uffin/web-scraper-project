Kimmel’s return came nearly a week after his monologue about slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk drew the ire of Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, prompting his suspension. The move was roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. Advertisement
Meanwhile, a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas left one detainee dead and two others critically injured. While a motive was not immediately clear, Vice President JD Vance and other members of the Trump administration were quick to allege the shooting was an attack on the immigration enforcement agency. The Department of Homeland Security said no law enforcement officers were injured in the shooting.See previous updates here, and read the latest below:TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

2 hrs 29 mins agoSara BoboltzTrump Floats Conspiracy Theory About His OpponentsThe president shared a conspiracy theory about his opponents after falsely claiming that cities like Portland had been taken over for years by left-wing radicals, despite a complete lack of evidence. “We’re looking at the funders of a lot of these groups,” he said. “You know, when you look at the signs, and they’re all beautiful signs, made professionally, these aren’t your protesters who make the sign in their basement in the evening because they really believe it. These are anarchists and agitators — professional anarchists and agitators.”(It should be noted that Trump’s supporters, like those of other politicians and activist groups, held professionally printed signs at many of his rallies over the last decade.)“And they get hired by wealthy people, some of whom I know, I guess. Probably know,” he went on. “And wouldn’t know it at dinner with them, everybody’s nice, and then you find out that they funded millions of dollars to these lunatics.”His remarks came as he signed a national security memorandum about “anti-fascist” activism directed at Attorney General Pam Bondi, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

The move would supposedly further deter crime. "It's very interesting. Capital punishment, capital city. It's capital, capital, capital,” Trump commented. It may be difficult, however, to convince a Washington jury to agree the death penalty should apply in any given case. Pirro has already encountered uncooperative juries in recent weeks as she attempted to charge anti-ICE protesters in the district.Advertisement

The other two followed.But federal Medicaid is not available to undocumented immigrants by law. The officials appear to be referring to certain state Medicaid programs, which use state funding to cover health care for some low-income and disabled immigrants who lack permanent legal status. California, Colorado and Illinois have such programs, and the Trump administration has pledged to investigate them despite insisting on the importance of states' rights to self-governance in other arenas, such as abortion or public school education.

Denver Police don’t cooperate with ICE, thereby encouraging immigrants to report crimes to local authorities instead of avoiding them for fear of getting deported.The ad goes on to tout ICE’s signing bonus of up to $50,000, and student loan forgiveness.Denver Police Chief Ron Thomas isn’t too concerned."I think that that's a terrible job for terrible pay," he told Axios Denver earlier this week, adding he’s “not worried in the least” about officers getting lured away.The outlet noted DPD’s salary range of $71,633 to $110,204 annually is also much higher than ICE’s ($49,739 to $89,528).A DPD spokesperson told Denver7 that to the best of their knowledge “we have not lost any officers to ICE as part of their new signing and retention bonus program.”“The Denver Police Department does not currently offer signing bonuses,” the statement continued. “However, if you do a side by side comparison of the lowest starting salaries, new DPD officers earn nearly $22,000 more annually than new ICE deportation officers, and Denver Police officer wages increase significantly each year to the point that, currently, officers earn more than $110,000 annually just four years after graduating from our Academy.”Advertisement

10 hrs 15 mins agoArthur DelaneyTop Democrats Brush Off Trump's Shutdown Mass Firing ThreatTop Democrats put out defiant statements in response to the Trump administration's threat to fire federal workers if the government shuts down next week. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called it an attempt at intimidation — and a hollow one. "Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one—not to govern, but to scare," Schumer said in an emailed statement. "This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government. These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today.”Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), whose constituents include many federal workers, offered a similar response. “President Trump is engaged in mafia-style blackmail, with his threats ultimately harming the American people," Van Hollen said. "He is threatening to double down on the failed actions of Elon Musk and his chainsaw — going after patriotic civil servants that provide Americans with critical services — despite having to rehire many of these workers after Americans experienced the negative impact of those cuts." And House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) offered an even more pointed statement in response to the firing threat, contained in a memo from Office of Management and Budget Director Russel Vought. "Listen Russ, you are a malignant political hack. We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings," Jeffries said on social media. "Get lost."Advertisement

11 hrs 24 mins agoMarita VlachouEx-FBI Director James Comey Could Soon Be Indicted On Criminal Charges: ReportsLindsey Halligan, the interim U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, is planning to seek a grand jury indictment for former FBI Director James Comey — one of Trump's biggest political rivals — even though prosecutors advised against the move, according to multiple news reports.Prosecutors presented Halligan with an extensive memo advising her against pursuing obstruction and perjury charges against Comey, as their investigation did not "establish probable cause of a crime," ABC News first reported.While the exact charges planned against Comey are unknown, he is likely to be accused of lying to Congress on Sept. 30, 2020, when he testified about his role in the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, according to MSNBC and CNN.Comey's indictment would be in line with Trump's political goals. Over the weekend, Trump urged U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute Comey and other adversaries, including New York State Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.)."We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!" he wrote.Halligan was sworn into her new role Monday after Eric Siebert was pushed out for failing to garner enough evidence to charge James with mortgage fraud.See More Updates Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
