A Washington Post columnist was fired over social media posts about the killing that garnered direct criticism from Vice President JD Vance. On a posthumous episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show” on Monday, Vance directed his followers to identify people who celebrated Kirk’s death, and “hell, call their employers.”Advertisement
Kimmel’s suspension has been roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. But Trump — who has sparred publicly with Kimmel for years — is taking a victory lap.“Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED,” Trump wrote on social media. “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.”Meanwhile, Trump got the royal treatment this week as King Charles III hosted the president and hundreds of other guests at Windsor Castle for a lavish multiday affair aimed at smoothing over trade and security relations between the U.S. and U.K.Advertisement

"That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent and I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry, Erika."Trump also previewed an announcement he'll make tomorrow about autism, which his Health and Human Services secretary has repeatedly pushed misinformation around as a condition to be cured.Advertisement

"The greatest cause in Charlie's life was trying to revive the American family. When he spoke to young people, he was always eager to tell them about God's vision for marriage."Erika Kirk addressed men who were watching to "accept Charlie's challenge and embrace true manhood," which she described as being "strong and courageous for your families, love your wives and lead them, love your children and protect them, be the spiritual head of your home.""Your wife is not your servant, your wife is not your employee, your wife is not your slave. She is your helper," she continued. "You are not rivals, you are one flesh working together for the glory of God."Before Charlie Kirk's killing, Erika Kirk focused her work on Turning Point USA Faith. On Sunday, she also challenged women to "be virtuous," saying "our strength is found in God's design for our role."Advertisement

Our ancestors built the cities, they produced the architecture, they built the industry," Miller said, adding that people like him and Kirk "stand for what is good" in order to "save the West.""And to those trying to incite violence against us, those trying to foment hate against us, what do you have? You have nothing, you are nothing," Miller continued. "You are wickedness, you are jealousy, you are envy, you are hatred. You are nothing. You can build nothing, you can produce nothing, you can create nothing. We are the ones who build, we are the ones who create, we are the ones who lift up humanity."Advertisement

7 hrs 51 mins agoPaul BlumenthalHow Trump’s LA ICE Crackdown Could Undermine The Next ElectionPresident Donald Trump has never seen an election that he didn’t think was fixed. In each of his three runs for the presidency, he falsely claimed widespread fraud. In 2020, he tried to overturn his loss, first through the courts and then in the streets.Now back in power, and with federal troops deployed to multiple cities run by Democrats, there are mounting concerns that he could use his power as commander in chief to deploy the military during elections.Trump has entertained this idea before. When he tried to steal the 2020 election he lost to Joe Biden, Trump considered issuing an executive order directing the Department of Defense to seize voting machines. He ultimately backed off, due to extreme opposition from Cabinet officials. But in his second term, his Cabinet has been chosen first and foremost for their loyalty in carrying out Trump’s agenda: None have expressed any semblance of opposition to Trump’s worst instincts.Read more:Advertisement
