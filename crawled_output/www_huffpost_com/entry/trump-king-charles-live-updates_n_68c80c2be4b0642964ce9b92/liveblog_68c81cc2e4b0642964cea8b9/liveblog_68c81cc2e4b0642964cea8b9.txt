A Washington Post columnist was fired over social media posts about the killing that garnered direct criticism from Vice President JD Vance. On a posthumous episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show” on Monday, Vance directed his followers to identify people who celebrated Kirk’s death, and “hell, call their employers.”Advertisement
Kimmel’s suspension has been roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. But Trump — who has sparred publicly with Kimmel for years — is taking a victory lap.“Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED,” Trump wrote on social media. “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.”Meanwhile, Trump got the royal treatment this week as King Charles III hosted the president and hundreds of other guests at Windsor Castle for a lavish multiday affair aimed at smoothing over trade and security relations between the U.S. and U.K.Advertisement

"We were in substantial contact with President Trump last night and then again today."Asked about who will retain control of the algorithm, Bessent declined to discuss the commercial terms of the deal.U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer added that the deal negotiated addressed the concerns of both sides."We were very focused on TikTok and making sure that it was a deal that is fair for the Chinese and completely respects U.S. national security concerns, and that’s the deal we reached," Greer said.Bessent’s comments came after Trump suggested that the future of the popular social media platform in the U.S. has been secured."A deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "They will be very happy!"TikTok’s future had been uncertain since former President Joe Biden signed legislation into law passed by Congress requiring ByteDance, TikTok’s China-based parent company, to divest the app or face a nationwide ban over concerns about national security.Trump has already extended a deadline for TikTok’s sale three times since taking office with the latest one coming up on Wednesday.See All UpdatesAdvertisement Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
