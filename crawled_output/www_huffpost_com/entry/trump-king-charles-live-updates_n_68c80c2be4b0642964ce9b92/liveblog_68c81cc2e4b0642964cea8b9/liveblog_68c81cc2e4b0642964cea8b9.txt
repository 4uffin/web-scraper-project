Kimmel’s return came nearly a week after his monologue about slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk drew the ire of Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, prompting his suspension. The move was roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. Advertisement
Meanwhile, a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas left one detainees dead and two others critically injured. While a motive was not immediately clear, Vice President JD Vance and other members of the Trump administration were quick to allege the shooting was an attack on the immigration enforcement agency.

"We were in substantial contact with President Trump last night and then again today."Asked about who will retain control of the algorithm, Bessent declined to discuss the commercial terms of the deal.U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer added that the deal negotiated addressed the concerns of both sides."We were very focused on TikTok and making sure that it was a deal that is fair for the Chinese and completely respects U.S. national security concerns, and that’s the deal we reached," Greer said.Bessent’s comments came after Trump suggested that the future of the popular social media platform in the U.S. has been secured."A deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "They will be very happy!"TikTok’s future had been uncertain since former President Joe Biden signed legislation into law passed by Congress requiring ByteDance, TikTok’s China-based parent company, to divest the app or face a nationwide ban over concerns about national security.Trump has already extended a deadline for TikTok’s sale three times since taking office with the latest one coming up on Wednesday.See All UpdatesAdvertisement Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
