agoTrump Promotes Hate At Kirk Memorial Ahead Of Traveling To UN General Assembly: Live UpdatesThe president urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to swiftly bring criminal charges against his political rivals.HuffPost StaffLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGThe Trump administration turned out en masse at the memorial service of slain right-wing political activist Charlie Kirk in Arizona on Sunday, as the president used his eulogy to promote hate, declining to express the forgiveness the crowd heard from Erika Kirk.The service came amid a broad campaign to shame and silence opponents whose reactions to Kirk’s killing were deemed unsavory. Late night host Jimmy Kimmel was suspended last week by ABC after his Kirk monologue drew the ire of Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr. The move was roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. Advertisement
Trump has also turned up the heat on Attorney General Pam Bondi, calling her out for not swiftly bringing criminal charges against his political rivals, including New York State Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), amid his push to seek retribution from his adversaries.Meanwhile, Trump is traveling to New York this week to attend the United Nations General Assembly, where about 150 members have said they will vote in favor of the recognition of a Palestinian state. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed the push as “largely symbolic.”The president is also expected to announce that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy could be linked to autism, while many scientists remain skeptical of any link between the two.Advertisement

"We were in substantial contact with President Trump last night and then again today."Asked about who will retain control of the algorithm, Bessent declined to discuss the commercial terms of the deal.U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer added that the deal negotiated addressed the concerns of both sides."We were very focused on TikTok and making sure that it was a deal that is fair for the Chinese and completely respects U.S. national security concerns, and that’s the deal we reached," Greer said.Bessent’s comments came after Trump suggested that the future of the popular social media platform in the U.S. has been secured."A deal was also reached on a ‘certain’ company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save," Trump wrote on Truth Social. "They will be very happy!"TikTok’s future had been uncertain since former President Joe Biden signed legislation into law passed by Congress requiring ByteDance, TikTok’s China-based parent company, to divest the app or face a nationwide ban over concerns about national security.Trump has already extended a deadline for TikTok’s sale three times since taking office with the latest one coming up on Wednesday.See All UpdatesAdvertisement Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
