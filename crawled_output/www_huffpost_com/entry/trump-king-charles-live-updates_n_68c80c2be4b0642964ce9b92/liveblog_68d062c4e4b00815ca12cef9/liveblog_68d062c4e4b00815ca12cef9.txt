A Washington Post columnist was fired over social media posts about the killing that garnered direct criticism from Vice President JD Vance. On a posthumous episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show” on Monday, Vance directed his followers to identify people who celebrated Kirk’s death, and “hell, call their employers.”Advertisement
Kimmel’s suspension has been roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. But Trump — who has sparred publicly with Kimmel for years — is taking a victory lap.“Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED,” Trump wrote on social media. “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.”Meanwhile, Trump got the royal treatment this week as King Charles III hosted the president and hundreds of other guests at Windsor Castle for a lavish multiday affair aimed at smoothing over trade and security relations between the U.S. and U.K.Advertisement

FALLON via Getty ImagesStephen Miller Gives Angry, Unsurprising Dog Whistle At Kirk's FuneralWhite House deputy chief of staff and long-known racist Stephen Miller used his time onstage to turn Kirk's funeral into a political rally and remind people who look and think like him that they are more civilized and superior to "them."Miller's speech about Kirk quickly spiraled into a rage-induced defense of civilization, using the term "our" when mentioning ancestry that dates back to places with a mostly white population."Our lineage and our legacy hails back to Athens, to Rome, to Philadelphia, to Monticello. Our ancestors built the cities, they produced the architecture, they built the industry," Miller said, adding that people like him and Kirk "stand for what is good" in order to "save the West.""And to those trying to incite violence against us, those trying to foment hate against us, what do you have? You have nothing, you are nothing," Miller continued. "You are wickedness, you are jealousy, you are envy, you are hatred. You are nothing. You can build nothing, you can produce nothing, you can create nothing. We are the ones who build, we are the ones who create, we are the ones who lift up humanity."See All UpdatesAdvertisement Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
