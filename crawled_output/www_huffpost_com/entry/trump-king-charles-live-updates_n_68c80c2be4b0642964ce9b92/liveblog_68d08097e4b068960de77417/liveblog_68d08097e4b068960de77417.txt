"That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent and I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry, Erika."Trump also previewed an announcement he'll make tomorrow about autism, which his Health and Human Services secretary has repeatedly pushed misinformation around as a condition to be cured.See All UpdatesAdvertisement Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
