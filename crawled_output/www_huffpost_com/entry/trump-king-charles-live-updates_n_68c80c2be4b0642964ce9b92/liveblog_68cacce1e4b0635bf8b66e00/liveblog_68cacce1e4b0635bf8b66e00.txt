A Washington Post columnist was fired over social media posts about the killing that garnered direct criticism from Vice President JD Vance. On a posthumous episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show” on Monday, Vance directed his followers to identify people who celebrated Kirk’s death, and “hell, call their employers.”Advertisement
Kimmel’s suspension has been roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. But Trump — who has sparred publicly with Kimmel for years — is taking a victory lap.“Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED,” Trump wrote on social media. “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.”Meanwhile, Trump got the royal treatment this week as King Charles III hosted the president and hundreds of other guests at Windsor Castle for a lavish multiday affair aimed at smoothing over trade and security relations between the U.S. and U.K.Advertisement

Kennedy, Jr. for refusing to follow his orders that were not based in facts or science.Speaking before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on Wednesday, Monarez said Kennedy wanted “blanket approval” to make changes to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.“He just wanted blanket approval,” Monarez said of Kennedy. “And if I could not commit to approval of each and every one of the recommendations that would be forthcoming, I needed to resign. I did not resign, and that is when he told me he had already spoken to the White House about having me removed.”Part of Kennedy’s demand was to change the childhood vaccine schedule. In June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the existing ACIP and replaced them with a smaller section of his own to alter the childhood vaccination schedule. Monarez said Kennedy had no data to back up the change.“He did not have any data or science to point to,” Monarez said. “As a matter of fact, we got into an exchange where I had suggested I would be open to changing childhood vaccine schedules, if the evidence or science were supportive. And he responded that there was no science or evidence associated with a childhood vaccine schedule.”“To be clear, he said there was no science or data, but that he still expected you to change the schedule?”
Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) asked.“Correct,” Monarez responded.See All UpdatesAdvertisement Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
