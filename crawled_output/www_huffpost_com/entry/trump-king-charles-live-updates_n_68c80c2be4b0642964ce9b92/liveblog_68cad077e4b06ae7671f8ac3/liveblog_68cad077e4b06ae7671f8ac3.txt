A Washington Post columnist was fired over social media posts about the killing that garnered direct criticism from Vice President JD Vance. On a posthumous episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show” on Monday, Vance directed his followers to identify people who celebrated Kirk’s death, and “hell, call their employers.”Advertisement
Kimmel’s suspension has been roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. But Trump — who has sparred publicly with Kimmel for years — is taking a victory lap.“Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED,” Trump wrote on social media. “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.”Meanwhile, Trump got the royal treatment this week as King Charles III hosted the president and hundreds of other guests at Windsor Castle for a lavish multiday affair aimed at smoothing over trade and security relations between the U.S. and U.K.Advertisement

Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said during the hearing. “Will you, either of you, feel confident telling parents they can now trust the ACIP recommendations that come out of this week’s meeting?”“I’m very nervous about it,” Monarez replied. “I don’t know, they haven’t met yet. I know that the medical community has raised concerns about whether or not they have the commensurate backgrounds to be able to understand the data and the evidence and to evaluate it appropriately.”Dr. Debra Houry, who resigned from the CDC following Monarez’s firing, said she had “significant concerns.”“I have significant concerns, as the public hasn’t been able to weigh in,” Houry said. She added that it’s “unclear to me what decisions are being made.”See All UpdatesAdvertisement Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
