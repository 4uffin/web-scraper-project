A Washington Post columnist was fired over social media posts about the killing that garnered direct criticism from Vice President JD Vance. On a posthumous episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show” on Monday, Vance directed his followers to identify people who celebrated Kirk’s death, and “hell, call their employers.”Advertisement
Kimmel’s suspension has been roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. But Trump — who has sparred publicly with Kimmel for years — is taking a victory lap.“Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED,” Trump wrote on social media. “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.”Meanwhile, Trump got the royal treatment this week as King Charles III hosted the president and hundreds of other guests at Windsor Castle for a lavish multiday affair aimed at smoothing over trade and security relations between the U.S. and U.K.Advertisement

He claimed networks should not be allowed to criticize him."If you go back, I guess they haven’t had a conservative on in years or something, somebody said, but when you go back and take a look, all they do is hit Trump," he said, according to CBS's Kathryn Watson.
