Late night host Jimmy Kimmel was suspended last week by ABC after his Kirk monologue drew the ire of Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr. The move was roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. Advertisement
Trump has also turned up the heat on Attorney General Pam Bondi, calling her out for not swiftly bringing criminal charges against his political rivals, including New York State Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), amid his push to seek retribution from his adversaries.Meanwhile, Trump is traveling to New York this week to attend the United Nations General Assembly, where about 150 members have said they will vote in favor of the recognition of a Palestinian state. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed the push as “largely symbolic.”The president is also expected to announce that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy could be linked to autism, while many scientists remain skeptical of any link between the two.Advertisement
