The move was roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. Advertisement

Edgar Hoover.Carson told the audience he was heartened to see conservative Christians of all ages unite before him, while predicting a cultural shift away from secular values."Get on board of the revival that is coming," he said, later adding, "You cannot be the land of the free if you are not the home of the brave."See All UpdatesAdvertisement Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
