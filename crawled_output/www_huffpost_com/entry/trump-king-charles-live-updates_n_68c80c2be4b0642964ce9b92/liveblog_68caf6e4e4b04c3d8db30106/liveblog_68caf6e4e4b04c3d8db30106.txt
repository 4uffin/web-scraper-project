A Washington Post columnist was fired over social media posts about the killing that garnered direct criticism from Vice President JD Vance. On a posthumous episode of “The Charlie Kirk Show” on Monday, Vance directed his followers to identify people who celebrated Kirk’s death, and “hell, call their employers.”Advertisement
Kimmel’s suspension has been roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. But Trump — who has sparred publicly with Kimmel for years — is taking a victory lap.“Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED,” Trump wrote on social media. “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.”Meanwhile, Trump got the royal treatment this week as King Charles III hosted the president and hundreds of other guests at Windsor Castle for a lavish multiday affair aimed at smoothing over trade and security relations between the U.S. and U.K.Advertisement

Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-CA) if he denied that Roof killed 9 black parishioners during a Bible study in a Charleston, South Carolina church in 2015."Dylann Roof, who followed white supremacist propaganda, murdered nine Black parishioners in 2015," Kamlager-Dove said. "Do you deny this?"Patel seemed dumbfounded as to who Roof, who has been sentenced to death, even is."I'm sorry, um, Dylann Roof?" Patel asked. "Roof?" Kamlager-Dove repeated."Roof? Can you give me some more information?" Patel asked."You're head of the FBI, you probably know this," Kamlager-Dove replied. "If you don’t know, that’s fine.""If you can give me a reminder, I’ve got a lot in front of me," Patel said."It was national news," Kamlager-Dove said. Since his attack, Roof has inspired other white supremacists to commit acts of racial violence. And in 2020, HuffPost exposed the leader of a Roof-worshipping neo-Nazi group.See All UpdatesAdvertisement Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
