Kimmel’s return came nearly a week after his monologue about slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk drew the ire of Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, prompting his suspension. The move was roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. Advertisement
Meanwhile, a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas left one detainee dead and two others critically injured. While a motive was not immediately clear, Vice President JD Vance and other members of the Trump administration were quick to allege the shooting was an attack on the immigration enforcement agency. The Department of Homeland Security said no law enforcement officers were injured in the shooting.See previous updates here, and read the latest below:TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-CA) if he denied that Roof killed 9 black parishioners during a Bible study in a Charleston, South Carolina church in 2015."Dylann Roof, who followed white supremacist propaganda, murdered nine Black parishioners in 2015," Kamlager-Dove said. "Do you deny this?"Patel seemed dumbfounded as to who Roof, who has been sentenced to death, even is."I'm sorry, um, Dylann Roof?" Patel asked. "Roof?" Kamlager-Dove repeated."Roof? Can you give me some more information?" Patel asked."You're head of the FBI, you probably know this," Kamlager-Dove replied. "If you don’t know, that’s fine.""If you can give me a reminder, I’ve got a lot in front of me," Patel said."It was national news," Kamlager-Dove said. Since his attack, Roof has inspired other white supremacists to commit acts of racial violence. And in 2020, HuffPost exposed the leader of a Roof-worshipping neo-Nazi group.See All UpdatesAdvertisement Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
