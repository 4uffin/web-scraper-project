Late night host Jimmy Kimmel was suspended last week by ABC after his Kirk monologue drew the ire of Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr. The move was roundly criticized as a government-sponsored assault on free speech. Advertisement
Trump has also turned up the heat on Attorney General Pam Bondi, calling her out for not swiftly bringing criminal charges against his political rivals, including New York State Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), amid his push to seek retribution from his adversaries.Meanwhile, Trump is traveling to New York this week to attend the United Nations General Assembly, where about 150 members have said they will vote in favor of the recognition of a Palestinian state. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed the push as “largely symbolic.”The president is also expected to announce that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy could be linked to autism, while many scientists remain skeptical of any link between the two.Advertisement

Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-CA) if he denied that Roof killed 9 black parishioners during a Bible study in a Charleston, South Carolina church in 2015."Dylann Roof, who followed white supremacist propaganda, murdered nine Black parishioners in 2015," Kamlager-Dove said. "Do you deny this?"Patel seemed dumbfounded as to who Roof, who has been sentenced to death, even is."I'm sorry, um, Dylann Roof?" Patel asked. "Roof?" Kamlager-Dove repeated."Roof? Can you give me some more information?" Patel asked."You're head of the FBI, you probably know this," Kamlager-Dove replied. "If you don’t know, that’s fine.""If you can give me a reminder, I’ve got a lot in front of me," Patel said."It was national news," Kamlager-Dove said. Since his attack, Roof has inspired other white supremacists to commit acts of racial violence. And in 2020, HuffPost exposed the leader of a Roof-worshipping neo-Nazi group.See All UpdatesAdvertisement Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
