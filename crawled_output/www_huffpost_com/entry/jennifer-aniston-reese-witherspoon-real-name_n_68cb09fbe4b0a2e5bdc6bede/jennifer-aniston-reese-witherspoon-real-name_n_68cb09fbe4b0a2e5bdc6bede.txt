During a joint interview with LADBible, Aniston was asked to name Witherspoon’s real middle name, but ended up learning her full real name instead. “I’m Laura Jean,” Witherspoon told Aniston in the clip, published on Tuesday. “That’s my real name, yeah.” “Laura?!” Aniston said in shock, as Witherspoon started giggling. “Who’s Laura?” Aniston said, as she too started giggling. “What! Who the hell’s Laura?” Aniston couldn't believe her ears. LADBibleAdvertisement
“What? Laura Jean. Like, I’m not calling you that from now on,” the “Friends” star added. “C’mon Laura Jean! Where’d Reese come from?” “It’s my middle name,” Witherspoon added, explaining that her full name is “Laura Jean Reese” as Aniston still looked like she was taking it all in. “What made you go with Reese for your ‘acting name?’” Aniston asked. Witherspoon laughed and said that she “didn’t change it, my name was just always Reese.” She then asked Aniston’s middle name, which is Joanna. Advertisement
Witherspoon isn’t the only actor who’s shocked co-workers ― and audiences ― by revealing their real name. Will Ferrell correctly predicted his name would go viral when he revealed his full moniker to James Corden back in 2020. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
