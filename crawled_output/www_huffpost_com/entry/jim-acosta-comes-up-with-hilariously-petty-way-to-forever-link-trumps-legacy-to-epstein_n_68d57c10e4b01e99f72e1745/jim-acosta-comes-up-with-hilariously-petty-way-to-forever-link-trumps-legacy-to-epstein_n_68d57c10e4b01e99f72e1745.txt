Jim Acosta and President Donald Trump.GettyOn Wednesday, the White House revealed the Mar-a-Lago revamp of the building’s historic West Colonnade — an exterior space that runs between the West Wing and the Executive Residence. Previously the corridor’s wall was completely blank, but it now boasts a row of gaudy gold-framed portraits of each president, which the White House is calling the “Presidential Walk of Fame.” Yet, the portrait of Biden is missing. Squeezed in between two portraits of Trump is a photo of an autopen writing Biden’s signature, with a label reading “Joseph R. Biden Jr. 2021-2025.”The Presidential Walk of Fame has arrived on the West Wing Colonnade Wait for it… 🖊️👀 pic.twitter.com/ApWfdxfFQa— Margo Martin (@MargoMartin47) September 24, 2025Advertisement
Trump’s dig is a reference to his longstanding claim that the Biden administration abused the autopen and implied that many of Biden’s prior actions are invalid. This is despite former presidents using autopens for decades to sign various documents.Former President Joe Biden’s portrait on the “Presidential Walk of Fame” on the wall of the colonnade outside of the Oval Office.Andrew Harnik via Getty ImagesAcosta was outraged by the stunt, likening it to “defacing the White House,” and then rolled out his suggestion as to how the next Democratic president, like “President Newsom or President Jasmine Crockett or whoever,” could avenge the act.Advertisement
“I think the next Democratic president of the United States, when he gets to — or she gets to — Washington, D.C., should take every picture of Donald Trump in the nation’s capital and replace that picture with a photograph of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein,” Acosta said an hour into the episode.Jeffrey Epstein (left) and Trump pose together at Mar-a-Lago in 1997.Davidoff Studios Photography via Getty ImagesTruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

He continued by taking his idea one step further. “The next president of the United States should say — if it’s a Democrat, if we still have elections — that any photograph, and this could be an executive order, ‘I hereby decree, by executive order, that any photograph of Donald Trump that ever exists in the United States of America in a federal building, that that picture should be a photograph of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein.’ I am dead serious.” Advertisement
