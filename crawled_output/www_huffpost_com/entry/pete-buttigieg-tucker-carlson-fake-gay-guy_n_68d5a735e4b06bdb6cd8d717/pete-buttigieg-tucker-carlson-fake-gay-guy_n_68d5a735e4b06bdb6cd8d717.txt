The former secretary of transportation sat down with journalist Kara Swisher at the University of Michigan on Monday, where he addressed Carlson’s comments.Advertisement
“First of all, I do not think I want to discuss anything with Tucker Carlson,” Buttigieg said. “Also, I cannot think of a topic I would like to discuss less with Tucker Carlson than that.”For a brief second, Buttigieg admitted to having a brief moment of “morbid curiosity” about exactly what Carlson might ask him, but quickly dismissed the thought and offered a more pointed take on the former Fox News host’s behavior. “I suppose it’s a sign of progress that their idea of a conspiracy is that I am actually secretly straight,” he said.Advertisement

“My gay producer was always like, ‘He’s not gay.’ He was with a girl, like, 20 minutes ago, and, like, he wants to be the Democratic nominee — it’s like, ‘Time for a gay guy!’” Carlson said to Knowles.Knowles responded by saying that he has an acquaintance who also believes Buttigieg is a “fake gay.”Relatedtucker carlsonpete buttigiegTucker Carlson Pushes Wild Conspiracy Theory About Pete Buttigieg's SexualityTucker Carlson Rips Gen Z White Supremacist As 'Angry Gay Kid' While MAGA Beef Heats UpPete Buttigieg Responds After Kamala Harris Admits Why He Was Passed Over As VP PickPete Buttigieg Hits Fox News Host's 'Fascist' Trump Question With Blistering Fact Check Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
