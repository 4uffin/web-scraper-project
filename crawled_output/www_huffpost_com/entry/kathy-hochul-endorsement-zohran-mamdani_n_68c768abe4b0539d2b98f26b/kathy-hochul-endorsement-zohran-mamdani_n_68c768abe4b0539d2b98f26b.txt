Kathy Hochul (D) endorsed Zohran Mamdani ― the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor ― in a notable move that signals growing support from moderates in the party. In a New York Times op-ed on Sunday, Hochul stressed the two leaders’ common focus on affordability and combating President Donald Trump in the endorsement, which makes her one of the most prominent establishment Democrats in the state to throw her weight behind Mamdani’s candidacy.

“Affordability has long been my top priority as governor, and it is the No. 1 concern I share with Mr. Mamdani,” Hochul wrote. She added: “In light of the abhorrent and destructive policies coming out of Washington every day, I needed to know the next mayor will not be someone who would surrender one inch to President Trump.”Hochul’s endorsement is significant given the key position she holds as a governing partner for Mamdani if he becomes mayor. Many of the policies that he’s committed to implementing, including tax hikes to cover social programs, will require her buy-in, and that of members of the state legislature.Advertisement
It’s also an indication of the party’s moderate flank uniting behind Mamdani’s candidacy. Hochul has long been hesitant about raising taxes on the wealthy, and she’s also been a staunch supporter of Israel. Her endorsement comes as other establishment lawmakers like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries have faced pressure to endorse Mamdani, as well as questions on why they’ve hesitated to act. Hochul noted that her decision followed numerous talks with Mamdani on a range of subjects, including those on which they disagreed. “I didn’t leave my conversations with Mr. Mamdani aligned with him on every issue. But I am confident that he has the courage, urgency and optimism New York City needs to lead it through the challenges of this moment,” she wrote. Advertisement
Mamdani has made affordability a central plank of his campaign, including proposals for free buses, no-cost child care and building affordable housing. Additionally, he’s directly confronted Trump over his brutal immigration enforcement policies and fought back as the president has lobbed xenophobic attacks on Mamdani’s identity and political ideology. Mamdani’s willingness to stand up to Trump has become more central to the race as reports have emerged about the president potentially intervening in favor of a centrist like former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). Other Democrats who remain in the race — including Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams — have faced scrutiny for their relationships with Trump. One New York Times report stated that Cuomo had held a call with Trump, a development that both leaders denied. Another stated that Trump advisers were eyeing an administration post for Adams to clear the field, though a spokesperson for the mayor said he hadn’t discussed a position with Trump.Advertisement
Hochul seemed to obliquely nod at these issues in her op-ed, writing: “We must never allow Mr. Trump to control our city like the king he wants to be. Anyone who accepts his tainted influence or benefits from it is compromised from the start.”Hochul also said she’d pressed Mamdani on certain subjects, including guaranteeing resources for the police, combating the rise of antisemitism and preserving business investment in New York City.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
