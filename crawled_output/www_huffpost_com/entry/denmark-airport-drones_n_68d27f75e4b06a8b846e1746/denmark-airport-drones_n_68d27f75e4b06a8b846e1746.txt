The Kremlin rejected the suggestion.APSep 23, 2025, 07:20 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGCOPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A skilled drone pilot flew two to three large unidentified drones over Copenhagen Airport on Monday night, shutting down the airspace for hours as the unknown perpetrator appeared to be showing off their capabilities over Scandinavia’s largest airport, police said Tuesday.Officials chose not to shoot down the drones because the risk was too great with the airport being full of passengers, the planes on the runways and nearby fuel depots, Jes Jespersen, senior police inspector of the Copenhagen Police, said during a news conference.Advertisement
Jespersen called the pilot “a capable actor” and said the culprit seemed intent on showing off their skills and possibly practicing their techniques.The drones disappeared after several hours.A board displaying flight information at Copenhagen Airport.SERGEI GAPON via Getty ImagesThere were no signs that the drone pilot intended to cause harm to anyone, he added. The drones’ lights turned on and off and appeared to engage in different flight patterns. “It all indicates that you are not out to attack anyone, but you are out to show off and maybe to practice,” he said of the pilot.Advertisement
Still, authorities couldn’t rule out the possibility of the drones being part of a Russian hybrid attack, he said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations.“Every time we hear unfounded accusations,” he said in a call Tuesday with reporters, adding that “a party that takes a serious and responsible position mustn’t make such unfounded accusations again and again.”The two to three drones appeared to have flown many kilometers (miles) to reach the airport. Investigators are looking at how the drones reached the airport — whether it was by land or possibly by boat.Advertisement

“Copenhagen Airport has reopened after being closed due to drone activity. However, there will be delays and some canceled departures. Passengers are advised to check with their airline for further information,” its official website said.A drone incident the same evening at the airport in Oslo, Norway, forced all traffic to move to one runway, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK. Traffic later returned to normal and it’s unclear who was responsible.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Security concerns in northern Europe are heightened following an increase in Russian sabotage activities and multiple drones and fighter jet incursions into NATO airspace in recent weeks.In 2023, London’s Gatwick Airport closed its runway for almost an hour after a drone was reported nearby. In December 2018, more than 140,000 travelers were stranded or delayed during the Christmas season after dozens of drone sightings shut down Gatwick for parts of three consecutive days.
