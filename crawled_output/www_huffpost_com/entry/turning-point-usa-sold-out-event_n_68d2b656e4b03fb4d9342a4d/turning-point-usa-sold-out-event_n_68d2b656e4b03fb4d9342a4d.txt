Since Kirk’s killing, right-wing voices have turned up the rhetoric against liberals, despite authorities not sharing any evidence so far linking Kirk’s 22-year-old alleged shooter to left-leaning groups.At a massive memorial event for Kirk in Glendale, Arizona, on Sunday, President Donald Trump used his eulogy to attack “radical left maniacs” who he said perpetuate political violence.“He did not hate his opponents; he wanted the best for them,” Trump said of Kirk before apologizing to his widow. “That’s where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent, and I don’t want the best for them. I’m sorry. I am sorry, Erika.”Advertisement
The crowd, which filled the 70,000-seat capacity of State Farm Stadium, erupted into cheers.“I can’t stand my opponent,” Trump said again.Turning Point’s first stop on the tour on Monday was also in a state marred by political violence: A Democratic Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband were murdered in their home in June in what appeared to be a politically motivated shooting.The event was hosted by right-wing commentator Michael Knowles, and other planned guests on the tour include Tucker Carlson and self-described comedian Rob Schneider. Turning Point has announced 11 other stops on its tour, with more announcements on the way.Relatedcharlie kirkTurning Point USACharlie Kirk's Widow Erika Hails Him As A 'Martyr' In First Remarks Since His DeathTrump Used Charlie Kirk Eulogy To Brutally Attack Opponents.
