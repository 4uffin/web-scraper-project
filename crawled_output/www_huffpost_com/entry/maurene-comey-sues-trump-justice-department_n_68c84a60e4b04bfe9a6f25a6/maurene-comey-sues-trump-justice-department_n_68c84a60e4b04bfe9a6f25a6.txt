Comey sought her reinstatement, along with a declaration that her firing was unlawful and a violation of the “Separation of Powers” as it is described in the U.S. Constitution.“Defendants have not provided any explanation whatsoever for terminating Ms. Comey. In truth, there is no legitimate explanation,” the lawsuit said, blaming the firing on the fact that her father is James Comey, “or because of her perceived political affiliation and beliefs, or both.”James Comey was fired as FBI director by President Donald Trump in 2017. The lawsuit noted that he has since written a memoir critical of Trump and has continued to publicly criticize Trump and his Administration, including a social media post in May Trump and other perceived as threatening.Advertisement
The lawsuit noted that Maurene Comey’s firing in July came the day after her supervisors had asked her to take the lead on a major public corruption case and three months after she’d received her latest “Outstanding” review.Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey is seen outside court during the Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial, June 3, 2025. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File)via Associated Press“The politically motivated termination of Ms. Comey — ostensibly under ‘Article II of the Constitution’ — upends bedrock principles of our democracy and justice system,” the lawsuit said. “Assistant United States Attorneys like Ms. Comey must do their jobs without fearing or favoring any political party or perspective, guided solely by the law, the facts, and the pursuit of justice.”Advertisement
Named as defendants in the lawsuit were, among others, the Justice Department, the Executive Office of the President, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi, the Office of Personnel Management and the United States.A message for comment from the Justice Department was not immediately returned.Comey’s July 16 firing came amid a spate of dismissals of prosecutors by the Justice Department without explanation, raising alarm that civil service protections meant to prevent terminations for political reasons were being overlooked.Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.

She became a rising star in her office for her work on the case against financier Jeffrey Epstein and his onetime girlfriend, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, and the recent prosecution of music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs.Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence after her December 2021 conviction on sex trafficking charges. Epstein took his own life in a federal jail in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. Combs is awaiting sentencing next month after his conviction on prostitution-related charges after he was exonerated in July of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges.RelatedJustice Departmentmaurene comeyTrump's DOJ Fires James Comey's Daughter, Who Prosecuted Jeffrey EpsteinFired Jeffrey Epstein Prosecutor Warns Fear Is The 'Tool Of A Tyrant'Kash Patel Defends Bungled Posts During Charlie Kirk InvestigationKash Patel Faces Congressional Hearings After Missteps In Kirk Assassination Probe And Turmoil At FBI Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
