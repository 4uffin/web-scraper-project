“And I’m really good at predicting things, you know,” he continued, citing a 2024 campaign hat emblazoned with the slogan, “Trump was right about everything.”“I don’t say that in a braggadocious way, but it’s true,” he added. “I’ve been right about everything, and I’m telling you that if you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail.”Ben-Ghiat, the author of “Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present,” highlighted on X, formerly Twitter, how Trump’s rhetoric echoed the fascist slogan in Mussolini’s Italy of “Mussolini is always right.”Advertisement
"Mussolini is always right," was the Fascist slogan. https://t.co/D2sv2F3xNI— Ruth Ben-Ghiat (@ruthbenghiat) September 23, 2025Ben-Ghiat, a New York University history professor, has previously described Trump’s administration as being characterized by “personalist rule” in which “everybody becomes a personal tool to the leader.”RelatedDonald TrumpRuth Ben-GhiatBenito MussoliniJD Vance’s Trump-‘Brain’ Gush Has Critics Asking, ‘Seriously?’Epstein Files Incoming?!?
