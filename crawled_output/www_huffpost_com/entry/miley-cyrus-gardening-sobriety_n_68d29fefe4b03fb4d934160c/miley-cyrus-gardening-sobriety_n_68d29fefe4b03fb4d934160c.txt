The “Flowers” singer recently spoke with Pamela Anderson about her new favorite pastime ― gardening ― and explained how it’s helped her with her sobriety. “Gardening is something you do for yourself,” Cyrus said in an interview with Anderson for CR Fashion Book, published on Monday. “When we’ve shared so much of ourselves, having those little precious times with something simple — like putting a seed in the ground and nurturing it — it becomes a very personal process.” Advertisement
She called the hobby “medicine” and explained that it’s helped keep her “grounded in my sober lifestyle.” “It’s part of a practice, the way yoga might be: getting out into nature, doing something with my hands, and having a creative outlet that isn’t about fame or success.” Cyrus called the hobby "medicine" and explained that it's helped keep her "grounded in my sober lifestyle."

Cyrus has opened up about her sobriety journey before, telling Apple Music’s Zane Lowe earlier this year that sobriety is “like my God.” “I need it, I live for it,” she said. “It’s changed my entire life.” 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

I wish I had the desire, but I don’t,” the Grammy winner told “Good Morning America” back in July. Advertisement
“There’s artists like Prince that are not here today that lived such a high-intensity lifestyle out on the road,” she added. “And it’s really hard to maintain sobriety when you’re on the road, which is a really important, kind of, pillar of stability in my life.” Relatedmiley cyrusGardeningpamela andersonsoberMiley Cyrus Reveals The Day She Knew Her Marriage To Liam Hemsworth Was OverMiley Cyrus Shares The Raw Reasons She Has No Desire To Tour AnymoreMiley Cyrus Says She Wears 'Very Modest' Bathing Suits Because Of MemesMiley Cyrus Reveals Harrison Ford Comment That Made Her Reassess Her Visual Album Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
