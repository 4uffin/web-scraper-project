“Donald Trump is the only president of the United States who has ever blamed a murder on millions of voters who did not vote for him,” O’Donnell said. But he said there’s a reason Trump is doing this. “What Donald Trump wants is agreement from his supporters and outrage from the millions of people he is libelously accusing of inciting murder,” he said. “Because that means that we will not be covering the very bad news that continues to mount for Donald Trump.” He pointed to a headline in The Wall Street Journal as an example: “Putin, Netanyahu March On, With Trump on the Sidelines.”Advertisement
“That is a very, very important headline for the world, and a very bad headline for Donald Trump,” O’Donnell said. “Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu proving every day how irrelevant Donald Trump is to their calculations about what they will do next.” He recalled Trump giving Putin “two weeks” to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine back in May ― a deadline Putin has ignored, leaving Trump “humiliated.” But O’Donnell said the biggest headline Trump is trying to hide isn’t about Putin or Netanyahu.It’s about Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender who was once close friends with the president.

O’Donnell took a closer look at the latest developments in the story, including the trove of emails recently obtained by Bloomberg News.
