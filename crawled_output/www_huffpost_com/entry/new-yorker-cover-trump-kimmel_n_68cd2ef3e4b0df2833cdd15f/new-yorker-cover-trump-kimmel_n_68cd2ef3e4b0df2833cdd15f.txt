Funny, haha, but it’s also very real," explained the magazine's editor, David Remnick.By Lee MoranEuropean correspondent, HuffPostSep 19, 2025, 07:02 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGPresident Donald Trump’s hand appears to be gripping a TV-style remote control with chillingly named buttons on the next cover of The New Yorker, due out on Sept. 29.Beneath a prominent red “POWER” button in artist Barry Blitt’s illustration are a series of ominous commands: Mute. Pause. Stop. Stifle. Silence. Shun. Sack. Banish. Oust. Muzzle. Axe. Dismiss. Torment.Advertisement
At the bottom, a larger red button reads simply: “DEPORT.”Françoise Mouly, the magazine’s art editor, wrote that Blitt’s cover “attempted to capture, in one image, Donald Trump’s unprecedented series of attacks on the media, destruction of federal programs, and abuses of executive power that have ushered in a new era of political vengeance.”Blitt himself said of his artwork: “When voting for president, I, of course, want someone who will not only run the country but also help narrow down our media diet.”An early look at next week’s cover of The New Yorker: “Remote Control,” by Barry Blitt: https://t.co/hOWhs4MG34 pic.twitter.com/uPYXtfUWEr— The New Yorker (@NewYorker) September 18, 2025Advertisement
The New Yorker Editor David Remnick appeared as a guest on Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” on Thursday.Colbert asked Remnick to explain the image, which the late night host described as showing a “tiny hand in a big suit holding a TV remote.” Remnick initially deadpanned it was just “some guy who watches TV, I guess,” before admitting it “captures in one image Trump’s peculiar obsession with the media, particularly television.”Advertisement
“It’s funny. Funny, haha, but it’s also very real,” he added, following a discussion on Trump’s attacks on Jimmy Kimmel, whose show this week was suspended by ABC amid conservative outrage over his remarks after Charlie Kirk’s killing.“This is what’s going on,” Remnick added.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
