(Watch the video in the player above.)Reuters verified the location of the incident using satellite imagery.According to Ruiz, no one was injured in the incident, which she speculated befell the truck when the city’s “very old” drainage network collapsed underneath it.“We arrived minutes after the truck loaded with soft drinks sank, and while we were coordinating preventive actions, the weight ended up sinking it completely,” Ruiz wrote in a post on social media that’s been translated to English.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
