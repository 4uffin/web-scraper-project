Gavin Newsom (D) ripped Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday for pointing the finger at the left for political violence, continuing the Trump administration’s blame game in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s assassination.Vance — in remarks following a shooting at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas that killed an immigrant detainee and wounded two others — claimed the act was “politically motivated” before calling for an end to “the rhetorical assault on law enforcement.”Advertisement

Vance — who once warned that Trump could become “America’s Hitler” — also used the speech to urge people to stop using the word “Nazi” as an insult.Newsom’s press office account had fun with the veep’s old rhetoric.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
