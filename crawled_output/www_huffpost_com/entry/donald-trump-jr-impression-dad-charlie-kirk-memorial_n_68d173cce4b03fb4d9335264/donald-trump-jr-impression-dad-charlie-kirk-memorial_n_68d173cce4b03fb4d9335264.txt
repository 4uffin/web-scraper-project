But instead, he made a joke about his dad, President Donald Trump. “I’m not widely known for being a sentimental guy,” Trump Jr. began his memorial speech to Kirk on stage Sunday at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. “Anyone who’s seen me on social media knows I’m far more likely to crack a joke or get myself in trouble for posting some grossly inappropriate memes than I am to shed a tear.”Advertisement
Trump Jr. claimed he’s aware of this because he’s “even gotten a call from that guy a couple of times,” the president’s eldest son said, as he then signaled to a stadium skybox, where his dad was seated behind bulletproof glass.“‘You know, Don. Don, you’re getting a little aggressive on social media, Don, relax,’” he said while imitating his dad, prompting the crowd to burst into laughter. Donald Trump, who was seated next to UFC head Dana White, was seen laughing and giving a thumbs-up to his son in response.Advertisement
Declaring Kirk was “like a little brother” to him, Trump Jr. went on to praise Kirk for his “relationship with Christ,” but not before taking aim at the president’s political opponents — former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Vice President Kamala Harris. “I want to start where I know Charlie would want me to, with what was most important to him, and that was his relationship with Christ,” he said. “To say Charlie knew more about the Bible than me is an understatement, folks. It’s like saying Donald Trump knows more about being president than Hillary Clinton or Kamala Harris. No kidding!”Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.
