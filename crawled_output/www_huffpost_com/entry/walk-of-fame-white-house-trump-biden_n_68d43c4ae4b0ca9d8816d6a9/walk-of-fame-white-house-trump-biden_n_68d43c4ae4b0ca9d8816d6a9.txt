Below a banner emblazoned with the words “Presidential Walk of Fame,” a row of gold-colored frames featuring photographs of past presidents lines the famous walkway outside the Oval Office.Advertisement
But where a photo of Biden should be — in between two portraits of President Donald Trump, the 45th and 47th president — is an image of an “autopen” writing Biden’s signature.Presidents have used automatic signature devices for decades to sign various documents.But Trump and his allies have long claimed the Biden administration abused the autopen and suggested many of the president’s former actions are invalid.Biden has called his Republican accusers “liars.”A clip of the “employee-of-the-month” style addition to the West Wing was posted by a Trump aide on Wednesday, and an official White House social media account uploaded a picture of Trump looking at the “Biden” portrait.Advertisement
Trump teased the autopen-baiting portrait of Biden in an interview with The Daily Caller earlier this month and suggested he drew inspiration for the new look of the West Wing colonnade from an unnamed Hilton hotel.Since returning to power, Trump has paved the Rose Garden and added two huge flagpoles, and plans to tear down the East Wing to build an enormous ballroom that resembles the one at his Mar-a-Lago home.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
