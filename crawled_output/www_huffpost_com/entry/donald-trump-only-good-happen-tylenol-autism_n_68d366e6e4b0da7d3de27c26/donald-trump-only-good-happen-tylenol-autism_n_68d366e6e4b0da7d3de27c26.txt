But with Tylenol, don’t take it. Don’t take it!” declared Trump at a press conference where he pushed claims that medical experts have deemed “irresponsible” and “unsettling.”Advertisement
The president’s head-spinning comment adds to his history of spewing confusing remarks over the years.Trump: "Nothing bad can happen, it can only good happen. But with Tylenol, don't take it." pic.twitter.com/nLY32M0CtN— The Bulwark (@BulwarkOnline) September 22, 2025Social media users were weirdly delighted over the line, likening it to “an affirmation” and describing it as an “instant classic” and a “quote for the history books.”Advertisement
Others compared Trump’s comments to a scene out of “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” when Dennis (played by Glenn Howerton) read a jumbled campaign speech that Charlie (played by Charlie Day) wrote for him.What kind of dressing would you like on your word salad?— Scott McDaniel (@mcdev) September 22, 2025“Nothing bad can happen, it can only good happen.
