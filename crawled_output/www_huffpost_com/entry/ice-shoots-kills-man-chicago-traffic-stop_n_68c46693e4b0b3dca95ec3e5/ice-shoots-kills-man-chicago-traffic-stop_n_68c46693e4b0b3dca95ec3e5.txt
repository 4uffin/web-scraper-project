According to CBS News immigration reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez, the incident occurred in Franklin Park, about 20 miles west of downtown Chicago. DHS claimed the man, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, had a history of reckless driving, and that during the stop, “the suspect resisted and attempted to drive his vehicle into the arrest team, striking an officer and subsequently dragging him as he fled the scene. Fearing for his life, the officer discharged his firearm and struck the subject.”Federal police officers watch from the rooftop as demonstrators protest outside of an immigration processing center on Sept. 12 in Broadview, Illinois.
