After President Donald Trump said Monday he’s “not so sure” about Americans’ First Amendment rights, Attorney General Pam Bondi dutifully followed up by threatening to bring racketeering charges against left-leaning groups that say things conservatives don’t like.Asked Tuesday by ABC’s Jonathan Karl if he could clarify Bondi’s vow to target what the administration considers “hate speech,” Trump instead chose to attack both Karl and ABC News.Advertisement
“What do you make of Pam Bondi saying she’s gonna go after hate speech? I mean, a lot of your allies say hate speech is free speech,” Karl asked.“[I] should probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly,” Trump replied. “You have a lot of hate in your heart. Maybe they’ll come after ABC.” TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
