Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and her team are building toward a possible campaign for president or the U.S. Senate in 2028, Axios’ Alex Thompson reported.The latter could pit her against old-guard Democrat Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), the Senate minority leader who’s up for reelection in 2028.Advertisement
According to the report, which cites “people familiar with her operation,” the congresswoman has hired some former advisers to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and is spending millions of dollars to bolster her already strong online reach.In-state town halls over the summer reinforced her message for a Senate bid and the national “Fighting Oligarchy” tour with Sanders upgraded her visibility for a try at the White House, the article suggested.But no decision has been made, wrote Thompson, who co-authored the bestselling Joe Biden expose “Original Sin.”Advertisement
In a follow-up to last week’s Axios report, The Hill on Sunday quoted someone who has spoken to Ocasio-Cortez about her plans to pursue the presidency or Senate. “Why wouldn’t she be considering this?” the source said. “She’s one of the biggest voices in the Democratic Party, she fundraises like no one else, and she’s authentic and true to herself. Can’t say that about a lot of other people in the party.”Fourth-term Rep.

If frequent Republican attacks, including by President Donald Trump, can be construed as a gauge of her viability, then Ocasio-Cortez should be a legitimate threat for higher national office.When asked about a presidential bid in July, she didn’t shut down the idea.Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.
