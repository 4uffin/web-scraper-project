(Watch the videos below.)In separate comments on “The Five” and later on his own show, Watters said protesters must accept a one-time offer to confess or repent and even get down on their knees to do so. And if they don’t, they’ll be banished from society.Advertisement
The host and colleagues cited celebratory, illegal and thoughtful responses to the assassination, lumping the responsibility for them on a group he called “they,” which has become quite the buzzword for the right.“We can forgive, but they have to get on their knees and they have to beg for forgiveness,” Watters said on “The Five” panel. “They have to repent their political sins. Only then will we allow them back into polite society. Until then, we will be seeking them out and exposing them with sunlight. We will disinfect them with sunlight. Everything they say or do will be exposed and then everybody will know who they are. And they will not be allowed to be with us, live with us, be in our companies, be in our social groups, no! I’m not living with people who celebrate assassinations.”Fast forward to 2:15 for Watters’ first rant.Advertisement
He revisited his redemption-for-dissenters jag on “Primetime” later, once again proposing a one-time offer for “them” ― perhaps an amalgam of Democrats and others who have criticized Kirk’s rhetoric ― to atone.“These people are incapable of turning the temperature down, so it’s our responsibility to do it for them, for the safety of the country and for their own safety,” he said. “Their heinous movement should be politically destroyed, systematically dismantled, their financial backing should be bankrupted, their media sponsors defeated in the marketplace, their candidates beaten at the ballot box, and their acolytes in academia behind the pulpit, in city councils and corporate America will be spotlighted and given one chance to confess and apologize. And if they don’t, thrown out of polite society.”“We cannot live with people and work with people like this,” he continued. “They can’t teach our children. They can’t be trusted with power and positions of authority. Every God-fearing American should take it upon themselves to get involved, get organized and do what’s right for themselves, for their families and for the United States of America.”Advertisement
