Read the full editorial at The Wall Street Journal.Bondi has since semi-walked back her comments following a backlash, which the Journal acknowledged. But the board still asked: “Is a basic understanding of the First Amendment too much to expect from the nation’s Attorney General?”It also suggested that Kirk, who had called for “even hate speech” to be “totally allowed” in the U.S., “would want a word” with Bondi.Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.

“But she is a law enforcer, not a social-media anger management coach, and she’s sworn to uphold the Constitution,” it concluded. “Maybe Ms. Bondi should quit appearing on podcasts about Charlie Kirk until she listens to some Charlie Kirk podcasts.”Relatedpam bondiWall Street JournalNewsmax Host Sounds Alarm On Trump’s ‘Huge Mistake’Trump’s ‘Disgusting’ Attack On Muslim Congresswoman Sparks Anger OnlineOOPS!
