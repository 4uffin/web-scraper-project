The trio argued that the suspect, who had a litany of previous arrests and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, should have been taken off the streets long ago. The conversation then shifted to a more general discussion of homelessness and the mental health crisis in the United States.“This is happening all across the country, and it’s not a money issue,” said Jones, adding that “a lot” of homeless people “don’t want” to get necessary help.Advertisement
“You can’t give ’em a choice,” Jones went on. “Either you take the resources that we’re going to give you, or you decide that you gotta be locked up in jail. That’s the way it has to be now.”That’s when Kilmeade floated a more extreme idea.Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.

Or something,” he said. “Just kill ’em.”The other two hosts barely react to his remark before continuing their discussion.Though the segment aired on Wednesday, it went viral on social media Saturday morning. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who has received heaps of criticism for his own policies on homelessness, responded with a biblical quote: “Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered.”RelatedHomelessnessbrian kilmeadefox and friendsVideo Released Of Ukrainian Refugee Being Stabbed On Train In Charlotte, North CarolinaJustice Sotomayor Blasts 'Unconscionable' Supreme Court Ruling Overturning Homeless RightsCritics Slam Ex-Trump WH Aide's 'Deeply Evil' Homeless Claim: 'This Is Who They Are'Brian Kilmeade Apologizes For Suggesting Homeless People Should Be Killed Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
