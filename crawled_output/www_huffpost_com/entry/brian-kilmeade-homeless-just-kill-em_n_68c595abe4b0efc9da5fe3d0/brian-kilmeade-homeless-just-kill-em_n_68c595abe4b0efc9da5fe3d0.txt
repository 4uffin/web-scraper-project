Log in to hide these messages.'Just Kill 'Em': Fox Host Makes Shocking Comment On Homeless People"Fox and Friends" co-host Brian Kilmeade made a jaw-dropping remark while discussing homelessness and mental health.By Hilary HansonDeputy Editor, Trends, HuffPostSep 13, 2025, 01:17 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADING“Fox and Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade suggested this week that homeless people suffering from mental health issues who refuse help should simply be killed.Kilmeade and fellow co-hosts Ainsley Earhardt and Lawrence Jones were discussing the fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee whose grisly killing on a North Carolina train was caught on surveillance video.Advertisement
The trio argued that the suspect, who had a litany of previous arrests and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, should have been taken off the streets long ago. The conversation then shifted to a more general discussion of homelessness and the mental health crisis in the United States.“This is happening all across the country, and it’s not a money issue,” said Jones, adding that “a lot” of homeless people “don’t want” to get necessary help.Advertisement
“You can’t give ’em a choice,” Jones went on. “Either you take the resources that we’re going to give you, or you decide that you gotta be locked up in jail. That’s the way it has to be now.”That’s when Kilmeade floated a more extreme idea.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
