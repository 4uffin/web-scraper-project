Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) voted "no" on a GOP-backed resolution to honor the assassinated right-wing commentator.By Sebastian MurdockSenior Reporter, HuffPostSep 19, 2025, 07:41 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) explained her reasoning for voting “no” on a GOP-backed resolution to honor assassinated political commentator Charlie Kirk.Kirk was fatally shot while speaking at Utah Valley University earlier this month. On Friday, the House passed a nonbinding resolution to honor “the life and legacy of Charlie Kirk.” While 95 Democrats supported the resolution, which passed 310-58, Ocasio-Cortez voted against it.Advertisement

Ocasio-Cortez went on to explain the dangerous beliefs that Kirk espoused over the years.“We should be clear about who Charlie Kirk was,” she said. “A man who believed that the Civil Rights Act that granted Black Americans the right to vote was a ‘mistake.’ Who after the violent attack on Paul Pelosi claimed that ‘some amazing patriot’ should bail out his brutal assailant. And who accused Jews of controlling ‘not just the colleges — it’s the nonprofits, it’s the movies, it’s Hollywood, it’s all of it.’”(It should be noted that the Civil Rights Act did not grant Black Americans the right to vote but instead outlawed discrimination in employment and public places, among other things. The Voting Rights Act, passed a year later, outlawed discrimination in voting.)
