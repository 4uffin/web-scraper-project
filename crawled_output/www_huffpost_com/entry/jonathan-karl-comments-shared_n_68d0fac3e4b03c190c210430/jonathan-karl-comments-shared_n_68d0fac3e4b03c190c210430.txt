Karl, in response, shared a video showing the full context of his comments.“Here’s what I actually said,” he captioned the 78-second clip.Watch here:Here's what I actually said: pic.twitter.com/Uc4hgpaN8m— Jonathan Karl (@jonkarl) September 21, 2025In the video, Karl said:“Later today, family, friends, and supporters of Charlie Kirk will gather in Glendale, Arizona, for his memorial. The 31-year-old activist’s murder shocked the nation, and it was condemned by sensible and compassionate people in and out of politics and across the political spectrum. It has also been senselessly celebrated by some, a small minority, who didn’t like what Kirk stood for and thought it was somehow, therefore, justified.Celebrating or excusing violence is abhorrent. The murder of Charlie Kirk was not a political act, it was a gruesome crime. His alleged killer now faces the death penalty.Our thoughts this morning are with the Kirk family, especially his two young children who will now grow up without their father.Whatever you think of his political views, and there are many who were deeply offended by things he said, Charlie Kirk was an unwavering advocate for free speech.On a personal note, he was always willing to engage with me and answer my questions. He welcomed debate with those he disagreed with. He did not try to silence his critics. He listened to them and tried to change their minds. As Charlie Kirk’s body is laid to rest, that core principle is under attack in America.”Karl also responded to several posts that criticized his remark.Kirk’s alleged killer, Tyler Robinson, “by all available evidence, was politically motivated,” Karl acknowledged in one message. “I do not and did not dispute that. But murder is not practicing politics, it is committing a high crime.”“My point is that when you murder somebody you are not practicing politics, you are committing a crime,” the journalist said in another. “I was addressing those who celebrated or excused the vile act because they objected to Charlie Kirk’s views.”Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.

ABC last week indefinitely suspended Jimmy Kimmel’s late night show after facing government pressure for a remark the host made after Kirk’s killing.
