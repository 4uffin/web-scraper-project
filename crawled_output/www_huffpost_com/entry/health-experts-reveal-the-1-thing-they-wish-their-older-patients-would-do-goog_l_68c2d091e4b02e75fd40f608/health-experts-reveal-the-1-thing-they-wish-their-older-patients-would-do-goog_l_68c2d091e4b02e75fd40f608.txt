But for people of a certain age, the diet and exercise recommendations aimed at younger folks just aren’t as helpful as they used to be. Our bodies have changed, and we don’t need to start hardcore exercise routines or embark on crazy fad diets that skip entire food groups.These days, there’s too much health information coming at us from all sides, much of it from questionable sources. That can be overwhelming at any age. We asked a group of cardiologists, nutritionists and other health professionals for one simple piece of advice they would give to all their senior patients.Advertisement
What nutritionists wish their patients would doWhen it comes to a healthy senior lifestyle, we can all benefit from some advice from a nutritionist who treats senior patients regularly. Four of them shared their top tips, and each one is a powerful tool for wellness.As we age, it’s especially important to make sure we are getting plenty of fiber. Registered dietician nutritionist Kathleen Garcia-Benson told us: “Fiber is essential for a healthy digestive system, regular bowel movements, and is associated with a lower risk of colon cancer. Easy ways to boost fiber include snacking on berries, adding ground flaxseeds or chia seeds to oatmeal, or using a fiber supplement. Just be sure to drink plenty of water when increasing fiber!”Nutritionists also urge seniors to make sure they are getting enough protein. According to registered dietician Courtney Pelitera, one of the biggest effects of aging seen across the board is something called sarcopenia, or the breakdown of muscle mass, strength and function.Advertisement
“A great way to preserve as much muscle as possible (besides regular exercise) is to make sure the diet is adequate in protein,” Pelitera said. “I like to encourage at least 20g of protein or more per meal with older adults.”Another common problem for seniors is deficiency of vitamin D, which plays a role in muscle movement and immune function, and is needed to keep bones healthy.“The body becomes less efficient at converting sunlight into Vitamin D as we age, and older adults are at increased risk for having low levels,” said RD Annette Snyder. “Food sources of vitamin D include fatty fish (salmon, tuna, trout, mackerel), egg yolks, fish liver oil, mushrooms, and fortified dairy products.”Advertisement
Something as basic as hydration can also become a problem for seniors. RDN Colette Micko says this is because the natural mechanisms that increase the sensation for thirst are diminished as you age.“This means you cannot rely on feeling thirsty to signal that your body needs water,” she said. “Staying adequately hydrated is important for nearly every cell in your body to function, and can help with energy levels, digestion, body temperature regulation and lubrication of joints.”Micko recommends increasing your water intake to a minimum of 48 ounces per day by drinking on a schedule, always keeping fluids nearby and focusing on hydrating foods like fruits and vegetables. This can all help ensure you are meeting your body’s minimum requirements.Advertisement
The diet tips medical doctors wish their patients would adhere toThe best thing that older adults can do to protect their heart health is to eat whole, plant-based foods ― and Dr. Katie Golden, a board-certified emergency medicine physician, recommends the Mediterranean diet, to be consumed joyfully with friends and family.Maki Nakamura via Getty ImagesDoctors cite fiber, protein and vitamin D as essential nutrients for older adults.“It’s all about eating fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats,” Golden said. “Also, enjoy yourself and the company of those around you while doing it, because mental health and well-being is an important part of physical health.”Advertisement
And all the cardiologists we spoke to agreed on one thing ― the importance of exercise. Just do whatever you can do. According to Dr. Eldad Einav, a cardiologist, obesity specialist and clinical assistant professor at SUNY Upstate Medical University, study after study shows that exercise helps with blood pressure regulation, cholesterol management, blood sugar regulation, weight maintenance, inflammation, stress, mortality, energy, stamina, sleep, cognitive ability, joint health, balance, mobility, immune system function and social interaction.Exercise guidelines from a medical doctorIt doesn’t take hours at the gym or training for an Ironman Triathlon to maintain your health. Dr. Dany Sayad, medical director for the Tampa General Hospital Heart & Vascular Institute’s General Cardiology Center of Excellence, told us: “If I could get my senior patients to do one thing, it would be to exercise a minimum of 150 minutes per week.”“The exercise should be tailored to the patient’s physical abilities,” Sayad said. “Chair yoga, pilates, and most importantly walking would improve not only the cardiovascular system but also lower the risk of fall, the anxiety and ameliorate the sense of well-being.”Advertisement
Things doctors wish you’d stop doingIf your doctor hasn’t already told you, cardiologists have a short list of habits you need to quit. According to Dr. Philip Nimoityn, a clinical cardiologist at Cardiology Consultants of Philadelphia at Jefferson, “seniors interested in maintaining cardiovascular health should pursue a heart-healthy lifestyle including avoidance of obesity, smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.”“A well-balanced diet, such as the Mediterranean diet, is beneficial in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease,” Nimoityn said. He also recommends asking for a few specific tests to make sure your heart is in tip-top shape. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
