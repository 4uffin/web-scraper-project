Called “THE skin care product” by one reviewer and a “welcome layer of comfortable protection” from Flores herself, Avène’s Cicalfate+ Restorative Protective Cream is a powerful moisturizer for restoring your skin barrier, soothing cuts, scrapes and eczema-prone skin, healing localized dry skin and so much more. And right now, you grab a bottle of it for 30% off at Amazon and Ulta.

This restorative cream has 45 reported uses.AmazonThe Avène Cicalfate+ Restorative Protective Cream has 45 skin care uses in one product.If you’re unsure if this moisturizing cream is right for you, we’ll take a bet that it likely is — especially as Avène lists this many uses for the stuff. You can use it as a topical agent for soothing scrapes, general discomfort and tightness; as a moisture treatment for post-laser and -cosmetic procedures; restoring a compromised skin barrier; creating a skin barrier around a flaky or cracked area; or just as an everyday moisturizer.It’s eve gentle enough for babies!The cream is also terrific for skin conditions like eczema, dermatitis, rosacea, acne, and more.Flores says when her chronic eczema causes her itchy, red skin to flare up and upset her daily routine, she uses this cream to help mellow it out. “I continued to apply the richly-textured cream throughout the week, noticing that my eczema was improving and my skin was significantly more hydrated than before I started using it,” she says.Advertisement
“But for as thick as the cream went on initially, it didn’t dry down to be overly greasy on the skin. Rather, it felt like a welcome layer of comfortable protection, and I was able to still use my hands normally.”“I’ve been using this for close to a year and it is amazing for my super sensitive and dry skin,” says one Amazon reviewer. “I have perioral dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and rosacea and live in Minnesota with bitter cold and the heater running over half the year. Cicalfate cream doesn’t flare any of these and it helps reduce redness and completely resolves dry skin.”It’s also loaded with helpful ingredients that users say helps reduce the visibility of wrinkles and fine lines.Not only is this moisturizer great for reducing dry skin and puffiness. It’s also great for reducing visible wrinkles, fine lines and more.“This cream has improved my skin on my face in so many ways,” says a reviewer named Brandi. “It’s helped dryness, redness and reduced my fine lines. I soak it on my face every night before bed.”“My skin is hydrated, DEEP forehead wrinkles are minimized, and my rosacea is the most tame that it’s ever been,” says another reviewer. “After one week, I’ve tossed out creams from Beekman, F.A.B., and Biossance because this humble cream outperforms them all.”Advertisement

It hydrates my skin and makes my skin look as glasslike as it can. My husband can’t even believe it is my skin. He thought my picture was filtered until I came home and he saw for himself.” — Claire “I was hesitant to purchase this after the reviews talking about it separating. But I was having a ton of issues with dry, irritated, skin out of nowhere. I took a chance and could not recommend this more. I shook the container in advance to hear if there was separated liquid, then also massaged the tube to make sure it was completely mixed together before opening. I used this on my face and woke up with very moisturized skin. I think it is going to make a huge difference in my dermal barrier. I paired it with the lip version as well. If you’re on the fence, buy it!” — Lauren “I’m not the type to leave reviews, this is my first one ever! but I have been struggling to find a night time moisturizer for my sensitive skin, i struggled with dry patches, a damaged skin barrier and acne/acne scars and this product absolutely changed that within the first week of using. My makeup sticks better on my skin, no more dry patches, and i’ve even noticed my acne scars have faded. I’ve tried all kinds of moisturizers with Hyaluronic acid, Niacinamide, and other popular ingredients that are supposed to repair barriers and are “meant for sensitive skin” but my skin has not reacted well to those so if you have skin like mine i recommend trying this product out! I wish i had pictures but i truly did not expect such a great outcome.” — Gliss 1.3-oz: $18.20 at amazon (regularly $26)1.3-oz: $18.20 at ulta (regularly $26)3.3-oz $28 at amazon (regularly $40)3.3-oz: $28 at ulta (regularly $40)Looking for more skin care recommendations?

4AesturaA sensitive skin-friendly, barrier-strengthening creamFor a rich yet non-greasy moisturizer, the Aestura Atobarrier365 Cream Moisturizer is the best of both worlds. Dr. Y. Claire Chang, a board-certified cosmetic dermatologist, said it's ideal for those with sensitive skin thanks to a patented blend of barrier-boosting ceramide capsules that allow the ingredient to stay within the skin barrier longer. "This leaves my skin looking glowy for hours — when applied, it feels luxuriously smooth and absorbs quickly into the skin, leaving the skin hydrated and protected without any heavy residue," she said.$32 at Sephora5CeraVeA lightweight lotion that can be used on the face and bodyDermatologist Dr. Geeta Yadav said that although the Cerave Daily Moisturizing Lotion is lightweight, it's nourishing thanks to a blend of ceramides and hyaluronic acid, which help add hydration into the skin and reinforce the skin barrier, preventing irritation and transepidermal water loss (TEWL). "Though it's best for those with normal to dry skin, those with oily skin can use it when their skin gets drier (in winter, for example)," she said. Not to mention, it can be used on both the face and body, making it great for those who value a low-maintenance skin care routine with minimal products.$14.34 at Amazon$14.97 at Walmart$17.99 at Target6MedicubeA K-beauty collagen jelly that visibly plumpsIf glass skin is the goal, this editors' pick is the road to getting there. From the K-beauty brand that you've undoubtedly seen on your For You Page more than a handful of times comes the Medicube Collagen Jelly Cream, a bouncy gel moisturizer that targets uneven skin tone as it hydrates. Instead of thick, pore-clogging oils, it uses hydrolyzed collagen and niacinamide to work its magic.Promising review: "I was skeptical at 1st but one single I fell in love. A very little goes along way. You can use in a thin layer under makeup or thick for a overnight mask. I like to keep it refrigerated for that extra chill and it feel amazing. It hasn't broken me out and just left me with beautiful glowing hydrating skin. For reference I am 40 with textured acne prone skin. I will definitely recommend and repurchase! Beautiful product." — JustAmble$14.90 at AmazonAdvertisement
