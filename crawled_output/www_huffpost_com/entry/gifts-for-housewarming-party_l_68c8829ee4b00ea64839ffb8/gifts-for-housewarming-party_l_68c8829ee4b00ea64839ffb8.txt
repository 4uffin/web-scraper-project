Cannot recommend this seller and his products enough." — I GEvergreen Oasis is a small biz committed to only using wood that comes from sustainably managed forests or reclaimed sources.

I was always skeptical about getting one of these, but I love it. I listen to music while I get ready for work, and I love that I can just say 'Alexa, play some music.' It is also very convenient for setting alarms and timers. This makes things so easy. I would recommend this product to anyone." — TX2030$50 at AmazonAdvertisement
4Wedding Gift Towels / EtsyA Turkish hand towel that'll add a fresh pop of color to their kitchenThe custom embroidery can be a name or a short message and is placed in the middle of the bottom edge of the towel, with 10 fonts and 12 colors available to choose from.

Incredibly flavorful and smooth with notes of fruit. Just had the Awake combined with truffle balsamic vinegar and freshly grated parmesan cheese as a bread dip, incredible combination of flavors, and the Awake olive oil shines through as balanced and flavorful — wow. Get some quality fresh bread and hang on, we're going to carb town and loving every single bite" — déjà mousePromising review: "Purchased this for a gift for friends who like to cook. I was pleasantly surprised by the packaging. They come ready to gift in a sturdy blue box...great presentation. Would make great housewarming gifts or even some good oils for yourself!" — Barb Averell$70 at Amazon6www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comMaldon sea salt flakes, a little gift with a big impactIf you want to fall further down the mineral rabbit hole, Maldon also makes flavored salts like smoked, garlic, and chili. Promising review: "I think the funniest thing about my Maldon Salt obsession is that I gift it and people look at me [funny]...then they text me afterward saying that it's so good they want to eat it out of the container! LOL It's got sort of a mild umami flavor that works with every food, ESPECIALLY sweets. It's the best dessert salt, but of course, it works on everything. I use it as a finishing salt mostly, but I also cook with it. Elevates simple dishes like fried eggs. Had to share the love." — SIV$13 at AmazonAdvertisement

10Paper SourceA custom address stamp to give their home the official seal of approvalPromising review: "This is my go-to housewarming gift. It feels so much more personal than a bottle of wine or a candle, and I love that the recipient gets to pick out the design. I also have one of my own! It's so fun to use and a million times better than hand-writing your return address on the envelope." — EmilyAnd, if you'd rather gift a stamp that's ready to use, Stamp by Me (on Amazon) offers four designs to choose from and can be purchased as a wooden stamp with an ink pad or a self-inking stamp. $40 at Paper Source11AmazonA set of cat salt and pepper shakersNote: These shakers are lead and cadmium-free and are part of a larger collection featuring these crafty kitties, with items like mugs, plates, and a utensil holder available!Promising review: "These cat-themed salt and pepper shakers are good quality. The painted details were done well. It was a gift for my sister, who is all about cats (and frogs). Another nice thing about these shakers is that there are other kitchen/table items that match them, so I can add to her collection as future gifts." — Amazon Customer$16 at Amazon12www.amazon.comThe "Essential Book of Cocktails" to shake up a mixing enthusiast's homemade blendsPromising review: "Pleasantly surprised to see that this book is actually much bigger, with more pages than I thought! Nice cover, nice quality overall, and really some lovely stories throughout. If you enjoy learning about the history of cocktails, hearing about how different parts of the country (and world) enjoy their cocktails, and reading archival material of the New York Times, then this book is for you! Overall, much more than a simple cocktail book!" — MP$15 at AmazonAdvertisement
13AmazonTell Me More, a conversation-starting gamePromising review: "These are GREAT for dinner parties or events when not everyone knows each other. I like them because they’re not as deep as We’re Not Really Strangers or other decks that are meant to really deepen a relationship with someone you know." — ChancyPromising review: "I have a few of these conversation starter card 'games' and while this version only has 52 cards, they are the most thought-provoking and interesting questions of most other similar games. We just played with another couple on Christmas Eve this year, and it added so much to the evening. We all learned some interesting things about ourselves and each other that we never knew...and some of us have known each other for 40+ years! We are in our seventies and this is something that can be appreciated by any adult age. I liked it so much I bought several for Christmas and birthday gifts this year." — S. Loew$17 at Amazon14www.amazon.comAn Oster electric wine openerThis rechargeable bottle opener works with the push of a button: simply place it above the bottle, activate the winding corkscrew, pull it out, and voilà! And, it comes with a foil cutter.Promising review: "AMAZING product! I got it as a secret Santa gift, about three years ago. Since then, I’ve gifted about five, on any opportunity I get, to my family and friends who don't already own an easy to use electric wine opener. I do not charge it every day, only when I see it’s losing it’s rechargeable power. Easy to use and works great! Doesn’t even take up that much space in the kitchen counter, very slick and looks modern." — Andres FelipePromising review: "This was given to me as a gift and I immediately ordered another to send as a gift to a friend. With severe arthritis in both thumbs I was forced to only buy wine with a screw top. This opener is so easy to use and no pressure or strength is required. Just be sure to hold onto the bottle because it has a tendency to turn as the cork is being pulled out. Changed my wine-drinking life." — LakeBrat$35 at Amazon15Amazon, www.amazon.comThe Official IMDb Top 100 Movies Scratch Off PosterNote: Instructions suggest scratching off the posters with a card, as a coin can damage the artwork. The seller also offers a Top 100 Horror Movies poster, chosen by Fangoria readers!Promising review: "I always struggle to find great presents for my son, who is 28, and his fiancé. This poster was a perfect gift in that all the classic movies (some way before their time) are included. They live in DC, and when the weather is crappy, they can pick a movie and enjoy a quiet night in. Perfect gift that was unique and unexpected and now well-loved." — Kindle Customer$23 at AmazonAdvertisement
16www.amazon.comA sunrise alarm clockNote: When used as a lamp, the alarm clock has nine color options to choose from. There are also 26 sleep sounds, with options like pink noise and rain available. And as a bonus, it's a great alternative to the Hatch (which is about five times the price, btw)!Promising review: "I bought this to improve my sleeping habits without my phone by my bed. The white noise is very comforting, and I like the number of options it gives you. The light is soft but enough to read by, and I like how it slowly dims down when the timer is up, so it’s not a jolt, but you know it’s time to sleep. The sunrise light feature actually wakes me up, and I have been turning off the alarm before the sounds go of,f so I actually like that better as it’s a gentle way to wake up." — Joslin$25 at Amazon17www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA custom book stampThe seller offers embossers, self-inking stamps, and wooden handle stamps, which are available in five ink colors. For the custom top and bottom text, there is a 35-character limit each, though keep in mind that the longer the text, the smaller the font will be. Promising review: "I bought this as a gift for a friend and she absolutely loves it. She’s a huge reader and even lends her books to friends when asked, and when she opened this, she cried. She then spent the next hour stamping her collection of books and loves that it’s so easy to use and adds a personal touch to her home library." — Alyssa M$17 at Amazon18Uncommon GoodsA Glow & Grow kit — if you can't decide between the classic candle or houseplantEach kit includes a 12-oz soy candle in a ceramic pot, seeds, a soilless grow medium, plant food, activated carbon, and instructions to help your plant thrive.Promising review: "We purchased the aloe plant as a gift for a friend who had a green thumb. The candle smelt absolutely amazing and I love the idea of repurposing it when it's all used. Such a cool gift, I wanted to keep it for myself. Our friend loved it!" — Sarah W.$40 at Uncommon GoodsAdvertisement
19www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA Marshall amp key holderThe company also sells a Fender key holder as well as jack keychains if replacements are needed. Each amplifier key holder comes with a mounting kit and instructions.Promising review: "Super cute item and so happy with my purchase! It’s not as heavy as you would think it is, it’s pretty light. But it hangs easily and looks super cute! It’s also helped my gf and I a lot with keeping track of our keys! It’s now a habit for us to come home and plug our keys in! 😆 Overall, 10/10 would recommend!!" — Super Cute!!$34 at Amazon20www.amazon.comA miniature frog garden statue to guard your friend's front porchThe seller offers other animal nightlights, like this dog playing the guitar or this elephant that's just trying to take care of some business.Promising review: "Cutest garden statue we have in our front lawn. Mr. Ribbit can be seen throughout the day enjoying his coffee. It brings the front lawn some character, and I just enjoy seeing him every day!" — Matchaman$20 at Amazon21www.amazon.comA home putting greenReviewers are impressed by the durability of the mat and how it remains wrinkle-free after rolling it up to put away. Many also place it on uneven surfaces (or towels) to create breaks!Promising review: "Great for practice. I live in the Midwest, so come wintertime, we have limited access to the great outdoors. I use this mat several times a week, practicing my target line. The mat is very durable at a GREAT price point. The bottom of the mat stays in place well; it's currently in use on a hardwood floor in my home office space. It can withstand me rolling over it with a computer chair (results may vary). Best part is it's also really easy to roll up and store away if you need the additional floor space." — J.S.$38 at AmazonAdvertisement
22www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA Lodge enameled Dutch ovenPromising review: "This Dutch oven is amazing! You can cook ANYTHING! and I mean anything in it. From soups and stews to bread to pot roast. It's a cook's best friend! It would make a wonderful gift for anyone who loves to cook or for someone who is learning how to cook." — Jennifer$100 at Amazon23www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA freakin' crab utensil holder to wield your friend's saucy spoonsNote: Some reviewers mention Red cannot hold heavier spoons, but twisting the upper half of the silicone helps stabilize weighty utensils. Ototo specializes in quirky, functional kitchen gadgets, with other popular designs being Gracula the garlic crusher and Nessie the ladle. Promising review: "I had no idea what to expect when I purchased this on a lightning deal. When it arrived, it was instantly one of the cutest things I've ever seen. My husband did not think it would be able to hold spoons, spatulas, lids, etc. But IT DOES! It doesn't fall over and can hold the lid and a spoon or spatula at the same time. It is rather small, but its size is what makes it so great. It takes up no room and does a great job. I love this little guy!" — boogersmom$20 at Amazon24Bright Beige / EtsyA set of reusable patterned napkinsBonus: These napkins are washer and dryer safe, and reviewers say they maintain their shape and vibrancy!Promising review: "I’m sooo pleased with my purchase, especially because even though they are seconds, I honestly can’t tell unless I’m really looking! There are maybe one or two napkins that aren’t perfectly square or misprinted, but the quality is still great, and the assorted patterns are adorable! I am so pleased that I got a bunch of fruit ones in the pack. I have been looking for more sustainable napkins during meals, and this is such a fun idea. I would definitely repurchase from this seller again!" — Tanya WanwatanakoolBright Beige is a small biz based in New York! Their products are printed by hand using a small batch production process that minimizes waste. $45+ at EtsyAdvertisement
25BrooklinenA Brooklinen super plush robeLots of reviewers size up for that extra cozy feel and appreciate that even after washing, the robe still feels brand new!Promising review: "This robe is incredible. Perfectly soft, and just the right amount of weight to be warm but not too heavy. I especially love that the sleeves slightly taper; I wear robes when I’m moving around in the morning, and burned the sleeve on my last one. Or rather, it melted on the burner! This robe is pure cotton, no polyester plastic garbage, and the sleeves don’t get in the way. Pockets hold a phone, glasses, whatever I need to get out of my hands. It’s pretty close to perfect!" — AbbyT$101 at Brooklinen26www.amazon.comA set of shower steamers to create a luxe, spa-like experienceRead more about aromatherapy and stress and tension at Johns Hopkins.Promising review: "I am so obsessed with the product! If you love bath bombs, this is on a whole other level and will change the way you shower! From the packaging, the smells, and inspirational quotes, I am so satisfied! As a mom of 2 I don’t get much time to myself to rest, relax or pamper myself. But now with this product I can escape, refresh, and feel beautiful, mind, body, and soul. I cannot wait to purchase another box!" — Jerrilyn$12 at Amazon27AmazonThe Pink Stuff cleaning kitThe complete Pink Stuff kit includes the cleaning paste, toilet cleaner, bathroom foam, a set of three microfibre cloths, and a scrubber. Promising review: "I absolutely love this brand of cleaner! I was introduced first to the multipurpose cleaner and had to try more! Now it's the main staple cleaner in my home! The smell is light enough not to aggravate my sensitive senses, and I can go hours of cleaning without a headache due to the chemical smell. It leaves everything shiny and super clean without the need for extra elbow grease. Even better if you have an electric scrub brush, like the one they have available." — Nikki$25 at AmazonAdvertisement
