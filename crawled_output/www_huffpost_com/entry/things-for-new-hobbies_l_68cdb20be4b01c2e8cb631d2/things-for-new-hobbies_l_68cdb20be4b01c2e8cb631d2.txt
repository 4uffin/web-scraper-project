Promising review: "I gave my wife one of these for Christmas, and she absolutely loved it! She's kind of a bookworm, so this was perfect for her bookshelf. It was fun to build and pretty simple to assemble. Putting the individual books together was a bit daunting, but the final product made it all worth it. As for quality, the pieces are very thin and sort of fragile (but that's the case with most DIY models), but overall, pretty solid in construction. Well worth every penny, and kept my wife busy for a month! My only real gripe about it is that the light switch is in the bottom back of it, so turning it on and off can be kind of a pain, having to pull it out of the bookshelf every time. Otherwise, it was a successful purchase, and the perfect gift! I'd recommend it to anyone!" â€” Daniel$33 at AmazonAdvertisement
13www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA complete baking set if you also were obsessed with "Cake Boss"You'll be able to practice every cake decorating technique as this set comes with 12 different nozzle tips, a spinning cake board, 50 disposable piping bags, two reusable ones, two icing spatulas, and three cake scrapers. It even comes with how-to guides and videos so you know exactly how each tool is used.
Promising review: "I got this for my little sisterâ€™s birthday since she loves decorating cakes, and it turned out to be a perfect gift. For the price, the quality is really solid â€” definitely a great starter set or something for casual decorators. She especially loved the guide that explains how to use each tip â€” super helpful for learning and pretty accurate. Great for helping her get ideas. The turntable glides smoothly, and the coupler makes switching tips easy. The piping bags are decent; they work fine for most frostings, though super-thick buttercream can cause them to burst if overfilled. Thereâ€™s a nice variety of piping tips, and the frosting spatulas (especially the offset one) have been really useful for her. Sheâ€™s already made some adorable cake and cupcake designs using this kit. Overall, itâ€™s a great gift for anyone just getting into cake decorating â€” fun, functional, and really encouraging for creative baking." â€” Atali Bouck$19 at Amazon14www.amazon.comAn embroidery set in case you've been searching for a "couch rotting" activityPromising review: "I honestly thought this was going to be way more complicated than it is.
