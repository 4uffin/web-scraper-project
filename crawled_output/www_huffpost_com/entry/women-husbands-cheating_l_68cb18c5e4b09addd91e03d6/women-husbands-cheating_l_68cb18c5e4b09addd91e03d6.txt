Then, some formerly married women ended up sharing the stories of how they found out their husbands were cheating. Here are the most interesting ones: 1Artur Debat via Getty Images"I was very young when I got married and really believed in the whole 'happily ever after' and the vows that we took. I worked 60 hours a week, did all the housework and gardening, and even took his car to be serviced for him. He got fired several times, and each job didn’t seem to work out. Everything was OK, but every year, he seemed less involved in our relationship. Then he suddenly found a job that he seemed to really like and worked very long hours. I was glad he was finally getting serious about a job. Nope, it was a woman co-worker at the job he was serious about. There were so many red flags, but I stupidly believed everything he told me. Then one night, he called to say he would be really late getting home from work again and gave a really bad excuse.""Something finally clicked in my head, and I went to his workplace, and he wasn’t there. I went to the bar at the hotel next door to his workplace when I noticed his car there. There he was with another woman, and they were all over each other. It was obvious they would be getting a room soon from their behavior. I didn’t say a word but went back out to my car and drove home. He came home a few hours later and complained about how hard he had been working all night and how he needed a shower. I packed his clothes while he was in the shower and had the suitcase by the door. I told him I had caught him and that I had seen them together. He was shocked. It never occurred to him that I wouldn’t believe his lies forever, I guess. I told him his suitcases were packed by the door, and he needed to leave. He left and moved in with her and never asked for a divorce. Finally, I went to a lawyer and got a divorce, and again, he seemed shocked. I never spoke to him or saw him again, but he is on his fourth wife now. They all got younger and younger, and they all looked like me. This last wife is about 35, and he is 75." — Anonymous, 68 Texas2"Found out earlier this year my husband of 11 years had been cheating on me since we were dating. He had a side chick he once dated and did drugs with back in his hometown. They had known each other for almost 20 years. Each time I was pregnant with our three kids, he would find a reason to go back to his hometown, visit family, sneak out late at night, and see her. After my last birth last December, he forgot his phone in my car one day, so before I gave it back to him, something told me to look in his phone, and sure enough, not only did I find out about the side chick, but he also had been having sex with other women around town too. I have decided to happily divorce him." — Anonymous, 39, Omaha3LordHenriVoton / Getty Images"My husband of 40 years was acting funny. I had mentioned it to my family and friends. I found he would yell at me for no reason, and was always on his phone and going to the bathroom with his phone. We threw a supper for a friend, and my husband's phone kept pinging, so he went outside. I went into the spare bedroom and was able to see him texting a romance scammer. When I confronted him, he tried to hide it. Well, that led to $2,000 being sent. I argued for months trying to save our marriage just to hear 'I can't say I'd never do it again or I'd be lying.' Keeping that in mind, I was always checking his phone. I'm thinking this will never change. He's 71 and I'm only 61, and to think he fell for a scammer who said they were Sandra Bullock. So, I'm thinking it's time to live the rest of my life for me."— AnonymousAdvertisement
4"I was driving to work on the highway and slowly caught up to a couple on a motorcycle. As I got closer, I recognized the bike and his distinct helmet. He had his side piece on the back of his bike on his day off from work! When he finally realized it was me behind him, he quickly veered off at the next exit. We divorced soon afterwards. I later remarried a man who put me and my children above all else. He kind of did me a favor." — Anonymous, 73, RI5Kinga Krzeminska / Getty Images"He started staying late for work, which is expected during a certain time of the year. But that time had passed, and he was still staying late. My mother told me to check his phone. I declined, as that is an invasion of privacy. However, Verizon updates the phone bill in REAL TIME. I logged in to the family phone account to check on a Netflix bundle. They had just increased their prices, and I wanted to see if it made sense to bundle it with the phone plan. He had 600 messages to one number. I called that number and texted. No response. He sent messages to her at 2:14 am, 5:33 am, and a hundred times throughout the day. I can see that he is ignoring me but texting her back. The minute he wakes up, in the middle of the night, and all day long. He tried to deny it, saying it was just a friend. But two days later, he is 'sleeping' while I am taking care of the house and kids. I checked the account, and he was currently texting her. I flipped out.""We are currently in the middle of a divorce. I have since uncovered numerous lies, all the way back to when we first started dating. I feel stupid that I didn’t see his truth from the beginning. The worst part? He won’t leave the house. I have asked him to move out or stay with his parents. Nope. He lives in the basement, works 14-hour days, eats my leftovers, and does NOTHING around the house. The cat has since started peeing in his shower, and while it stinks, it’s also hilarious."— Anonymous, 42, MI6"On my birthday, I walked in on my husband in bed with another man." — Anonymous, 72, KYAdvertisement
7Kmatta / Getty Images"He was selling his old van. His friend went with him and left his girlfriend with me. After giving me a run-around story on the phone that didn’t make sense, his friend’s girlfriend says to me that I’m gullible and that he’s cheating on me. She told me they were all at this bar, so we went there. I walk into the bar, and I see him flirting with and hugging this girl. He has his back to me, but his cousin and friend warn him, and he looks at me and literally runs out of the back of the bar.""The girl yells his name and says, 'Where are you going?' I chase him and ask who that girl is, and he says he doesn’t know her. I ask why she knew his name. He ran away again, and I ended it, but he ended up stalking me. When people show you who they are, believe them."— Anonymous8"I was waiting in my man's office while he did some work on the manufacturing floor. I opened a drawer to look for a pen to write with, and saw a note from a woman inviting him to attend an OB-GYN appointment. When I asked him about it, he admitted that she was an old girlfriend whom he had slept with, 'when he thought I was dumping him,' and she is pregnant. She had staged the scenario, was attending a fertility clinic, and listed him as the partner, and the person with whom they were both hoping for a child together. She thought he’d drop me and stay with her." — Anonymous9Witthaya Prasongsin / Getty Images"This was years ago. I was working in Atlanta. I met him at a kiosk he owned and ran in the mall. He had twin girls, and I had a son. They would play together. I would babysit. One day, we were looking through pictures from his trip to Nigeria. There was one with this woman and him smiling. They were both dressed casually. It didn’t look romantic, but something told me to ask, 'Is this your wife?' He laughed and asked me why I asked that. Fast forward to later that year, and I decided to move home to NC. He said he wanted to come, he missed me, blah blah blah. One day, he called to ask if I could let him borrow money to keep his cellphone on. I told him I would send it, but he’d never asked for money before.""As he was getting on public transportation, he said he’d call me later. Well, he forgot to hang up. I heard him strike up a conversation with a Nigerian man. He told him about his trip and his WIFE. Yes, the woman in the picture was his wife. I didn’t send the money. Weeks later, he called me over and over again. I finally answered and told him I knew. He asked me to be his second wife. As if. He said he was afraid to tell me because I might leave. Duh. It’s been over a decade. He keeps trying to friend me on social media platforms under different names. My block game is strong."— Anonymous, 52, DCAdvertisement
10"Separated from husband of 21 years upon discovering he’d gotten us over a million dollars in debt behind my back. The straw that broke the camel’s back was the discovery of a $300,000 excavator that he’d been hiding from me for six months. As if financial infidelity wasn’t enough, I found out he’d been seeing high-end escorts for ($2000/hr) for the last decade of our marriage. He then threatened me and the kids, so I filed for divorce and left. It’s been four years, and he now owes me $120,000 in spousal and child support, plus $60,000 as an equalizing payment for our divorce. I’m sure I’ll never see a dime of that money, but at least I walked away with my kids, my sanity, and no STDs. Good riddance!!!" — Anonymous, 50, Eureka, CA11FG Trade Latin / Getty Images"My husband of 29 years had a history of cheating. I knew something was off, and I put a tracker in his car. The same address kept coming up. It was a nasty hotel not far from us. One morning, it came up on the tracker while I was at work. I made some excuse that I had to leave, as it was an emergency.""I waited over two hours for him to come out with his girlfriend, the mother of a former student who was married. I confronted them in the parking lot and said, 'Hope it’s worth it. You’re going to lose everything!' Our divorce was finalized in November of 2024."— Anonymous, 5612"Got an email sent to my work email that said: 'Sorry, I didn’t know he was married.' Found out later she was just one of many, including someone who was a close friend." — Anonymous, 43, USAdvertisement
13Witthaya Prasongsin / Getty Images"My husband of seven years and father of my two kids came home at lunch on Valentine's Day and used my computer to check his email. He accidentally left it logged in, he was emailing a coworker whom he had bought a pink iPod for Valentine's, and had called me a 'tax deduction.' I called him just as he was about to address his entire company and told him not to come home."— Anonymous, 50, Colorado14"I was at home watching TV when the evening news was broadcasting from the Horseshoe Bar for an annual festival. My husband was in the background with his friend and his fiancée, and with his arm around another woman. She was the cousin of his friend's fiancée, and she was the daughter of a local dentist. It had been going on for a while. She knew he was married. They had coupled up and went on vacation together to Chicago for a weekend, and were meeting up. I had given him a pager, and when I got the bill she had paged him over 600 times in the month. She called the house frequently and hung up. She was driving by my home. I'll never understand the women who seek out married men for attention." — Anonymous, 57, Cleveland, OH15Aire Images / Getty Images"Back when Pampered Chef home parties were really popular, I bought their can opener. This particular brand worked differently from most can openers and took a little practice to learn how to use. The first day I had it, my husband pulled it out of the drawer and immediately used it correctly. No second thought. I immediately knew he’d been spending enough time at another woman’s house that he knew how to use that can opener. Turns out I was right!"— Anonymous, 50, North CarolinaAdvertisement
16"Married for 12 years. I found a file folder without a label when I was searching the file cabinet for something else. The unmarked folder had some forgettable papers that didn’t mean anything, and a printout of an email exchange between my husband and another woman informing him she was pregnant with his child. It went on with a three-page back-and-forth, followed by a birth announcement for baby Eric, my husband’s middle name. We stayed married until I was done with cancer treatment. Then I left him (with a note) and emptied the bank account. In retrospect, he may have been cheating the entire time I knew him. Dating, engagement, and marriage." — Anonymous, 57, US17MTStock Studio / Getty Images"We'd spent a blissful summer together, he told me we were exclusive — then in August, he got sick with a pretty bad respiratory infection. I moved my home office to his house, took care of him, bought groceries, took him to the doctor, and got his meds. At the end of three weeks, he threw me out, saying that now that he was better, he needed some 'creative space.' Turns out he'd been on kink websites for months (in the car, at the lake, at his mother's, while I was taking care of him), communicating with multiple women, and he'd finally arranged a secret hookup with one of them. After the hookup, he called me, told me he missed me, and asked me to come over for dinner. While I was taking out his trash, I found all the evidence of his wild weekend. He confessed and gave me a song and dance about how sorry he was. Then he did exactly the same thing a month later."— Anonymous18"I came over to my friend's house an hour early, thinking it was no big deal. When I get to the front door, I knock on it. She didn’t answer, so I looked into a window next to the door, and guess what I saw, my husband of one year is kissing my friend." — AnonymousAdvertisement
19Maria Korneeva / Getty Images"He was showing me pictures from a work trip — he handed me the phone and told me to scroll. I then found screenshots of his convo with 'Sexxi Sammi,' a sex worker who was accusing him of being a cop. He screenshotted the texts to prove he wasn’t the police — I still don’t understand why. He was very confused when I explained to him that Sexxi Sammi was not genuinely into him, that she was doing it for money. We were engaged, and I was helping to parent his young kids during the lockdown. Sex work should be legal, and I hope Sexxi Sammi is thriving. I am!"— Anonymous, 40, Kansas City20"I was playing a game on his iPad while he was texting vacation plans with his girlfriend on his iPhone. He didn’t realize that his Apple ID linked the two devices, so I could see everything in real time. Was married for 15 years and have three kids." — Anonymous, 57, South Carolina21PhotoAlto/Frederic Cirou / Getty Images/PhotoAltoAnd finally, "I’m an early riser. I entered my partner’s office and noticed the fax machine was out of paper. After I reloaded the machine, it spewed out a lengthy love letter from another woman. I loaded up a rug I loved into my car and left. I took him back a few times and made each escapade more expensive. After a condo, a Mercedes, a big house, I finally left with $1M and called it quits."— AnonymousAdvertisement
