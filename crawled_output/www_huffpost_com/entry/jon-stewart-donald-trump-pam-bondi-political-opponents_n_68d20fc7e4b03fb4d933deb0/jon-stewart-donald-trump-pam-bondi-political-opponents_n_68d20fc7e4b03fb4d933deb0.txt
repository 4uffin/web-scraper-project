“He does not give a fuck anymore! He’s saying it straight up! Trump is saying, ‘The people like dictators.’ Trump is saying, ‘I hate my opponents and I want them punished.’ And Trump is saying, ‘I’ll use all the levers of government at my disposal to accomplish that goal,’” Stewart said.He directed his message at those backing the president, “So you can get on board with that and say, ‘I’m with that.’ Or you can join the rest of us and fight like hell for this Constitution.” Earlier in the monologue, Stewart celebrated Jimmy Kimmel’s expected return to ABC late night.Disney, ABC’s parent company, lifted its indefinite suspension of Kimmel’s show — a pause that followed threats from Trump’s Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr over Kimmel’s comments about conservatives’ response to Charlie Kirk’s killing.Advertisement
“That campaign that you all launched pretending you were going to cancel Hulu while secretly racing through four seasons of ‘Only Murders in the Building,’ that really worked. Congratulations,” Stewart quipped.Check out more from Stewart’s Monday monologue on “The Daily Show.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
