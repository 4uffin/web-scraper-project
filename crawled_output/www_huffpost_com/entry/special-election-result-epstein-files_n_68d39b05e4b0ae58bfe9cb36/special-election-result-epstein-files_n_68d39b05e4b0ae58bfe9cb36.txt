House Finally Has Magic Number To Demand Docs.A special election result means the files on the disgraced financier — and onetime close friend of Donald Trump — may now be made public.By Lee MoranEuropean correspondent, HuffPostSep 24, 2025, 03:51 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGA special election result in Arizona appears to have put the release of the Epstein files within reach.Adelita Grijalva (D) defeated Daniel Butierez (R) on Tuesday in the race for the state’s 7th District. It means the House petition demanding the Department of Justice release documents on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will soon have the 218 signatures required to trigger a vote.Advertisement
Grijalva has pledged to join fellow Democrats and the handful of Republicans who want the files made public in signing the petition.The bill requiring the files to be released would have to pass the House, Senate and maybe even overcome a presidential veto. And even then it’s unclear whether President Donald Trump’s DOJ would follow the law.

However, the president has, in recent years, downplayed their association and attempted to cast the investigation into his ex-pal as a hoax, prompting outrage from his own base, who want transparency in the case.Advertisement
