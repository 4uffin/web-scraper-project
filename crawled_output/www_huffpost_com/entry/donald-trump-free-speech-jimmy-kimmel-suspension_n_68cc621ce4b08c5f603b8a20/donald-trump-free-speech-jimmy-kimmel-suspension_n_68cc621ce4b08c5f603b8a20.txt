“The stories are — they said, 97% bad. So, they gave me 97, they’ll take a great story and they’ll make it bad. See, I think that’s really illegal, personally,” said the president, who vowed to “immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America” in his inaugural address back in January.Trump — who made a similar evidence-free claim about network TV criticism of him on Thursday, suggesting that broadcast licenses “should be taken away” for having such coverage — added that reporting “has to be at least accurate, at least accurate to an extent.”“Again, when somebody is given, 97% of the stories are bad about a person. That’s no longer free speech. That’s no longer anything. That’s just cheating,” he said.Advertisement
He continued, “And they cheat, and they become really members of the Democrat national committee. That’s what they are, the networks, in my opinion. They’re just offshoots of the Democrat national committee.”Trump: "When you have networks where I won an election in counties -- I guess it's 2,600 to 525, that's called a landslide times two -- when you have that kind of popularity or voter support, and yet 97% of the newscasts are against me ... I think that's really illegal."— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) 2025-09-19T21:02:03.046ZTrump: "When 97% of the stories are bad about a person, that's no longer free speech."— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) 2025-09-19T21:02:58.730ZAdvertisement
The president, along with members of his administration, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr, has made an apparent change of tone on free speech since the assassination of Charlie Kirk.Bondi has faced intense criticism after she suggested that the Justice Department would “absolutely target” people for alleged hate speech. She’d go on to seemingly walk back her comments, declaring that freedom of speech is “sacred” in the U.S. and her office would “never impede upon that right.”TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

On Friday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) likened Carr’s comments to something “right out of ‘Goodfellas’” and — despite not being a fan of Kimmel — warned that his actions could set a “dangerous” precedent, noting that it could be used by Democrats to “silence” Republicans.Trump said he disagreed with Cruz’s assessment, calling Carr an “incredible American patriot with courage” and that the FCC chair doesn’t like to see the airwaves being used “illegally and incorrectly and purposefully horribly.”RelatedDonald TrumpJimmy Kimmelfree speechfirst amendmentcharlie kirkTed Cruz Says Jimmy Kimmel Retaliation Is 'Right Out' Of 'Goodfellas'Conan O'Brien Bluntly Reacts To Kimmel Ouster: 'Anyone With A Conscience Knows'Newsom Slams 'Made Up' Jimmy Kimmel 'Rule' In All-Caps Post Trolling TrumpTrump Throws Tantrum On Air Force One Over Talk Show Hosts Who Criticize Him Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
