However, it raised questions about whether the Trump scion had the correct security clearance to be present, given that such a pivotal moment of national security had taken place.Advertisement
“He deserves it. He deserves it. And he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize so many times over,” Eric Trump told Gina Loudon of Real America’s Voice, while hawking his new memoir “Under Siege.”“I’ve literally been in that office. I was in that office for one conversation where he literally stopped a war,” he claimed. “In fact, I was in the office recently for another one where he stopped another one.”Eric Trump: "He deserves the Nobel Price Prize so many times over. I've been in that office for one conversation where he literally stopped a war ... he deserves that Nobel Peace Prize, he deserves to be on Mount Rushmore, and I think in time he'll get both. pic.twitter.com/BkGkKW3Mx1— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 24, 2025Advertisement
“I mean, the amount of children, and I say children, young kids right now that are running around the world who are alive based on the fact that he stopped conflicts that otherwise would have spiraled out of control,” he added. “There are moms and dads out there who have their kids based on calls that he’s made and conflicts that he’s ended, kind of before they really got out of control.”Those people have “probably zero appreciation that many of their children and many of the people they knew would not be there had it not been for him. And he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize,” Trump concluded, adding his dad “deserves that Nobel Peace Prize, he deserves to be on Mount Rushmore, and I think in time he’ll get both.”Eric Trump did not expand on exactly which conflicts his father had ended.Politifact has ruled the president’s boast about ending seven conflicts as being “misleading.”Watch the full interview here:Advertisement
