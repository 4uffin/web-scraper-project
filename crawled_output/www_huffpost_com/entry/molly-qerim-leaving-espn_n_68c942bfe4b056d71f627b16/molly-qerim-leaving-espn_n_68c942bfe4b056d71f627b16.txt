Smith on the sports network’s signature morning show.“After much reflection, I’ve decided it’s time to close this incredible chapter and step away from First Take,” Qerim wrote on her Instagram Story. “Hosting this show has been one of the greatest honors of my career. Every morning, I had the privilege of sharing the desk with some of the most brilliant, passionate, and entertaining voices in sports — and with all of you, the best fans in the world.Advertisement
“I’m so grateful for what this journey has given me: lifelong friendships, unforgettable memories, and the chance to be part of something truly special. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for welcoming me into your homes.”“Stay tuned,” she added with a smiley face, perhaps indicating an announcement about her next move was forthcoming.Molly Qerim made it official after an outlet reported her planned departure from ESPN.InstagramAdvertisement

ESPN has previously praised Qerim, 41, for her ability to “moderate very strong personalities with both warmth and authority. In this role, she regularly showcases her ability to connect with a wide variety of guests through interview segments.”Qerim’s exit continues a shakeup on “First Take.” In July, ESPN cut ties with Shannon Sharpe, a regular, after he settled a lawsuit brought by an ex-girlfriend who accused him of rape. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
