The plans were set just a day earlier after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) wrote to Trump and demanded a meeting with him to discuss lowering the price of health care in a bill that would keep the government open past Sept. 30. Trump initially agreed to the meeting, but then changed his mind. “The Democrats in Congress seem to have totally lost their way,” he added. “They obviously have no idea what it means to put America First or to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! All Congressional Democrats want to do is enact Radical Left Policies that nobody voted for — High Taxes, Open Borders, No Consequences for Violent Criminals, Men in Women’s Sports, Taxpayer funded ‘TRANSGENDER’ surgery, and much more.”The president said he would be willing to meet with Democrats if they agree with him on his policies.

“To the Leaders of the Democrat Party, the ball is in your court. I look forward to meeting with you when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for. DO THE RIGHT THING!” Trump wrote in his post.“Trump is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there.”- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.)Trump and congressional Republicans are daring Senate Democrats to vote down a short-term funding bill that was narrowly passed by the House last week. They’re refusing to negotiate over the bill, and House Republicans won’t even be in Washington early next week, putting additional pressure on Democratic senators to fold on government funding, as they did in March.

Democrats, meanwhile, have pointed out that 60 votes are required to advance a bill in the Senate, so Republicans can’t act alone. They’ve called the GOP bill “dirty” because it does not extend expiring tax credits for people who get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.The standoff will result in a costly partial government shutdown next week if it is not resolved. Right now, neither side is budging, though the Senate is expected to return Monday to vote on the short-term GOP bill.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

Schumer warned that Trump would “own the shutdown” if he refuses to discuss funding with Democrats.“Trump is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there,” Schumer said in a statement. “While Americans face rising costs and a Republican healthcare crisis, Trump would rather throw a tantrum than do his job. Democrats are ready to work to avoid a shutdown — Trump and Republicans are holding America hostage. Donald Trump will own the shutdown.”RelatedDonald TrumpDemocratic PartyGovernment Shutdownu.s. congressTrump To Meet With Top Democrats As Government Funding Deadline NearsDemocrats Give Ultimatum On Government FundingDemocrats Pressed ‘To Actually Fight’ Trump Over Government Funding This Time Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
