Rogan asked.By Jazmin TolliverTrends Reporter, HuffPostSep 18, 2025, 07:32 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGJoe Rogan is reflecting on the birthday letter President Donald Trump allegedly wrote to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein with a seven-word response.“What the fuck is wrong with you?” he asked during Wednesday’s episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience.”Advertisement
Rogan mocked the alleged letter while reading it with his guest, comedian Jordan Jensen. “It says, ‘Voiceover,’ like he’s like a movie star, like he’s in a script,” Rogan told Jensen before reading the letter aloud. The letter was typewritten inside an outline of a woman’s body. “‘Donald: Yes, there is, but I won’t tell you what it is. Jeffrey: Nor will I, since I also know what it,’” the podcaster began. Taking a moment to ask “who fucking talks like this?” Rogan continued reading: “‘Donald: We have certain things in common, Jeffrey. Jeffrey: Yes we do, come to think of it. Donald: Enigmas never age, have you noticed that? Jeffrey: As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you.’ Ugh. ‘A pal is a wonderful thing.’” Advertisement

May every day be another wonderful secret.’ Ooh.” Trump, who sued The Wall Street Journal and its owner Rupert Murdoch over its July report on the note, has denied writing and sending the letter to Epstein in 2003.

The president also blasted the Journal in a July Truth Social post, calling its report a “false, malicious, and defamatory story.” Rogan went on to say the drawing in Trump’s letter was “weird.” “If that’s what you’re into, that’s a dude. OK? That’s a dude with womanly hips,” he said of the illustration. “Like, look at the boobs. They’re weird.” Jensen then declared that she didn’t understand why Trump is “writing a script.”“Yeah, it’s very odd stuff,” Rogan responded. “But it’s also like the way, like, ‘Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?’ and ‘Jeffrey: As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you.’” Advertisement
Rogan later joked that he would change his number if a friend contacted him in such a manner. “Like, if one of my friends sent me that, I’d be like, I’m getting a new number,” he added with a laugh. “Yeah, you need help. Why didn’t you just write, ‘Happy Birthday’?” Jensen questioned.
