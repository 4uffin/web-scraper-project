Colbert also seized on reports that Trump’s team had flown in his own bedsheets from the United States.“That’s not surprising to me,” the comedian quipped, before delivering his filthy punchline: “I’ve always suspected that Trump sheets his own bed.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
