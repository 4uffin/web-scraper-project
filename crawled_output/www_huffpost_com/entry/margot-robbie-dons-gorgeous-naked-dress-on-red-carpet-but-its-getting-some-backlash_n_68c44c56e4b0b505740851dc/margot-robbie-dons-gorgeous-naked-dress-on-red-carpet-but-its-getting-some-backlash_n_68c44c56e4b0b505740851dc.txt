Elle magazine notes that the dress was also a tribute to the late designer Giorgio Armani, who died earlier this month at age 91. The event also marked Robbie’s first major red carpet event since she gave birth to her son with husband Tom Ackerley.A side view of Robbie’s gown.Samir Hussein via Getty ImagesAdvertisement

Some people found the look gorgeous.“Wow wow wow,” an Instagram user wrote.“The sequins embroidery work on that dress 🤩” another user said.She looks good in everything she wears. 😍— ⊱✿⊰ 𝒜𝓃𝑔𝑒𝓁𝒾𝒸𝒶 𝒲𝒾𝓁𝒹𝑒 ⊱✿⊰ (@angelofdesire07) September 11, 2025Other social media users, however, took one look at the sheer number and clutched their pearls.“Thought she had more respect and class. Another one who fell from grace,” an Instagram user wrote.“Reprensible that any woman would dress like this in public,” an X user said.“While she’s beautiful and it’s beautiful, some things are better left on a hanger. Where is class these days?” another Instagram user wrote.The criticism got a bit more complex when feminism entered the chat.Robbie posing alongside her co-star, Colin Farrell.Joe Maher via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
In 2016, Robbie, who at the time was lauded more for her looks than her acting chops, admitted to the New York Times that the very short shorts her character Harley Quinn wore in David Ayer’s “Suicide Squad” made her feel uncomfortable. (Although she also said at the time that the hotpants were true to the character.) “As Margot, no, I don’t like wearing that,” she told the Times. “I’m eating burgers at lunchtime, and then you go do a scene where you’re hosed down and soaking wet in a white T-shirt, it’s so clingy and you’re self-conscious about it.”In 2020, Robbie reprised her role as Harley Quinn in “Birds of Prey.” This time, the film was directed by Cathy Yan, and Harley’s costumes were noticeably less revealing.Advertisement
“That’s what happens when you have a female producer, director, writer,” the film’s costume designer, Erin Benach, told Vogue in 2019 in a joint interview with Robbie.“Yeah, it’s definitely less male gaze–y,” Robbie agreed.In the very same interview, Robbie also said that she hates being referred to as a “bombshell.”Due to this — and the feminist themes of her 2023 smash-hit “Barbie’ — some social media users implied that Robbie wearing the nude-illusion gown on Thursday was hypocritical.“Now just wait a minute Harley I love you so much but didn’t you say you didn’t wanna be in another Harley Quinn movie that has you wearing too revealing outfits again? I’m so confused. But I love you though,” one Instagram user wrote.Advertisement
“6 years ago Margot Robbie wanted to COMBAT the male gaze. Now she’s desperately seeking it!” an X user wrote.Almost like the whole “male gaze” narrative was a lie all along…— Rising Star Comics - COSMO GIRL #1 on Kickstarter! (@RisingStarCom) September 12, 2025Others found it annoying that the “I, Tonya” star donned a barely there dress while her male co-star was bundled up in a trench coat during a cold London night.Advertisement
“She is beautiful, there is no doubt but it is necessary that she goes practically naked and the worst, next to Colin in a suit and trench? Nonsense!” an Instagram user criticized.“Let’s talk about both outfit,” another Instagram user said. “So the man has a coat for the photos but not the woman. They both look so beautiful but why is it ok for a man ti wear a coat for pictures and not woman.”“The dress/woman is wonderful, the pairing is terrible. The woman stripping down to her underwear and the man buttoned up to the neck? Is that okay in the 21st century? What is the message? ♀️/♂️Ouch 😬” another Instagram user echoed.Advertisement
Robbie likely only wore the dress itself for a few minutes for photographs, because she was also seen on the red carpet sporting a black coat.Robbie was seen wearing a coat on the red carpet.John Phillips via Getty Images20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
