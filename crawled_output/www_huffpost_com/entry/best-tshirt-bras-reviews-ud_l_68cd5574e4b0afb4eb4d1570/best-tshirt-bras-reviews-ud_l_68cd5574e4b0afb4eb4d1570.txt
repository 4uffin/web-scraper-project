It also has a lot to live up to comfort, all-day-worthy support and a smooth, seamless look beneath even your snuggest-fitting tees. If you’re on the hunt for such an indispensable piece, you wouldn’t be alone. Several online reviewers have chimed in to announce that they’ve found their perfect under-T-shirt bra for one reason or another.Advertisement
Based on these reviews, we gathered some of the most promising options with the following list of bras, including options for every bust size, underwire preference and support needs. 1FloatleyAn ultrasoft, lightweight bra from FloatleyAvailable in three colors and sizes 34B-40D, this T-shirt bra features an underwire designed to eliminate poking and digging, thanks to its light yet supportive and soft cushioning. The seamless construction of the bra is flattering and provides an invisible fit under your clothes, featuring an elastic side gel that grips the skin to prevent movement. It's a lovely everyday bra. Promising review: "Best bra I have ever owned!! I'm in my late 60's and I have tried many bras. This one is supportive, comfortable and has the best fit. At my age you start having slippage if you don't have the right fit. Although I was fitted in stores, it wasn't until I tried Floatley's on-line fitting that I finally had success. No more slipping through!!" — anonymous$25 at Floately (regularly $45)2NordstromA fuller coverage supportive underwire braA good option for those with larger chests and who want a bra design that prevents a uni-boob silhouette, this ultra-supportive bra uses seamless and partially lined cups for a smooth contoured look under close-fitting fabrics. It's available in five colors and sizes 30D-44DDD.Promising Nordstrom review: "Terrific fit! Stays on my shoulders so no more 'where did my strap go?' It gives great shape without adding a bunch of padding. Great under T-shirts, dresses and anything where you need a clean line and no seams or outline of an undergarment. Bought two and now bought two more. Just what I needed and was looking for." — ConEd$68 at Wacoal$46+ at Nordstrom3Victoria's SecretA lightly lined wireless braDubbed by Victoria's Secret as "The T-Shirt," this wireless bra features soft, lightly lined cups, convertible straps and an impressive selection of colors and prints to choose from.

Love the color." — Dirty"This is by far my favorite bra ever! It is so soft and silky, I forget it is even there. No bulkiness, moves with your body. Smooth lines in the back too. Wireless support is amazing, I get great shape and lift! Perfect silhouette for any top! I wear it with all work tops, especially white tanks, and with all my evening attire (low cut, strappy tops, and cocktail dresses)." — Russo$29+ at Victoria's SecretAdvertisement
