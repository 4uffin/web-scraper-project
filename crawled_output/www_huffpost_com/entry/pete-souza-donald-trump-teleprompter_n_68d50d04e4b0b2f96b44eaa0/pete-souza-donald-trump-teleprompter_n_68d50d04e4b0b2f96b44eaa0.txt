See Souza’s photo here.Souza posted a 2011 image to Instagram showing White House Communications Agency personnel operating a presidential teleprompter during former President Barack Obama’s time in office.It was “during a normal presidential speech,” the photographer zinged.The equipment is controlled by the president’s own team and not the U.N., Souza noted. A spokesperson for the U.N. backed up that claim following Trump’s complaint about the glitch, although the White House has denied it.“Facts matter,” Souza wrote.“Glitches do happen,” the snapper said, acknowledging how the same system occasionally glitched out during Obama’s addresses too.Advertisement
The post followed Souza’s throwing of shade at Trump after the escalator at the U.N. stopped suddenly after he boarded, forcing him and first lady Melania Trump to walk. The U.N. blamed a Trump staffer who accidentally triggered a safety mechanism. Souza responded by sharing a 2015 photo of Obama gliding up the motorized stairs.CORRECTION: This story has been amended to clarify how the escalator likely stopped, according to the U.N.RelatedDonald TrumpBarack Obama
