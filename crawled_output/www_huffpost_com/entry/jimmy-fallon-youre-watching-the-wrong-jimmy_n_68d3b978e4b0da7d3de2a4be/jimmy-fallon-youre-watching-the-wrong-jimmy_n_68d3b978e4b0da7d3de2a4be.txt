(Watch the video below.)“Welcome welcome welcome to ‘The Tonight Show’!” Fallon began. “And if you’re tuning in to see what I’ll say about my suspension the last couple of days — again, you’re watching the wrong Jimmy. Dad, the other Jimmy, Dad!”Advertisement
Fallon gave the quick nod to Jimmy Kimmel’s return after the ABC host was suspended for remarks about conservatives’ reactions to Charlie Kirk’s murder. But Fallon didn’t dwell. He veered to zinging President Donald Trump’s speech to the United Nations General Assembly:“Trump talked for an hour and at one point he said that the European countries were going to hell. After listening to him ramble for 45 minutes, European leaders were like, ‘I feel like we’re already there.’”Advertisement
Last week, Fallon issued a more serious take on Kimmel’s ouster from the air by Disney amid pressure from the Federal Communications Commission and affiliate companies. Disney, facing a public outcry over censorship and subscription cancellations on some of its channels, brought the show back just days later.“He’s a decent, funny and loving guy and I hope he comes back,” Fallon said at the time.RelatedJimmy KimmelJimmy FallonJimmy Fallon Takes Down Trump's Pressure Campaign In Just 7 WordsJimmy Fallon Addresses Kimmel Suspension: ‘To Be Honest With You All…’Jimmy Fallon Zings Trump In England With A Jolly Good Epstein JabJimmy Kimmel Reveals The 1 ‘Condition’ From Disney For His Return To TV Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
