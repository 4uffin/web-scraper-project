For the millions of Americans who head to Europe each year, it’s easy to overlook cultural nuances or assume things work the same way they do back home. From ordering a coffee to navigating the streets, there are many big and small mistakes that can make a trip more stressful and leave locals less than impressed.Advertisement
To help tourists avoid the most common faux pas, HuffPost asked Europeans to share the missteps they see from U.S. visitors ― and what to do instead. Below, find 14 mistakes that Americans make in Europe, according to locals who have seen it all.Assuming Everyone Speaks English“There’s often an assumption that everyone speaks English, which can be a bit misleading, especially in countries like France, where English isn’t always spoken fluently. It’s important to remember that Europe is not one single culture or language, and that each country has its own identity and ways of communicating.” ― Kenza Sadoun-El Glaoui, Parisian digital creator“Many Europeans ― especially in tourist areas ― do speak English. But making the effort to say even a simple ‘hello’ or ‘thank you’ in the local language changes everything. It’s less about fluency, more about respect.” ― Luli Monteleone, Lisbon, Portugal-based digital marketing specialistAdvertisement
Expecting Air Conditioning Everywhere“Another mistake is expecting air conditioning everywhere. In many European hotels and apartments, especially those situated in historic buildings, AC isn’t a standard. It can surprise (or even frustrate) travelers who are used to it back home literally everywhere.” ― Jane Iskra, Iceland-based elopement and wedding photographer at ISKRA PhotographyMisunderstanding The Tipping Culture“Tipping is another big one. Americans are used to leaving 20% or more, but in Europe, tipping is much smaller ― often just rounding up the bill or leaving 5-10%, with 10% already considered generous.” ― Iskra“A mistake is tipping like it’s New York ― leaving 20% on small bills or getting annoyed with slow service compared to N.Y. Here, most places never expect tips ― and now they’re giving better service to tourists than locals because of it.” ― Carol Batista, Portuguese tour guide and food criticAdvertisement
“The question of tipping often causes confusion. In many European countries, including France, service is already included in the bill. So while tipping isn’t expected the way it is in the U.S., I personally think that leaving a generous tip when the service is truly excellent is always a kind and appreciated gesture. In that sense, it’s not really a mistake, more of a pleasant ‘extra.’” ― Sadoun-El GlaouiUnderestimating Distances“Europe may look small on a map, but trying to visit five countries in 10 days usually leads to exhaustion. High-speed trains and short flights help, but traveling still takes time. Slowing down and focusing on fewer destinations makes for a richer journey.” ― Diana De Lorenzi, Rome-based lifestyle blogger“Another mistake is underestimating distances. On the map, Europe looks compact. In reality, Paris to Rome isn’t a quick day trip ― it’s a plane ticket, not a stroll.” ― MonteleoneAdvertisement
Not Being Open-Minded About Food“A mistake that I think some make boils down to a lack of culinary exploration. Some visit England or a city like London and stick to chain restaurants when they should really try independent restaurants or use the many foodie apps that exist to help try new food experiences. It’s very frustrating seeing online conversations saying that British food is terrible given the many options available beyond English heritage dishes like fish and chips. There are great restaurants run by different diaspora groups across the country. American tourists need to be braver.” ― Ronke Lawal, PR and communications consultant in London“A mistake is ignoring local food ― flying across the Atlantic just to eat fast-food chains you have at home and skipping the local bakery or market next door. Europe really does taste different if you let it.” ― Monteleonekate_sept2004 via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
Wearing The Wrong Attire“Unless you’re headed to a glamorous night out in Mayfair, leave the stilettos at home. Europe is built on cobblestone streets, and I’ve managed to trip on uneven laneways even in flat shoes ― completely sober, mind you. Most women here wear trainers or chunky boots on nights out. European style is far more relaxed, comfortable, and practical.” ― Kelsey Heinrichs, blogger at Kelsey in London“Don’t wear flip-flops and shorts everywhere. There is a difference between beachwear and citywear. I’ve seen gym shorts and Havaianas in fancy restaurants. Not cool!” ― BatistaTrying To Do Too Much In One Short Trip“Only spending one or two nights in a European capital city is a mistake. I understand many Americans have limited vacation days, but you simply can’t see Rome in a day or appreciate Vienna’s beauty in just 24 hours. Europe isn’t meant to be ticked off like a shopping list.” ― HeinrichsAdvertisement
“Six cities in seven days sounds ambitious, and what you’ll really remember are airport lounges and train stations, not piazzas or palaces.” ― Monteleone“Overpacking itineraries is a big mistake. Every country and even each region deserves time. I’ve seen people try to do five countries in 10 days, and while they technically ‘see’ them, they leave exhausted and miss the real experiences that come from slowing down.” ― IskraMissing Out On Conversations With Locals“At the end of the day, the soul of a place is its people — skipping these interactions means missing a big part of the experience. In smaller towns, people are genuinely happy to meet travelers and share their traditions, stories and recommendations.” ― De LorenziAdvertisement
Being Unprepared For All The Walking“Many European cities have restricted traffic zones, narrow medieval streets or are even car-free like Venice. Driving is often impractical. Walking ― and walking a lot ― is an essential part of the European travel experience.” ― De Lorenzi“Americans underestimate how much walking is involved. Europeans walk a lot. And sometimes that ’10-minute walk’ on Google Maps turns out to be a steep uphill climb that leaves everyone out of breath.” ― BatistaTreating Europe As One Country“People show up in Lisbon thinking it’s part of Spain or expecting Aperol spritz vibes like in Italy. But in Europe, every country has its own history and identity. And some tourists’ comments can feel a little offensive to locals. Europe is not one big theme park.” ― BatistaAdvertisement
Expecting Large Portions And Free Refills“A mistake I often see Americans make in Europe is expecting large portion sizes and free refills at restaurants. In many parts of Europe, dining is slower, portions are smaller, and drinks like water often aren’t free.” ― IskraNot Being Mindful Of Boundaries“Another mistake is being friendly too fast and expecting the same. Warmth is lovely, but oversharing with waiters or touching someone you just met can feel overwhelming and abusive. On the opposite side, it also makes Americans more vulnerable to being taken advantage of as customers as well.” ― BatistaVisiting Only The Most Touristy Areas“They tend to only focus on visiting areas where the tourist attractions are, which I understand because that’s how most countries and cities have been sold, but only going to Central London when visiting England, for instance, is so limiting. London is huge and has so much more to offer, especially in terms of food and restaurants. Beyond London, just visiting other parts of the U.K. and England is worth it, if they explore beyond the usual tourist hotspots they’ll really have an unforgettable experience.” ― LawalAdvertisement
“Rome, Florence, Venice, and Milan are stunning, but also overcrowded, expensive and in many ways shaped by mass tourism. The true magic of Italy often lies in smaller towns like Tivoli, my hometown, with its UNESCO World Heritage villas and charming atmosphere, or the countless medieval villages scattered across the country.” ― De LorenziOverlooking The Small Rules And Customs20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Embracing these rhythms makes the experience more authentic.” ― De Lorenzi“A mistake is skipping the small rules ― not validating metro tickets, showing up to dinner without a reservation or entering churches dressed for the beach. Small details, big headaches.” ― MonteleoneAdvertisement
