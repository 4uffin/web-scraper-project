Maher went on to read a social media post from a conservative user who cited President Donald Trump’s attempted assassinations, Kirk’s death and the fatal shooting of Ashli Babbit during the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riots to argue “our side hasn’t fired a bullet.”“Your side has fired a lot of bullets,” Maher said. “And used hammers on [Democrat former House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi’s husband, and used firebombs on the [Pennsylvania’s Democrat] Governor [Josh] Shapiro’s house.”That’s when the discussion turned testy, as Shapiro said he was familiar with “the kind of death threats Charlie was getting.” He then claimed it was clear which side of the political spectrum was responsible for Kirk’s death.Advertisement
“If we are not politically correct, then we understand that if there’s a shooting at a synagogue, it is very likely to be either a white supremacist or a radical Muslim. If it is a shooting of a Republican politician, it is very likely to be a trans, Antifa or Marxist shooter.”Maher interjected, “That is just not true. We don’t know what this kid is.”A suspect in Kirk’s shooting has been caught, but a motive remains unclear. While a Wall Street Journal article reported that shell casings found at the scene were inscribed with “transgender and antifascist ideology,” those details were walked back in an editor’s note.Shapiro argued that “we do know” the 22-year-old suspect, Tyler Robinson, “was of the political left,” citing reporting from The Guardian that a former classmate described Robinson as a “leftist.” That, however, has also been hedged in an editor’s note.Advertisement
“It’s two days out,” said Maher. “We don’t know shit, Ben. We don’t know shit.”Shapiro, seen here at last year's Conservative Political Action Conference in Argentina.Tomas Cuesta/Getty ImagesThe pundit then listed all the theories flooding social media about Robinson, including that he was part of a far-right group “for whom Charlie Kirk was not right-wing enough” — and asked Shapiro point-blank, “But you’re sure he’s not that?”“I’m not sure that he’s not that,” said Shapiro, which prompted Maher to note, “Oh, a minute ago you were sure what he was.”Advertisement
That moment spawned rapturous applause from the host’s studio audience.Shapiro went on to decry the “permission structures” on both sides, from supposed Marxists on the left to white supremacists on the right, for fostering political violence — only to once again state that the left is more responsible than the right.“I think you are projecting your own intellectual rational world onto people who are not living in that universe,” said Maher, to more applause.RelatedBill Mahercharlie kirkBen Shapiroreal timeKash Patel's Use Of This 1 Word In Charlie Kirk Farewell Has Social Media BuzzingCharlie Kirk's Widow Erika Hails Him As A 'Martyr' In First Remarks Since His DeathJesse Watters’ ‘War’ Remarks After Charlie Kirk’s Killing Have Experts Sharing 1 Dire WarningMaggie Haberman Says Trump Is 'Struggling' With Messaging Around Charlie Kirk's Death Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
