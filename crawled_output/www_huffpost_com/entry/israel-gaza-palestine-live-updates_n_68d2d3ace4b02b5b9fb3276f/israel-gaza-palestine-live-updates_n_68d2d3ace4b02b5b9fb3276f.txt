With support from the United States, Israeli forces also continue to target journalists and hospitals while blocking most aid and food from entering the enclave.Advertisement
The Gaza Health Ministry says Israeli forces have killed at least 65,300 Palestinians — considered a gross undercount – and wounded nearly 167,000 since October 2023, when Hamas militants killed about 1,200 in Israel and took 200 hostages, about 50 of whom remain in captivity. Israeli forces are also accused of attacking Palestinians in the West Bank and enabling settler violence.Activists, world leaders, human rights groups, genocide scholars and most recently a U.N. committee have determined that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, a finding Netanyahu vehemently rejects. Leaders of several Western nations also recently announced their recognition of a Palestinian state at the U.N. in hopes of pursuing a two-state solution for the region.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Guards also carry out violence against detainees during frequent cell searches. The doctor was reportedly in the same clothes as when he was arrested, until he received a new set on Thursday.Despite repeatedly requesting to see a doctor for his scabies and history of heart problems, Abu Safiya said he has not been examined by an Israel Prison Service physician since his arrest in December 2024."Dr. Abu Safiya's case is just one of many that illustrate the systematic and sweeping harm inflicted on Gaza's medical teams," Naji Abbas, director of PHRI's Prisoners and Detainees Department, said in a statement. "Instead of caring for thousands of wounded people in Gaza, doctors and nurses are being held in unlawful detention in Israel. This is both a moral and legal crime."Advertisement

He added, “It’s time to stop now.”Trump has long bragged about his close relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but the president has faced pressure from Arab leaders, who have publicly expressed concerns about the Israeli military acting to annex more territory.Read more from AP:Advertisement

Settler violence has also led to increased Palestinian displacement in the West Bank."We will not leave our homeland, we will not leave our lands. Our people will remain rooted like the olive trees, firm as the rocks," Abbas continued. "We will rise from under the rubble to rebuild and to send from our blessed holy land messages of hope … and build the bridges of just peace for the people of our region and the entire world."Advertisement

Abbas said that while the growing recognition gives hope to Palestinians for an end to the violence, such announcements are only symbolic if they are not paired with tangible action."The time has come for the international community to do right by the Palestinian people, so that they may obtain their legitimate rights to be rid of the occupation, and to not remain a hostage to the temperament of Israeli politics, which denies our rights and continues in their injustice, oppression and aggression," he said.Abbas also pledged to work with leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, on a peace plan for Gaza known as the New York Declaration, which was overwhelmingly supported by the General Assembly earlier this month. The plan lays out a path for a two-state solution, which Israel has staunchly rejected.Advertisement

He also said that Hamas and other militants will be required to surrender their weapons."We reiterate that we do not want an armed state," Abbas said from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.Advertisement

Seventeen others were killed in the strike.“We renew our demand for a clear account from the Israeli authorities and urge the government to uphold its obligations to ensure press freedom and protection,” the statement from the AP and Reuters said. “We remain devastated and outraged by their deaths.”Read more:Advertisement

Attaf on Tuesday called for Palestine's full membership to the UN.Advertisement

"The suffering is a stain on our collective conscience."Pakistan was among the first few countries to recognize a Palestinian state, after Yasser Arafat declared Palestinian independence in 1988. Dar welcomed the latest slew of nations recognizing statehood, though stressed that it must be paired with tangible steps toward accountability and justice."The time for words has passed," he said. "The time for action is now."Advertisement
Sep 23, 2025, 5:27 PM EDTSanjana KaranthSOPA Images via Getty ImagesPro-Israel Policy Group Applauds Global Recognition Of Palestinian StatehoodThe president of pro-Israel policy group J Street welcomed the decision by several world leaders this week to recognize a Palestinian state at the UN, rejecting claims by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S. President Donald Trump that such recognition only rewards Hamas."Recognition of a Palestinian state is not a gift to Hamas. It's a blow to extremists on both sides who reject coexistence," Jeremy Ben-Ami said in a statement. "A secure, functioning Palestine will be essential to any 'day after' plan in the wake of Gaza: it's key to a ceasefire, the release of hostages and ensuring Hamas never governs the Strip again." "What truly fuels Hamas is Prime Minister Netanyahu's endless settlement expansion, permanent occupation and threats of annexation that isolate Israel and endanger its democracy."Advertisement
