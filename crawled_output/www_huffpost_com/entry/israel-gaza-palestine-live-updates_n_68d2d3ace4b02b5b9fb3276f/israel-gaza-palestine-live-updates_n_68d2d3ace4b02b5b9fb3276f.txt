With support from the United States, Israeli forces also continue to target journalists and hospitals while blocking most aid and food from entering the enclave.Advertisement
The Gaza Health Ministry says Israeli forces have killed at least 65,300 Palestinians — considered a gross undercount – and wounded nearly 167,000 since October 2023, when Hamas militants killed about 1,200 in Israel and took 200 hostages, about 50 of whom remain in captivity. Israeli forces are also accused of attacking Palestinians in the West Bank and enabling settler violence.Activists, world leaders, human rights groups, genocide scholars and most recently a U.N. committee have determined that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, a finding Netanyahu vehemently rejects. Leaders of several Western nations also recently announced their recognition of a Palestinian state at the U.N. in hopes of pursuing a two-state solution for the region.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Attaf on Tuesday called for Palestine's full membership to the UN.Advertisement

"The suffering is a stain on our collective conscience."Pakistan was among the first few countries to recognize a Palestinian state, after Yasser Arafat declared Palestinian independence in 1988. Dar welcomed the latest slew of nations recognizing statehood, though stressed that it must be paired with tangible steps toward accountability and justice."The time for words has passed," he said. "The time for action is now."Advertisement

It's a blow to extremists on both sides who reject coexistence," Jeremy Ben-Ami said in a statement. "A secure, functioning Palestine will be essential to any 'day after' plan in the wake of Gaza: it's key to a ceasefire, the release of hostages and ensuring Hamas never governs the Strip again." "What truly fuels Hamas is Prime Minister Netanyahu's endless settlement expansion, permanent occupation and threats of annexation that isolate Israel and endanger its democracy."Advertisement
