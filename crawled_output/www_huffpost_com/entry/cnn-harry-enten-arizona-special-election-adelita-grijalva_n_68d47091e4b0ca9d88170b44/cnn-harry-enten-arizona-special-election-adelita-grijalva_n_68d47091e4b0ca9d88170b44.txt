(Watch the segment below.)The victory by Grijalva — a progressive set to succeed her father after he died from cancer in March — further trims down on the GOP’s slim House majority and, according to Enten, indicates a “massive move to the left” in the district.Advertisement
Grijalva won the special election by a margin of +39 percentage points, according to 87% of the estimated vote. That’s better than former Vice President Kamala Harris, who took the district by +22 percentage points last year.Enten argued that Grijalva’s win in the district — which neighbors the U.S.-Mexico border — is linked to Democrats doing “much better” in predominantly Latino districts.And, he added, Grijalva joins others in her party who outperformed their opponents in a House special election this year.Advertisement
In the average House special election, Democrats are doing +18 percentage points better this year than Harris did in 2024, per Enten.“Again, this is one of the best signs that Democrats have had, so far — when people vote, Democrats are doing significantly better than they did just a little bit less than a year ago,” Enten said.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
