Man Accused Of Spitting At National Guard Sees Felony Case DismissedThe judge offered a rebuke of Jeanine Pirro’s office: “The way this is supposed to work is the U.S. Attorney’s Office does its due diligence.”By Dave JamiesonLabor Reporter, HuffPostSep 16, 2025, 01:58 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGA judge dismissed a felony case Tuesday brought against a Washington, D.C., man whom prosecutors had accused of spitting at two National Guard members during President Donald Trump’s crackdown on crime in the nation’s capital.The dismissal amounted to another embarrassing walkback by the office of Jeanine Pirro, the former Fox News host who is now Trump’s U.S. attorney for D.C. Prosecutors filed several cases accusing D.C. residents of assaulting federal agents, only to see the charges fall apart in a matter of weeks or even days.Advertisement
During a hearing in federal court Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Caelainn Carney said the government moved to withdraw the felony charge against Scott Pichon after reviewing the evidence in the case. Carney had filed a motion last week saying dismissing the matter would be “in the interests of justice.”The original charge carried prison time of up to eight years. Instead, the government is prosecuting Pichon in city court on a less serious misdemeanor charge.Magistrate Judge Matthew J. Sharbaugh seemed visibly annoyed during the Tuesday hearing, saying the U.S. Attorney’s Office had been wasting the court’s time with felony charges that went nowhere. He said the office should have reviewed the evidence closely before bringing such a serious charge.Advertisement
“The way this is supposed to work is the U.S. Attorney’s Office does its due diligence,” Sharbaugh said at one point. Trump asserted federal control over D.C.'s police department last month.via Associated PressHe noted that Pichon had spent time in jail before being released, all for a case that would soon be dismissed.

Pichon had been riding a Lime scooter near Union Station in D.C. when the alleged incident took place. He was arrested by an Amtrak police sergeant.Trump asserted federal control over D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department in August, claiming crime in the capital was out of control – despite the fact that violent crime in the city recently hit a 30-year low, according to Justice Department figures.

Encounters between residents and these agents led to several cases in which Pirro’s office claimed federal officials were assaulted.Advertisement
In one high-profile case, a former Justice Department employee threw a sandwich at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer, becoming a local hero for what was taken as an act of resistance. A grand jury declined to return an indictment, leading to the felony case being dismissed. Like Pichon, the alleged sandwich thrower now faces a misdemeanor assault charge instead, with a jury trial scheduled for next month.RelatedDonald Trumpjeanine pirroJeanine Pirro Dealt Another Humiliation In Federal CourtThe Folk Hero Known As 'Sandwich Guy' Is Facing Up To A Year In JailJeanine Pirro Is Getting Embarrassed In Federal Court Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
