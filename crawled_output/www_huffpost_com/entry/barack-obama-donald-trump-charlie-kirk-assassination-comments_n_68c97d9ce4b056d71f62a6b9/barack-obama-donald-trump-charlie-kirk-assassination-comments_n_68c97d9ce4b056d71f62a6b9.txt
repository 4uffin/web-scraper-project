“I think George W. Bush believed that. I believe that people who I ran against — I know John McCain believed it. I know Mitt Romney believed it,” Obama said.“What I’m describing is not a Democratic value or a Republican value. It is an American value. And I think at moments like this, when tensions are high, then part of the job of the president is to pull people together,” he said.Following Kirk’s assassination last week, Trump slammed those on the left who compared Kirk to a Nazi, calling such rhetoric “directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today.”Advertisement
Others on the right, including Eric Trump, the president’s son, have seemingly referred to those on the left as “they” while playing into the blame game, as well.Former President Barack Obama responded to Donald Trump's statements following Charlie Kirk's killing, saying it was a “mistake” for the president to identify an “enemy” immediately after the shooting despite a lack of evidence indicating the shooter’s motive.

He suggested that it was a “mistake” for Trump to identify an “enemy” despite a lack of evidence indicating the shooter’s motive at the time. Obama later turned to his response to the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina, shooting targeting Black churchgoers, noting that he didn’t use it as an attempt to target his political opponents.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

“And so when I hear not just our current president but his aides, who have a history of calling political opponents ‘vermin,’ enemies who need to be targeted, that speaks to a broader problem that we have right now, and something that we’re going to have to grapple with — all of us,” he said.Obama — who called Kirk’s assassination “horrific and a tragedy” — stressed that Americans, regardless of their political affiliation, must recognize that there are “extremists” and those who make comments contrary to what he believes are the country’s “core values” on both sides of the aisle.RelatedDonald TrumpBarack Obama
