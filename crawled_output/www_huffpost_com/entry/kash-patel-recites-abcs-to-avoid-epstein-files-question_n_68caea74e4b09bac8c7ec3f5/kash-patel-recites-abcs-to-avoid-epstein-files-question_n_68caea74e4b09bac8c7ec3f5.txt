Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) asked Patel if he had ever told Trump that he was in the files.Advertisement
After Patel said no, Swalwell asked, “Did you ever tell the attorney general that Donald Trump’s name is in the Epstein files?” This time, Patel avoided answering the question with a simple yes or no.“The attorney general and I have had numerous discussions about the entirety of the Epstein files and the reviews conducted by our teams,” he said.Although Attorney General Pam Bondi told the president back in May that his name came up multiple times in various documents related to the late sex offender, Patel wouldn’t respond to Swalwell’s question, which the congressman noted.Advertisement
“It’s a simple question,” Swalwell said. “Did you tell the attorney general that the president’s name is in the Epstein files?”Patel avoided a direct answer, which ticked off Swalwell to the point where he shouted that “the question is simple,” and repeated it again, this time slower.“Did you tell Donald Trump that his name was in the Epstein files? Yes or no,” Swalwell said in an irritated tone.Advertisement
“Why don’t you try spelling it out if you’re going to mock?” Patel griped, as Swalwell repeated, “Yes or no!” “Use the alphabet!” Patel fired back. “No? A, B, C, D, E, F ... don’t want to do it?”Patel then avoided answering the question by snarkily telling the California Democrat to focus on crime in his own state.Swalwell asked Patel the question 10 times before Patel insisted that “the question has been asked and answered.”Advertisement
Swalwell noted that no such thing had happened.“You have not answered it, and we will take your evasiveness as a consciousness of guilt,” Swalwell said.You can see the clip below.FBI Director Kash Patel reciting his ABCs to avoid question on Trump-Epstein connection pic.twitter.com/hsor22S2zh— Alexander Willis (@ReporterWillis) September 17, 2025PowerOurJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour membership fuels reporting that informs, inspires, and holds power accountable.

At one point, Patel and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) got into a shouting match with Patel yelling, “Your time is over,” and calling the New Jersey senator an “embarrassment.”He also risked pissing off MAGA members by claiming he had “no credible information” that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked young women to people besides himself.RelatedDonald Trumpjeffrey epsteinkash patelhouse judiciary committeeepsteinKash Patel Didn’t Remember Charleston Mass ShootingCory Booker And Kash Patel Get Into Extraordinary Shouting MatchKash Patel Makes An Epstein Comment That Is Likely To Anger MAGAFBI Director Kash Patel Grilled Over Charlie Kirk Shooting At Senate Hearing Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
