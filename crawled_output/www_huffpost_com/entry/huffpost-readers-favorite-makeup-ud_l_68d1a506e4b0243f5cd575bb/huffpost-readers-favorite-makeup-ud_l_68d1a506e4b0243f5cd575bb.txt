But every once in a while, a beauty product is so stellar that it transcends all limitations and becomes a cult-favorite among makeup fanatics and casual users alike.We combed the data based on our previous coverage to find what HuffPost readers’ favorite makeup is, and it turns out that there are quite a few beloved items. And while HuffPost readers overwhelmingly favor brands like Armani Beauty, Merit and Tower 28, they have some stiff competition from others. Below, we’ve rounded up the makeup our readers can’t get enough of — pick up a few of these must-have staples and elevate your everyday routine. Advertisement
Ultaaf94 *69 gel eyelinerHuffPost Shopping writer Tessa Flores was pleasantly surprised when she tried this gel-cream eyeliner by indie beauty brand af94, and HuffPost readers are in agreement. Available in six shades, it applies with the ease and control of a traditional pencil eyeliner but with greater opacity than you would expect and no skipping or dragging on the skin.Flores said, "It actually feels more like a cream than anything else and is similar to other gel-based pencils of luxury origins like Bobbi Brown's Perfectly Defined gel eyeliner. I like that I'm able to smoke it out a bit into a wing with a fine eyeliner brush to get that soft cat eye look and because it's a gel formula, it really doesn't budge once it dries down. I've even worn it to dance classes and it doesn't move." Additionally, she noted that you also don't need a sharpener because it's a twist-up pencil that automatically sharpens with each turn.$4 at Ulta (regularly $8)WalmartThrive Causemetics Brilliant Eye BrightenerThis illuminating eye stick by Thrive Causemetics, a beauty brand dedicated to crafting makeup suitable for mature skin, is meant to make eyes look more lifted and awake. Apply the versatile, waterproof and cream-to-powder formula in the waterline, inside corners of the eyes or beneath the brow bone. It comes in 28 light-reflecting shades, and is infused with macadamia and meadowfoam seed oils to prevent a drying texture that settles into creases. Promising review: "I absolutely love them! They go on smoothly and they last all day! They don’t smudge and they blend nicely. My skin is not smooth, I’m 67 years old and they look great, no creasing." — Melinda K.$26 at Thrive CausemeticsSephoraTower 28 Swipe all-over hydrating serum concealer"Ever since I discovered the Tower 28 concealer, I actually stopped using foundation," says BuzzFeed editorial VP Peggy Wang. Wang, who is in her early 40s, has normal to dry skin and says the concealer "blends so nicely and gives great coverage, and it saves me time in the morning. I just dab some on my forehead, under the eyes, around the nose, and around my chin, and buff it in using a foundation brush. It actually stays put and I don't get the greasiness or heaviness that comes with using an all over foundation."Kam can also vouch for this one: she bought it when her local Sephora didn't have the Benefit Boi-ing Cakeless Concealer in stock, and she found that the Tower 28 is light and isn't cakey — it barely even feels like wearing makeup when she has it on. It's available in 20 shades and has a natural finish and medium coverage. In previous coverage of popular concealers, it was a clear favorite among readers.$22 at SephoraAdvertisement
MeritMerit The Minimalist Perfecting complexion stickMerit's foundation stick is, in my opinion, the crown jewel of the brand's collection — and HuffPost readers tend to agree. It glides on effortlessly, has a creamy consistency and gives you just the right amount of buildable coverage. It's incredibly versatile, too. Some days I use it just as an under-eye concealer or to spot correct around my nose or to hide pimples, and when I want fuller coverage, I use it as an all-over foundation. It leaves skin looking glowy, but not oily, has a dewy finish and, unlike many hydrating foundations, it actually lasts all day long. It's available in 20 different shades, is safe for acne-prone skin like mine, conditions and moisturizes the skin and can even be used as a contour — just go three shades darker than your usual hue if that's how you plan to use it.$38 at MeritAdvertisement
SephoraCharlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless FilterIn previous coverage, makeup artists recommended products that helped them look younger, and this Charlotte Tilbury "glow from within" complexion booster was a huge fan favorite. Veteran makeup artist and makeup department head Lindsay Garrison's absolute favorite product for achieving that "lit from within glow" is Charlotte Tilbury's cult-favorite Hollywood Flawless Filter, a unique product that hydrates, illuminates and blurs imperfections."You can mix it in with your foundation for an all over dewy finish or just apply it to the high points of your face, like the tops of your cheekbones, for added radiance," Garrison said.This must-have Charlotte Tilbury item is now available at Amazon, along with the rest of the brand's lineup. $49 at Sephora$49 at AmazonWalmartMaybelline Color Sensational cream finish lipstickThis shea-butter infused drugstore bestseller is available in a veritable encyclopedia of shades, and the deeply pigmented Red Revival is a clear customer (and HuffPost reader) favorite.Promising Walmart reviews: “I've never tried this formula before but I'm pleasantly surprised by how well it wore. The pigment is there, the texture is nice and smooth and not overly drying. A definite rebuy.” — Kayla“This is the only lipstick I have used that truly moisturizes. Smooth feel on the lips, the colors available are beautiful and fully pigmented. Great price point too!” — Sue“The Maybelline brand is an outstanding lipstick that stays on your lips and shouts, Lookin good and I'm here to stay. The phenomenal Reds that u have to choose from is awesome because that is my favorite color.” — Jackie$5 at WalmartAdvertisement
Jones RoadJones Road Miracle balmThe Jones Road Miracle balm is a skin-enhancing pigment thoughtfully created to address common concerns associated with aging skin like dullness and dryness. Slightly reflective, the hydrating balm imparts a wash of soft-focus, and contains skin-conditioning ingredients like vitamin E and softening seed oils. It's available in 13 sheen-inducing shades that can be used as blushes, bronzers, highlighters, face bases and more. It's a fave with HuffPost readers with mature skin.Promising review: "I am 50 and I have tried it on for 3 days now. I am glad I did not have the rash reactions as other users reported. I have had the same experience as others have reported - pretty sticky on the face. I think I like it better than the other foundation products I have tried. The concept is pretty straightforward - if you have dry/mature skin and is looking for a solution to [brighten] up your complexion effortlessly. This works!" — Yao h$40 at Jones RoadAmazonMaybelline Super Stay Ink Crayon matte longwear lipstickThis Maybelline lip crayon got huge numbers from readers in former HuffPost coverage. It works as a lipstick and a liner in one, letting you outline, shape and fill lips at once. Depending on how lightly or heavily you apply them, you can get a sheer wash or layer it on for more coverage. It’s available in tons of shades at Amazon, Walmart and Target, and also comes with a handy built-in sharpener.Promising review: “I find these lipsticks/stains great. There is no drying effect and the colour lasts. The tips are slim enough to effectively line the lips so no need to have a separate liner. I am a repeat buyer of different shades.” — Lesley-Ann LS$10 at Amazon$8 at Walmart$10 at TargetSephoraWestman Atelier Vital Skincare complexion dropsI am a longtime fan of this foundation, and HuffPost readers love it as well. This liquid foundation has a thin, lightweight and serum-like consistency — almost like a tinted moisturizer – with light-to-medium buildable coverage that looks just like my own skin, but way better. It blends beautifully with both brushes or a sponge and, somehow, it manages to blur my breakouts and cover redness and dark circles without looking or feeling heavy. I’ve gotten compliments almost every time I’ve worn it from people who think it’s my natural, makeup-free face. It’s gentle and hydrating, doesn’t clog pores and gives my skin an overall healthy glow. Another reason I am obsessed with it is that while it does have a dewy finish, it doesn’t leave my skin looking slick or oily. It dries down to an almost powdery consistency that leaves my skin velvety smooth and stays put all day long. it’s packed with serum-style ingredients like squalane, tsubaki oil, ginseng extract and more to improve the look of skin texture, reduce redness, soothe irritation, hydrate and brighten the complexion. The foundation is available in 20 different shades, all of which correspond to the brand’s stick foundation shades. $68 at Sephora$68 at Nordstrom$68 at Violet GreyAdvertisement
SephoraCaliray Come Hell Or High Water tubing mascaraCaliray's Come Hell or High Water tubing mascara is an Allure 2022 Best of Beauty award winner, designed to curl, add volume and wash off with warm water. This non-flaking and easy-to-remove mascara was the clear favorite in HuffPost's piece about mascaras worth the splurge.As mentioned in previous coverage, the inclusion of certain ingredients — like polymers — in high-end mascaras could justify an increased price tag.Tubing mascara may be a good example of this. Distinct from standard mascara, tubing formulas contain polymers that wrap around lashes to lengthen and define; traditional mascara, on the other hand, utilizes pigmented waxes and oils that have a greater propensity to smudge and flake. Folks with sensitive eyes may also find tubing formulas preferable since they require much less tugging and rubbing on the eye area to remove.Promising Sephora review: “It doesn’t take much to make me cry, I live in a very humid climate, I have sensitive eyes, AND I wear contacts. That is a recipe for a mascara disaster on a daily basis. However, this is the first mascara I have ever used that none of that mattered. It doesn’t smudge, smear, streak or flake. I love it. I highly highly recommend!” — tinkerbellmama$14+ at SephoraAmazonNyx Butter GlossHuffPost Shopping writer Erika Kam has been using Nyx's Butter Gloss for almost 10 years now with no plans of stopping any time soon. It's pigmented but wearable for an everyday look, comes in so many gorgeous colors and has a smooth texture that feels nice on the lips. Her go-tos are the nudey-pink shade Tiramisu or occasionally the bolder Red Velvet, but the clear Sugar Glass is the most popular at Amazon and would look great on its own or over another lip color.Promising review: "This lip gloss is my ride or die holy grail. I have almost all the colors. It's so smooth and moisturizing, lasts a long time and I love the colors!!" — HatchMama$6 at AmazonSephoraRare Beauty by Selena Gomez Soft Pinch liquid blushHuffPost readers snap up this blush, and with good reason. Former Shopping writer Haley Zovickian, senior life editor Lindsay Holmes and Niforos can all vouch for Rare Beauty's quality, with Zovickian and Niforos specifically highlighting the brand's Soft Pinch liquid blush. "The liquid blush went TikTok viral several times over the incredible color payoff and the gorgeous shades," Zovickian says. "A little goes a long way so it's sure to last!" The blush comes in four matte finish shades and nine radiant finish shades. The tube comes with a doe foot applicator so you can easily apply and blend one or two dots (that's all you need!).$25 at SephoraAdvertisement
AmazonL'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Radiant serum foundation with SPF 50Intentionally formulated for lightweight wear that won't settle into fine lines, this concentrated serum foundation for mature skin promises a radiant finish, buildable coverage and broad spectrum SPF 50 protection. Available in 15 shades, this foundation also contains vitamin B3, an antioxidant that can neutralize environmental stressors responsible for premature skin aging. It was HuffPost readers' top pick in previous coverage of tinted sunscreens.$15 at AmazonAmazonE.l.f. no-budge retractable eyelinerCreamy and pigmented, this retractable eyeliner is waterproof and will last for the day. It comes in a streamlined package that is easy to put on and will ensure you get the product exactly where you want it and not anywhere you don't. It's a beloved item that HuffPost readers with mature skin picked up in droves.Promising reviews: "All of ELF's products are great, but this eyeliner is the best I've ever used, and I'm 50 so I have used a lot of eyeliners." — Lara Beth“Love it. I am an older woman, most pencil liners pull my skin and don't produce a good continuous line. This pencil glides on and STAYS out all day long!!!!” — Kindle Customer$6 at AmazonSephoraFenty Beauty by Rihanna Eaze Drop blurring skin tintIn previous coverage regarding celebrity beauty brands, Wellness reporter Jillian Wilson put forth a recommendation for the Eaze Drop blurring skin tint by Fenty Beauty. She was backed up by operations associate Alexandra Niforos and news reporter Sanjana Karanth, who have also used and loved it. HuffPost readers couldn't get enough, either.(Fenty Beauty also appears to be a popular choice over on Reddit, as celebrity brands go.)The skin tint is light coverage with a natural finish. The formula is sweat- and transfer-resistant and can be applied with your fingers, a sponge or a brush to buff it out. There are 25 shades available (the two shown here are 1 and 25).$39 at SephoraAdvertisement
SephoraSephora Collection Love The Lift Curling + Volumizing mascaraA Sephora-exclusive option, this volume-inducing and curl-preserving formula boasts an ultra-creamy and buildable texture that's enhanced with lifting wax to keep lashes fanned out, curled and in place. In previous reporting covering the best curling mascaras, HuffPost readers flocked to this option.Promising Sephora review: "I can’t believe I love this mascara. It actually does what it says it’s going to do. I was shocked. My eyelashes are like straight, they never stay curled and lifted. This mascara does it! I’m gonna buy more as backups, just in case they ever get rid of this." — Jackieg862$15 at SephoraSephoraMilk Makeup's cooling water jelly cheek and lip tintTikTok managed to sell out this reader-beloved cheek and lip tint back in 2024. (Luckily, multiple retailers are fully stocked now.) Meant to be worn on both the cheeks and lips, Milk Makeup's Cooling Water jelly tint features a bouncy Jello-like texture and glides on the perfect touch of glassy, buildable color. The hydrating formula is also infused with vegan collagen, soothing aloe and refreshing seawater.$26 at Sephora$26 at Amazon$26 at Milk MakeupNordstromArmani Beauty Luminous Silk foundationIn previous coverage, Flores noted that
Luminous Silk foundation by Armani Beauty is one product in particular that has been suggested to us by several experts, one of whom called it a “never cakey, lightweight and dewy” foundation that leaves a skin-perfecting, natural-looking finish. Iit's also beloved by HuffPost readers.Available in 40 shades, this medium-coverage and buildable foundation uses what the brand refers to as “micro-fil technology” to allow color pigments to lay flat for seamless blending and layering. The long-lasting formula also claims to improve the look of irregular skin texture while maintaining that lit-from-within glow.$48+ at Nordstrom$69 at SephoraAdvertisement
Amazone.l.f. Camo peach color correctorSenior security director Greta Geiselman says she's "a big fan of using a peach concealer first for the dark circles." Geiselman, 48, has combination skin and says her favorite concealer is the e.l.f. Camo Color Corrector in the shade Peach. Because peach is in the orange family, directly opposite blue and purple on the color wheel, it can correct the darkness of under-eye circles when used underneath another concealer or foundation, according to e.l.f.The Camo Color Corrector has a satin finish, is full coverage and contains hydrating hyaluronic acid. Best of all, it's a total steal at under $5. No wonder it's HuffPost readers' top drugstore concealer.$5 at AmazonRelatedshoppingBeautyMakeupThese Are HuffPost Readers' Favorite Makeup BuysWe Shop For A Living And These Are Our Favorite Products EverMeet The Winning Beauty Products That Earned A HuffPicks Awards Seal Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
