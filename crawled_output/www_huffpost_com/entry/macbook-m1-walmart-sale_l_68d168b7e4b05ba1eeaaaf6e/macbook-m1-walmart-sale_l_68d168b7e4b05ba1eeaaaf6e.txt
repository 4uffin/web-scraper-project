But if you’re already using devices like an iPhone, iPad, AirPods or an Apple Watch, it can be incredibly convenient to have a laptop that will integrate seamlessly into all of your existing tech.So when we spotted a brand-new 13.3-inch MacBook Air at Walmart for $599, our jaws dropped. The laptop first hit the market at a whopping $999, has since been discounted and now it’s the lowest price we’ve ever seen it. Advertisement
$599 at Walmart (Regularly $649)Walmart doesn’t list an original retail for the machine (at debut, at least), so we did some quick comparison sleuthing. Apple is no longer carrying this version on its website. (It’s been reported that Apple is retiring this model, which may account for the drop in price.) Available in three colors, the laptop offers a convenient 18 hours of battery life on a single charge. Apple’s reliable M1 chip (which the brand describes as a “major breakthrough”) has 16 billion transistors and eight CPU cores that promise faster performance than its predecessors, and eight gigabytes of memory to keep your machine operating at a speedy clip. It also comes with Apple’s standard one-year warranty, 90 days of complimentary tech support and the option to purchase AppleCare for extended coverage.Advertisement
$599 at Walmart (Regularly $649)Based on the Walmart website, hundreds of customers have already taken advantage of this deal, and it’s likely that inventory is limited. Don’t miss out on this sale!“Really great laptop! My older MacBook stopped working, and the initial set up was extremely simple, the keyboard is really nice, the screen is really high definition, perfect for streaming and movies. I love how reliable it is, the OS is very smooth and snappy. Will eventually get an M4 once the price comes down.” — anonymous “Loooveee my MacBook!! Mine is silver but I bought this one in “gold” for my cousin, because the gold looks more like a rose gold pinky color. Love mine so much, and she loves hers. It takes like a whole day or two for my computer to die after fully charging it which is great, because I use the computer a lot for work. I work from home and in office, while also doing my personal projects on it too and it’s perfect for everything. Plus it’s Apple, so you get to use it interchangeably with your iPhone. (My phone died once and I left my charger at my boyfriends, so I FaceTimed him through my computer to ask to pick it up at 1am the night before I had to go to work. Saved me!)” — devanny “This is my first Apple product! I’m usually a Windows user, but I got this pink MacBook because of the price. So happy with my purchase! It’s fast, reliable, lightweight, and fits perfectly in my backpack. The battery lasts 10 hours and it’s super easy to use. Highly recommend! No issues with the packaging or the device itself. Picked it up at the store.” — Gladys$599 at Walmart (Regularly $649)The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics. Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount. (And when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why.) Advertisement
