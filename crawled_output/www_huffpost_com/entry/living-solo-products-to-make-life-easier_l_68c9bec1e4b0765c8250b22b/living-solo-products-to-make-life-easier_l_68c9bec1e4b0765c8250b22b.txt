Promising review: "I was getting so tired of making several trips to my car to retrieve my groceries after each shopping trip. I saw this trolley on Amazon and decided to buy it. Best purchase ever. I now can bring all my groceries in with one trip to the car. I also love that its wheel design allows the trolley to climb my front steps, making it so easy for me. I have used it in the house to help me carry things upstairs, and the climbing feature makes it safe and easy." — m Robinson$97 at Amazon2Emma Lord/BuzzFeed, Emma Lord/BuzzFeedSelf-heating soothing foot masks made with Epsom salts, lavender, and peppermintCheck out a TikTok of the foot masks in action. My colleague Emma Lord loves these: "I'm a long-ish distance runner and these were certainly an interesting experience for my feet! You slide them on and after a few minutes feel a tingling, mildly burning (in a good way) sensation. It doesn't quite numb your feet, but it relaxes them. I kept them on for 30 minutes and then toweled my feet off, and the tingling sensation slowly faded over the next 30 minutes. After that my feet felt very refreshed and relaxed at a time of day when they're usually aching from all the miles I put in. The whole thing was a mess-free, easy process, and I will definitely keep them on hand for longer run days!"Promising review: "Very soothing. My husband and l used these on our European vacation and they definitely felt good on our feet!" — KS2018$12 at Amazon3www.amazon.comA double step stool with a safety lock and a weight limit of 330 poundsPromising review: "I recently moved into my first solo apartment and I knew I needed a step ladder to reach things because your girl is 5'2. This ladder is very sturdy, and I love that it folds up easily so I can hide it in my storage room. Would definitely recommend." — kmill$29 at AmazonAdvertisement
4Amazon, AmazonPlus, a flexible grabber that's made for people with limited mobilityPromising review: "Bought the 2-pack. Wanted my mother to be able to reach rarely used items in the topmost cupboard without getting on a step stool if my sisters and I weren’t available. I’m using the other one to pick up trash when out mudlarking. Sturdy and convenient that it folds up." — Kristen$26 at AmazonAdvertisement
5www.amazon.comA rapid defrosting trayPromising review: "I was a little concerned this was going to be one of those gifts that were hyped up but it’s not. It’s not going to thaw a huge chunk of meat in an hour but I have thawed a chunk of chicken in a few hours. The product itself isn’t very thick which I like as it doesn’t take up a lot of space for storage. It doesn’t warm up, but pulls the cold from the meat, which makes the product thaw (like putting meat in cold water to thaw it faster and not cook it)." — Savannah A. $20 at Amazon6AmazonPlus, a dishwasher-safe silicone soup cube tray that'll hold one cupIt also comes with a lid so you can easily stack them and four fill lines (½ cup, 1 cup, 125 mL, 250 mL).Souper Cubes is a small business seen on Shark Tank that specializes in bake-and-freeze storage products. Promising review: "I'm extremely happy with my Souper Cubes! I cook chili and soup and always make too much, having the ability to freeze serving-size portions is perfect. Saves time and food quality by not having to thaw it all each time I want another serving. High quality and since it's silicone and not rigid plastic it won't crack in the freezer. Highly recommend!" — Alexander S. Waterman$22 at AmazonAdvertisement
7www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA streamlined door draft stopperPromising review: "So easy to set up! All you do is peel tape and adhere to a CLEAN and DRY door. Also looks great, I don't even notice it. I had a huge gap under my door. I could smell and hear everything from the hallway. Smells, drafts, and sound all are less of an issue now." — Brit B.$10 at Amazon8www.amazon.com, AmazonPlus, a reviewer-beloved veggie chopperCheck out a TikTok of the veggie chopper in action. Promising review: "Makes life so much easier. I can't imagine chopping onions or bell peppers by hand anymore, and it does so much more. We used to have a Prepworks chopper, which was a similar idea, but you had to press so hard to chop and it broke after not too long. This one requires very little effort to cut through the food and it has a generous container." — Amazon Customer$30 at Amazon9www.amazon.comAn organizing couch pillow with a spot for everything you requireCup Cozy Pillow is a small biz as seen on TV specializing in cleverly designed cup holders. Promising review: "I liked that it worked with cups and mugs, perfect for clumsy friends." — YAZ"This thing is great! I’m home on maternity leave with my new baby and spend most of my time on the couch under a sleeping baby. This product makes it easy for me to keep my drinks, remote, etc close by even with crazy dogs running around. It’s a little more expensive than I would have liked but it works and I love it so money well spent!" — Amber$25 at AmazonAdvertisement
10www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA pair of blackout, noise-canceling, AND thermal insulating curtainsPromising review: "Truly life changing sound barrier curtains!!! They definitely help with the quality of sleep, quietness, and solace for me and my whole family. The sound isolation is incredible! There was so much noise pollution around with constant main road traffic, pool/deck construction, chainsaws next door, water main construction on the main road with giant trucks/bulldozers and jackhammers, several lawnmowers, outdoor concert noise, birds constantly chirping, weekly Brazilian parties. Especially with people coming out of the woodwork after the pandemic with the noisiest, most annoying things on the planet all at once. These curtains truly dampened ALL that noise to a distance or to completely nothing. Almost all of it gone. Our sleep at night has dramatically improved and deepened. Best in our lives and finally feeling fully rested." — Heather Lascano $47 at Amazon11www.amazon.comA folding sink topper that'll give you an ample surfaceSink Topper is a small biz that specializes in this product.Promising review: "Great for messy teenagers. Cool item for my teenager's bathroom. She likes to lay her hair/makeup stuff on it so she can keep her other bathroom decor on the sides. When she's done she puts what she was using under the sink and folds up the sink tray so it can slide under the sink as well." — Melina$26 at Amazon12Just SpicesA Just Spices starter set with eight blends you'll actually use upThe set comes with the following spice blends: Chicken Allrounder; BBQ Allrounder; Vegetable Allrounder; Italian Allrounder; Avocado Topping; Casserole Allrounder; Stir Fry; Mexican Allrounder.$60 at Just SpicesAdvertisement
13www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAn under-cabinet lid opener to help pop open that jar of pasta sauce in a jiffyPromising review: "Works exactly as it says it does. I have small hands and trouble gripping things. This makes opening jars extremely easy and it opens in seconds just by twisting the jar counterclockwise. I'm so glad I ordered two so I can give one to a family member who has trouble with opening jars as well. I would definitely buy this again!" — H.T.$12 at Amazon14www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA UV black-light flashlight that'll track down all sorts of messesPromising review: "OMG this is disgusting!!! I hope this isn't all just cat pee that shows up cause there is a lot! I bought this because I thought my cat was peeing in one room and couldn't find the exact spot so I bought this. Found the spot and more. Would recommend." — Momof3boys$13 at Amazon15www.amazon.comA no-scrub weekly shower cleanerPromising review: "This product is so easy to use. As you can see from the pictures, my bathtub was staying pretty good. The guy that owned the house before me used Ajax to clean it so it has almost no enamel left on it and it’s probably the staining and nothing could get it out until I bought this. After 4 8-hour applications you can see the difference. I highly recommend this to everybody and once it’s completely clean I’m gonna go on the once a week application. I actually bought another bottle for my dad and mom." — Domenick R. Stamegna$21 at AmazonAdvertisement
16www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA reusable pet fur removerPromising review: "I have a golden retriever and the shedding is out of control. My fabric sofa is constantly covered in hair and I finally decided to try this after reading an article about popular TikTok products. The reviews do not lie, this thing works magic!! I wish I had taken a before and after picture because the difference is noticeable. I watched the video tutorial before I tried it to ensure I was using it properly and everything he says is true, you do really have to put your arm to work with vigorous back and forth movement! However, I find it's a great arm workout and it works wonders." — Joanne Ertel$19 at Amazon17AmazonA three-pack of Velveeta cheese saucePromising review: "These have been great to use. Cooking for just one person isn't the easiest thing for me, but these portions have been great when I want mac 'n' cheese, nachos, or a small smothered burrito for one. I'm sure when it's camping time these will make it into my camping stash." — M. Cheatham$3 at Amazon18www.amazon.com, www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA drill brush cleaning kit that'll attach to your drill/driverIncludes three brushes that'll attached to a standard handheld drill. The white is a soft bristle, best for wheels, carpet, upholstery, glass, and leather; the yellow is a medium bristle, best for bathroom, bathtub, shower, tile, and porcelain; the green is a medium bristle, best for kitchen, stoves, cabinets, countertops, and linoleum; the blue is a medium bristle, best for boats, pools, canoe/kayaks, hot tubs, and plastics; the red is a stiff bristle, best for outdoors, siding, brick, garage, and gutter; and the black is a hard bristle, best for grills, loose paint, furnaces, ovens, and industrial use. Drill Brush is a small business based in New York!Promising review: "I’m in love with this. I manage many apartment properties and finding people to do the cleaning has been tricky business, so I end up having to get in and clean these horrendous filth pods tenants lived in and left me to deal with when they move out. The ovens and stove tops are usually the worst, and I absolutely hate cleaning. I came across this drill attachment set, and let me tell you, it helped me tremendously! I still had to get in with a putty knife on some of them but it really cut down my elbow-grease time. If it wasn’t for this drill attachment, I think my arms would have just fallen off trying to clean it as good as I did! My only con would be that it doesn’t have any extension of any sort, so I really had my drill all up in that oven, but well worth it." — alicia haats$25 at AmazonAdvertisement
19www.amazon.comA mini air fryer in case you've put off the investmentPromising review: "I bought this tiny air fryer to use while camping, but now it has a permanent space in my kitchen, too. I find myself throwing food into it instead of my expensive, gigantic one. So many times, I don't need the whistles and bells overkill of the big one. If you live alone or have a household of 1–2, and don't expect to cook a 5-pound anything in it, it's perfect and packed with the quality I expected from Cosori. (It also blew my camping buddies away when hot rolls hit the table on my night to make chili...lol)" — Cheri$60 at Amazon20www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA Dash mini rice cookerPromising review: "I bought this for my daughter for her dorm at college. She loves making flavored rice and warming up soups and things. She likes it so well that she brings it home from college with her on breaks. It is especially nice that it has a removable pot, which makes it so much easier to clean or keep leftovers in. Would definitely buy again, don't waste your money on a slightly cheaper one that does not have a removable pot." — midohtree$20 at Amazon21www.amazon.com, AmazonA rectangular lazy Susan made to hold more than the traditional round onesCheck out a TikTok of the rectangular lazy Susan in action. Promising review: "This is perfect for short people with big refrigerators! I could never reach anything on the top shelf and had to grab a step stool, now everything fits perfectly on this, and I can reach them all! It glides great and is very sturdy." — Tara Mann$20 at AmazonAdvertisement
22www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comSome sheet fasteners if that the fitted sheet won't stay put on your mattressSee them on TikTok. Promising review: "I love these! Since I started using them my sheets haven’t popped off once and that used to be a several-times-a-night problem because I toss and turn when I sleep. Thank you, TikTok!" — Gabby$9 at Amazon23Amazon, AmazonA set of safe-locking magnetic duvet clips to keep your duvet in its proper placeCheckout a TikTok of the duvet clips in action. Pinion Pins is a small business specializing in home improvement products. Promising review: "I was super worried about if I would have enough of the Pinions, and I totally do! My duvet is kinda thick and the Pinions pierced through with no problems! Plus with a little extra room if I had some extra layers. I REALLY like how you have to have the magnet tool to pull them apart. Absolutely no moving! Don’t walk, RUN TO BUY THIS. I also like how unnoticeable they are." — Abigayle Mishler$18 at Amazon24www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA small compost bin/trash can will easily hang on a cabinet door for easy hidingPromising review: "So I saw this tiny trash can on TikTok, and I was moving into a tiny studio apartment and thought this would be perfect. Turns out it's one of the best things I've ever bought. I installed mine with the over-the-cabinet hooks (also comes with adhesive stickers) on my kitchen island, and it is so convenient I can't even express with words. The lid is on this nifty hinge so you can open it by flipping the lid up, or by sliding it forward and it folds down out of the way. I usually keep it open while I'm cooking but I can close it super quickly if I see the dog coming. There is a little pull tab for easy opening. It is so easy to use and easy to clean. It's also so cute! I use my plastic grocery bags as trash can liners for this and they fit perfectly. It comes with a roll of bags as well. The lid lifts off easily to change bags out. Clicks back on easily over the new liner. Can't recommend this enough!! This is going on my list of 'best things I've ever spent my money on.'" — Ginger$22 at AmazonAdvertisement
25www.amazon.comOr some pink! Cherry blossom–scented! Forceflex trashbagsPromising review: "These are my absolute favorite. They are stretchy and durable. They smell great and keep my house from smelling bad when I have food trash. And I love that they are pink." — Ashley van Kirk$9 at Amazon26www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA set of two rechargeable emergency LED bulbsPromising review: "These little guys are so bright!! Got these on a whim after seeing it on a TikTok. These are super bright and charge when the light is turned on. These are worth the price." — Reid524$26 at Amazon27www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA self-sealing magnetic screen door to let dogs help themselves outPromising review: "I bought this so my puppies could traverse to/from their backyard pen area...and keep flying insects out. It is AWESOME! The puppies figured out quickly that they could go through the screen — the screen snapped back into a closed state immediately after they got through the opening. If only all things in life could be solved this easily!" — Lynette S Quigley$32 at AmazonAdvertisement
28Amazon, www.amazon.comA Rapid Ramen CookerRapid Brands is a small biz specializing in microwave cookware. Promising review: "God's ramen cooker. This thing may seem like just an ordinary Tupperware, but I assure you it will blow that thin plastic garbage out of the water. It retains heat amazingly and does not bend or falter under extreme temperatures. I'm a college student and I have never felt such joy from making ramen in my small dorm microwave, for a 900-watt I recommend five minutes. Buy this product if you live and breathe air, because it is beautiful." — Theron$10 at Amazon29www.amazon.comA game-changing "bed wedge" pillow in a high-density foam and triangular shapeBonus: There's a lil' side pocket for your phone, glasses, or other nighttime accessories. Promising review: "I did not realize that these were out there until I watched a TikTok about one. This has saved my pillows. I do have a headboard, but there was about a three-inch gap between it and my mattress. This has stopped my pillows from sliding down in between. I have had no issues at all with it. I did let it sit for almost 72 hours while it was getting its shape back from being in a shipping container, but after that, it was perfect!!! I highly recommend." — Miss_Beck$27 at Amazon30TargetA powerful dishwashing sprayI live in an apartment without a dishwasher, and I honestly use that as an excuse to order takeout food instead of cooking. But, as soon as I got my hands on a bottle of this stuff (regular Dawn is my go-to dish soap, BTW), I put it to use on both a saucepan I used to make homemade enchilada sauce and the casserole dish I baked those enchiladas, which had a ton of caked-on food. It really does work like I say it does! Like, scary well.$17 at AmazonAdvertisement
31www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA clear magnetic refrigerator dry-erase board that'll stick directly on your fridgeIt also includes four dry-erase markers! Promising review: "Saw it on TikTok being used as a dinner menu for the week! It will help me be more organized and add little chores that needs to completed or important reminders. Love it, no complaints." — Clarince Thomas$17 at Amazon32www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA jumbo pack of toilet cleaning tabsPromising review: "Effective at keeping the toilet bowl clean and very easy to use." — Amazon Customer$23 at Amazon33www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA handheld steam cleanerPromising review: "Cleaned stove top and the hood vents. Then, I had to clean the sticky grease from the sink. Worked very easily and without chemicals. Easy to use and to refill. The attachments make various jobs easy to clean." — Lori$30 at AmazonAdvertisement
34www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAnd a playful bath mat because you NEED one anywayPromising review: "I absolutely love this rug. I was not expecting it to be as cute and fluffy as it is! I’ve gotten so many compliments on it." — Amanda Fiji$24 at AmazonReviews have been edited for length and/or clarity. Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
