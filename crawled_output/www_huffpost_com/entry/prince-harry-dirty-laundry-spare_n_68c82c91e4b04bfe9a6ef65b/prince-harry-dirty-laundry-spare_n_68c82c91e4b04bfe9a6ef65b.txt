Two years after publishing the book that shocked the globe, the Duke of Sussex is opening up about speaking out in the years since he and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, stepped back from royal life in 2020.

“I know that [speaking out] annoys some people and it goes against the narrative,” Harry said in a new interview with The Guardian, published on Sunday. “The book? It was a series of corrections to stories already out there,” the prince added. “One point of view had been put out and it needed to be corrected.” Harry then responded to some of the criticism that surrounded the book, as people were miffed the prince would share such a behind-the-scenes look at The Firm in the 400-plus page memoir.

When asked by The Guardian if Harry would like to return to the U.K. more, especially with his children, despite his continued security difficulties, the Duke answered, “Yes I would.” “This week has definitely brought that closer,” he added. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Charles revealed that he was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February 2024. At the time the news was revealed, sources close to the prince told HuffPost that he’d spoken with the king about his health news and that the two would reunite in person. Advertisement
