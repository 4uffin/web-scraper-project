Spencer Cox said Sunday that Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Charlie Kirk's assassination, has not been cooperating with authorities so far — but that family members and others who know the 22-year-old are helping with the investigation."He has not confessed to authorities. He is not cooperating," Cox said on ABC's "This Week." "But all the people around him are cooperating, and I think that's very important."The Republican said investigators have not yet discovered a potential motive for the shooting, but that Robinson's conservative family members believe his extensive time online resulted in him subscribing to "leftist ideology." "We're getting all of this information from family members, again, people around the suspect — and then the forensic information that we have, which is confirming everything and more than what we were able to share in that initial press conference," Cox told NBC's "Meet the Press."Charges are expected to be filed against Robinson on Tuesday.See All UpdatesAdvertisementRelated shootingcharlie kirkTurning Point USACharlie Kirk ShotCharlie Kirk Dead After Being Shot At Utah EventCharlie Kirk Shooting Suspect Captured, Trump And Utah Authorities Announce Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
