Follow along below for live updates: Sep 14, 2025, 9:52 PM EDTLi ZhouMANDEL NGAN via Getty ImagesTrump Says Admin Is Looking Into Leftist OrganizationsTrump once again lambasted "the left" in comments to a gaggle of reporters on Sunday evening, adding that his administration is looking into leftist groups. “If you look at the problem, the problem is on the left. It's not on the right, like some people like to share the right, the problem we have is on the left," he said, according to a White House pool report. "And when you look at the agitator, you look at the scum that speaks so badly of our country, the American flag burning all over the place, that's the left. That's not the right."Trump's comments come after he began blaming "the radical left" for Charlie Kirk's killing prior to the apprehension of a suspect, and as he's continued to disparage this group.Authorities said Sunday that they're still working to identify a motivation for the attack on Kirk and noted that the suspected shooter's family members believe he subscribed to "leftist ideology."“We’ll see. We’ll be announcing. They’re already under investigation. They’re already under major investigation," Trump told reporters regarding inquiries into leftist organizations. He declined to specify which entities he was referring to, however. “A lot of the people that you would traditionally say are on the left, they're already under investigation," he said.
