It's not on the right, like some people like to share the right, the problem we have is on the left," he said, according to a White House pool report. "And when you look at the agitator, you look at the scum that speaks so badly of our country, the American flag burning all over the place, that's the left. That's not the right."Trump's comments come after he began blaming "the radical left" for Charlie Kirk's killing prior to the apprehension of a suspect, and as he's continued to disparage this group.Authorities said Sunday that they're still working to identify a motivation for the attack on Kirk and noted that the suspected shooter's family members believe he subscribed to "leftist ideology."“We’ll see. We’ll be announcing. They’re already under investigation. They’re already under major investigation," Trump told reporters regarding inquiries into leftist organizations. He declined to specify which entities he was referring to, however. “A lot of the people that you would traditionally say are on the left, they're already under investigation," he said. Advertisement

Sep 13, 2025, 9:58 AM EDTAPPatel Faces Congressional Hearings After Missteps In Kirk Assassination Probe And Turmoil At FBIWASHINGTON (AP) — Hours after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, FBI Director Kash Patel declared online that “the subject” in the killing was in custody. The shooter was not. The two men who had been detained were quickly released, and Utah officials acknowledged that the gunman remained at large.The false assurance was more than a slip. It spotlighted the high-stakes uncertainty surrounding Patel’s leadership of the bureau when its credibility — and his own — are under extraordinary pressure.Patel now approaches congressional oversight hearings this coming week facing not just questions about that investigation but broader doubts about whether he can stabilize a federal law enforcement agency fragmented by political fights and internal upheaval.Democrats are poised to press Patel on a purge of senior executives that has prompted a lawsuit, his pursuit of President Donald Trump’s grievances long after the Russia investigation ended, and a realignment of resources that has prioritized the fight against illegal immigration and street crime even though the agency has for decades been defined by its work on complicated threats like counterintelligence and corruption.Read more: Advertisement
