Fry sustained a broken nose and facial fractures, The Associated Press reported Wednesday afternoon.‚ÄúHe is doing OK, he‚Äôs in good spirits,‚Äù Guardians manager Stephen Vogt told the wire service. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs upright, he‚Äôs alert.‚ÄùThe night before, Vogt called the scene a ‚Äúreally scary moment.‚ÄùThe ball was ruled a foul but Vogt said Fry took a direct hit.Fry got knocked on his back by the impact but never lost consciousness, according to MLB.com. He was transferred from one medical facility to another where he was kept for observation overnight.Skubal, the reigning American League Cy Young winner, appeared rattled by the scene at home plate as Fry was being treated. He took off his hat and glove and rubbed his face.Advertisement
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really tough,‚Äù Skubal said, per MLB.com. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already reached out to him. I‚Äôm sure his phone is blowing up. Just want to make sure he‚Äôs alright. Obviously, he seemed like he was OK coming off the field, and hopefully it stays that way. I know sometimes with those things, they can change, so hopefully he‚Äôs alright.‚ÄùThe sixth inning unraveled Skubal, who also had a wild pitch, a balk and a throwing error in which he attempted to hike the ball football-style to the first baseman but the ball flew down the right field line.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
