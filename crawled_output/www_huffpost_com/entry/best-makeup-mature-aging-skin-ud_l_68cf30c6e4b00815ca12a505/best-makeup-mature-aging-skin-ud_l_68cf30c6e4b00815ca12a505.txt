Dermatologists and beauty experts have previously told HuffPost that these shifts can result in drier, duller and more delicate skin, as well as loss of volume resulting in fine lines and wrinkles. This means that not any old makeup product on the market will satisfy your current beauty needs. Luckily, cosmetic innovation has thankfully brought us everything from hydrating foundation formulas to cream blushes that add luminosity back into the skin, to blurring, brightening concealers that won’t settle into fine lines.

Beauty lovers of all ages will appreciate the lineup of well-performing makeup products ahead which includes everything from an affordable eyeliner that applies like butter but won’t smudge into fine lines, to a multipurpose “miracle balm.”1Stila CosmeticsA precision-tip lip stainFor anyone who struggles with precise lip product application, the Stila Calligraphy Lip Stain might be a worthy investment thanks to its innovative marker tip applicator that can make it easy to line or fill lips or both. The stain itself claims to be sheer but buildable, lightweight and non-drying. It comes in 16 colors.Promising Stila reviews: "As per usual for Stila, this is a high quality product. I'm a mature lady, and naturally am developing some lines above my upper lip. Even using lip liner doesn't guarantee I won't have my lipstick running into those lines after a couple hours. This product eliminates that problem altogether. And I don't have to use a lip liner with it! It stays on well while eating, drinking, and best of all, kissing! I bought this color and the purple one, and they're buildable and easy to apply with precision." — Barbara"I'm 50 this yr and with fine lines and shrinking lips its been hard for me to find a realistic looking color stain that doesn't make the problem worse. This is a win! I bought 2 colors." — Smothered.hope$25 at Stila Cosmetics$21 at Nordstrom$25 at Ulta2Thrive CausmeticsA brightening eye stickThis illuminating eye stick by Thrive Causemetics, a beauty brand dedicated to crafting makeup suitable for mature skin, is meant to make eyes look more lifted and awake. Apply the versatile, waterproof and cream-to-powder formula in the waterline, inside corners of the eyes or beneath the brow bone. It comes in 28 light-reflecting shades, and is infused with macadamia and meadowfoam seed oils to prevent a drying texture that settles into creases. Promising review: "I absolutely love them! They go on smoothly and they last all day! They don’t smudge and they blend nicely. My skin is not smooth, I’m 67 years old and they look great, no creasing." — Melinda K.$26 at Thrive Causemetics3SephoraA HuffPost-famous luminous-finish foundationPossibly one of the most popular and best selling foundations that we've covered here at HuffPost, Giorgio Armani's Luminous Silk has won the internet over. It's especially suited for mature skin because it won't settle into fine lines and wrinkles, according to a number of different makeup artists we've previously spoken to. The hydrating and "like-skin" formula claims to blur imperfections and offer a glowy finish with the perfect level of seamless coverage. It uses what the brand calls “Micro-Fil” technology to help reduce the appearance of texture, and you can find this in 40 radiant shades.Promising Sephora review: "Best foundation I’ve found for my aging skin. I am 49- look much younger. This doesn’t settle into lines and is high quality. Also doesn’t bother me at all; I have sensitive skin. Highly recommend you try it if you’re considering." — flaca9$69 at Sephora$48+ at NordstromAdvertisement
4SephoraA long-wearing liquid eyeshadowThe Armani Beauty long-lasting eye tint can leave lids awash with a budge-proof and high-impact pigment that won't settle or separate on thin and crepey eyelid skin. The liquid-to-powder formula glides on smoothly, blends easily, and comes in several colors and finishes like matte and shimmer. Promising Sephora reviews: "These are great for older eyelids like mine. These shadows are quick to apply with minimal blending needed. They hide wrinkly eyelids. These are a go-to for my eyes, even on days I don’t wear full makeup." — jerseygirlinca"This eye tint is so nice! After using this product now for a few weeks, I am so satisfied. It applies so smoothly. The wand allows for a fine precision application or a more blended look. It is also buildable for a deeper tint. Compared to other eye tints I've used, this is better. It doesn't bleed into the fine lines/wrinkles around my eyes. It doesn't crease. It lasts me all day long. The shimmer is so pretty and not overly sparkly. I also used it under regular eye shadow as a primer and it works great! The packaging is attractive and easy to use. I highly recommend this eye tint!" — TristaNic$39 at Sephora$33 at NordstromAdvertisement
5Jones RoadA multi-purpose "miracle balm"The Jones Road Miracle Balm is a skin-enhancing pigment thoughtfully created to address common concerns associated with aging skin like dullness and dryness. Slightly reflective, the hydrating balm imparts a wash of soft-focus, and contains skin-conditioning ingredients like vitamin E and softening seed oils. It's available in 13 sheen-inducing shades that can be used as blushes, bronzers, highlighters, face bases and more. Promising review: "I am 50 and I have tried it on for 3 days now. I am glad I did not have the rash reactions as other users reported. I have had the same experience as others have reported - pretty sticky on the face. I think I like it better than the other foundation products I have tried. The concept is pretty straightforward - if you have dry/mature skin and is looking for a solution to [brighten] up your complexion effortlessly. This works!" — Yao h$40 at Jones Road6IliaA balmy and hydrating lip tintThe opposite of those thick, matte and overly drying lipsticks that exaggerate lip lines, Ilia's Balmy lip tint is a low maintenance product that leaves behind a buildable swath of sheer-to-medium coverage color on lips. The hydrating and nourishing formula contains shea butter, sea succulent extract and rosehip seed oil for added antioxidant benefits. Grab this smoothing balm in eight shades like a cool rosy tone, warm peaches and neutral berries. Promising Ilia reviews: "I loved the first lipstick I purchased (Wanderlust) a pretty berry color so I thought I’d try Runaway. Wow! It is a perfect pop of warm pink and nude color and actually makes my teeth look whiter. The moisture it provides is wonderful as I live in a very dry climate and just one swipe on my bottom lip and one swipe on my top lip lasts for hours without feeling heavy or goopy. I have white hair, light green eyes and fair to medium skin tone and live a very active lifestyle and I like a more natural look. All of the Ilia products just give me a fresh glow without looking too made up. The ingredients are good for your skin and the lipstick, multi sticks and the skin tint serum really last and you don’t need a lot to get that glowy fresh look. I get loads of compliments on my skin which is very nice at 59 years young! I feel that the ease of this makeup line helps my dry skin and makes me look and feel vibrant. I’d highly recommend it if you are into easy routines that make you look and feel good from the inside out!" — Sheryl J."Most tinted lip balms soak into my lips and fade and travel into lip lines. Not this one. It’s thick and moisturizing and stays really well. The colors are beautiful. I’ll be buying in more colors for sure." — Danielle D.$28 at Ilia$28 at SephoraAdvertisement
7UltaA blurring powder that won't settle into fine linesThis translucent loose setting powder is made with silky, finely milled and plant-derived particles for an undetectable finish that melts into the skin, while also blurring pores, fine lines and texture. The conditioning formula contains antioxidants vitamin C and E, and comes in four sheer shades.Promising Laura Mercier review: "Hands down the best. I prefer this one over some of the others. This one has just the right amount of illuminating properties without being 'sparkly' or 'glittery.' It’s the grown up version of 'glowing up.' It doesn’t settle into the wrinkles but reflects and redirects the light so you have a flawless finish and photograph amazingly in those phone photos and selfies. Plus…it lasts forever. A little goes a super long way. Not cakey. Very light and even feels hydrating for a powder. Doesn’t dry out skin or feel like it’s taking away the glow or dewiness of the foundation underneath, but truly setting it while keeping the glow and moisturized and youthful look. I’m in my 40s and every time I do full makeup and set with this powder, I get asked what I’m using to look younger and compliments on my skin tone (and I have very blemished, scarred, and uneven skin tone underneath). This is perfect for 'airbrush' effect on blemishes. First I do foundation, then a drop of my cream concealer and with a small concealer brush, I dip into the powder and tape lightly on the blemish to 'bake' the area. It really does blur it and make it nearly unnoticeable. I will turn my car around and go home to get this powder if I ever forget it and think I might need to cover a blemish at some point while I’m away from home. It is a makeup bag staple and goes everywhere with me. Don’t hesitate. Buy this." — Becca$43 at Ulta$43 at Sephora$21+ at Nordstrom8AmazonA lightweight and brightening concealerThis bestselling concealer really has a way of providing comfortable and cushiony coverage under the eyes without looking cakey or creasing. The flexible and hydrating formula is infused with goji berry extract to brighten skin, color correct blemishes and camouflage fine lines. Available in 19 shades, the Instant Age Rewind has been my exclusive concealer of choice, and I can personally attest to the incredibly lightweight and seamless texture. Promising Amazon reviews: "I have mature skin and this does not create or highlight crepy skin and wrinkles. It lasts a really long time without creasing or fading. It's better than more expensive concealers I've tried. It's not too thick or dry. Spreads easily & covers well. Excellent product!" — Mary Lee Pagliaroli"Tried this product even though I was very skeptical. But I was wrong. It works great to cover the dark circles under my eyes without leaving deep wrinkle lines. I am a 'mature' woman and I couldn't be more pleased with the product. Have already reordered it and recommend it highly." — Jan K.$9 at Amazon$10 at Target$9 at Ulta9Thrive CausemeticsA buildable crease-proof concealerAnother winning age-conscious formula from Thrive Causemetics, this creaseless concealer claims to brighten, blur and diffuse the appearance of fine lines and imperfections. It's infused with a proprietary eye serum containing moisture-locking ingredients like coconut emollients and betaine and elasticity-promoting snow mushroom extract. Shop this in 20 waterproof shades.Promising Thrive Causemetics reviews: "I love it! It is much better than my previous concealers. It helps the wrinkles not to show around the eyes. I’m glad I bought it and will buy more when I run out." — Susan B."I've been searching for this concealer my entire life. I've always had dark circles but as I've gotten older I've got wrinkles around my eyes too. This stuff matches my skin tone perfectly. It's light and buildable. It does not make wrinkles look worse like all the others. Is not greasy. It's matte. It really looks like your not wearing concealer. I don't look so tired all the time. Thank you Thrive." — judi m$29 at Thrive CausemeticsAdvertisement
10SephoraA fool-proof and buildable cream blushMerit's hydrating blush balm deposits a creamy and radiant veil of color that lets your natural skin shine through while also conditioning it thanks to the inclusion of antioxidant-rich vitamin E. The soft, lightweight and beginner-friendly formula uses micro-fine pigment powders to avoid a cakey or line-exaggerating finish, and it's available in several flexible shades like a petal baby pink, poppy red and soft burgundy.Promising Sephora review: "I have very dry mature skin and sometimes blushes are cakey. This balm blush is amazing. It went on smooth, easy, blended amazing and the color is beautiful. I definitely recommend. I did receive this to give my honest opinion." — Corybob2877$30 at Sephora$30 at Merit11SephoraA finely milled bronzerCharlotte Tilbury's Flawless Filter bronzer previously came at the suggestion of a makeup artist when asked about the best products for aging skin. He said that adding a touch of tawny or bronze to the face can add definition and healthy glow back into the skin, and this pressed powder is made using micro-fine perfecting powders for a silky feeling on the skin as well as hyaluronic acid to hydrate. Available in four shades, this filter-like finish is meant to impart a blurred and airbrush effect to the skin. Promising Sephora review: "Such a beautiful shade, the best best formula ever! I'm 35 and this formula doesn't stick to any texture, fine lines or emphasize pores just goes on so smooth and flawless. One issue I took was with the fair shade, it's so light I'm always the lightest shade in bronzer's but I had to order the medium so beware of the shade you choose." — Bubbleicious85$58 at Sephora$35 at Nordstrom$58 at Ulta12SephoraA hydrating SPF-infused foundationThe Futurist Hydra Rescue foundation is a radiant-finish formula infused with SPF 45 and nourishing ingredients like chia seed extract and prebiotics that soothe and hydrate skin. It offers medium coverage and breathable wear, perfect for maturing skin. Find this in 28 colors. Promising Sephora review: "This has to be the best foundation for my dry, uneven, mature skin. It offers medium coverage without looking like I’m wearing a mask. The shade is perfect as that’s a challenge for a neutral skin tone like mine. My favorite way of applying is with a foundation brush. Highly recommend for mature skin types." — yellowdaffodil"As I get older, full coverage foundation isn’t always the best option, especially in the dry winters in the desert. I really like how hydrating this looks as well as the coverage that it provides! It also doesn’t settle into fine lines, which I appreciate. I found this goes on well with fingers and then patting it into place with a slightly damp beauty blender. I set it with the Laura Mercier translucent powder, and it stays all day! Love it!" — hirie714$55 at Sephora$55 at Ulta$47 at NordstromAdvertisement
