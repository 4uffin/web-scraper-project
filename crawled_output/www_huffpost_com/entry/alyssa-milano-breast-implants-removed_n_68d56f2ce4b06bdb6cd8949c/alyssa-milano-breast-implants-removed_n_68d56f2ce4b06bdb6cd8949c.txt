“I’m letting go of the body that was sexualized, that was abused, that I believed was necessary for me to be attractive; to be loved; to be successful; to be happy,” revealed Milano, who began her acting career as a child. “And in doing so, I hope I am releasing my daughter Bella from ever feeling those same unhealthy demands.”While the star acknowledged how some found “freedom and beauty” in their implants, she wrote about how her cosmetic surgery fed into a “false narrative” she had about herself.“I am so happy that we can all find our femininity and peace on our own terms,” she continued.Alyssa Milano, here in Cannes, France in October 2022, opened up about her decision to remove her breast implants in a raw new Instagram post.Arnold Jerocki via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
Milano also expressed gratitude to pop star and “RuPaul’s Drag Race” judge Michelle Visage for being open about her own decision to remove her implants and “making it easier for me and countless others to find our own way.”“Today I am loved, I am feminine, I am attractive, and I am successful. None of that is because of my implants. I will still be all of those things when I wake up and they are gone,” Milano went on. “There is so much and joy in that knowledge and freedom in letting go of what was never me in the first place.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
