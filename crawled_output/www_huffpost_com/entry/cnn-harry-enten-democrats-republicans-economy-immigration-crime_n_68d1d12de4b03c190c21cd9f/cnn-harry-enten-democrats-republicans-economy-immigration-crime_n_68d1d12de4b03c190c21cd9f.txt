Enten — who highlighted how President Donald Trump’s net approval rating is “underwater” on the three issues earlier this month — turned to a recent Washington Post-Ipsos poll that found the GOP is trusted more than the Democratic Party on the economy (by a margin of +7 percentage points), immigration (+13) and crime (+22).Back in 2022, the same poll found that the GOP was trusted more than Democrats on the economy (+12) but less when it came to immigration (+3) and crime (+13), indicating that the GOP has made gains with Americans on the latter two issues.“What are you doing, Democrats? My goodness gracious,” Enten said.He later added, “Whatever Democrats are doing, it ain’t working.”Enten, when asked by Bolduan what’s driving the figures, noted that independents currently trust Republicans more than Democrats on the economy (+1), immigration (+10) and crime (+21).Advertisement
“The bottom line is, when you look at these numbers, Democrats should call their offices because at this particular point ... even if the public doesn’t like what Donald Trump is doing, they ain’t necessarily liking what Democrats are doing,” he said.“And it ain’t just a referendum on one party. You actually have to go out and beat that party. At this particular point, Democrats are not able to beat Republicans. They still lead on the issues.”TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
