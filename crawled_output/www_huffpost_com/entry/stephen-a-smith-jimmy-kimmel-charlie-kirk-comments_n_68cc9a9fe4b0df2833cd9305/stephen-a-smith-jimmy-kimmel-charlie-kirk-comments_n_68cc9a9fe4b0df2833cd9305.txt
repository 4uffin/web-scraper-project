Smith Rips Jimmy Kimmel Over Charlie Kirk Comments: 'Where Was The Joke?'The radio host also called out Trump on his SiriusXM show.By Jazmin TolliverTrends Reporter, HuffPostSep 18, 2025, 09:19 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGStephen A. Smith is calling out Jimmy Kimmel over his remarks about Charlie Kirk following the conservative activist’s death. On Thursday’s episode of his SiriusXM show “Straight Shooter,” Smith declared there wasn’t “anything funny” about Kimmel’s recent comments about Kirk. Advertisement
“The only thing that I would say as it pertains to Jimmy Kimmel is, where was the joke?” Smith said. “Because you’re a late night host — and obviously that has a comedic attachment to it. Where was the joke?” He added: “Obviously, it wasn’t anything funny about that.”Kimmel remarked on Kirk’s killing during Monday’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” In his monologue, the late night host alluded that Trump supporters are trying to capitalize off Kirk’s assassination following the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who was charged in the shooting. Kirk was shot and killed while speaking with students at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10.“We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said.Advertisement
