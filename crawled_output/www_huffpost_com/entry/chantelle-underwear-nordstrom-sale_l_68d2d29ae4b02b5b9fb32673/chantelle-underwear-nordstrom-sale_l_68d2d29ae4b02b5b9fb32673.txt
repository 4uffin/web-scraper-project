Tucked away in Nordstrom’s vast intimates section is a cult-favorite lingerie brand called Chantelle, and their undies may be the softest, lightest, and most comfortable undergarments on the scene. They look as good as they feel and you can snag them in one of your favorite classic silhouettes. As if that weren’t enough, they’re currently on sale and 40% off.Hipster briefs: $13.20 at Nordstrom (regularly $22)Bikini briefs: $13.20 at Nordstrom (regularly $22)Advertisement
NordstromIt was actually my 64-year-old mother who turned me onto this brand – she purchased them on a whim and now stocks up every time Nordstrom has a sale. She reports that the fabric is buttery soft, like a second skin that is undetectable under clothing. They have just the right amount of stretch and, according to her, fit like an absolute dream. The Chantelle underwear is available in a few different silhouettes and right now, the bikini and hipster briefs styles have select colors on sale. One unique thing about this brand is that all the undies are one size fits all, designed to perfectly conform to bodies that traditionally wear sizes 4-16. My mother, who usually wears a size medium, was initially very skeptical about the lack of clear sizing, but was shocked to find that the fit is perfect. Advertisement
Regardless of which style you choose, all of these panties have a smooth, line-free look thanks to bonded sides and seamless edges that all but vanish under clothing. They’re made with a polyamide and elastane blend fabric that is featherlight and cloud-like, with a cotton-lined gusset that is ideal for personal health. The lightweight construction makes them ideal for anyone who easily overheats, is going through menopause, has sensory issues or just loves a pair of undetectable undies. They’re machine washable, though the brand recommends laying them flat to dry. You can get them in a range of hues, from skin-like nudes to lovely pastels.

The Chantelle underwear is highly rated at Nordstrom, so if you’re still on the fence if these are right for you, take a look at what other happy shoppers have to say before you stock up and save. Promising reviews:“I am easily irritated by tags, leg openings that constrict, or fabric that rides up... And these panties are the perfect solution for all of these issues. I actually forget I’m wearing underwear. I was skeptical of a one size fits all approach, but they’re perfect. I’m going to stock up for sure!” — an9ymous“I went in asking for full coverage panties that wouldn’t ride up and wouldn’t have visible panty lines (if such a thing exists!). A sales lady recommended these and I was skeptical but decided to try them. They are amazing!!! They really do all of those things and they are one size, so no worrying about getting it wrong. I am excited to replace older panties with these! By the way, I’ve worn them under jeans, under skirts and under leggings (running and otherwise) and they have been excellent in every situation!” — Raenak“These underwear are definitely seamless! I am not a thong wearer so I am always looking for a good bikini or hipster that is seamless the really lives up to the name. I typically order a size small so was skeptical about the one size fits all. But the sizing was totally fine.” — Amyann“I am absolutely obsessed with these! I only wear seamless undergarments, but I didn’t realize how terrible the other brands I was wearing were until I bought these. I had just become so accustomed to readjusting my underwear all day that I didn’t realize I was doing it. After I wore these and they stayed in place, I literally tossed all my other brands.” — slpscientist“I bought these panties for the first time and really like them. I’m 74 years old and they fit well, very comfortable and they don’t show lines when wearing pants. I highly recommend these panties.” — Jewelbox“Never thought I’d say this about a pair of underwear, but these are my holy grail pair. Obviously the perk here is function over look, but they’re not granny panties, just very basic looking. They’re super comfortable, and (unlike many invisible panty line underwear pairs that I’ve tried) don’t roll up at all on the edges. I’ve purchased multiple colors and washed them a bunch and continue to be impressed by the quality. For sizing reference, I’m a solid M/29/8 and these fit just fine.” — Juliagrace“These are quite possibly the most comfortable undies ever! I love that they’re one size! They were/are amazing during my pregnancy and postpartum because I was so many different sizes! Now they’re my go to and I will continue to get them moving forward.” — Tulip28Hipster briefs: $13.20 at Nordstrom (regularly $22)Bikini briefs: $13.20 at Nordstrom (regularly $22)Need to replace your entire underwear drawer?

They're also a great option for those who are postpartum, recovering from c-sections or other abdominal surgeries.Promising review: "If you are anything like me you probably have a few products in your cart and you are doing your homework in the review section. This is your sign to ORDER THEM! I found a few brands I was interested in but ultimately came back and ordered these. There was a review that said “it feels like nothing is on.” At first I thought yeah okay.. but seriously it feels like nothing is on. I am blown away at the quality and comfort of these panties and highly recommend them. I’m usually not a repeat buyer because I find something wrong with any kind I get but I will definitely be ordering another pack in different colors! Love love love them! For reference I am 5’ 2” 230lb with an apron belly and love handles and bought an xl. The high waist band does not dig in and sits right above my belly button. They are super forgiving, super stretchy and have a wide crotch area that is perfect for pad use. So glad I spent the little extra $ and bought these." — Amazon Customer$20 at Amazon2AmazonA 12-pack of Fruit of the Loom's most popular styleDesigned to be fade- and shrink-resistant, this 12-pack of famously soft mid-rise briefs features a cotton-poly blend construction, cotton gusset and woven waistband and leg openings to help prevent panty lines.

These are fantastic. A lot of stretch, come right to the navel, and soft. Very happy purchase." — tj$11 at AmazonAdvertisement

I love wearing sexy underwear but when it all bunches up, digs in, and leaves marks you don’t feel sexy in the least. And a bikini pair would be out of the question. These are the most comfortable underwear I have ever worn. They are soft, seamless, and yes…they stay in place! They don’t bunch, dig in, and no marks whatsoever. I got an XL and they are simply perfect. The colors are true, and there is no visible line when wearing leggings, and they aren’t heavy feeling at all…they are so light to wear!

They remain smooth on the under cheek and you can’t see lines in the jeans. The top band is a lovely lace, and although lace tends be unstructured, it never rolled with wear. It stayed structurally sound. I highly recommend and I personally would purchase again." — Destiny$28 at Amazon11AmazonA colorful 6-pack of boyshortsThese Hanes boyshorts are made with a flexible, stretchy and comfortable nylon-blend fabric that is moisture-wicking and tagless, so you stay comfy all day long.

The soft cotton fabric feels incredibly gentle against my skin, providing all-day comfort without sacrificing sexiness. With their low rise, V-waist design, and cheeky cut, these panties offer the perfect combination of support and allure, making me feel confident and fabulous every day. I initially thought they wouldn't stay in place all day but quickly proved me wrong and have become my favorite underwear thus far." — April$15+ at AmazonAdvertisement
13AmazonA 5-pack of lace-trimmed cheeky hipstersSay bye-bye to panty lines with these cheeky hipsters. They provide enough coverage and comfort for everyday use but won't make you feel dowdy. These undies are designed to give a hint of sexiness while the soft fabric and lightweight seamless construction keeps you comfortable. You can get these in packs of five or 10 in a variety of color and pattern combinations in sizes S-4XL.Promising review: "These are a total win if you're looking for the right amount of coverage but just a little sexiness. The lace detail along the top is nice, and unlike other panties I've ordered on Amazon, the sewn lace seems to be reinforced, so that pilling should be minimized. They are perfectly soft and have some stretch to them with the 5% spandex. They fit mostly true to size, though mine were a bit big, because I was right on the cusp between sizes, or on the low number end. If you are like me, you might be able to get away with the size just below, but to be safe, go for the range you're in. Just know that they'll fit a little loosely, though not so baggy they'll fall down (unless you have pants that are too big!!) I got a beautiful range of colors and am shocked that you can find quality of this kind for $2.40 a panty!! I'm considering ordering another set." — S.A.$20 at Amazon14AmazonA 5-pack of Calvin Klein logo bikini briefsEveryone looks great in a pair of Calvins, and these hugely popular bikini briefs are a testament to the brand's long-standing credibility in the undergarment sphere.
