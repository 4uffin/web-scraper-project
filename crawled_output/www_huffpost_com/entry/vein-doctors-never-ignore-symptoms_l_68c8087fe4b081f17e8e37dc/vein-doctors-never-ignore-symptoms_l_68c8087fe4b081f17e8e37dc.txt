But when something goes wrong with those vessels, the body often sends early warning signs.The tricky part is knowing which symptoms are harmless and which could point to a dangerous condition like a blood clot, arterial blockage or even a stroke.Advertisement
To help make the distinction clearer, HuffPost asked vascular surgeons and vein specialists to share the symptoms they always take seriously and why you shouldn’t ignore them either.Swelling And Pain In Just One Leg“There are a lot of causes for swollen legs, but as a vein specialist, I worry most about a deep vein thrombosis blood clot,” said Dr. Tikva Jacobs, a vascular surgeon at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. “If someone has unilateral (one leg only) swelling and pain that does not go away with elevation, I would want to evaluate that person with an ultrasound to make sure there is no DVT.”She takes particular note if these symptoms come after a recent flight or long car ride, which increase the risk of developing a blood clot. If a clot breaks free from the leg vein, it can travel to the lungs and cause a life-threatening pulmonary embolism. Advertisement
“Some of the other causes of swelling that are not as dangerous ― like too much salt or being more sedentary usually cause swelling in both legs and often improve with leg elevation,” Jacobs added. Persistent Numbness Or Tingling In The LegsIn addition to sudden swelling in your foot and leg, Society for Vascular Surgery member Dr. Mounir Haurani also recommended paying attention to numbness. “While your leg falling asleep can occur every once in a while, I would not ignore persistent numbness or tingling in the legs,” said Haurani, who is a surgery professor and chief of the division of vascular surgery at East Carolina University. “This sensation is one of the most obvious signs that the leg veins are not transferring blood thoroughly, signaling conditions like deep vein thrombosis, chronic venous insufficiency or even arterial disease.”Advertisement
Skin Discoloration And Itching Around The Ankles And Lower LegsDr. Nisha Bunke, the medical director at La Jolla Vein & Vascular, said she would never ignore skin discoloration and itching around the ankles and lower legs, as this change can be a sign of a condition known as chronic venous insufficiency.“When the valves in the leg veins fail to work properly, blood begins to pool in the lower legs, leading to increased venous pressure, also known as venous hypertension,” Bunke said. “Over time, this pressure pushes outward on the skin and surrounding tissues, triggering a chronic inflammatory response.”She noted that people with CVI may notice brownish or reddish skin discoloration known as hyperpigmentation; itchy, dry or scaly skin ― referred to as venous eczema; or a heavy, aching sensation in the legs and/or visible varicose veins.Advertisement
“CVI is not a static condition. If left untreated, what starts as discoloration or itching can progress to hardening of the skin and eventually to open, slow-healing wounds called venous ulcers,” Bunke said. “Persistent pressure within the veins can also damage the skin and subcutaneous tissues, setting off a cycle of inflammation and tissue breakdown. Once this process begins, reversal becomes more difficult. Early intervention can significantly reduce long-term complications.”Gradual Leg Pain And Swelling“There are times when abrupt changes in pain and swelling in the legs are obvious ― and of course concerning for deep vein thrombosis ― but the insidious, gradual symptoms are a concern, too,” said Dr. Katherine McGough, a vein specialist with Metro Vein Centers. “We never want to ignore the progression of heaviness, aching, swelling, cramping or restless legs.”These gradual changes can be signs that insufficiency is worsening and putting you at risk for complications like blood clots and ulcers.Advertisement
“Just because something didn’t happen overnight doesn’t mean it isn’t a problem,” McGough said. “You don’t have to live with that pain you have had for years. Check those veins!”Peter Dazeley via Getty ImagesSwelling should prompt a visit to your doctor.Non-Healing Wounds Or Ulcers Around The Ankles And Feet“Poor vein function with chronic venous insufficiency or poor arterial supply with peripheral artery disease can cause wounds that fail to heal, raising the risk of serious infection or even amputation,” said Dr. Hugh Pabarue, another vein specialist with Metro Vein Centers. “Wounds can also have a foul odor which can lead to major social embarrassment.”Advertisement
If you’ve got these kinds of ulcers, don’t wait to make an appointment with a doctor for further examination. “Another sign can be seemingly small cuts or wounds on the feet that take a long time to heal,” Haurani echoed. “The reason these symptoms are so concerning is that they are signs of not enough blood flow getting to your feet and can lead to amputation if not managed.”Cold And Pale Feet With Calf Pain“I would never ignore cool or cold feet that are pale, especially if you also have pain in your calves when walking,” Haurani said. “Oftentimes, signs of vascular problems first present in our legs and feet, because they are one of the furthest destinations blood travels to from the heart. So, if there are blockages in those blood vessels, it can lead to problems.”Advertisement
Pabarue also would never ignore severe leg pain that comes on suddenly with coldness or paleness.“This could indicate acute arterial occlusion aka a blocked artery,” he said. “Without prompt treatment, it can lead to tissue death, loss of limb or stroke if it involves certain arteries. Go to the hospital immediately.”Rest Pain In The Feet Or ToesAnother symptom to pay attention to is pain in the feet or toes while at rest, particularly at night and if it’s relieved by dangling your foot. “This suggests critical limb ischemia ― severely reduced arterial blood flow,” Pabarue said. “Without intervention, it can lead to tissue loss, gangrene, or amputation.”Advertisement
This situation is another one in which he advises seeking immediate medical attention to prevent the worst potential outcomes. Sudden Shortness Of Breath, Chest Pain Or Coughing Up BloodDon’t ignore sudden shortness of breath, chest pain or coughing up blood ― especially when there’s also leg swelling, Pabarue stressed.“This is a classic sign of pulmonary embolism from a clot that traveled from the leg veins,” he said. “It’s a medical emergency that can be fatal if ignored. Call 911!”Advertisement
Sudden Visual Disturbance, Slurred Speech Or Weakness On One SideOther sudden symptoms that shouldn’t be ignored is visual disturbance, slurred speech or weakness on one side of the body. “While not limited to the legs, these are vascular warning signs of a stroke due to arterial blockage or clot traveling to the brain,” Pabarue said. “Immediate care is essential to prevent permanent disability.
