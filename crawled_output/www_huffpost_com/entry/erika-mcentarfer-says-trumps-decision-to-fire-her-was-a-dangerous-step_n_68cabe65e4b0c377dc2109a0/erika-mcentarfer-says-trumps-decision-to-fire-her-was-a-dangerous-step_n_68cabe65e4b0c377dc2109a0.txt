It has serious economic consequences. But that they would do this with no warning — it made no sense.” Advertisement
Trump became enraged in August after the BLS released its usual jobs report on the first Friday of the month with revised data showing the economy has actually been slowing down more than expected. He summarily fired McEntarfer, accusing her of manipulating the numbers to make him look bad. An acting commissioner, William Wiatrowski, is filling in while Trump’s chosen nominee from the right-wing Heritage Foundation, E.J. Antoni, awaits Senate confirmation.The BLS releases statistics that investors and business leaders rely on, such as the unemployment rate and the consumer price index. With McEntarfer’s firing came concern that the Trump administration would try to massage the data to make the president look better, even if it defied reality. On Tuesday, McEntarfer explained how she had wanted to modernize the way the BLS compiles its reports for better accuracy, The Wall Street Journal reported. Advertisement
In Trump’s second term, though, she said she ended up spending a lot of her time fending off efforts by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency — the group formerly headed by billionaire Elon Musk — to interfere with its operations. She described her job as “a constant high-wire act,” per the Journal.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
