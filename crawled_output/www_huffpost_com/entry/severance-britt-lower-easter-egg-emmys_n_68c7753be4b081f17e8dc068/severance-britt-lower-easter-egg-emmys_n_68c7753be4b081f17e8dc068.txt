“First, it’s a privilege to even be mentioned alongside such an incredible group of artists. Wow,” she said. “I share this award with my heroic cast and crew, whose work catalyzes mine.”“Thank you to my mom and my dad, my brother, my husband, our kids, our co- parents, our chosen family,” she said, adding, “I love you so much. Thank you for this and thank you for choosing me.”Amidst the outpouring of love, eagle-eyed “Severance” fans spotted a hidden detail on the back of her acceptance speech notes. Advertisement
It was a message in all caps ― seemingly from Lower’s “innie” character, Helly R. ― that simply read “LET ME OUT.” In photos from the night, you can clearly see the plea:Lower wrote "LET ME OUT" on the back of her speech notes, in a nod to her character and "Severance" fans everywhere.GettyPeople on social media absolutely loved it: The cast and crew on Severance are dedicated to the subtle clues.
