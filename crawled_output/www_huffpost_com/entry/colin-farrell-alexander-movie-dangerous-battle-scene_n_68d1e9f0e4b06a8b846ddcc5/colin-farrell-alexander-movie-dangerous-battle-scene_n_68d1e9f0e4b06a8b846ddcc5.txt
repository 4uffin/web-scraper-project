After Robbie asked if the sequence involved elephants, Farrell clarified that shooting the Battle of the Hydaspes was “the most dangerous thing” he’s “ever been a part of.”“They would say action and there was eight head of elephant, 200 head of horse and 800 background, 800 foreground, 800 x, 800 Thai men who would move,” Farrell explained.“Wow, that’s crazy!” Robbie remarked.Farrell continued: “Eight elephants, 200 horses and 800 men would go on action. One guy broke his leg on horseback, that was it, nobody died. It was a miracle. You couldn’t do it, they wouldn’t do it now.”Advertisement
Farrell starred as Alexander the Great in the 2004 epic, which featured an all-star cast that included Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, Jared Leto, Rosario Dawson and Anthony Hopkins.“Alexander” — which was in development for 16 years before its release — is considered to be a box-office failure, grossing $167 million globally against its $155 million budget.Colin Farrell at the U.S. premiere of "A Big Bold Beautiful Journey" on Sept. 15 in New York City. The actor told The Hollywood Reporter back in 2023 that the reception to "Alexander," the 2004 epic historical drama where he starred as Alexander the Great, caused him to question himself as an actor, which eventually led him to "plug back into" the person he was when he walked into an acting class at age 17.John Nacion/Variety via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
Farrell, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in 2023, said he and others with “Alexander” had tuxedos ready for an award show run and expected the film would be “off to the Oscars” before negative press began to trickle in.“I was like, ‘Holy shit.’ I thought, ‘What can I do?’ I felt so much shame,” said Farrell of criticism toward the film, which received six nominations at the 2005 Golden Raspberry Awards.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
