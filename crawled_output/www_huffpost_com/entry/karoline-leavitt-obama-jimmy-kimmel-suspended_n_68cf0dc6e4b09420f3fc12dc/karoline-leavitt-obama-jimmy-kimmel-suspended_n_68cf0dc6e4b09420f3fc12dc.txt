Obama wrote Thursday on X, ”After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn’t like.” Advertisement
After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn’t like. https://t.co/uts7JpJZzN— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) September 18, 2025“This is precisely the kind of government coercion that the First Amendment was designed to prevent — and media companies need to start standing up rather than capitulating to it,” he said in a follow-up post. Leavitt told Fox News’ “Saturday in America” host Kayleigh McEnany that “with all due respect to former President Obama, he has no idea what he’s talking about.” Advertisement
The late night talk show was pulled off the air indefinitely following massive backlash from conservatives who took offense to comments made about MAGA’s reaction to podcaster Charlie Kirk’s fatal shooting during Monday night’s monologue. Kimmel’s abrupt suspension came amid licensing threats from Trump Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr and was immediately celebrated by President Donald Trump.

This was not the first time Carr had threatened ABC. He previously launched a formal review into ABC as well as the network’s corporate parent and supported Trump’s lawsuits against the network and CBS, which resulted in $16 million settlements from each of their parent companies, NPR reported.ABC’s decision sparked a wave of concern and criticism over the administration’s influence on free speech rights. Christopher Anders, the director of the democracy and technology division at the American Civil Liberties Union, called Kimmel’s suspension “beyond McCarthyism.”Advertisement
“Trump officials are repeatedly abusing their power to stop ideas they don’t like, deciding who can speak, write, and even joke,” Anders said. “The Trump administration’s actions, paired with ABC’s capitulation, represent a grave threat to our First Amendment freedoms.”However, Leavitt denied any White House pressure during her appearance on McEnany’s show. “The decision to fire Jimmy Kimmel and to cancel his show came from executives at ABC,” Leavitt said. “That has now been reported and I can assure you it did not come from the White House, and there was no pressure given from the president of the United States.” Advertisement
Leavitt went on to say she was the one who broke the news to Trump during his visit to the United Kingdom. “It was a decision that was made by ABC because Jimmy Kimmel chose to knowingly lie to his audience on his program about the death of a highly respected man when our country is in a state of mourning,” Leavitt said. “That was a decision that he made, and he is now facing a consequence for that decision and for that lie.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
