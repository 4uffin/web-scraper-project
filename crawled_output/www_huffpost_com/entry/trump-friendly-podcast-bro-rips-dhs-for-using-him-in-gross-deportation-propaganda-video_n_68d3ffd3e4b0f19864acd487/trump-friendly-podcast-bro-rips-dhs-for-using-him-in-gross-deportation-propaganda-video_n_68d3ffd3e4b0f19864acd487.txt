The video, which has since been deleted by DHS, opens with a clip of Von in January shaking his head disapprovingly and saying, “I heard you got deported, dude. Bye!”The video then goes on to brag about the department’s deportation numbers backed by images of people being arrested to upbeat music. It ends with a clip of a plane and overlaying text that reads: “Leave now.”The caption for the video was simply, “Bye!”Another screenshot from DHS’s deleted video.Screenshot @DHSgov via XAdvertisement
“Yooo DHS i didnt approve to be used in this,” Von wrote Tuesday while re-tweeting the now-deleted DHS video celebrating deportations. “I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger’ deportation videos.”He added: “When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are alot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye!”Yooo DHS i didnt approve to be used in this. I know you know my address so send a check. And please take this down and please keep me out of your ‘banger’ deportation videos. When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are alot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye! https://t.co/5v5gagf4Dr— Theo Von (@TheoVon) September 24, 2025Advertisement
HuffPost has reached out to DHS for comment, but did not receive an immediate response. Von’s criticism is significant considering that he’s one of several influential podcasters who have been largely sympathetic to President Donald Trump and the MAGA movement — helping to elevate Trump’s voice to younger male voters.

Von also interviewed Vice President JD Vance in June, and discussed Elon Musk’s feud with Trump.Advertisement

Ro Khanna (Calif.) at the time that it was “a horrible idea.”Despite that, many left-leaning X users weren’t exactly buying that Von was criticizing DHS for ethical reasons.Advertisement
“Send a check” before “take this down” is wild— John (@quesoliker) September 24, 2025When your first concern is where your money is it makes your “nuanced” thoughts on immigration seem unimportant— BROTHER LOBO 🐺⚔️ (@ellobosalvaje) September 24, 2025Which is it, you want to get paid for your likeness, or be disassociated from the message?— "Dr. Hypnosis" 🧠 | BowTied Brain-Hacking (@BowTiedTrance) September 24, 2025Advertisement
But you did, in fact, say what's in that video. And you DID, in fact, endorse Trump basically. And you DID, in fact, attend his inauguration, even though his entire Campaign was "deport everyone." So, spare us.— A.J.
