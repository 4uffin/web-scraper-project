(Watch the video below.)Singer Micah Palace had just finished his performance when Mel B praised him for “the party vibe.” The Spice Girls star then changed the subject completely.Advertisement
“But I just wanna give you a few words of advice: You have to be nice to everybody: the crew, the people that dress you,” she said. “’Cause if not, you’re gonna meet them on the way back down, anyway.”“What do you mean?” Cowell can be heard asking Mel B. The two could be seen talking as Howie Mandel offered his critique. Cowell gave the “cut” sign on his neck in Mel B’s direction.Palace, still onstage, noted that “Simon’s got something to say,” and the talent show ceded the floor to Cowell.Advertisement
“I have seen you, Micah, backstage, and this is my own perspective: You’ve been really polite and sweet to everyone, so that was out of order,” Cowell said while seemingly glaring at Mel B.Palace said his mother, who was in the audience, “raised somebody to always treat people respectfully, and my apologies out to anybody if there was ever anything, that was never my intention.”Here’s an edited clip of the exchange:Advertisement
Fast-forward to 3:30 for the entire tense moment in the video here. People magazine issued an oddly worded explanation for Mel B’s apparent lecture, writing: “People has since learned that Mel B’s intentions were to simply pass on the best piece of advice she received as a young performer to another rising star.”That’s tough to buy. We’re reaching out to all parties involved for comment.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
