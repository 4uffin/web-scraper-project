“We have kids and we go to our friend’s house and he has one of these double king-size beds put together and all the kids sleep in the bed,” McConaughey said in an interview with Fox News Digital, published over the weekend.“The wife’s on one side with her side table, and the husband’s on the other side and it’s great when you got all three kids, but all of a sudden the kids get too big,” he said. “They’re out of the bed.”McConaughey said that one day it hit him that his wife was “like a football field away” in bed. “Then you go to bed at night, like you want to snuggle up and …‘Well, we’ve got to cover up you... Come about 12 feet and I’ll come 12 feet,’” he said. Advertisement
Suddenly, “You’re like, man, this damn king-size bed is not good for the marriage, man,” he added.“Get rid of that son of a bitch,” he said. “So we got a queen size where we’re shoulder to shoulder. I’m telling you, it’s good for your marriage.” There’s something to his advice, as the “True Detective” star and his wife, Camila Alves McConaughey, have been married for 13 years. The two are parents to three children: Levi, 17; Vida, 15; and Livingston, 12. Camila has weighed in with her own relationship advice for others, though she’s joked there’s not really a “simple, short answer!” Advertisement
In an interview with Hollywood Life in 2021, she said, “Relationships are work, but I choose love. I was actually thinking about it this morning, because you can go through a lot of things in a relationship, you can go through a lot of ups and downs, no relationship is perfect. It’s work.” She then posed a simple question for those working on their relationship to consider.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
