And I‚Äôve so been enjoying living in the Bondi 9s at home and on my walks. $175 at Zappos$175 at Hoka$164+ at AmazonAdvertisement
Hokas are seemingly everywhere these days. I have two teenagers who are both equally obsessed with the brand, and an 80-year-old aunt who swears by them. Hoka has somehow seamlessly done what‚Äôs usually impossible: crossed generational boundaries and brought together fans of all ages by knowing how to make everyone‚Äôs feet look hip and feel happy. My mom recently convinced me on the merits of having an indoor pair of sneakers to wear in the kitchen, and for all those household chores. She claims slippers aren‚Äôt supportive enough. So I took her suggestion and wore my new pair of Bondi 9 indoors for a few days for all the hours I‚Äôm in the kitchen ‚Äì cleaning, meal prepping, and cleaning again. (Did I mention I have two teenagers?) $175 at Zappos$175 at Hoka$164+ at AmazonAdvertisement
After long stints in the kitchen, I can definitely feel that the Bondi 9 delivers the ultimate shock absorbency when standing on hard floors. The foamy and bouncy underfoot cushioning is improved, which makes standing for long lengths of time delightful. I‚Äôve been in multiple PT sessions for back and foot pain (three decades of running will do this), but never felt tired or achy wearing the Bondi. I‚Äôd say Mom‚Äôs right ‚Äî slippers just don‚Äôt cut it anymore for my two-hour kitchen marathons. I also stood in line for 45 minutes at the DMV in the Bondi and experienced no leg fatigue or lower back discomfort. The Bondi 9 looks good, too. I opted for the blue spark/mint fluorite color, which is a bold and fun combo. (My teenage daughter even complimented my choice.) It looks nice with a tan, and the bright colors make me happy when I look at my feet. With 15 choices in regular width, and eight options in wide sizes, you can definitely find something neutral if that‚Äôs more your thing too. My foot is a normal width ‚Äî in a running sneaker I wear a 9.5, walking sneaker a 9. This sneaker fits true to size for me. The Bondi 9 is also lighter than its predecessor. The women‚Äôs version dropped from 9.9 ounces to 9.3, while the men‚Äôs went from 11.4 ounces to 10.5. The 9 does feel and look like an upgraded shoe when I compared my youngest daughter‚Äôs 8 and 9 models. She‚Äôs a beginner runner and loves these! (FYI, I always order my kid‚Äôs sneakers from the Hoka site ‚Äî they have free returns and more color options than Amazon.) Advertisement
Jennifer Samson-AckerMy daughter's older Bondi 8 alongside her newer 9.I also appreciate the newly improved knit upper for a more stretchy fit in the 9 model. The 9 also sports a raised heel height, which provides more comfort, less sock slippage, uncomfortable heel rubbing, and I think even makes putting them on a tad more seamless. There was no breaking in period for me ‚Äì they felt great right out of the box. Hoka improved the Bondi with what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúsupercritical‚Äù EVA foam midsole, which is lighter, a bit softer, and more responsive than the traditional EVA foam in the Bondi 8. The takeaway: it gives back more energy, and feels bouncier. The stack height is two millimeters greater compared with the former Bondi 8, so you‚Äôre getting a more energetic ride overall. With a cost of $175 (a $5 increase from the previous model), I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs not too shabby of an investment for your heart and mental well being health. Advertisement
$175 at Zappos$175 at Hoka$164+ at AmazonThe Bondi 9 is a breathable sneaker too. I prefer wearing my running and walking sneakers with a thin moisture wicking sock, and my feet stay cool in the Bondis ‚Äî even on the hottest and most humid August days. On my two-mile walks I appreciated the supportive heel cushioning that allows my foot to gently roll forward making for a comfortable and enjoyable ride, and delivers a springy step that feels good. My walks include a lot of up and downhills, and this model delivers the right amount of cushion and responsiveness for varying terrain. Advertisement
If you want to experiment with running, or even play around with a run/walk during your outdoor ventures, the Bondi 9 is the shoe to take that leap in. It‚Äôs billed as a slow running/recovery sneaker, but also falls under the walking purview. So while the purist runners will grimace if you say you walk in your running shoes ‚Äî I say you‚Äôre allowed to do that in the Bondi 9. See what some other happy shoppers had to say or just scroll down to grab a pair for yourself.‚ÄúI absolutely LOVE these shoes! I wear a size 8 normally and they fit perfectly in an 8. So comfy and super cute! I felt like I was walking on a cloud in my vanilla Hokas! This is my first pair ever and I‚Äôm so thankful I splurged on a shoe that feels good on my feet for work and for exercise. Finger crossed my back pain improves. ‚ù§Ô∏è will add my hubby could tell how happy I was as I jumped up and down in excitement at first try on üíÅ‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚Äù ‚Äì Julia Guzman‚ÄúThese shoes are a lifesaver for your feet if you have to be upright for hours at a time! All of the nurses wear them for 12+ hour shifts so I knew they had to be good. The color is the prettiest shade of cream with a hint of peach. They are very well made, comfortable (like a hug for your feet), lightweight with excellent support and I‚Äôve so appreciated having them.‚Äù ‚Äì T. Hughes‚ÄúI purchased the Bondi 9 for a trip to Switzerland. I knew I would be doing A LOT of walking and needed a really good shoe. After a ton of research I purchased these. I am so glad I did! They are the most comfortable shoe ever. I wore them brand new out of the box with no break in period. Not one blister or any foot pain! Walked over 30 miles! BUY THEM NOW!! My husband was so impressed with my love of them he went and got the Bondi 9 for men. He loves his too!‚Äù ‚Äì The Traveler$175 at Zappos$175 at Hoka$164+ at AmazonRelatedshoppingwalkingsneakerscomfortable shoesI Regret To Inform You That Hoka Sneakers Are Worth The Hype ‚Äî Especially While They're 20% OffI've Tried So Many Hoka Sneakers, And This One Is Hands-Down The Best For WalkingI've Tried So Many Hoka Sneakers, And This One Is Hands-Down The Best For Walking Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
