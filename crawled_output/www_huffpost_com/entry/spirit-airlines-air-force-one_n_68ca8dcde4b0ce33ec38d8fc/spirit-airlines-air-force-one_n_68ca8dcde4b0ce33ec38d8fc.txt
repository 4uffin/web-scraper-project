“Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right,” a controller said in recordings reported by the network. “Pay attention, Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right. Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right, now. Spirit wings 1300 turn 20 degrees right, immediately.”Flight data estimated the Spirit jet came within 8 miles of the presidential aircraft while flying parallel and was as close as 11 miles when it was on a path where the planes might collide, the network noted.“Pay attention. Spirit 1300 traffic off your left wing by 6 mi― or 8 miles, 747. I’m sure you can see who it is. Keep an eye out for him — he’s white and blue,” a controller said in an apparently lighthearted tone.Advertisement
Temporary flight restrictions for planes sharing airspace with any aircraft carrying the president “usually consists of an outer ring that measures 30 nm and an inner ring of approximately 10 miles,” according to Flyingmag.com.After the Spirit jet made the correction, the controllers cracked, “Pay attention. Get off the iPad.”A Spirit spokesman told CBS the flight followed the traffic-control instructions and “landed uneventfully.”Advertisement
