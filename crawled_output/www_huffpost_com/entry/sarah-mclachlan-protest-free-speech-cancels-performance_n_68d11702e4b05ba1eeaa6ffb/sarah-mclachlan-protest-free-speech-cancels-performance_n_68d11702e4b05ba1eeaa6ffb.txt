“I know you’re expecting a performance tonight, and I’m so grateful to all of you for coming, and I apologize if this is disappointing, but we have collectively decided not to perform but instead to stand in solidarity in support of free speech,” McLachlan said to cheers in a clip shared by The Hollywood Reporter’s Chris Gardner.“I know you’re expecting a performance tonight, and I’m so grateful to all of you for coming, and I apologize if this is disappointing, but we have collectively decided not to perform but instead to stand in solidarity in support of free speech,” Sarah McLachlan said breaking… pic.twitter.com/CteaSYysnl— Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner) September 22, 2025ABC News Studios had already canceled the red carpet for the doc, Variety reported.In a move that has ignited a furor over censorship, Disney yanked ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” from the air amid pressure from Donald Trump’s Federal Communications Commission over comments the host made about Charlie Kirk’s alleged killer.Advertisement
