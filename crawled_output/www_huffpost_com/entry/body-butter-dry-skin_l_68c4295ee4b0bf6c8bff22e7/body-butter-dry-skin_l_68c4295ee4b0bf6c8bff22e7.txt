Thanks to barrier-supporting ingredients like shea butter and cocoa butter, they’re designed to deliver deep, long-lasting hydration. Plus, the whipped, velvety texture makes application feel more indulgent, perfect for self-care moments. Here are 10 buzzy newcomers and cult-favorites, just in time for cooler weather. 1An affordable whipped body butter Treehut’s lightweight whipped body butter melts into the skin, leaving it soft and smooth. The vanilla version, one of my drugstore go-tos for its delicious scent and affordability, blends vanilla bean, coconut cream and warm sandalwood, leaving a fragrance that lingers all day. Shea butter deeply nourishes, while oat kernel extract soothes, smooths and protects. Get the body butter in a dozen other scents, including favorites like Moroccan Rose and Tropic Glow.Promising review: “This body butter is incredible! The whipped texture feels so light going on, but it leaves my skin soft and hydrated all day. After using it, my skin honestly feels smooth as a baby’s — it’s that good. The Vitamin C gives it an extra brightening boost, and the scent is fresh without being overpowering. I love how quickly it absorbs without feeling greasy, which makes it perfect for daily use. A little goes a long way, and the jar itself lasts quite a while. This has quickly become one of my favorite skincare treats — both effective and indulgent.” – Evelyn M$9+ at Amazon$11 at Ulta2A spinoff of its viral and beloved sibling This TikTok‑viral Vanilla Cashmere whipped body butter from eos is born from the popularity of its highly touted sibling, the Vanilla Cashmere body lotion. Loved for its comforting, dessert‑inspired vanilla scent that’s rich without being overpowering, the body butter delivers up to 72 hours of deep hydration. At the heart of its Cashmere Smooth Complex™ is a blend of butters and oils, including shea, cocoa and argan butters, to replenish dry skin, while coconut oil helps smooth and maintain that luxurious, whipped finish. Promising review: “This product exceeded my expectations and I wish I would have found it sooner. Incredible moisture that lasts forever and the scent is delicious. Someone thought I walked in their store with fresh baked goods. The scent is not offensive and smells like vanilla. I am very impressed with the glow and long lasting moisture I get. This is a luxurious body cream at a decent price leaving my skin soft for HOURS.” – Sharie$13 at Amazon$15 at Target3A rich vegan moisturizer that’s dermatologist-approved Weleda’s Skin Food body butter is a rich, vegan moisturizer that drenches dry skin in lasting hydration. Shea butter smooths, cocoa seed butter boosts hydration and elasticity, and sunflower seed oil locks in moisture, while calendula soothes and comforts. Dermatologist-approved, NATRUE-certified and housed in a sustainable five-ounce glass jar, it’s a nourishing pick for every skin type.Promising review: “This is a really positive review because the product has done wonders for me. The Shea and Cocoa Butter gives a velvety touch to the skin, making it feel like a luxury. I love the non-greasy feel after application. It's like heaven for my dry, middle-aged skin. I couldn't be more pleased with the results. Absolutely love it!” – Braggmama3 $20 at AmazonAdvertisement
4A cult favorite that’s gentle enough for sensitive skin Naturium’s Glow Getter Multi-Oil body butter is a whipped, vegan body cream that hydrates, firms and nourishes with a powerhouse blend of botanical oils, shea butter, squalane and plant-based peptides. Shea butter softens and smooths, squalane delivers lightweight, non-greasy moisture while supporting the skin barrier, and peptides help firm and boost elasticity. Infused with a natural vanilla and coconut scent, this cult favorite not only transforms dry, dull skin into a soft, radiant glow, but it’s also one of my personal favorites for being gentle on my sensitive skin.Promising Amazon review: “I bought this for the first time at the recommendation from a friend. I am impressed with the way it smells and the way it softens my skin. It makes my skin shine and it keeps me moisturized all day. I have eczema and this product doesn’t affect it at all. It feels very creamy but not heavy. Did I mention that I love the way it smells?! I love the quality and will most likely purchase again.” – Ms Tema27 $25 at Target$20 at UltaAdvertisement
5A moisturizer that plumps with hyaluronic acid Light, airy and whipped to perfection, Kopari’s Ultra Restore body butter sinks into skin while delivering long-lasting hydration. Hyaluronic acid plumps, mango seed butter nourishes with vitamins A, C and E, and coconut oil locks in moisture. Prickly pear flower extract adds antioxidants, while squalane and plant oils strengthen and soothe. Enjoy it in three scents: OG Coconut, with its sweet, milky aroma, warm and creamy Tahitian Vanilla, or Guava for a tropical twist.Promising review: “I like everything about this product. It doesn’t leave a residue on your skin, but gets the job done. It definitely helped rehydrate the alligator skin on my arms and legs. I love the very slight fragrance, which is not perfumy. I love the consistency and the texture of this product. I will buy it again. By far the best skin hydrating product that I have come across so far. And I have tried a fair number of them.” – B. Harvey $39 at Amazon$42 at Ulta6AmazonA cult-favorite body “milk”While Herbivore describes this moisturizer as a milk and not a butter, this firming body cream promises to contain all the hydrating prowess of its dairy counterpart. The fatty acids found in coconut are designed to soak into the skin and vegan squalane helps to lock in softness. Promising review: “This is a very thick body cream with a whipped like consistency. It contains shea butter and coconut oil which contributes to its thicker feel. Although it's thick, it melts into the skin beautifully without having to use that much and leaves my skin feeling super soft and silky. It smells like a sweet soft coco vanilla that settles into your skin. I use this before bed and I wake up with a very soft sweetness, which I absolutely love! I use a body serum before using this on top and this provides a lot more sealing moisture rather than hydration, and this feels like it would be best during the cold. I love that this absorbs really well despite the thickness, I didn't notice much firming but it was a secondary affect that I didn't put much weight on. One thing I just wish it wasn't as pricey. Because a little goes a long way with this, it definitely feels worth the price as it will last me well throughout the fall and winter weather and then some. I'm reaching for this more and more that I know I will replace this once I run out.” – AmazonReviewer$40 at AmazonAdvertisement
7An indulgent formula crafted with 100% pure argan oil Josie Maran’s Whipped Argan Oil body butter is an indulgent treat that restores skin’s suppleness, bounce and tone, leaving it soft and radiant. Packed with 100% pure argan oil, shea butter and avocado oil, it nourishes, soothes and protects while strengthening the skin barrier. Eco-friendly and refillable, it comes in a sleek glass jar with BPA-free refill pouches. Get it in seven delicious scents, including Bohemian Fig, Topless Tangerine, Vanilla Vibezzz, Golden Hour, Vanilla Bean, Vanilla Apricot, Sweet Citrus, plus fragrance-free Always Nude.Promising review: “This butter has a faint vanilla scent that I love. Leaves skin moisturized without being greasy. I feel like my skin has a smoother appearance when I use it.” – SkinBeGlowin$36 at Sephora$36 at Josie Maran8A body butter that’s loaded with antioxidants Packed with antioxidant-rich ingredients, this Innersense Organic Beauty Blissful body butter leaves skin soft, soothed and seriously supple while smelling like orange blossom and white rose. Its mango seed butter hydrates deeply with vitamins A and E, while organic shea butter locks in moisture without feeling heavy. The Vitarevive Trio blend, featuring vitamins B5, C and D, boosts brightness and elasticity, resulting in a decadent, weightless formula that restores stressed skin and keeps it glowing. Promising review: “This body butter is awesome!! It smells delicious (somewhat fruity) and it's very rich and thick - it's done wonders for my dry legs and it absolutely hydrates "intensely" as it claims - it lasts throughout the day and leaves my skin feeling very moisturized and soft. A little goes a long way, too - I use my fingertip to scoop out a small amount for each leg and this is enough to evenly cover both. I had not heard of this brand before, but I'm excited to try their other products as this one is a definite winner when compared to other brands that carry similar products! And the best part is that this one happens to be non-toxic and organic!” – Shay $42 at Amazon9A luxurious formula with a mood-boosting scent When I want to indulge a little, I reach for Sol de Janeiro’s Delícia Drench body butter, which locks in moisture for up to 24 hours while strengthening the skin’s barrier. Its star ingredient, bacuri butter, a nutrient-packed plant butter from the bacuri fruit, delivers deep hydration and essential fatty acids, while the Brazilian Soothing Complex — copaiba resin and passionflower seed oil — calms stressed skin. The Delícia Drench scent is an uplifting woody-gourmand mix, with velvet plum and sugared violet on top, vanilla orchid and whipped amber at heart, and sheer sandalwood with fresh vetiver at the base.Promising review: “The smell is a lovely warm and cozy winter scent. The thick butter is wonderful for preventing dry skin. Hours later the scent is still there but not overly powerful, just perfect! It’s the right balance of warm and spicy.” – AmyHacker $24+ at Sephora$24+ at UltaAdvertisement
10A vegan pick that nourishes with Undaria seaweed Known for clean, vegan skincare powered by the sea, Osea blends ocean-derived ingredients with safe, sustainable formulas. The Undaria Algae body butter, packed with undaria seaweed, shea butter and ceramides, firms skin, smooths crepiness and strengthens the barrier. Rich enough to lock in moisture for 72 hours yet lightweight enough to absorb quickly, it leaves skin deeply nourished without a greasy finish.Promising review: “I have super dry skin and it takes something very rich to be able to moisturize my skin especially my legs and arms. This does a fantastic job. It feels great. It’s not greasy it soaks in nicely. It has a great fragrance very clean smelling and light. Can’t say enough nice things about it. Osea makes great products. Highly recommend for those people with such dry skin you get flaky.” – chefsally $54 at Amazon$54 at Ulta11A splurge that smells like a Hawaiian vacation Kai fragrance has won over beauty enthusiasts and A-list celebrities alike, including Reese Witherspoon, Lily Collins and Mindy Kaling, thanks to its clean formulations and signature scent, a fresh blend of gardenia, plumeria, pikake and jasmine. Their body butter, a whipped soufflé, features key ingredients like shea butter, safflower oil and apricot oil, deeply hydrating and nourishing the skin while leaving it soft and renewed. In addition to its signature scent, the sleek 6.4-ounce tub is also available in rose.Promising review: “This body butter smells divine and goes on easily. You know how sometimes you’ve got to rub body butter for like an hour to get it to sink in? Not this one!! This one hydrates quick and is not greasy! Love it!” – Amy Combs $54 at AmazonRelatedshoppingskin care moisturizerdry skinReviewers With Mature Skin Are Obsessed With These 13 Makeup ProductsReviewers With Mature Skin Are Obsessed With These 13 Makeup ProductsThese ‘Magical’ Beauty Finds Have A Supremely Devoted Following — And It’s Time You Try Them Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
