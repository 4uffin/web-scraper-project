“Now I don’t want to suggest there’s been some disconcerting cognitive decline but back in 2020, that mofo could spit out hydroxychloroquine no problem,” quipped Klepper, referring to Trump’s embrace of an anti-malaria drug that was unproven in treating COVID-19.Klepper called Trump’s talk “especially strange,” pointing to medical experts slamming such claims as “irresponsible.”He proceeded to play a supercut of Trump repeatedly warning Americans not to take the drug.“Nothing bad can happen, it can only good happen,” said Trump at the presser.Klepper swiftly roasted the president’s claim, “Ask your doctor if it can only good happen for you.”The comedian emphasized that Trump is “so pissed” at Tylenol.“He’s going to start bombing the pain reliever aisles at Walgreens. Joke’s on you, Trump, even missiles can’t get through that plexiglass. You’re going to have to ring that customer service button like the rest of us,” he quipped.Advertisement
