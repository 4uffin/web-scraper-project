Sykes then directly called out President Donald Trump, saying:“So, let’s see, he didn’t end the Ukraine war or solve Gaza within his first week but he did end freedom of speech within his first year. Hey, for those of you who pray, now’s the time to do it. Love you, Jimmy.”Watch Sykes’ comments here.An audience member has also revealed how they only found out the show wouldn’t be going ahead while waiting in line.“They waited to pull the plug on this right as a studio audience was about to walk in,” he told The Associated Press. “They didn’t tell us what had happened, they just said that the show was canceled. Initially, my concern was, ‘I hope everyone’s OK, no one got injured.’”Advertisement
He added, “As they told us the show was being canceled, at the same time online, they announced that it was indefinitely, which we can probably assume is forever, taken off the air because of certain comments that were made, which I was not aware of. And then I went to go look to see what those comments were and they didn’t really seem to justify the means, it seemed to be a bit extreme.”TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

Kimmel added, “In between the finger-pointing, there was grieving.”Trump, a frequent critic of Kimmel, later celebrated the news, gloating on his Truth Social platform that it was “Great News for America” and demanding that Kimmel’s fellow late night hosts, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon, should now be pushed out of NBC.RelatedDonald TrumpJimmy KimmelWanda SykesSean Hannity Utterly Shredded For ‘Unreal’ Spin On Kimmel SuspensionOxford University Historian Predicts Exactly How Long U.S. Has To Save Its DemocracyFascism Scholar Sounds Alarm: We’re Now In ‘Next Phase’ Of Trump Authoritarian PlaybookBill O'Reilly Actually Says He's 'Sad' To See Jimmy Kimmel Off The Air Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
