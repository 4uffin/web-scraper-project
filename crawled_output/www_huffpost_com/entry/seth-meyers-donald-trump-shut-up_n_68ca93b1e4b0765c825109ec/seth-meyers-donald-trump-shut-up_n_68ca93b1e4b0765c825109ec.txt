“No one gives a shit about the ballroom,” Meyers continued. “Prices are skyrocketing and our freedoms are disappearing all around us, and you’re going on about a ballroom like a fop from ‘Dangerous Liaisons.’”Meyers then reality checked Trump with this line: “You think the farmers in Iowa who voted for you are sitting down for coffee at their local diner saying, ‘Well, the tariffs are killing my business, but at least the White House will finally have a place to hold fancy proms.’”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
