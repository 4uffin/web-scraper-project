Police Officer Attacked On Jan. 6 Shreds Trump's Kirk ResponseMichael Fanone spelled out what the president has done more than any other politician in America.By Ben BlanchetSep 17, 2025, 05:35 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGMichael Fanone, a former D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer who was attacked by a mob of Donald Trump supporters during the deadly Capitol riot, slammed the president on Tuesday over his response to Charlie Kirk’s assassination.“I think that no American politician has done more to normalize political violence in this country other than Donald J. Trump,” said Fanone in an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. Advertisement
Trump — in a video message from the Oval Office after the killing of his ally last week — ripped those on the “radical left” who have compared Kirk to a Nazi, claiming that their rhetoric is “directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today.”Other right-wing figures have similarly hurled blame at Democrats and the left for the assassination, as well.Fanone said he’s “disgusted” that Americans reelected a president who’s been “so divisive and so destructive,” adding that Trump has used the killing to “sow more seeds of division” and advocate for violence instead of uniting the country.Advertisement

In 2023, Trump echoed Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini when he vowed to “root out ... vermin” political foes, declaring that the “threat from outside forces is far less sinister, dangerous, and grave, than the threat from within.”Fanone argued that Trump has further advocated for the use of “political violence” by pardoning hundreds of rioters who were convicted of assaulting officers on Jan. 6, 2021.PowerOurJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour membership fuels reporting that informs, inspires, and holds power accountable.
