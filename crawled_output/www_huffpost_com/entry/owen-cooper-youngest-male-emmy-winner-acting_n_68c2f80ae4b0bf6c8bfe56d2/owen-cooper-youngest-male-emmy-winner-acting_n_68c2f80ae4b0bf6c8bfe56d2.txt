Cooper went up against his co-star Ashley Walters in his category, as well as Javier Bardem (“Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story”), Rob Delaney (“Dying for Sex”), Peter Sarsgaard and Bill Camp (“Presumed Innocent”).“Adolescence” marks Cooper’s first on-screen role. He played a 13-year-old student named Jamie Miller who was arrested for murdering his classmate. In the four-episode series, the allegations turn his family’s world upside down and force them to confront every parent’s worst nightmare.Cooper’s TV father, Stephen Graham, also picked up an Emmy nomination for Best Actor in a Limited/Anthology Series or TV Movie, while Christine Tremarco (Jamie’s mother) and Erin Doherty (Jamie’s psychologist) were both nominated for Best Supporting Actress. The show itself was up for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series.Advertisement
So far this awards season, Cooper has been on a roll, nabbing his first Emmy win shortly after taking home another best supporting actor honor at the Gotham TV Awards in June.Cooper reacted to his history-making Emmy nomination last month in an interview with People, saying, “It’s just crazy, really. And the youngest in my category is just ... Do you know what? It’s not even sunk in yet, to be fair, but that’s just something else to think about.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
