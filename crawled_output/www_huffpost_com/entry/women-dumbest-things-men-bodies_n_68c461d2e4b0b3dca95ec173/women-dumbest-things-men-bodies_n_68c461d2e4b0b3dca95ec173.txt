4FOX"One time, my now ex-boyfriend commented to me about how women lactate 24/7, and then asked why our tops weren’t constantly stained."— velvetbonesss"My male cousin thought any woman could breastfeed at any time. I was babysitting my niece (who was 6 months old), and I was running around trying to make her a bottle because she was crying so loudly. With a straight face, he stated, 'Why didn’t you just breastfeed her?'"— fatimaa4503fa89c5"I think the biggest one is when men think we pee via our vaginas, and they don't realize that there is a separate hole." — VaginaGoblin6"That there's no such thing as female orgasm." — la_selena"The men who say this don’t realize how hard they’re calling themselves out for never giving a woman an orgasm." — justdontsashayAdvertisement
7NBC"That women aren’t supposed to get wet during sex."— Top_Manufacturer89468"Just the idea that a lot of men have that women like sex with huge dicks, ramming hard, for an hour. It's like they imagine a magic vortex down there that opens up like in labor..." — jonni_velvet9"That any woman who’s had sex with multiple men must have the baggiest vagina ever. So we can have sex with 50 men and be loose, but sleep with the same man 50 times and remain tight? Makes sense." — Malibu_MilkAdvertisement
10Peacock"The idea that the size and shape of the labia are affected by how many partners a woman has had. That makes zero sense whatsoever."— eefr11"One time, a coworker told me he watched a video that said every woman who has had sex with multiple men carries their DNA with her for years and years, and when she does get pregnant by one man, all those other men’s DNA is also found within the child. I asked him where he got his information, and he couldn’t recall, but swore that it's true and scientifically proven." — Ilikeweirdshite12"My grandma had uterine cancer and had to get a hysterectomy. My brothers, dad, and I were in the waiting room during her surgery when one of my brothers started getting irritated. He said that our grandma was being selfish for letting her cancer get this far. I was dumbfounded and asked what the fuck he meant. This dude believed that women pee out their uteruses during menopause. So he thought our grandma was willfully holding in her uterus, which caused the cancer. My other brother and dad chimed in, in agreement that, yeah, our grandma could have prevented this. Mind you, my brothers at that time had been in relationships and had kids. I had to explain to these grown-ass men basic sex ed. — u/trinkets2024Advertisement
13Channel 4"I’ve had to explain to a few guys that it’s the man who determines the sex of the baby. They all thought that if they kept having daughters, it was somehow their wives' fault."— philipnicholls14"They don't seem to realize how painful periods are — that's not exactly news — but it still baffles me that, in 2025, a lot of men don't realize shedding the lining of your uterus hurts...a lot." — Mother-Worker-544515"I feel like everything men say about periods is the most embarrassing piece of garbage: 'The heavier a period, the more sexually active a woman is. It should just be the tiniest drop of blood. That’s why it’s called a period. Because that’s the size of it in your panties.' An actual thing I heard a man say." — thanarealnobodyAdvertisement
16Miramax"The idea that you can transfer an ectopic pregnancy from the fallopian tube to the uterus instead of terminating it. Not just ridiculous, but dangerous."— Ghoulishgirlie17"When CONGRESSMAN Todd Akin said women's bodies were naturally able to prevent pregnancy in the case of 'legitimate rape.' In 2012." — bananachow18"It’s only happened to me a couple of times, but it’s very funny to be asked, 'Did you come?' after a sexual encounter that involved little-to-no clit stimulation. Like…no, I didn’t, and I assume you wouldn’t finish if your main sexual pleasure organ wasn’t touched, either." — celestialismAdvertisement
19Disney+"I've had multiple men argue with me, like genuinely argue, that men and women have a different number of ribs."— GimmeBooks192020"A guy I used to work with said he grounded his 13-year-old daughter for having a UTI because he thought the only way she could get one was by having sex." — taylorzufall21"My ex said I was cheating because I had more discharge than normal in my underwear. Thank god I eventually got rid of him." — kathrynvankirkAdvertisement
22"'Kidney stones are more painful than childbirth.' My doctor told me that.'" — weatherboy23And finally, "Just a few hours ago, a man said, in front of me and around five other people, that women don’t have bowels, they have ovaries." — u/Eriibear24Comedy CentralHave you heard a man say something completely out-of-pocket about how a woman's body works?
