Melissa Hortman the same way he’s honored Charlie Kirk.Hortman — along with her husband, Mark, and their beloved dog — was fatally shot in a politically motivated assassination back in June.

Collins highlighted Trump’s lack of response to the lawmaker’s death ― versus how he’s honored slain podcaster Charlie Kirk ― during her CNN show on Monday. The reporter cut to a clip of Trump talking about how he would’ve lowered the flags for the assassinated lawmaker back in June, if one thing had happened. “I wouldn’t have thought of that. But I would have if somebody had asked me,” Trump said while speaking to reporters at the White House on Monday. “Had the governor of Minnesota asked me to do that, I would have done that gladly.” Advertisement
Back in her show, Collins quickly contradicted Trump’s answer about speaking with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.The reporter then showed footage that showed that she’d asked Trump about lowering flags in June after the assassination, and he gave a completely different answer.“I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. I’m not calling him,” Trump told Collins while on Air Force One in June. “Why would I call him? I could call and say, ‘Hi, how you doing?’ The guy doesn’t have a clue. He’s a mess. I could be nice and call, but why waste time?” Advertisement
Trump has taken an entirely different approach to mourning Kirk, who was an ardent supporter of the president. Kirk was shot and killed on Wednesday, Sept. 10, while speaking at Utah Valley University.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
