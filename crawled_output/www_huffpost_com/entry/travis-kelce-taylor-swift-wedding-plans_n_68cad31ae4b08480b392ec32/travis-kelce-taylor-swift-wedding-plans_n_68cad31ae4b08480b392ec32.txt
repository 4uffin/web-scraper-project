“Are you working on planning the wedding?” the late night talk show host asked. “Are you doing this now? Is that the next move?”“Yeah, that’s the next step. That’s the next step,” Travis replied, prompting Fallon to tell him not to stress about wedding planning. “That one’s gonna be easy.

In it, I put all the fabric swatches of the wedding dress I’m going to wear. I also have a tuxedo I picked out of a catalog that you’ll wear.’”The NFL star and Swift have been romantically linked since late 2023, and announced their engagement in an Aug. 26 Instagram post. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
