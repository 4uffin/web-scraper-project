“Are you working on planning the wedding?” the late night talk show host asked. “Are you doing this now? Is that the next move?”“Yeah, that’s the next step. That’s the next step,” Travis replied, prompting Fallon to tell him not to stress about wedding planning. “That one’s gonna be easy. I just gotta figure out how to win a football game first,” the podcaster quipped. “It’ll be easy compared to trying to figure out how to fucking catch a goddamn football.”Advertisement
The Chiefs are currently 0-2 and ranking dead last in the AFC West this season.

“I want to build a life with someone that’s based on their dreams as well as my dreams,” she told Cosmopolitan in a 2012 interview. “I don’t want it to just be like, ‘So, I have a scrapbook. In it, I put all the fabric swatches of the wedding dress I’m going to wear. I also have a tuxedo I picked out of a catalog that you’ll wear.’”The NFL star and Swift have been romantically linked since late 2023, and announced their engagement in an Aug. 26 Instagram post. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
