Then he seriously added: “To be honest with you all. I don’t know what’s going on and no one does. But I do know Jimmy Kimmel. And he’s a decent, funny and loving guy and I hope he comes back.”Fallon then pivoted back into comedy mode when he teed up a lengthy bit by saying: “Yeah, a lot of people are worried that we won’t keep saying what we want to say or that we’ll be censored but I’m going to cover the president’s trip to the U.K. just like I normally would.”He then appeared to mock and trash Trump, but his comments were dubbed with only positive comments about the president.Advertisement
