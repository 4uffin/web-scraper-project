Israel said it has called up 60,000 reservists and extended the service of an additional 20,000 in order to carry out the operation.Advertisement
Israel maintains the military operation is meant to wipe out Hamas, the Gaza-based militant group that carried out the deadly attack on Oct. 7, 2023. About 50 hostages taken by Hamas at the time remain in captivity, roughly half of whom Israel believes are dead.Arab mediators say Hamas leaders have agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal, though similar developments in the past have not led to a permanent truce. Israel has not agreed to the deal.Both the international community and some Israelis themselves have accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of abandoning the hostages and a potential ceasefire in favor of destroying the Palestinian people. The Gaza Health Ministry estimates Israeli forces have killed at least 65,000 people, with the real toll expected to be much higher.Advertisement

Sep 17, 2025, 10:02 AM EDTOver 65,000 Palestinians Have Been Killed In Gaza War, Local Officials SayThe Palestinian death toll in the Israel-Hamas war surpassed 65,000 on Wednesday, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, as Israeli troops and tanks pushed deeper into Gaza City and residents fled the devastated area.Israel’s military said that air force and artillery units had struck the city over 150 times in the last few days, ahead of ground troops moving in. The strikes have toppled high-rise towers in areas densely populated by tent camps where thousands of Palestinians are sheltering. Israel claims the towers are being used by Hamas to surveil troops.Overnight strikes killed at least 16 people, including women and children, hospital officials reported. The death count in Gaza reached 65,062, with another 165,697 wounded, since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, said the Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government.Read more from The Associated Press:Advertisement

Sep 15, 2025, 7:09 PM EDTSanjana KaranthAnadolu via Getty ImagesUN Says Israel's Escalation In Gaza City Is Having 'Appalling Impact' On PalestiniansUnited Nations spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters on Monday that Israel's massive military escalation in Gaza City is having "an appalling impact on civilians enduring suffering and starvation.""Over the past few days, colleagues monitoring the movement of people in Gaza counted almost 70,000 displacements heading south, primarily to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis," Dujarric said. The forced displacement is exhausting families' few resources, while the cost of transportation to the south has skyrocketed.On Sunday, the chief of UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, said that in just the past four days, Israeli strikes have hit at least 10 of the agency's buildings in Gaza City — including seven schools and two clinics used to shelter thousands of displaced Palestinians."Health services continue to be heavily constrained, since clinics have suspended their services due to insecurity and displacement orders," Dujarric said, adding that a third of Gaza City's malnutrition treatment facilities have shut down due to the Israeli operation.Advertisement
Sep 15, 2025, 2:47 PM EDTSanjana KaranthNetanyahu Told Trump About Plan To Strike Qatar Beforehand: AxiosIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed U.S. President Donald Trump of his military's plan to strike Hamas leaders in Qatar shortly before the attack occurred, according to a Monday report by Axios.Several Israeli officials with direct knowledge on the matter told the outlet that Netanyahu alerted Trump over the phone of the impending attack in Doha roughly 50 minutes before it took place last Tuesday – giving the president enough time to order the strike canceled, if he wanted to.Since the attack on Qatar – a U.S. ally and key negotiating mediator for a Gaza ceasefire – the White House has claimed that Trump had no time to oppose the strike because he was only informed after the missiles were in the air. One official said Israel decided to go along with the White House's denial narrative "for the sake of the U.S.-Israel relationship," Axios reported.The Monday story comes as Secretary of State Marco Rubio visits Israel and Arab-Islamic leaders meet in Qatar to discuss a path forward following the Doha attack.Advertisement
Sep 15, 2025, 12:24 PM EDTQatar Hosts Summit For Arab Leaders To Show United Response After Israel's Doha AttackDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Qatar hosted a summit of leaders of Arab and Islamic nations Monday in the hopes of presenting a united response to Israel’s attack on Hamas leaders in Doha last week. But the group has few ways to restrain Israel as its war in the Gaza Strip grinds on.Israel launched its invasion of Gaza in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack, and since then it has also retaliated against the militant group and other members of Iran’s so-called Axis of Resistance elsewhere, including in Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and now Qatar. That’s led to wider anger among Mideast nations already enraged by the over 64,000 Palestinians killed during the war in Gaza — and a growing concern that the U.S. commitment to protect Gulf Arab states may not be strong enough.Read more from AP:Advertisement

Hamas has claimed the strike killed two lower-ranking members and three bodyguards, but that senior leadership survived the operation."If we didn't get them this time, we'll get them next time," Yechiel Leiter told Bret Baier on Fox News' "Special Report."Qatar is a key U.S. security partner that has been hosting and mediating negotiations between Israel and Gaza. The strike was widely condemned for escalating military operations in the region and threatening to topple any progress made toward a ceasefire."Right now, we may be subject to a little bit of criticism," Leiter said. "They'll get over it. And Israel is being changed for the better."Advertisement

Just imagining another displacement fills us with despair," said team member Osama, who chose to stay in Gaza City after being displaced four times.

Mercy Corps said Monday that the city has faced over 60 evacuation orders this year alone, often with little time for families to act."I try to take any path that might offer even the smallest chance of safety. If the army says, 'Go south,' I will go south. If they say, 'Go north,' I will go north," said team member Marah, who chose to flee Gaza City.
