Very light and beautiful. Light sunscreen scent that fades when dry. It glides on very smooth and feels very soothing.” — Carlos Hernandez“I’ve been using this sunscreen now for about 6 months and I love it so much. Thick and moisturizing but dries light weight and doesn’t make me feel or look greasy. I am acne prone and suffer hyperpigmentation from the acne. I’ve tried so many sunscreens and this is my absolute favorite. This doesn’t clog my pores or cause me to break out. And no eye stinging!! A must have for me. I love it!!!” — Ashley Session“Only thing I’ve found that I like. At 50+ years old I’ve just recently started wearing sunscreen. Mainly because I couldn’t stand the feel of anything on my face. However, this seems to moisturize my skin and I don’t mind wearing it at all (don’t even notice it). It does seem to make my skin kind of glow/dewey.” — bogman“I’ve been using this sun screen for the past year or so, and have been getting compliments on my skin ever since. Gives you a glossy finish and does NOT leave a white cast. I have a darker complexion, so that’s a big thing for me. I use everyday and it’s helped with my dark spots. Always recommended this product to people!” — RuthieJ“The best sunscreen out there! I’ve used numerous sunscreen brands and most of them left my skin dry and flaky or broke me out but this one is very lightweight doesn’t feel sticky and no white cast. Also the consistency is pretty watery not too thick and heavy very refreshing for sure. It also gives me skin that shiny glow. This is going to work just fine for you if you have dry skin, also it’s a broad spectrum which I love cause it protects against UVB and UVA rays, doesn’t make your eyes burn and has no scent” — Galilea$17.77 at Amazon (regularly $24.99)Still on the hunt for the perfect sunscreen? Take a look at these dermatologist-approved SPFs from previous reporting. 1DermstoreEltaMD UV Restore SPF 40If you're looking for a sunscreen that doubles as anti-aging skin care, board-certified dermatologist Dr. Sonia Badreshia-Bansal recommended the EltaMD UV Restore sunscreen. She said, "sunscreens that combine physical blockers with antioxidants like niacinamide, vitamin C, or DNA-repair enzymes" can help combat oxidative stress and visible signs of aging. This particular SPF has with squalane and ginger root extract, both of which support skin health and appearance.$46 at Dermstore$45 at Amazon2SephoraUltra Violette Future Screen SPF 50The cult-fave Australian brand Ultra Violette is finally available in the US at Sephora! If anyone knows how to protect their skin from harmful rays, it's Southern Hemisphere-dwelling Australians. I stock up on their sunscreens and lip balms every time I'm Down Under, and this development is a real thrill for skin care lovers. Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Jessie Cheung of Chicago’s Cheung Aesthetics & Wellness told HuffPost that this must-have SPF is “packed with mineral blockers to protect from the harsh Aussie sun, but feels silky and lightweight.”$40 at Sephora3AmazonIsdin Eryfotona Actinica SPF 50+Both Badreshia-Bansal and Cheung recommended this Barcelona-based skin care brand's sunscreen. It is 100% mineral-based and infused with skin-loving ingredients that make it a great multitasker. It is one of the most comfortable mineral sunscreen formulas I’ve tried. It’s formulated with zinc oxide, DNA repair enzymes and vitamin E — so not only is it preventing sun damage, but it’s helping to nourish and repair the skin as well.The Isdin sunscreen is significantly lighter and easier to blend than traditional mineral SPFs, and doesn’t have that lingering zinc smell that personally drives me up the wall. It dries down to a soft matte and is a nice base for dewy makeup looks. While this sunscreen blends well, there is a very slight white cast that’s typical of a mineral sunscreen formulation. The combination of lightweight finish, formula and UV protection has made it worth the troubleshooting. Many shoppers noted that it’s great for anyone who has sensitive skin, rosacea and skin cancer.$46 at Dermstore$46 at SephoraAdvertisement
4AmazonNeutrogena Sheer Zinc Oxide Dry-Touch mineral sunscreen SPF 50When you're going to hit the beach or pool, water-resistant formulas are key. Badreshia-Bansal said, "Look for something labeled ‘water resistant (80 minutes)’ and at least SPF 50. I recommend mineral sticks or lotions because they tend to be more photostable." In previous reporting, Dr. Brandan Camp, a board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology, said, "This lightweight, non-greasy product provides SPF 50 protection and contains zinc oxide as the active ingredient," Camp said. It's specially formulated with antioxidants to be water-resistant, is naturally sourced and dries down quickly without leaving a greasy finish.$25 at Amazon5ElemisElemis Pro-Collagen SPF 50This silky sunscreen is one of Elemis' newest products, but given how great it is, you'd think the brand has been in the SPF game for decades. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and absolutely love it. I'm extremely fussy about sunscreen texture, finish and scent — and luckily this beauty knocks it out of the ballpark on all counts while providing powerful SPF 50 protection. It's a sheer, imperceptible fluid that dries down quickly with no white cast and leaves your complexion looking radiant and dewy, never greasy. I can't help but add it to this list of must-haves that your skin will love.$72 at Elemis6DermstoreEltaMD UV AOX mist SPF 40For beach days, Cheung recommends a water-resistant SPF, preferably a mineral formula that won’t cause your eyes to sting or slide off when you're sweating in the sun. She pointed out that the EltaMD UV AOX Mist is great for full body coverage, since it "sprays on white but dries clear, so you won't miss any spots. It also has 360-degree sprayability, so you can apply it upside down." $46 at Dermstore$46 at AmazonAdvertisement
7UltaLa Roche-Posay Anthelios tinted light fluid sunscreen SPF 50Badreshia-Bansal said, "I’m really impressed by the new La Roche-Posay Anthelios mineral tinted SPF 50+ Fluid – it’s sheer, has a universal tint, and offers high UVA/UVB protection with 100% mineral filters. It’s ideal for sensitive skin and has a great, elegant feel." Perfect for those days when you don't want to wear makeup want an easy pick-me-up.$30 at Ulta (regularly $40)$29.99 at Amazon8AmazonCeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion with SPF 30According to Witkowski, this CeraVe lotion with SPF 30 is "an excellent, affordable and widely accessible option for a daily morning routine."

He also pointed out that it's non-comedogenic and fragrance-free, making it appropriate for sensitive and acne-prone skin.$15 at Amazon$15 at Ulta$15 at Target9UltaBlue Lizard Sensitive mineral sunscreen SPF 50+Another Badreshia-Bansal recommendation for days spent outdoors, this reef-safe mineral sunscreen from Australia contains no active chemicals and is suitable for use on sensitive skin.

Be one of the first to check out this SPF.$38 at Merit11AmazonLa Roche-Posay Anthelios Clear Skin Sunscreen Dry Touch SPF 60Having earned The Skin Cancer Foundation's Seal of Recommendation, this La Roche-Posay is Witkowski's personal favorite and “go-to” sunscreen, both for daily use and for days with extended sun exposure. It's also what he uses on his four-year-old child on beach days, bike rides or hikes. He noted that this oil-free SPF is very popular among dermatologists and is formulated with antioxidants that can help protect the skin from environmental damage. He also noted that it contains senna alata, "a tropical leaf extract known for its ability to combat oxidative stress and support the prevention of premature skin aging." You can't go wrong with this non-comedogenic, water-resistant formula that is also well-suited for sensitive skin. $16+ at Amazon$16+ at Ulta12DermstoreEltaMD UV Clear SPF 46Badreshia-Bansal echoed the saying that "the best SPF for daily use is one that you'll actually wear — lightweight, invisible and comfortable under makeup." She recommends a mineral SPF with low irritation potential, like this cult-fave SPF that is beloved by both HuffPost readers and editors alike. It's formulated with hyaluronic acid to deeply moisturize skin while the inclusion of lactic acid lightly exfoliates skin and can help to reduce hyperpigmentation and shine. It's a great option for people like me with sensitive and acne-prone skin. I turn to it anytime I'm going to be spending a lot of time in the sun or when I'm post-procedure and want to protect my skin without irritating it.$44 at Dermstore$44 at AmazonAdvertisement
13AmazonTiZO2 facial sunscreen and primer"I recommend Tizo 2 Facial Mineral Sunscreen SPF 40 for individuals seeking both high-performance sun protection and anti-aging benefits," said Witkowski. It's enriched with powerful antioxidants that canhelp neutralize free radicals and support overall skin health, while the gentle formulation makes it well-suited for sensitive and post-procedure skin. He also pointed out that it has a matte finish that "wears comfortably under makeup."$25 at Target (regularly $45)14DermstoreLancer mineral Sun Shield universal tint SPF 30Cheung recommends a lightweight, tinted mineral SPF with antioxidants for everyday wear, like the Lancer Mineral Sun Shield SPF. "It multitasks as sun protection, skincare and a glow-up in one," she said. The iron oxides that provide the tint can also help to protect your skin from blue light, which penetrates deeper than UVB and contributes to hyperpigmentation. She added that this sunscreen "soothes while protecting and reducing sun damage, and will blend into all skin tones."$60 at DermstoreThe Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics.
