Kennedy Jr. faces calls to resign over his anti-vaccine policies.“Look, you have vaccines that work. They just pure and simple work,” Trump said. “They’re not controversial at all.” Advertisement
Colbert seemed impressed ... at first. “Wow,” he said. “That is shockingly sensible.”Then he added: “But you know what they say about a broken clock. It was close friends with Jeffrey Epstein.” The president and his allies in Congress have been trying to block the release of additional files related to Epstein, the late convicted sex offender who was once close friends with Trump. Colbert also spotted a story in New York, where the president’s company, the Trump Organization, has been trying to win the contract to operate the skating rink in Central Park, as it did for decades until 2021.

The New York Times reported that the company is poised to lose that bid. Colbert’s audience cheered the news. “Don’t applaud, that’s terrible!” he mockingly scolded them. “Now I’ll never realize my dream of seeing ‘Cankles On Ice.’” Trump suffers from swollen feet and ankles due to a condition called chronic venous insufficiency. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
