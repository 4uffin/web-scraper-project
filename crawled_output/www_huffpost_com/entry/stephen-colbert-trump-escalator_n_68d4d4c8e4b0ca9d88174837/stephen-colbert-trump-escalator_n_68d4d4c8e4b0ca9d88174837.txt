The United Nations said a member of Trump’s team accidentally triggered the escalator’s safety mechanism, causing it to stop. The president and his entourage eventually walked up the stopped escalator. Trump was livid, and on Wednesday demanded that arrests be made over the incident. Colbert looked into the moment as the “Escalator Investigator” in his “Late Show” monologue: Advertisement
