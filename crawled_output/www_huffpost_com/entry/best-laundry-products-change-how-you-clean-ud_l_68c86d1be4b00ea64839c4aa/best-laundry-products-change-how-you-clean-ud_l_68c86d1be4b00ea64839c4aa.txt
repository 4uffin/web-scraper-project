If you’re curious to see some of the above-mentioned products, or are just looking for ways to dramatically upgrade your laundry game, read on to the list of German color-boosting detergents, tablets that will restore your washing machine, luxe laundry soaps and much more. 1DedCoolA trendy luxury laundry soap scented like bergamotTrue to its name, DedCool is a functional fragrance brand that's incredibly cool in both look and execution. The company has transformed many of its incredible-smelling scents into non-toxic detergents "made for clothes, sheets, intimates, delicates, and life," according to the brand — like the Dedtergent in Xtra Milk. One of DedCool's most popular fragrances, this luxe soap will have your fabrics smelling like amber, bergamot and white musk. Plus, it comes in this eco-conscious aluminum carton that holds enough soap for 60 washes and can be replenished from one of the brand's many refill options. $35 at DedCool2AmazonWashing machine cleaning tablets to eliminate that mildew smellDespite what you may think, washing machines need to be cleaned too and these reader-favorite tablets promise to make it an effortless process. Just pop an Affresh tablet into either your top- or front-loading machine, run it on a normal wash cycle and the time-release formula eliminates any grime or odor-causing residues from every part of your washing machine, including the valve, filter, pump and more. No more hard water stains or mildew smells to speak of. 6-pack: $12 at Amazon5-pack: $11 at Target6-pack: $12 at Home Depot3AmazonA 6-pack of reusable wool dryer balls that won a HuffPicks awardPrevious HuffPost Life coverage revealed that dryer sheets may actually be harming the environment, reducing the longevity of your clothing and your dryer. Reusable wool dryer balls were recommended to us by laundry experts as a great alternative, and since then, we've awarded this 6-piece set by Handy Laundry one of our coveted HuffPicks official shopping awards. Currently listed as a number one bestseller on Amazon and rated 4.6 out of 5 stars, these dryer balls are made from 100% New Zealand premium wool that won't shed lint and are reusable for 1,000+ loads. They absorb moisture, so your clothes spend less time in the dryer and naturally add softness to fabrics. $12 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonA vacuum attachment that will clean all of the trapped lint out of dryerThis cleaning attachment and long-bristled brush combo can help remove years' worth of lint buildup from your dryer vent, which is not only unsightly to look at but can be a potential fire hazard and impact the efficacy of your dryer. The flexible hose attaches to most vacuum cleaners and can also be useful for sucking out dust bunnies from deep underneath furniture or appliances.$8 at AmazonAdvertisement
5AmazonA laundry detergent holder standThis clever stand makes struggling with clumsy, heavy jugs of laundry detergent a thing of the past. It's built on a set of non-slip feet and has a tilted surface so the contents are constantly flowing to the pour spout to make pouring a breeze, and you never have to replace a messy, sticky cap onto your jug or clean up spills post-dispensing. There's even an elastic strap secured with Velcro that keeps jugs tightly in place while it lives on the stand.$20 at Amazon6AmazonA hidden-gem of a stain-remover that messy people needCome for the adorable packaging, but stay for the actually effective stain-fighting power of this magical spray that was created as a safer and more eco-friendly option compared to other stain removers on the market. The water-based and pH-neutral formula promises to eradicate some of the greatest offenders — including grease and coffee — and is free of phosphates, sulfates, perfumes and dyes. Even set-in stains are no match for Miss Mouth's, which works on a variety of fabrics including carpets, linens and upholstery. A frequent bestseller during major shopping events like Amazon Prime Day, reviewers have dubbed this stain treater "magic," another has said it's so good "I need to invest in stock," and yet another claimed it managed to restore clothing items that had been run over by cars going 80 miles an hour!$8 at AmazonAdvertisement
7AmazonA famously scented Glamorous Wash fine laundry detergentBack in 2022, HuffPost shopping writer Griff Wynne splurged on a bottle of this fragrant Glamorous Wash laundry soap in the popular scent Diva, which reached (insanely) viral proportions on TikTok. Made by the Texas-based Tyler Candle Company, Wynne described the scent as "a little floral and fruity, but not sugary or sticky sweet.""It’s rounded out by amber and chocolate, making it a warm, soothing scent. I’d compare it to a cashmere- or amber-scented candle. It’s woody and inviting, not screaming 'girly' or perfume-y," Wynne said. Suitable for all fabrics, Wynne insisted that the recognizable Glamourous Wash aroma lingered on their clothing for weeks, making it an "appealing investment" that was worth the coin. They even suggested just using smaller amounts of this detergent alongside your normal laundry soap as a luxurious scent booster. 64 ounces: $42 at Amazon8AmazonAn Italian stain-removing laundry detergentDuring a trip abroad, HuffPost senior shopping writer Lourdes Avila Uribe regaled her introduction to Napisan's Vanish, an Italian laundry detergent that's enhanced with active oxygen bleach to disinfect, remove stains and bleach clothing without damaging fabrics or fading color. According to Uribe, this adored pink tub is much different from similarly marketed American formulas like OxiClean, namely because it's less harsh and promotes greater softness. "I was surprised at how fresh our belongings looked and felt, minus that chemical-y smell and rough hand-feel that I often find traditional American laundry detergents can leave behind," Uribe wrote, while her partner believes it's thanks to European detergents like Vanish that keep her clothes lasting longer.$21 at Amazon9AmazonA cost-cutting and multi-purpose laundry bar that went viral a few years agoAlthough Fels-Naptha has been around since 1894, this versatile laundry bar went viral on TikTok a few years ago for its incredible ability to remove old, difficult stains, perspiration, and oil marks from clothing and other soft surfaces. Made of a blend of animal fats and coconut oil, the Fels-Naptha bar works as a pre-treatment for clothing that's been marred with sweat stains, blood, grass stains, and grease. You can also make your own budget-friendly and highly effective laundry detergent by combining a grated Fels-Naptha bar, which smells like fresh linen, with Borax and baking soda. One TikTok user claimed that this concoction costs her a fraction of the cost of normal gallon detergents and lasts much longer.2-pack: $8 at Amazon1-pack: $2 at WalmartAdvertisement
10AmazonA German professional color detergent powderLast year, HuffPost shopping writer Griff Wynne shared yet another one of their laundry soap experiences with one captivating detergent powder that you won't find on the shelves of your local Target or Walmart. Persil is a German-made soap that Wynne swears makes fabrics the softest and freshest-smelling yet, and you can buy it at Amazon in bulk with enough powder to last you at least 130 loads. Ideal for all colored clothing and fabrics, Griff said this professional-grade detergent "penetrates your fabric to get rid of tough stains while still keeping your clothes looking crisp, even after many washes. The formula also works to keep your washing machine clean and fresh as it cleans your clothes." $89 at Amazon11AmazonA rolling laundry organizerKeeping organized can make laundry day just a tad bit easier, and this sleek rolling hamper may be just the ticket. Made with a durable steel frame, this cart has four individual fabric bags capable of holding 11 gallons each, so all your to-be-washed items have a designated place. The rolling casters also have brakes, allowing you to move your sleek hamper at will or keep it firmly in one place.$37 at Amazon12AmazonA specialty laundry soap for cashmere, wool and knitsSome luxury fabrics require equally luxurious washing solutions, and The Laundress brand is a recognized name in opulent laundering. This specially formulated "shampoo" is made to gently clean all your delicate knits from pricy cashmeres to merino wools to fluffy mohair. Made with bio-based ingredients, it has a soft, woodsy fragrance and is double-concentrated, so just one bottle contains enough soap to do 31 loads of laundry. The brand suggests purchasing The Laundress measuring cap for precise pouring.$30 at Amazon$30 at The LaundressAdvertisement
13AmazonMrs. Stewart's Liquid Bluing, a bleach-free alternative to whitening fabricsIf you've ever wanted to get your whites bright and refresh clothing that's gone dingy or yellowed — without the risks associated with bleach — Mrs. Stewart's Liquid Bluing has been a trusted bleach-free alternative since 1883. This laundry additive essentially uses its blue hue to “tone” white fabrics, in the same way you might use a toner to neutralize brassy hues in blonde hair. Just be sure to follow directions and dilute the liquid properly before adding it to your load of laundry.$6 at Amazon14AmazonA pair of clever attachments that stop your bedding from wadding up in the dryerHave you ever pulled sheets from the dryer only to find them in a tangled, knotted nest that's partially damp in some spots and dry in others? These attachments, which work for both the washing machine and the dryer, stay fixed on the corners of your fitted and flat sheets to help them dry faster and with fewer wrinkles. (Please note that these shouldn't be used with rayon or bamboo sheets.)$20 at AmazonRelatedshoppinghomeCleaninglaundryThis 'Messy Eater' Stain Remover Isn't Just For Kids — Reviewers Call It 'Witchcraft'The Best Stain Remover You'll Ever Use Is Less Than $3These Vintage Cleaning Products Are Still The Best For Getting Things SpotlessYou’ll Never Do Laundry The Old Way Again After Trying These 14 Items Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
