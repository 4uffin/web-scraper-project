But in the frame reserved for a photo of former President Biden appeared an image of an autopen, referring to Trump’s claims the mechanical tool was used excessively throughout Biden’s administration without the then-president’s knowledge. Biden has dismissed Trump’s claim. Trump himself has had papers signed on his behalf with the pen.The Presidential Walk of Fame has arrived on the West Wing Colonnade Wait for it… 🖊️👀 pic.twitter.com/ApWfdxfFQa— Margo Martin (@MargoMartin47) September 24, 2025Critics piled on over the stunt.One suggested there should be a wall featuring memes of Vice President JD Vance. Others swapped out Trump’s portraits for an old image of him with his onetime buddy Epstein. Some just reminded how Biden beat Trump in the 2020 election.Advertisement
Trump teased the autopen troll during an interview with The Daily Caller’s Reagan Reese that published earlier this month, during which he also mocked Biden’s cancer diagnosis.🚨BREAKING: The White House has placed a photo of an auto-pen instead of a portrait of former President Biden on the “Presidential Walk of Fame”This is the most immature and stupid presidential administration in history.

Grow the fuck up.— Jo (@JoJoFromJerz) September 24, 2025I have to admit:I am impressed by his ability and determination to always find a way to be an even shittier human being than he has ever been beforeEspecially since he is sticking his name on the projects that President Biden started with his Infrastructure Bill— Linda (@Linda71082464) September 24, 2025How insecure and broken of a man do you have to be to do this? I would NEVER let anyone I was jealous of see me sweat like this 😭😭— Politics x Pop (@PoliticsxPop) September 24, 2025Advertisement
Instead of former President Biden’s portrait, the White House display on the “Presidential Walk of Fame” now shows a photo of his autopen signature. Pathetic
pic.twitter.com/SO4UwdHpaN— Republicans against Trump (@RpsAgainstTrump) September 24, 2025This blurs a critical line. The presidency demands a certain gravitas, and these stunts can feel more like a campaign rally than sober governance. It seems to prioritize spectacle over substance every single time.— Gelson Luz (@gelsonluz) September 24, 2025So haunted by the ghost of a real presidency they can't even look at a portrait. The pettiness is monumental, but the insecurity is even bigger.— Rahul Mani (@1RahulMani) September 24, 2025Advertisement
Sick. Anti American https://t.co/Peg5peo7pg— ALASTAIR CAMPBELL (@campbellclaret) September 24, 2025The Presidency and the White House (“The People’s House”) should not be a vehicle for your 5th grade-level sense of humor. I know you are appealing to MAGA, but you are accountable to the whole country, not just the 23% who voted for Trump.— Gulliver Gadfly (@GulliverGadfly) September 24, 2025Goes to show you the maturity level of this administration. If you hire clowns, expect a circus.— JohnnyVomits (@JohnnyVomits) September 24, 2025Advertisement
The “Presidential Walk of Fame” is supposed to honor history. Instead, Trump turns it into a middle school prank wall. This is how unserious and insecure he is — mocking Biden with an auto-pen while the world laughs at America. https://t.co/zzweFJ5XIb— Victorola (@Victorola799) September 24, 2025Absolutely pathetic and juvenile behaviour. Decorum, please, I beg of you. https://t.co/oXXxQk2v12— Rachel Moiselle (@RachelMoiselle) September 24, 2025An 80 year old troll. That's who we have leading the country. An immature, 80 year old pumpkin-like troll.— Milenka~ (@MilenaAmit) September 24, 2025Advertisement
Don't ever wonder why so many Americans feel the way they do about Trump when he is constantly doing childish and despicable stunts like this, just to divide America even more.The truth is, Joe Biden beat him and will always be remembered as a better person and president.— Chris D. Jackson (@ChrisDJackson) September 24, 2025I'd be embarrassed if I lost to an auto-pen but I guess Trump is built different https://t.co/wghgmoCYfJ— Ari Drennen (@AriDrennen) September 24, 2025TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
