Smith Names Two Democrats He Wants To Run In 2028The radio host called one of the possible presidential candidates “the real deal.”By Jazmin TolliverTrends Reporter, HuffPostSep 25, 2025, 08:27 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGStephen A. Smith revealed the top two Democratic picks he’d like to see go up against the Republicans in the 2028 presidential election, dropping the names of those prospects during Thursday’s episode of his SiriusXM radio show, “Straight Shooter.” A caller from Wisconsin said he was “not totally sold” on the idea of California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) entering the race. However, Newsom has not formally announced a 2028 run. Advertisement
“You shouldn’t be. You shouldn’t be,” Smith said. “Let me tell you something right now: First of all, I’ve got two candidates for you. They’re two of my favorites. Now, I’m not telling you to vote as I vote. I’m just being honest and open with you about who are my two favorite candidates, OK?”Then came Smith’s picks.“I love Gov. Josh Shapiro from Pennsylvania and Gov. Wes Moore from Maryland,” he said. “Those are my two and not necessarily in that order.”Calling Moore “the real deal,” the sports commentator told the caller that the Maryland politician is someone to watch with intent.Advertisement
“Gov. Wes Moore is the real deal. Make no mistake about it, I doubt he’ll run, but he is the real deal. When you talk about somebody that can walk and communicate ... across the aisle and fixated on getting things done, Wes Moore is somebody that I would strongly, strongly advise you not to ignore,” Smith continued. “You better pay attention to this man.”Moore revealed earlier this month to NBC News’ Kristen Welker that he has no plans to run for president in 2028. Smith, who has floated his own potential run before, went on to praise Newsom for having what he deemed to be the qualities of a presidential candidate. Advertisement
“He looks so presidential, right? And Gavin Newsom is smart, he’s articulate, he’s bright, he’s very polished, and he could debate with the best of them,” he said. Smith then noted that Newsom’s representation of California could pose an obstacle due to the issues the Golden State is battling, including a homelessness crisis and affordability issues.
