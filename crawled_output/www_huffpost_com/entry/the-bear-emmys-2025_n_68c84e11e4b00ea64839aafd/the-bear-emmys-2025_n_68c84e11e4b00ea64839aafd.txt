EvansSenior Culture Editor, HuffPostSep 15, 2025, 02:10 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGOn Sunday night, there was a new comedy in town to nab a ton of Emmys Awards.Apple TV+’s “The Studio,” a new Seth Rogen-led series which hilariously mocks Hollywood’s film industry, broke an Emmy-winning record previously set by FX’s “The Bear.” “The Studio” won 13 awards Sunday, blasting past the mark set by “The Bear” for its second season, when it won 11 Emmys.After years of fans and critics of the series shouting about “The Bear” committing category fraud, it seems Emmys voters have finally listened. For the first time in what feels like forever, the FX kitchen series didn’t dominate the comedy categories Sunday night. In fact, quite the opposite happened, as “The Studio” and “Hacks” divvied up the awards, and rightfully so.Advertisement
In the end, “The Bear” ended up missing out on all 13 of its nominations, including Outstanding Comedy Series.Jeremy Allen White in "The Bear."FXHere’s what we said about the losses on Sunday night:I can’t say I’m not thrilled about the outcome. Don’t get me wrong, I love “The Bear,” but perhaps this sweep by “The Studio” will teach the show to start submitting for a more appropriate category moving forward, aka drama, where it belongs!

I will say it does suck that the “Napkins” episode, directed by Ayo Edebiri, lost because that was a brilliant episode of television. And considering that “The Bear” actually dialed up the comedy this most recent season, it’ll be interesting to see where it gets nominated next year. Either way, a lesson was learned tonight. — NjeraWhat I’ve also had to remind myself is that this Emmy season, it was Season 3 that was up for nominations. It was an overall lackluster season — aside from that “Napkins” episode that Edebiri directed. Season 4 fared way better in my book, so there’s always next year’s Emmy ceremony for the show. Here’s hoping that FX and the show’s creators and producers decide to put it up for the Drama categories. PLEASE, chef! — ErinAdvertisement
People on X, formerly Twitter, also had a lot to say about “The Bear” not winning any awards on Sunday night.The White Lotus and the Bear going home empty handed made me genuinely so happy #Emmys— Sean #BB27 (@sean2637) September 15, 2025how it feels to have an emmys without the bear winning exclusively via category fraud pic.twitter.com/yCLMmX3owU— Liam (@YJBli) September 15, 2025Advertisement
