Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). A video posted Thursday on the social media platform showed Schiff accusing Patel of being “incompetent,” and “firing all the competent people” before remarking, “How can you respect someone like Patel? ... You can take an internet troll and make him FBI director, but he’s still not gonna be anything more than an internet troll.”Advertisement
Although Patel could have responded to the video by explaining why he’s not as incompetent as Schiff claimed ― or not responded at all (that’s a thing too) — he decided the best plan of action was a weird combination of being insulting AND cryptic.And, yes, he responded by posting a watermelon emoji 12 times.🍉🍉🍉 🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉 https://t.co/UOYAqdlnbb— FBI Director Kash Patel (@FBIDirectorKash) September 18, 2025Apparently, Patel’s use of a watermelon was a call back to April, when his fearless leader, Donald Trump, referred to Schiff as “watermelon head.” Advertisement
During a black-tie event for Republicans, Trump lashed out at Schiff by saying, “He’s got the smallest neck I’ve ever seen — and the biggest head. We call him Watermelon Head.”The insult may have stuck around in the hallowed halls of MAGAdom, but, frankly, many people on X didn’t understand Patel’s reference. As a result, Grok, the social media platform’s AI bot, kept getting asked to explain Patel’s post.Watermelon?I don’t speak FBI. What does this mean?— Matt Crossette (@mattcrossette) September 18, 2025Advertisement
Some people wondered if Patel was making a reference to Gaza, where the watermelon has become a sign of solidarity with Palestinians.Watermelon ? As in Gaza ? As in free Palestine. Remove this man’s passport immediately and sent him back to wherever he came. He’s obviously very antisemitic.Kash Patel is Hitler— Happy Man (@HaavaraAgree) September 18, 2025Others quickly recognized Patel was just being a dick.So your reply is to be an internet troll. What a sad loser you are. Go back to making fashy memes and save us all your bullshit. pic.twitter.com/eMwSOpFUQ6— Fred Wellman (@FPWellman) September 18, 2025Advertisement
Adam Schiff correctly criticizes Trump's FBI director, Kash Patel, as "an Internet troll."So Patel proves it by replying with some watermelon emojis, because MAGA trolls call Schiff "Watermelon Head."Does any sane person think this is appropriate behavior for an FBI chief? pic.twitter.com/RorgNhQxAH— News Corpse (@NewsCorpse) September 18, 2025Very mature post from the FBI Director @FBIDirectorKash This you by the way? 👇🏻RESIGN! pic.twitter.com/ACk80udSeU— ZZZ (@AskMeLaterOn) September 18, 2025Not a serious nation.

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) got into a shouting match at a Senate committee hearing over the FBI director’s handling of the Charlie Kirk assassination. Patel also dubiously claimed there is “no credible information” that the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein trafficked young women to anyone but himself.He also avoided answering California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell’s questions about the Trump administration’s lack of transparency over the Epstein files and claimed to be unaware of Dylan Roof, a white supremacist and mass shooter who killed nine Black people at a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015.Advertisement
