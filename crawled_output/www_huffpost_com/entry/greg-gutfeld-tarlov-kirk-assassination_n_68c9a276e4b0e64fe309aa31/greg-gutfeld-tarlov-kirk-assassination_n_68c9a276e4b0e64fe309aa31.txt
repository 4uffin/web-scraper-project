Melissa Hortman.By CorEy TownsendSep 16, 2025, 03:12 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGFox News host Greg Gutfeld had a few choice words for his co-host, political consultant Jessica Tarlov, after the two came to an impasse regarding political violence amid the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk.During Monday’s episode of “The Five,” the roundtable of guests, including Tarlov and Gutfeld, were discussing the suspected killer in the death of Kirk. Tarlov, who is the more liberal leaning member of the group, brought up the shooting death of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman (D). She emphasized the need for “more information” before you “smear” the name of the shooter. Advertisement
“We don’t need more information,” Gutfeld responded. “What is interesting here is why is only this happening on the left and not the right? That’s all we need to know.”Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld explodes on co-host political consultant Jessica Tarlov on Monday, Sept. 15, 2025, episode of "The Five."Fox News“You want to talk about Melissa Hortman?” he replied. “Did you know her name before it happened? None of us did. None of us were spending every single day talking about Mrs. Hortman. I never heard about her until she died.” Advertisement
Tarlov responded: “So she doesn’t matter?”Gutfeld promptly hit back with an expletive-laced snipe.“Don’t play that bullshit with me,” he said. “What I’m saying is there was no demonization, amplification about that woman before she died. It was a specific crime against her by someone who knew her.” He went on to argue that the “both sides argument” regarding the left and the right, “doesn’t fly” and that those on the right “don’t care.”TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
