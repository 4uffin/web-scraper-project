After Kirk’s fatal shooting at Utah Valley University last week, some of Kirk’s supporters went online to share photos of their Starbucks order, a mint majesty tea with two honeys. The conservative podcaster had said he drank “like nine of them a day” to keep from losing his voice.Advertisement
Fox News even posted about an online petition urging Starbucks to memorialize Kirk’s legacy by naming the drink after him.The trend gained even more visibility via a TikTok video of a customer trying get a Starbucks barista to write Charlie Kirk’s name on her cup. In the video, the barista tells the customer they “can’t do political names.”Advertisement
@valerielewis292 Today my husband walked into this Starbucks to order Charlie Kirk's drink, when they asked for his name he said "Charlie Kirk" she said, "pick another name" he asked why? she said "we don't do politics here" my husband didn't mention anything political, it was Charlie Kirk's name. She refused to write the name or say it. The barista walked over to my husband and handed him the drinks instead of using the name "Charlie" She is the one who brought up "politics" if she would have said "okay' then written the name, no politics would have been mentioned. I went in a few hours later.... here's the video 📷

“We can’t do political names, but it didn’t even ask for a name to begin with, so it’s going to be $3.75, OK?” the barista told the TikTok user, who kept asking for Kirk’s name to be written on the cup.The video gained viral attention, with some viewers mocking the customer and others expressing outrage that the barista wouldn’t write the name on the cup. Those outraged included former New York City Mayor Giuliani, who called Starbucks a “Marxist, anti-American company.”Advertisement

And when a customer wants to use a different name — including the name Charlie Kirk — when ordering their drink in our café, we aim to respect their preference,” Starbucks said in a follow-up statement.Advertisement
