(Watch the video below.)Advertisement
“First of all, I definitely don’t think that the government should be involved — ever — in dictating what a comedian can or cannot say in a monologue, that’s fucking crazy,” Rogan said on “The Joe Rogan Experience,” posted Tuesday.Rogan added that “people on the right” are “crazy for supporting this, because this will be used on you.”“You don’t think that the fucking globalist lizard people who run the world are sitting here going: ‘Great, what do we got — three years? We’ll wait this out. We’ll wait this out. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let them say the government should be involved in censoring people’s speech.’”Advertisement
Trump not only celebrated Kimmel’s suspension after years of griping about his monologue disses ― he claimed Kimmel’s cracks about him were illegal.On his show, which appeared to be recorded before Kimmel’s reinstatement, Rogan correctly predicted that Kimmel would return after a short suspension and that Trump would tweet “mean shit about him.”“I think that is also fucking insane. ... How do you have time while you’re running the world to be tweeting that you don’t like talk show hosts?” Rogan asked.Advertisement
Rogan said that although Kimmel’s suspension-provoking comment about Charlie Kirk’s alleged killer “wasn’t accurate,” it “wasn’t bad” and it set up a “very funny” joke. Rogan’s endorsement of Trump perhaps helped him gain a second term, but lately the podcaster has disagreed with the president. The host criticized him multiple times over the Jeffrey Epstein files and dismissed his ad nauseam lie that the 2020 election was stolen.Fast-forward to 18:00 for the bulk of Rogan’s comments about Kimmel:Advertisement
