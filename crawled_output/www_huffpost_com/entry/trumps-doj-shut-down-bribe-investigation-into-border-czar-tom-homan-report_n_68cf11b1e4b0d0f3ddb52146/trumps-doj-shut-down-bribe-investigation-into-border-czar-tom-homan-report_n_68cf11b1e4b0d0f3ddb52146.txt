More from MSNBC:The federal investigation was launched in western Texas in the summer of 2024 after a subject in a separate investigation claimed Homan was soliciting payments in exchange for awarding contracts should Trump win the presidential election, according to an internal Justice Department summary of the probe reviewed by MSNBC and people familiar with the case. The U.S. Attorney’s office in the Western District of Texas, working with the FBI, asked the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section to join its ongoing probe “into the Border Czar and former Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Tom Homan and others based on evidence of payment from FBI undercover agents in exchange for facilitating future contracts related to border enforcement.”The investigation into Homan stalled after Trump became president in January, sources told the network. And in recent weeks, Trump appointees officially closed the investigation after FBI Director Kash Patel requested a status update on the case, two sources told MSNBC.In a statement to MSNBC, Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the allegations against Homan were “subjected to a full review by FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors.”Advertisement
“They found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing,” the statement added. “The Department’s resources must remain focused on real threats to the American people, not baseless investigations. As a result, the investigation has been closed.”Read the full report at MSNBC.RelatedImmigrationFBIJustice DepartmentGavin Newsom’s Taunt Gets In The Face Of Trump Border Czar Over Mask RefusalTrump's Border Czar Denies Allegations Of 'Quid Pro Quo' With Eric AdamsTrump ‘Border Czar’ Threatens States Not Willing To ‘Cooperate’ On Deportations Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
