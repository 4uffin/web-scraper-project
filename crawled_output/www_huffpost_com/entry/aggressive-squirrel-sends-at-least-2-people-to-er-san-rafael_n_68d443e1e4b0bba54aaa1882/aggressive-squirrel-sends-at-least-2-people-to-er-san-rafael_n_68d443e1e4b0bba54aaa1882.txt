“It clamped onto my leg. The tail was flying up here. I was like, ‘Get it off me, get off me!’,” Heblack said.Isabel Campoy also said she was attacked while walking in the same area. The squirrel launched itself from the ground to her face and wound up on her arm, leaving it bloody, she said.Both women went to the emergency room, the TV station reported in its Monday story.Flyers have now been posted, warning residents that the squirrel is no joke and that more than five people have been attacked by a ”very mean squirrel” that “comes out of nowhere.”Advertisement
Vanessa Potter of WildCare, a wildlife rescue organization in San Rafael, told KGO-TV that the aggressive behavior likely comes from the squirrel being fed and cared for by humans when it was a baby.She said squirrels are not vectors for rabies. Experts say the public should not feed wild animals.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
