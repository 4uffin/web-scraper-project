Kathy Hochul endorsed Democratic socialist and New York City mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani. (Watch his analysis below).“The fact is, socialism is not a four-letter word in Democratic primaries, not among Democratic voters. It’s a five-letter word in the minds of a lot of Democrats. That five-letter word being great,” he told CNN’s John Berman.Advertisement
Enten turned to Gallup polling, showing the net popularity of socialism (the percentage who view it positively minus the percentage who view it negatively) among Democrats, which shot “up like a rocket” from +7 in 2010 to +36 today.His findings arrive months after a shocking primary win by Mamdani, who holds a massive lead in general election polling, over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani has championed several progressive causes, including a push for free city buses, free child care and city-run grocery stores.Advertisement
Hochul — who for months has declined to endorse Mamdani, a progressive who has alienated moderates with his sharp criticism of Israel and plans for policing — wrote in a New York Times op-ed that while the two didn’t align on “every issue” following their talks, she’s looking for the next mayor to not “surrender” to President Donald Trump.“The bottom line is socialism isn’t a dirty word among Democrats at this particular point. It’s actually a word that, when attached, Democrats seem to like it,” Enten said.He noted that the net popularity of capitalism, meanwhile, has fallen “through the floor” among Democrats, dropping from +8 in 2010 to -13 this year.Advertisement
He emphasized that a “danger” remains for Democrats as socialism might be at play in their primaries, but doesn’t play in the general electorate.Gallup polling shows the net popularity of capitalism among all adults has reached +12. At the same time, socialism is “way, way, way underwater” at -18, Enten said before adding, “Republicans are salivating at the idea that they can run against a Democratic socialist being the mayor of New York City.” TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
