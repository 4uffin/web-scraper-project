It's available in oversized and standard models, all with a built-in hanging loop, fade-resistant coloring and Okeo-Tex certification. The standard size also comes in white.Promising reviews: "I love how the towels are so soft & fluffy. As a big girl, I appreciate the bath sheet being big enough to wrap around me." — Tabby"I really love these towels. I have a hard time finding new towels that aren’t soooo soft - I want there to be some texture to my towels! These are perfect. They feel great, they are HUGE, and the little loop to hang them by is surprisingly a game changer. The day I got them I washed them twice (once with vinegar and once with detergent) and dried twice to make sure to get any new fuzzies off and have never had any transfer to my skin after that. These will be my staple towels from here on out." — ChelseaFStandard: $10 at TargetOversized: $15 at Target3TargetA breathable, antimicrobial version (with a signature hanging loop)Reviewers say "everyone compliments how soft" these Total Fresh antimicrobial Threshold towels are.Each one is made with 100% cotton for maximum absorbency, so your towel will feel comfy and dry post-shower — even if you take your time getting ready or sipping coffee.It's available in an oversized and standard option; the standard comes in tan, white and dark gray.Promising review: "Great quality and so soft!!! These will survive washes and still maintain that softness!" — Lady L"I never write product reviews, but these towels have immediately solved my Stinky Husband Towel problem and I had to share the good news. I have no idea why, but my husband’s bath towels always smell HORRIBLE. They’ll stink up the whole bathroom! We were washing towels like crazy and the bathroom still always smelled, and we couldn’t figure out why they stunk and why it was just his towels. I thought I’d give these a try and there was an immediate difference. No odor. At all. Amazing!!!! Thank you magic anti-stink towels!" — AlOversized Orange: $14 at TargetOversized Dark Gray: $14 at TargetAdvertisement
4TargetA luxurious quick-dry set"Amazingly soft" and ribbed for some delightful extra texture, this towel set will add a pop of simple style to your bathroom decor. Plus, the pack's all-cotton design is super-absorbent while being gentle on the skin.You can grab it in a two-pack (with two bath towels) or a four-pack (with two bath towels and two hand towels).Promising review: "This is the best towel I have ever had. I’ve gone back and purchased several more. Have about 2 dozen of these bath towels, as we have a large family. I have the white, so I can’t comment on the other colors. Best advice. Don’t let the initial shedding deter you. I was shocked by how much they shedded at first. Far worse than any other towel I’ve had. The label even said low lint which was weird. Therefore I was going to return, but so glad I didn’t! Because after a few washings, they are fine! Just get through that, and you will have the nicest towels you’ll ever have! My whole family loves them. Every time I shower, I look forward to using the towel :) it just feels luxurious. Also, they dry really nicely in the washer. The first couple times you wash, they shed A LOT. After that, the shedding lessens each time . Then shortly after that, you are good. It doesn’t take that long. Maybe 5-6 washings? I have paid 3x as much for towels that are not nearly as nice. These are a great price, excellent quality, and feel much more expensive than they are! I also bought the matching hand towels and washcloths. Also love them!" — Ocean2-Pack Black: $14 at TargetAdvertisement
