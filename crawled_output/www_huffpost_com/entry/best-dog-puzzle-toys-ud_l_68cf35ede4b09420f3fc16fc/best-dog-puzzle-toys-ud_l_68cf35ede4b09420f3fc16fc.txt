Yet, even the dogs with the best behavior can have trouble pacing themselves as they eat.If your pup tends to eat too quickly, is naughty at times or is a little on the nervous side, vets say that food-dispensing toys can be a good solution for both their tummies and brains.

“Slow feeders are beneficial for both the mental and physical health of dogs,” Dr. Carly Fox, senior veterinarian with the emergency and critical care service at the Schwarzman Animal Medical Center in New York City, told HuffPost.“Daily use of puzzle toys can help stimulate a dog’s mind by challenging them to solve problems. This can help a dog’s cognitive abilities, including memory and patience.”Dogs that frequently solve puzzles are often less bored and can have less anxiety, she said.Dr. Lisa Chimes, emergency veterinarian at Australia’s Small Animal Specialist Hospital and founder of pet care company Dog by Dr. Lisa, says these types of toys, also known as “enrichment toys” or “boredom busters,” are meant to exercise your dog’s brain.Advertisement
“Puzzle toys allow dogs to use their senses, particularly their super-powered nose, while also encouraging them to problem solve, which works the brain in a similar way to a human doing puzzles and quizzes,” Chimes told HuffPost. “Any activity that encourages dogs to use their sense of smell will provide them with environmental stimulation, learning and problem-solving opportunities.” Dr. Antonio DeMarco, chief medical and mentorship officer at GoodVets, noted that mental stimulation is just as important as physical exercise for dogs.“Many bad behaviors that dogs develop come from boredom and lack of proper mental and physical stimulation,” DeMarco told HuffPost. “Feeder or puzzle toys are great at allowing them to use their brain to solve problems and [get] a reward.” Advertisement
All three experts agreed that feeder toys and puzzles can also be a good option for dogs that eat too quickly, as the toys generally prevent choking, bloating and overeating. (However, if your dog is in its golden years, dealing with dental issues or struggles to eat enough, you may want to skip them.)If you’re looking to keep your furry friend engaged and entertained, this selection of treat toys deserves two paws up. 1AmazonA "Hide N' Slide" feeding puzzle"As your dog gets better at solving puzzles, they may develop better learning skills, which can be thought of as an improvement in their intelligence," Fox said. When it comes to puzzles, Fox personally recommends this swivel toy from Outward Hound. It features a non-slip base to keep it from sliding around and weighs two pounds, so it's not flimsy. The brand calls this a "level 2" toy, meant for intermediate leaners. Peep their chart to see what's the best fit for your dog. Promising review: "My lab puppy loves it. She uses it for treats and often times if she won’t finish her meal I put the remainder in the hide & seek and she enjoys eating it." — Dee$12 at Amazon2AmazonA multi-step puzzle feederAnother popular puzzle-style dispenser, we love is this three-in-one set that works as a toy, slow feeder and a basic dog bowl. Introduce this gadget as a beginner puzzle by having your pup nudge the lids with their nose. Then make it more challenging by having your dog use their paws to push the center down. To use it as a slow feeder, just remove the plastic cover. If you take out the inner divider, you can use it as a bowl. That's three tools in one so your pup gets to enjoy tons of fun — and food! Promising review: "It slows down his eating and calms him down after having to use his brain. Keeps him from wanting to get into trouble!" — Kenneth J Leidner$25 at Amazon3AmazonA snuffle matBoth Fox and Chimes recommend snuffle mats, fabric pads made with soft strips meant to obscure food and treats. While there are certainly tons of options on the market, Fox recommends this specific mat, which measures 21 inches by 17 inches with 2-inch strips and a 1-inch edge, to keep everything in. Simply sprinkle in dry food bits or little treats and watch your dog use their nose to find it all. Promising review: "My puppy's favorite place to be. Was a bit skeptical, but thought it looked like it might keep him challenged and help stimulate his mind a bit. Well, yes, he loves to hunt for treats, but it's also is favorite place to lay, play and sleep on. It's pretty unique and I can see why he loves it. Did I also mention that his sharp teeth have not destroyed it. It shows no signs of tears or teeth marks. Don't know what it's made out of but it sure is durable. I'm buying a second one for when I take him to work!" — Jeff$27 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonA Woof "Pupsicle" kitDr. Fox also recommends this "Pupsicle" interactive toy that uses frozen homemade pellets or the brand's refill pops inside a durable ball. This set comes with the ball, a refillable tray and a pack of seven pre-made treat balls to keep your four-legged friend active. Freeze wet food, broth, yogurt, peanut butter or dog treats in the mold to ensure your dog is getting all the nutrients they need. Promising review: "This is such a convenient system. We freeze the treats so they'll last longer for our dog. The container is high-quality construction and easy to open (for humans, not dogs). Our dog loves the treats and it keeps her entertained while we're gone. Love this system!" — Chad$45 at Amazon$55 at WoofAdvertisement
5AmazonA lick-mat for wet food"Since slow feeders are used with dry kibble, any dog on wet food can consider a lick mat, which still provides some of the benefits of a slow feeder," Fox said. Though she didn't give a specific option, we love this highly-rated, budget-friendly lick mat that measures about 8" by 8". With over 10,000 5-star ratings, it comes in three different pressed patterns, each in a fun bright color of blue, green or orange. Promising review: "These lickimats are the best. They have been so helpful to provide enrichment for my two pups. Especially in the summer months when it is often too hot for us to go outside. It is so easy to spread whatever smear of choice. They don't take a lot of space up in the freezer either! It is nice the 2 packs comes with different levels of difficulty for how easy it is to lick the smear off. I would buy these again in a heart beat." — Mark Michel$9 at Amazon$9 at Chewy6FableThe Fable PuffinFable, a small business whose dog products that look like they belong in a modern art museum, is here for all your aesthetic pup needs. Fox recommends the brand's Puffin toy, which slowly dispenses dry food or treats. The brand said the toy is meant to "mimic the experience of hunting prey" and it's dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning. As it's not meant to be intensively chewed on, it may not be for every dog, but it comes in a bunch of great colors for the pups that do love it. Promising review: "Our dog Clementine absolutely loves this game and goes crazy for it when her food is inside. She bonks it, wags her tail ferociously and bounces all around until she gets the treats inside! I would recommend this to anyone with a pooch!" — Jane W.$80 at FableAdvertisement
7AmazonA Kong wobbling food dispenserGrowing up, I remember my parents filling up a Kong toy with peanut butter for my childhood dog Buddie. She's looking over us in doggie heaven now, and I imagine she was very excited when Fox recommended the Kong. It's a classic slow feeder that you've likely seen in the pet store, and this newer model even twists open so it's easy to fill and clean. Promising review: "Our pup loves it! I bought the smaller one for our smaller dog. Great distraction, and you can buy Kong brand fillers or something you already have in your kitchen. Very sturdy" — G$25 at Amazon$25 at Chewy8AmazonA maze-like dog bowl"We personally use the puzzle bowl feeders for our three dogs when eating," DeMarco said. "They look like a labyrinth and ensure our dogs eat significantly slower, making it safer for them." While DeMarco didn't recommend a specific puzzle bowl, we like this budget-friendly option with thousands of 5-star reviews. It comes in a variety of sizes, patterns and colors, works for wet and dry food and can go in the dishwasher. Promising review: "This bowl works perfectly for my Goldendoodle. We got him as a puppy and I realized very quickly that he loves to scarf his food. I've had Labradors before and it seems it's some kind of large breed/retriever trend lol. Sadly, I had a Lab pass many years ago due to a flipped stomach from eating too quickly so I wasn't ready to risk it again.We bought this bowl and it has been a huge lifesaver I believe. It holds about 2 cups I think full. Basically we just scoop the bowl in to the food bin and fill it up for him. He has been using it since about 2 months old and is now 10months old. His eating has dramatically slowed down naturally. At first it irritated him and took a few feedings to get used to. It washed great in the dishwasher which is awesome because the amount of funky slobber from him tracking all the food bits down is so gross. They are super durable and seem to be standing the test of time." — L. Van B.$8 at Amazon$7 at Chewy9AmazonA multi-layer puzzle toyFor triple the puzzle fun, this slow feeder has three spinning layers. It's freezer-safe, so you can put treats and water in the sections and give your pup a chilly treat on a hot day. You can also use it for wet or dry food and treats to keep your pup engaged and eating slowly. Promising review: "Easy to load, comes apart for cleaning, entertaining for my boy, very sturdy, worth it!" — Snug Pod Farmstead$20 at ChewyAdvertisement
10AmazonA pair of interactive treat ballsMake slow feeding feel extra fun with a pair of fillable, durable balls. They also work as teething toys and for playing fetch. Promising review: "My puppy absolutely loves these, especially the one with the little teeth! We smush semi soft toys in or banana and freeze it and it occupies her for hours -- and she's a high energy breed and a beast to keep entertained!!" — Melissa Bornstein$9 at Amazon$11 at ChewyRelatedshoppingDogs PetsEach Of These Dog Products Has Over 15,000 5-Star RatingsThis $11 Dog Toy Got Me Through The Chaos Of My Golden Retriever's PuppyhoodPet Owners With Big Dogs Swear By These 26 Useful ProductsThese Toys Can Actually Improve Your Dog's Cognitive Abilities, According To Vets Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
