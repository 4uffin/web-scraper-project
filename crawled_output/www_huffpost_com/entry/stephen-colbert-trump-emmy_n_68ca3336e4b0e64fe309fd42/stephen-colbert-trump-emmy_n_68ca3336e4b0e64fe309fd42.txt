If there’s anything on TV that the president dislikes more than late night shows, it’s probably award shows. He’s complained about most of them ― especially when they make jokes about him ― and has nursed a long-running grievance about the Emmys specifically. Trump has complained that he never won one for this show “The Apprentice,” and has publicly griped that he should have won the award “many times over,” that he got “screwed” out of the award, and that the ceremony has “no credibility.” Advertisement
