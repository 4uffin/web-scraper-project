She then asked the Oscar winner, ”What are you afraid of at this present moment as an artist and as an American in regards to the U.S.?”The question was an oblique reference to ABC suspending Jimmy Kimmel after comments he made after the assassination of far-right activist Charlie Kirk inspired threats of penalties from Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr.Jolie, who was promoting her latest film, “Couture,” took her time to respond to what she said was “obviously a very difficult question,” but stressed, “I love my country ... but I don’t, at this time, recognize my country.”Advertisement
She then emphasized that she’s always had a broad worldview.“I’ve always lived internationally, I’ve always, my family’s international, my friends, my life, my world view is equal, united, international,” Jolie said. “So anything, anywhere that divides or, of course, limits personal expressions and freedoms and, from anyone, I think is very dangerous.”Jolie also said the tenor of the times requires people to be intentional about what they say and the possible effect of their words.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

So I’ll be careful during a press conference, but to say that, of course, like all of you and everyone watching them, you know,” she said. “These are very, very heavy times we’re all living in together.”Advertisement
