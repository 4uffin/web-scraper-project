The executive order is part of the administration’s wider push against diversity, equity and inclusion.The Washington Post was the first to report on the orders.A National Park Service spokesperson told the Post that materials that “disproportionately emphasize negative aspects” of U.S. history and fail to note “broader context” or “national progress” could “unintentionally distort understanding rather than enrich it.”The photo of the formerly enslaved man is known as “The Scourged Back.” The image features a man named Peter Gordon and shows his back heavily scarred from whippings. A reproduction of the photo was on display at Georgia’s Fort Pulaski National Monument, per The New York Times. Fort Pulaski was a former Confederate prison camp later taken over by the Union Army.Advertisement
The photo — a copy of which is in the National Gallery of Art’s collection in Washington, D.C. — was used to advance the abolitionist movement in the 19th century. The photo of formerly enslaved man Peter Gordon is known as “The Scourged Back" and shows his back heavily scarred from whippings. Gordon is known to have escaped from Mississippi and reached a Union Army camp in Louisiana in 1863. The photograph is attributed to two photographers, McPherson and Oliver, who were in the camp at the time. It became one of the best-known photographs of the Civil War and a powerful weapon for abolitionists.

“Brought to you by the team that says education should be state and local,” he added.Materials have also been flagged for removal at sites including West Virginia’s Harpers Ferry National Historic Park, where John Brown attempted to lead a slave revolt in 1859, and the President’s House site in Philadelphia, where George Washington lived with several slaves.Tourists walk past a plaque near the Liberty Bell that discusses the Founding Fathers and their link to slavery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Exhibits and displays in Independence National Park are under review by the National Park Service in an initiative to eliminate materials deemed disparaging to the Founding Fathers or the legacy of the United States is part of an executive order issued by Donald Trump in March.

Brown believed that armed insurrection was the only way to end slavery in the United States and led a raid on the federal armory at Harpers Ferry that was intended to obtain weapons to begin an uprising against slavery in the southern states. Brown was captured after the raid, tried and hanged for treason. Print Collector via Print Collector/Getty ImagesAdvertisement
Books on slavery could also be barred at several parks sites in South Carolina, per South Carolina Public Radio. One book flagged for removal is “Shackles,” a children’s picture book by Marjory Wentworth, according to SCPR.Wentworth questioned how there could be “anything offensive” in her book, which is about her children finding shackles while digging for treasure at their home on Sullivan’s Island, where hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans passed through when brought to colonial America.Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.
