But they all lost to the lesser-known Jeff Hiller, who won the coveted award for his hilariously heartwarming performance in the HBO Max series, “Somebody Somewhere.” Advertisement

Upon hearing the veteran Upright Citizens Brigade comedian’s name as the winner, all three men appeared to be absolutely elated to lose to him. Coleman’s jaw dropped before he applauded enthusiastically. Urie beamed with happiness as his hands shot up with surprise. And Yang immediately jumped out of his seat excitedly in order to give his peer a standing ovation. Advertisement

But, much like his character Joel in “Somebody Somewhere,” Hiller eventually got his footing. After sharing a kiss with his husband, artist Neil Goldberg, he got up, shrugged to someone in the audience, and then proceeded to the stage with a look of disbelief and glee on his face.As he walked, Yang could be seen covering his cheeks with his hands and smiling. Urie looked especially moved by Hiller’s win — since he directed Hiller in an off-Broadway production of “Bright Colors and Bold Patterns” in 2018.Hiller’s shrug while he walked to the Emmys stage Sunday night.Christopher Polk via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
“I feel like I’m going to cry,” Hiller began his acceptance speech. “Because for the past 25 years, I’ve been like, ‘World! I want to be an actor!’ And the world’s like, ‘Mmm, maybe computers.’”After thanking HBO for “putting a show about sweaty middle-aged people” on the same network as “the sexy teens of ‘Euphoria,’” Hiller went on to encapsulate why “Somebody Somewhere” is so beloved.“Thank you to the Duplass brothers, Carolyn Strauss, Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen ― who wrote a show about connecting and love in this time when compassion is seen as a weakness,” Hiller said, citing producers and creators on the show.Advertisement
