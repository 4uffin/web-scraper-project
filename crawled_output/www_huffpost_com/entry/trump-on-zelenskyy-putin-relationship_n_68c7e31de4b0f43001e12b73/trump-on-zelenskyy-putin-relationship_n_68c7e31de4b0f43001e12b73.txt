(Watch video below.)Speaking to reporters in Morristown, New Jersey, Trump said he expected he would need to be involved in future negotiations between the two leaders given their extremely tense relationship.Advertisement
“The hatred between Zelensky and Putin is unfathomable,” Trump said. “I think I’m going to have to do all the talking. They hate each other. There will be talks, whether you call it a summit or just a get-together, it doesn’t matter.”“They hate each other so much they almost can’t talk,” he added. “They’re incapable of talking to each other.”Following his summit with Putin in Alaska in mid-August, Trump said he expected a meeting between the Russian leader and Zelenskyy to follow. However, Putin has not shown a serious willingness to sit down with his Ukrainian counterpart, repeatedly ignoring Trump’s deadlines for ending the war, and only floating what Ukraine described as an unacceptable proposal for the two of them to meet in Moscow.Advertisement
Still, Zelenskyy on Friday once again said he is prepared for face-to-face negotiations with Putin with the goal of bringing the brutal conflict to a close.“Sometimes we need it. Even if we don’t love faces,” he told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria.Meanwhile, Trump told reporters he would be open to taking tougher action against Russia as long as European countries overall fully halted their purchase of Russian oil.“I’m willing to do sanctions, but they’re going to have to toughen up their sanctions commensurate with what I’m doing,” Trump said.Advertisement
While the European Union has committed to cutting off Russian oil by 2028, two members of the 27-nation bloc — Slovakia and Hungary — have opposed the plan.Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.

Turkey, which is part of the military alliance, is the third biggest buyer of Russian oil, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.Advertisement
“China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.“If NATO does as I say, the WAR will end quickly, and all of those lives will be saved! If not, you are just wasting my time, and the time, energy, and money of the United States,” he continued.RelatedDonald TrumpRussiaUkraineVladimir PutinVolodymyr Zelenskyy'It's A Pity': Volodymyr Zelenskyy Says Trump 'Gave Putin What He Wanted' With This 1 MoveSean Penn Recalls Dinner With Putin.
