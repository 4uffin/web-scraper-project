(Watch his analysis below.)“We’ll have to wait and see if history holds, but if it does, two thumbs up for the Democrats,” said Enten in a segment with CNN’s John Berman.Advertisement
Enten noted that there’s been a “record” amount of House retirements — a figure that includes those running for a higher office — in the 2025-26 cycle.There have been 27 retirements in the House thus far this cycle — the highest such figure this century and notably more than the average number of retirements at this point in a cycle from 2005 to 2024, which is 16, Enten said.The record numbers arrive as the GOP holds the smallest majority in the House in over 90 years. Enten likened the current cycle — with 17 Republicans and 10 Democrats retiring from the House thus far — to this point in the 2017-18 cycle, when 18 Republicans and eight Democrats were retiring from the chamber.Advertisement
He stressed that the 2018 midterms were “very, very, very good” for Democrats when the party “absolutely” flipped the House by gaining a net total of 41 seats.“Democrats have to like what they see so far,” he said.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
