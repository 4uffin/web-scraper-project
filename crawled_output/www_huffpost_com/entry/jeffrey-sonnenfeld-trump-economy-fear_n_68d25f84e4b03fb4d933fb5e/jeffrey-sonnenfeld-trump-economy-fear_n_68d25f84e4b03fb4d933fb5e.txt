But about 80% of all those business leaders say they are disappointed with the economy under Trump, he noted.“They’ll go through specifics about what they don’t like. Tariff policies and the independence of the Fed,” Sonnenfeld explained. “But more than anything else, it’s the corrosive effect on and threat to the free enterprise system of not having a functioning democracy” that most worries them, he added.Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.
