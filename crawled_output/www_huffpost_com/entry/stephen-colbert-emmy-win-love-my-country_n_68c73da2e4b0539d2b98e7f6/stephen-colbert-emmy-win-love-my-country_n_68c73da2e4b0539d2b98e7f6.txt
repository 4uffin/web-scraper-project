There was no hint of bitterness as he began his speech by thanking CBS for “giving us the privilege to be part of the late-night tradition.”Advertisement
While the network said ending “The Late Show” was a “purely financial decision” back in July, some have speculated that Colbert got canned for political reasons.Always a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, the host took on CBS’s parent company, Paramount Global, after it settled a fishy multimillion lawsuit from the president around the same time the entertainment giant was seeking approval for its merger with Skydance Media.‘The Late Show with Stephen Colbert’ wins the #Emmy for Outstanding Talk Series.

“Ten years later, in September of 2025, my friends, I have never loved my country more desperately,” Colbert continued. “God bless America.
