There was no hint of bitterness as he began his speech by thanking CBS for “giving us the privilege to be part of the late-night tradition.”Advertisement
While the network said ending “The Late Show” was a “purely financial decision” back in July, some have speculated that Colbert got canned for political reasons.Always a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, the host took on CBS’s parent company, Paramount Global, after it settled a fishy multimillion lawsuit from the president around the same time the entertainment giant was seeking approval for its merger with Skydance Media.‘The Late Show with Stephen Colbert’ wins the #Emmy for Outstanding Talk Series.

Though many saw the abrupt cancellation of “The Late Show” as a warning to those who dare criticize the Trump administration, Colbert’s takes have only gotten more defiant since the decision was announced.But on Sunday, he struck a measured and, at times, patriotic tone.Recalling how he had once dreamed about making a late-night comedy show “about love” when he took the reins back in 2015, Colbert said he only later realized his show was much more about “loss.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

“Ten years later, in September of 2025, my friends, I have never loved my country more desperately,” Colbert continued. “God bless America. Stay strong, be brave, and if the elevator tries to bring you down, go crazy and punch a higher floor.”For more highlights from the 2025 Primetime Emmy Awards, check out HuffPost’s liveblog.RelatedStephen ColbertEmmyslate show with stephen colbertStephen Colbert Addresses 'Late Show' Cancellation At The Emmys'Don't Applaud, That's Terrible!': Stephen Colbert Stops Audience During Trump JokeStephen Colbert Breaks Format With Heartfelt Plea After Charlie Kirk AssassinationJohn Oliver Shares The 'Funniest' Way Emmys Could Have Responded To Colbert Cancellation Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
