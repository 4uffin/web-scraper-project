Comey, whom Trump has long accused of criminal conduct related to his FBI investigation into possible collusion between Russia and his campaign during the 2016 election, was indicted on one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice.Former FBI Director James Comey in 2018.via Associated PressThe indictment, handed down by a grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, concerns congressional testimony Comey gave on Sept. 30, 2020. It accuses him of lying when he said he had not “authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports.”Advertisement
The indictment comes days before the five-year statute of limitations on the testimony was set to run out.The grand jury declined to indict Comey on an additional count of making false statements. The charging documents accused Comey of lying when Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) asked him during his September 2020 testimony if he was aware of a plan by Hillary Clinton to tie Trump to Russia to distract from concerns about her use of a private email server. Comey replied, “That doesn’t ring any bells with me.” It’s unclear why the grand jury did not concur on this count.In a video posted to social media, Comey stated his innocence and welcomed the trial. Here is the entirety of his remarks:Advertisement
My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump, but we couldn’t imagine ourselves living any other way. We will not live on our knees, and you shouldn’t either. Somebody that I love dearly recently said that fear is the tool of a tyrant, and she’s right, but I’m not afraid, and I hope you’re not either. I hope instead you are engaged, you are paying attention and you will vote like your beloved country depends upon it, which it does. My heart is broken for the Department of Justice, but I have great confidence in the federal judicial system, and I’m innocent, so let’s have a trial and keep the faith.CNN reported that Comey plans to surrender on Friday morning.Trump was ecstatic about the news in a Truth Social post.“JUSTICE IN AMERICA!” he wrote, saying of Comey: “He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation.”Advertisement
Current FBI Director Kash Patel also celebrated the news, calling Comey’s investigation into Trump “a disgraceful chapter in history we continue to investigate and expose.”Trump, who fired Comey in 2017, made his expectations for an indictment clear in a Sept. 20 Truth Social post directed at Bondi.“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” Trump wrote, arguing that Comey, along with his other political enemies, Sen. Adam Schiff and Attorney General Letitia James of New York, are “all guilty as hell” and that the DOJ has a “GREAT CASE.” He ended the post with the urgent demand: “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”Advertisement
Though Trump has long slammed Comey for leading a “witch hunt” against him, the results of the Russia investigation ― which was taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller after Trump fired Comey ― determined that Russia did attempt to influence the 2016 election. And while the investigation did not confirm any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, according to officials involved in the investigation, it also did not “exonerate” Trump, as he’s claimed.Attorney General Pam Bondi speaks to reporters alongside President Donald Trump in Junvia Associated PressTruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

Days before Siebert handed in his resignation, sources told The New York Times, he had told his superiors at the Justice Department that the cases against Comey and James were weak and unlikely to result in charges.Advertisement
Trump replaced Siebert with Lindsey Halligan, a White House adviser and his former personal lawyer with no prior experience as a prosecutor. While working for Trump, Halligan was given the task of ridding the Smithsonian Institution of “improper ideology.”Trump referenced her in his post directed at Bondi, writing, “Lindsey Halligan is a really good lawyer, and likes you, a lot.”RelatedDonald TrumpFBIJames Comeypam bondiTrump Pressures 'All Talk, No Action' Attorney General To Go After EnemiesFired Federal Prosecutor Maurene Comey Sues Trump Administration To Get Her Job BackTrumpworld Turns On Pam Bondi Over Talk Of 'Hate Speech' CrackdownAll Of The Most Dire Warnings About The Supreme Court's Immunity Decision Are Coming True Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
