Sunday’s ceremony instead sidestepped politics for a seemingly carefree evening of entertainment and celebration.That’s been par for the course for most award shows in 2025, which have largely avoided any political talk, save for a few bold individuals who seized the moment and the attention of millions watching. Perhaps it’s due to a fear of retribution from the current administration, or a desire to avoid inflaming an already-fraught news cycle exemplified by last week’s fatal shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk.Advertisement
Either way, the lack of social commentary onstage made for a noticeably subdued evening.But according to first-time Emmys host Nate Bargatze, the ceremony was never going to get that political, anyway.“I know there’s heartbreaking stuff that’s been happening right now, but I want this night to be an escape, and I think that’s why I was brought on,” he told Entertainment Weekly ahead of the show. “Everybody has to deal with that stress all day long. So I wanna be just that one escape where they can turn something on and hopefully relax and just have fun.”Sure, that’s partially the point of awards season, even for those up for trophies. But award shows have long been a place for political expression, whether it was welcome or not. So why now, at a moment when public advocacy feels more urgent than ever, should tradition have been paused in favor of some light fun and a few laughs?Advertisement
And I do mean a few.As this year’s Emmys emcee, Bargatze had the job of making the annual show as enjoyable as possible, but by many accounts, he did the opposite. There was a tired gimmick of subtracting from a $100,000 Boys & Girls Club donation for every long acceptance speech, an incredibly dull opening monologue and a handful of self-deprecating jokes — “A lot of people are wondering, why am I hosting?” The stand-up comedian never quite rose to the occasion and couldn’t even land the punchline of a blue jeans joke, seemingly directed at Sydney Sweeney’s American Eagle ad controversy, moments before she presented an award.With the host fumbling the night’s lightest laughs, it’s no shock that he chose to dodge the heavier moments, too. Maybe that’s why the family-friendly Bargatze was selected in the first place — because a bolder, more seasoned voice might’ve used that spotlight to be a bit more disruptive.Advertisement
Stephen Colbert holds up his vintage headshot as he jokes about his late-night show's cancellation during the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards.CBS Photo Archive via Getty ImagesIt’s not lost on many that the person who got the biggest applause at the 77th Emmys wasn’t the host, but in fact, one of the night’s most anticipated winners: Stephen Colbert. At the start of the show, the “Late Show” host earned a standing ovation as the first presenter, marking his first major awards show appearance since the cancellation of his long-running late-night show in July.While Colbert kept it cute on the same network that axed his show, he couldn’t help but poke fun at the obvious by jokingly asking the audience, “Is anyone hiring?” on behalf of his show’s staff, the “200 very well-qualified candidates with me here tonight who will be available in June.”Advertisement
Colbert earned even more cheers when he whipped out his own vintage headshot and resume, which he passed off to Emmy nominee Harrison Ford to give to director Steven Spielberg. It wasn’t the same hard jab at CBS’s parent company that many speculate was the reason behind the cancellation of his show, but it was enough to get the crowd energized.Later on in the evening, Colbert accepted the Emmy for Outstanding Talk Series (his first win in the top late-night category) and used the moment to not only strike a chord with those worried about the future of late-night TV, but also those concerned about the current state of American politics.“I want to thank CBS for giving us the privilege to be part of the ‘Late Night’ tradition, which I hope continues long after we’re no longer doing this show,” Colbert said mildly.

He added, “Sometimes, you only know how much you love something when you get a sense you might be losing it. Ten years later, in September of 2025, my friends, I have never loved my country more desperately.”The conclusion of Colbert’s speech took on a more patriotic tone. “God bless America. Stay strong, be brave,” he said before quoting Prince’s “Let’s Go Crazy.”“And if the elevator tries to bring you down, go crazy and punch a higher floor.”It’s instances like that — acknowledging the state of the world, and specifically, television, when it matters most — that would’ve made all the difference in Bargatze’s hosting gig. It certainly would’ve made up for all the flat jokes that someone like Colbert might have handled better (and with actual insightful things to say).Advertisement
But while Bargatze held back, that didn’t stop others from making their own politically charged statements.Before the ceremony even kicked off, Javier Bardem — one of over 4,000 actors who recently signed a pledge to boycott Israeli film institutions organized by Film Workers for Palestine — told Variety on the red carpet, “I cannot work with somebody that justifies or supports a genocide [in Gaza].”“Hacks” star Megan Stalter also arrived on the carpet ready to make a statement, sporting a simple T-shirt, jeans and a black handbag with a handwritten “Cease fire!” sticker on it.Advertisement
“It’s the most important to stick up for people and for peace [to] ask [for] an end to war,” the actor told Variety of her accessory. “We have to use our platforms and say what’s important to us, because what’s the point of being at these big events if you’re not going to use your privilege?”True. Hence, fellow “Hacks” star Hannah Einbinder, wearing an Artists4Ceasefire pin on her dress, used her acceptance speech for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy to boldly say, “Go Birds, fuck ICE and free Palestine.”In the Emmys press room later, Einbinder explained, “It is my obligation as a Jewish person to distinguish Jews from the state of Israel, because our religion and our culture is such an important and long-standing ... institution that is really separate to this sort of ethnonationalist state.”Advertisement

Our religion and our culture is such an important and long-standing institution that is really separate to this sort… pic.twitter.com/FNVTji7VC3— Variety (@Variety) September 15, 2025Einbinder’s onstage declaration was one of the only televised moments that didn’t gloss over political matters. There were a few subtle jabs at the Trump administration as Television Academy Chair Cris Abrego criticized Congress for voting to defund this year’s Governors Award honoree, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting — a nearly 60-year-old cultural institution that’s being forced to shut down at the end of the year.Still, this year’s Emmys held back when the broadcast should’ve leaned in.Celebrities have been a bit more tight-lipped about politics this year, especially when it comes to taking a firm stance either for or against the Trump administration (because it’s bound to spark controversy). Perhaps some didn’t think it was worth interrupting their Emmys moments for, but the show could’ve stood to be a bit more daring in these trying times. Advertisement
A more assertive host (again, Colbert was right there!) might have been willing to lead the charge and spark a wave of discourse about Israel’s ongoing destruction of Gaza, or the uncalled-for deployment of troops to U.S. cities, or Trump’s escalating ICE raids, or even gun violence. It certainly would’ve made the evening a lot more interesting, or at least more purposeful beyond handing out (well-deserved) statuettes in front of a who’s-who of Hollywood. Those spontaneous moments became some of the most talked-about of the night, seemingly giving people even more reason to tune in to the ceremony. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

But if the aim was to play it safe and avoid another lawsuit, I guess you could say “mission accomplished.” Advertisement
