See the photo here.Souza paired the snap with an excerpt from Obama’s 2015 U.N. address hailing the “system of international rules and norms,” which Trump, with his rhetoric and policies, is now risking tearing down, a decade ago:“It is this international order that has underwritten unparalleled advances in human liberty and prosperity. It is this collective endeavor that’s brought about diplomatic cooperation between the world’s major powers, and buttressed a global economy that has lifted more than a billion people from poverty. It is these international principles that helped constrain bigger countries from imposing our will on smaller ones, and advanced the emergence of democracy and development and individual liberty on every continent.”Souza, who also served in Republican Ronald Reagan’s administration, later mocked Trump’s complaints about the escalator moment, writing: “I guess walking a few steps is too challenging for an authoritarian.”Advertisement
He also dismissed Trump’s U.N. speech as “just a series of lies and grievances.”A spokesperson for the U.N. suggested that the escalator stop may have been caused by Trump’s videographer accidentally setting off a safety sensor.RelatedDonald TrumpBarack Obama
