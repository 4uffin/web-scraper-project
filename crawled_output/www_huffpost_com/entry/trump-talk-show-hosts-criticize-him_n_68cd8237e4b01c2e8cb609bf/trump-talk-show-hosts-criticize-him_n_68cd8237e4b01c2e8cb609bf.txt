They are not allowed to do that!‚Äù the president falsely claimed.By¬†David MoyeSenior Reporter, HuffPostSep 19, 2025, 02:33 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGAlthough one of the duties of a U.S. president is to defend the Constitution, certain parts of it seem to bug current office holder Donald Trump ‚Äï like the pesky First Amendment.Trump admitted as much to reporters on Air Force One on Thursday while flying home from his recent state visit to the U.K. after Daily Mail reporter Nikki Schwab asked him who he thought should replace recently suspended talk show host Jimmy Kimmel.Advertisement
The president started ranting about Kimmel, before making a chilling, rambling and, most importantly, false comment about free speech.‚ÄúA lot of people, anybody could replace him. Guy had no talent. Kimmel had, look, he was fired. He had no talents. He‚Äôs a whack job, but he had no talent,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúMore importantly, the talent that he had, because a lot of have people have no talent, they get ratings. But he had to ratings. His ratings were worse than Colbert, I think. They got rid of Colbert, which was a good thing to do.‚ÄùTrump then noted that networks like Kimmel‚Äôs employer, ABC, are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, but that‚Äôs not necessarily a given.Advertisement
Kimmel‚Äôs suspension reportedly came after FCC chair Brendan Carr publicly called for his removal from the air after he made a joke about the White House attempting to cast blame on anyone on the left for the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Trump also suggested other network talk show hosts may have their jobs at risk if they keep utilizing their First Amendment rights to mock him.‚ÄúWhen you go back and take a look, all they do is hit Trump. They‚Äôre licensed. They are not allowed to do that!‚Äù the president falsely claimed.Advertisement
And, yes, there‚Äôs a clip. Gulp!Trump: When you have a network and you have evening shows and all they do is hit Trump‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre licensed. They‚Äôre not allowed to do that. pic.twitter.com/kSsqkmWZBU‚Äî Acyn (@Acyn) September 18, 2025Considering the First Amendment of that Constitution thingie that Trump swore under oath to protect, a lot of people had problems with his notion that talk show hosts shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to ‚Äúhit Trump.‚ÄùTrump: ‚ÄúWhen you have a network and you have evening shows and all they do is hit Trump‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre licensed.

What says they are not allowed to do that? That is the very premise of free speech. Trump is using the FCC and other institutions as a weapon to silence critics. It is unconstitutional.https://t.co/yEAIpLVRES‚Äî J.C.'s Thought Dump (@jcsthoughtdump) September 18, 2025Yes, they are. The "Fairness Doctrine" was repealed in 1987 under Reagan, and FCC "equal opportunity" rule (rarely if ever enforced) exists only as to **bona fide candidates running for office**, not to political points of view or jokes (or to news shows at all.)‚Äî Jeffrey Evan Gold (@jeffgoldesq) September 18, 2025"To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public."

Trump‚Äôs comments on Air Force One are not the only occasion where he suggested he doesn‚Äôt really respect the country‚Äôs founding document.During his second term in office, he has tried to get rid of birthright citizenship for people born in this country and wants jail time for people who burn the U.S. flag.Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.
