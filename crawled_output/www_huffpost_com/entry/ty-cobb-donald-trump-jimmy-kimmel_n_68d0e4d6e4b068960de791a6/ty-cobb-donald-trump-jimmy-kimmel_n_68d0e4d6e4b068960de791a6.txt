Cobb also pointed to Russian President Vladimir Putin, noting that one of Putin’s first moves in the early 2000s was to “systematically silence critical media outlets and independent TV channels” that were soon “bought out or shut down.”“Trump is waging war on people who offend him,” said Cobb. “He’s all about vengeance.

All have mocked the president. Cobb called the situation “really tragic” and predicted more comedians would be targeted.Advertisement
“Pretty soon, the only comedian left standing is going to be Karoline Leavitt,” Cobb deadpanned, referring to the current Trump White House press secretary whose comments sometimes appear to be parody, but aren’t.Watch the full interview from the 10:50 point here:Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.
