And that doesn’t seem true or fair."Yana Iskayeva via Getty ImagesBy Leslie VoorisGuest WriterAug 26, 2025, 04:20 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENT“Hi!” the little girl says as I push my cart down the grocery aisle. I can see she is friendly and eager to chat. I stop my cart. We talk naturally, chitchatting about her favorite cartoon princesses and her new shoes. She’s 3 years old, I learn. This is not a rare occurrence. Littles are especially fond of me: In subway stations, where one once fell asleep on my shoulder. And at the beach, where a little boy recently encouraged me to go into the water, proclaiming, “You can do it! Look at me!”I make these friends wherever I go. What people, and especially mothers, are always shocked to learn is that I don’t have any children myself. Whenever I reveal this, I usually detect a range of reactions that span disappointment, sadness and surprise.Advertisement
I’m used to it. Whenever I reconnect with my Latino family, the first thing they ask about is the possibility of me having children — as if not having them is a sin. Raised in what I consider dysfunction, motherhood has never been the goal. And while I haven’t totally ruled it out, the world’s reaction to childless women (who love children) is bizarre. What is it about childless women that still stirs so much negative emotion? I suspect it has to do with the idea that to be a mother is to be intrinsically selfless, wholesome, moral and, well, “good.” There’s always a politely hidden implication that there must be something wrong with you if you opt out.And this is important to address since more women are opting out of motherhood altogether. And those who are having babies are apparently having fewer; according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. fertility rate has dropped to 1.62 births per woman, down from the replacement level of 2.1 in 1990.

At the same time, we are seeing a rise in pro-natalist policy proposals during our current administration, with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance incentivizing higher birth rates through federal benefits and tax breaks. “Much of the movement is built around promoting a very specific idea of what constitutes a family — one that includes marriage between a man and a woman, and leaves out many families that don’t conform to traditional gender roles or family structures,” Caroline Kitchener writes in The New York Times.This is problematic in more ways than one. But for me, the push to have a baby implies that my self-worth is tied to birthing a child. And that doesn’t seem true or fair. I was adopted into a home with several foster siblings who I played surrogate mother to after my own adoptive mother developed Alzheimer’s. I had literally raised children, some of whom we received straight from the hospital, often just days old. So, as a teen who sometimes felt hampered by the duties of child rearing, I was excited to enjoy all my freedom when I left home at 18.Advertisement
But now, as a grown woman, I realize that culturally, we are surrounded by mothers of all types: married mothers, single mothers, older mothers, TV mothers, ads specifically targeted to mothers. Motherhood, whether it comes early or late, is still widely connected to being thought of as an essential part of womanhood, of being feminine, of being who you really are and meant to be. It’s as if creating another human makes a person appear more human.And that’s the idea I challenge. After all, not all mothers are good. Some, in fact, are terrible. And so, to equate motherhood to sound morality is false. Sometimes, the kind and smart thing is knowing motherhood is not right for you.I’ve found myself drawn to others like me: people who don’t always fit in easily, culturally or otherwise. Since I don’t have children of my own, I’m able to be available to others. I am able to mother in different, very helpful ways, not only to those in my inner circle, but to anyone who might need it. I quickly realized that this is a form of mothering as well — and that I’m good, too, for fostering community intentionally.Advertisement
But to some, this doesn’t count. I’ve been told that I’ll never understand what “real love” is until I have a kid. I know that’s wholly inaccurate. Because my attention is not laser-focused on my literal offspring, I can be there for members of my community in a more involved and often intimate way. And there is certainly no shortage of others who need me: cousins, siblings, nephews, friends, acquaintances and colleagues.In fact, I have more to give. I can be a better friend, sibling, aunt and more open to being there for others who may also defy norms.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

I just don’t think having children should be considered the only path to being a morally sound, trustworthy and kind person. Advertisement
For childless women like myself, life is not empty. It is already full of meaning and value that I plan on passing on to whoever needs and wants it. We love in myriad ways, in the forms we are best at. And for all the kids who find my shoulder or presence as a source of comfort, I want them to know I’m always here for them — whether it’s a listening ear, a laugh or a moment of refuge in an uncertain world. This, too, is a kind of mothering, one that doesn’t require parenthood, only the willingness to accept and love others.
