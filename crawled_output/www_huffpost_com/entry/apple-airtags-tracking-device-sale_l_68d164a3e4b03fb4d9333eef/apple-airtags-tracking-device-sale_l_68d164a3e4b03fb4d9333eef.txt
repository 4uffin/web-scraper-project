Apple’s AirTags do exactly that, making them a tiny yet must-have travel companion, so it’s no wonder they’ve been a consistent bestseller here at HuffPost. Right now, you can grab a single tag for 25% off, dropping them to just under $22 — the lowest price they’ve been since Prime Day in July. Of course, they’re even cheaper if you snag the 4-pack because that makes them $18 each, but if you’re only wanting a single, there’s no better time to grab it. We have no idea how long this deal will last, but this is a good deal and definitely worth grabbing whether you’re a newbie or just doing a re-up.Advertisement
Single: $21.75 at amazon (originally $25.99)4-pack: $74.99 at amazon (originally $99)Here’s how they work: AirTags can ping their own location, so when you attach them to one of your belongings, you can track that item via Apple’s Find My app, which is available in the cloud and on Apple devices like iPhones, laptops, and more. Through Find My, you can even tell your AirTag to play a sound so it’s easier to find. AmazonAirTags are simple and easy to set up and track with your Apple devices (the key ring holder is not included, but there are many options).Advertisement
Single: $21.75 at amazon (originally $25.99)4-pack: $74.99 at amazon (originally $99)Each one is completely encrypted for privacy, and even when it’s far away, it can anonymously and secretly use a network of Apple devices to send its location back to you. When you move away from an item like your keys, it can even send you a notice. In addition to being water- and dust-resistant, AirTags have a wildly simple setup, and you can assign each one a name to keep your most valuable belongings sorted. After my car was stolen a few years ago and the thieves ripped out its GPS system, I bought one to keep in the spare tire in my trunk as a backup — and found it so useful I bought another to place in checked luggage (you never know where your bag might end up!). I haven’t lost my car in a crowded parking lot since. Advertisement
AirTags have so many five-star reviews on Amazon, with an incredible 4.7-star rating. “The durability is outstanding,” wrote one reviewer, who added, “With their simple setup, tracking precision, durability, elegant design, and intelligent features, they are an investment worth every penny. If you’re an Apple user who values the security of your belongings, AirTags are an unbeatable choice. I’m extremely satisfied with my purchase and can’t recommend them enough.”Join the hordes of others taking advantage of a rare Apple sale and grab a pack of four for the whole family or multiple valuable items.

Promising review: "Great product for a great price! The colors help identify whose it is, makes them easier to see, they’re super easy to use by just popping the AirTag in, but it fits securely and doesn’t even attempt to fall out!" — rbnyrk$5.88 at amazon (regularly $6.99)AmazonA lightweight Airtag wallet holder (10% off)This handy Airtag wallet holder can hold a single AirTag snugly in your wallet. It's smaller than a traditional credit card and it's flexible, making it a perfect fit for various wallet types. Save a buck on the plain black version. Promising review: "I bought a different holder that proved to be too thick and rigid for my wallet. I can use that one with a different air tag for an alternate purpose. This one works better for my “back pocket” wallet. (So far, no problems with the air tag falling out)." — Ctexhowlin$8.99+ at amazon (regularly $9.99)Advertisement
AmazonOr a Belkin secure holder with a wire cableShopping editor Marquaysa Battle has written about this high-quality, locking AirTag holder before, noting "Reviewers love it because you can enclose the AirTag inside it, loop it around and lock it closed on everything from luggage to purses to keychains and beyond. Several reviewers noted that out of all the AirTag holders on the market, the locking aspect of this one is so tight, you actually need a small tool to get it open or closed."“I use this holder to secure my Airtag inside of my luggage,” reviewer, Josh, noted. “The allen-head screw makes it hard to remove without the tool as a deterrent to theft by a shady TSA or airport employee. A must-have!Promising reviews: "I really like how nice these look and how well they show off the airtag. I did not expect them to be nearly as durable though! i have put these on my keys which get tossed around and also on my luggage and they show no sign of cracking or coming lose. They may be a bit pricier than other options but these really feel like the premium choice." — Ame"I've bought two of these and have never regretted it. These are the only cases I have bought and will buy for my AirTags. I don't trust the ones you can pop in and out, having the locking screw system gives me the peace of mind my tags won't go missing. Easy to use and durable. They have never accidentally come open and that's what it's designed to do." — Amber$19.95 at AmazonAmazonOr a leather holder than conceals the tagPromising reviews: "This was a great item for my son, who is always leaving his keys somewhere. The design is not 'attention-seeking' so he didn’t mind putting it on his key chain. The material and the quality is very good for holding up to rough handlers with keys. It was very easy to insert the apple tag and it holds it securely. It is not bulky. It protects the apple tag very well. I bought the black one so it doesn’t stand out. I would definitely recommend for all and is worth the money." — Pamela Rayfield"This was perfect for the air tag and it looks like a key chain instead of an air tag holder. I had one that showed the air tag and was worried it would either fall out or get stolen. This covers both of those issues. And as a bonus, it is a very nice leather and looks great." — THans$12.95 at AmazonThe Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics.
