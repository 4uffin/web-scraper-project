Smith's Harsh 7 Words Won't Help Kamala Harris Sell Her BookThe ESPN "First Take" star just gutted the former Democratic nominee with a diss.By Ron DickerGeneral Assignment Reporter, HuffPostSep 22, 2025, 02:48 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGStephen A. Smith has already turned the page on Kamala Harris, even though she has a new book out. (Watch the video below.)“Who cares what she has to say?” the ESPN star said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”The former vice president’s book on her compressed presidential campaign, “107 Days,” hits the shelves on Tuesday. But Smith was already bashing it based on excerpts.Advertisement
Harris wrote that she made a grave mistake by not discouraging President Joe Biden from running again. She attributed the decision to “recklessness.”Biden’s disastrous debate against Donald Trump essentially forced the incumbent to drop out of the election. He then endorsed Harris, beginning her 107-day run for the presidency.In another excerpt, Harris wrote she “pulled the pin” on her campaign by saying she wouldn’t have done anything differently than Biden did in the previous four years on “The View.”Advertisement
Still, Smith accused Harris of pointing the “finger of blame” at everybody but herself. He took a dim view of her chances in 2028 if she chooses to run again.“I don’t think she’s going to have any support from the Democratic party,” he said.Harris wasn’t “that strong of a candidate before,” Smith said, noting her failure to gain traction in 2020 and her defeats to Trump in every swing state in the 2024 election.“I believe her political career is over,” he declared.Harris trailed California Gov. Gavin Newsom 26.5% to 21.1% in recent aggregate polling for the 2028 Democratic nomination.Advertisement
So perhaps she will write another chapter, after all.Fast-forward to 31:20 for Smith’s take:Relatedkamala harris2024 electionStephen A.
