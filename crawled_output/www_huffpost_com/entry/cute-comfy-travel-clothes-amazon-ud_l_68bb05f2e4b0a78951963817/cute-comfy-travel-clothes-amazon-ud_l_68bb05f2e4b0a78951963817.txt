And as much as I value being comfortable on a plane, I simply refuse to sacrifice my personal style in the process. So while you will never catch me wearing hard pants on a 14-hour flight to Australia, I would rather not be clad in an ill-fitting tracksuit upon landing. Luckily, there are so many affordable comfortable clothing options at Amazon that this really never needs to be the case. Below, we‚Äôve curated a selection of the cutest, comfiest and surprisingly chic travel-appropriate clothing at Amazon that is perfect to wear on your next flight.

1AmazonLillusory two-piece lounge outfitThis two-piece set from Lillusory is downright elegant, with a uniquely tailored silhouette that elevates it from your average tracksuit. It is devastatingly put-together and wildly comfortable. The top features a front pocket, a classic crewneck and a sophisticated rib knit. The pants have a stylish tapered hem with pleats along the ankle that add visual interest and give the overall look a structured feeling. (Just be aware that many of the photos show the model with a belt, but the pants come without one.)Both of these pieces are cool enough to be worn separately or together and can easily be dressed up or down depending on shoes and other accessories. It‚Äôs about as versatile as a loungewear set can get. You can get it in sizes XS‚ÄìXL in multiple color combos.Promising reviews: "I absolutely love this set. True to size. The fabric is great quality and very durable. You can wear it as long wear at home or to the office. It‚Äôs my go to when I want to look cute and comfy." ‚Äî Marla"This looked so amazing online and I have three Lillusory sweaters I love, so I thought I would give it a try. The size chart put me at a small and it fits just perfect. Even the hubby said it really looked good on me. I am a senior and we travel quite a bit and it will be perfect for strolling the deck on our cruise next month. I plan to get another set in other colors so I can mix and match. A great buy." ‚Äî Mimi Stader$48 at Amazon2AmazonA cozy, slouchy knit set with a V-neckWith its slouchy, relaxed fit thanks to the batwing sleeves and V-neck, plus the wide leg pants, this two-piece knit set is effortlessly cool. Both pieces are machine-washable, and are made of a soft, sweater-like nylon that can keep you warm on a cold plane. The set is available in 24 colors and sizes S-XL.Promising review: "I was traveling and wanted to be comfortable without looking frumpy. I decided to give this lounge set a try. After sizing down, I fell head over heels! I absolutely love the fabric on this lounge set. It's super soft and stretchy and doesn't show every lump and bump on my body which makes it very flattering. The top is a good length, not too long, not too short, but the best part is the length of the pants. They don't drag the floor! Being 5'2" this is usually a problem. There are a lot of great colors to choose from. I chose the navy color, which is rich, vibrant and beautiful. I was comfortable to the plane and felt "put- together". This is my new favorite lounge set." ‚Äî Jenna D$49 at Amazon3AmazonA chic tank top outfit with pocketsIf you feel like a sweatsuit will make you overheat, try this two-piece set that has a tank top paired with high-waisted, ankle-length wide leg pants. Best of all, the pants have two front pockets, which isn't the case with many of Amazon's options for lounge sets. You can get it in a range of colors, in sizes XS-XXL.Promising review: "I never write reviews and rarely purchase clothes from Amazon. This is literally the best set I‚Äôve ever bought. I travel internationally for work and you can literally go from the plane, throw on heels and a blazer and go right to a meeting. Super comfortable and a nice material. I bought in black and ordering another color now. I am extra careful about washing it because not sure how it would do in the dryer etc." ‚Äî Amazon Customer$34 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonA long T-shirt dressPrefer a dress? Look no further than this cute maxi that is as comfortable as it is adorable. I would throw a button down or a shawl over it for extra warmth on a flight, but it's great on its own for anyone who runs hot or doesn't like the loungewear look. It's available in a range of colors in sizes S-XXL and features a side slit and sleeveless silhouette.Promising reviews: "Love this dress! This dress is so comfortable and flattering. You can dress it up with a belt, Scarves or jewelry. The side slits are the perfect height, allowing easy walking. The fit is perfect!" ‚Äî Dawn Adams"Currently packing for my island trip and this arrived just in time! ü•≥ I love it. I am 5‚Äô3 and pretty petite and the loose fitting maxi long dresses typically swallow me up but this one is surprisingly flattering! Perfect length. I love the side slits and looove the pockets. And with the higher neck, it‚Äôs conservative enough to wear on a casual day at work with a cute jean jacket or something, at home, out and about, pretty much anywhere. The material is soft and good quality and I‚Äôm not finding it to be transparent so far." ‚Äî Nikia$20 at AmazonAdvertisement
5AmazonA pair of tapered ankle pantsThese ankle pants are reminiscent of this very popular pair of Athleta pants, in the very best way. They perfectly split the difference between loungewear and everyday pants. The fabric is soft and stretchy, so you feel like you're in sweats, but the tailoring is excellent, with a tapered ankle that makes you look put together and feel chic. It's available in 20 colors in sizes XS-3XL.Promising review: "So comfortable and stylish! I bought these pants for a Costa Rica trip. I wore them on the airplane and several times throughout in warm and cool weather. I even did a sink wash and they dried beautifully. They are very soft, stretchy, but retain their shape. I‚Äôm getting more!" ‚Äî Kim Hennessee$30 at Amazon6AmazonA two-piece sweatsuit with a half-zip pulloverI've been eying this two-piece ribbed tracksuit for a while now, and just might have to pick it up before my next long-haul flight. Despite the fact that is has a very typical loungey silhouette, it features enough heft, tailoring and interesting detail to elevate the look as a whole. The jogger-style sweats are relaxed but not sloppy, while the half-zip sweatshirt is timelessly chic. This set is available in 20 colors in sizes S-XXL.Promising reviews: "Must buy. Love it!! This is so cute, comfortable, and great material. Love this for traveling or just relaxing at home." ‚Äî Nixie Garcia"This sweat suit is soft and comfortable. It is fairly light weight as far as warm, but heavy enough that it hangs well. Great for casual wear, lounging, and I think I will wear it when I fly next month. Color and fabric are both attractive." ‚Äî Joye Taylor$47 at AmazonAdvertisement
7AmazonA cheeky two-piece printed shorts setIf you like to let your legs breathe, then this sweater set is just the thing for your next big travel day. The top has long puff batwing-style sleeves that add a ton of visual interest and put a twist on the average sweatshirt. The set has a casual, relaxed fit and comes in a range of colors and prints, though I'm loving this sweet black and white daisy color combination. It's available in sizes S-XXL.Promising review: "Perfect fit, quality woven fabric design. I'm just under 5'2" 115 lbs. I ordered a small. It's perfect, not too tight or too loose. I've already gotten compliments the first two times wearing the sweatshirt with my jeans out. I absolutely love its versatility; wear as separates or together ‚ù§Ô∏è" ‚Äî cupcake22"Bought this because i thought it would be a great spring lounge outfit! it is so so comfy and cute! the top doesn‚Äôt just go good with the pants too i also wear it with leggings and so it can be dressed up or down!! the material is cooling but still will keep you warm." ‚Äî Maria$30 at Amazon8AmazonA cuddly pashmina-style wrapIf you're not really a sweatshirt person or prefer a more elegant silhouette, then a wrap is the way to go for an extra layer of coziness while traveling. This soft, sophisticated and timeless pashmina-style shawl can be easily tossed over your shoulders for an extra layer of warmth that won't sacrifice your style. It's available in a variety of colors and at a reasonable price point, so you can pick up the one that best matches your style or grab a few to put into rotation year-round. I love having one of these on hand for travel days; it adds a hint of unexpected glamour.Promising review: "Fit the bill. Needed a wrap to take on a trip. This was perfect; warm, but not too warm, soft, and classy looking. Perfect for ocean breezes or cold restaurant air conditioning!" ‚Äî Kathe"The shawl is soft and warm. It‚Äôs just the right length. I have two others in the same material. I‚Äôm planning on giving some for birthday gifts." ‚Äî Lady Prof$14 at Amazon9AmazonA pair of lightweight joggersI love a tapered jogger-style pant, but it can be difficult to find a some that aren't too oversized and slouchy. These super-soft, stretchy joggers are made with light fabric that skims the body, providing tummy control and lengthening the line of the leg. They would look great with everything from a T-shirt to a button down, cardigan or shacket. You can get it in sizes XS-3XL in a wide variety of colors.Promising review: "Ordered these for vacation. I rotated through all 4 pairs using a variety of shirts. I wore very casual t-shirts some days and dressier tops other days with the pants and both looked great. So, they can have a very casual or a little more of a dressy casual look. They are super comfortable. I love the soft fabric. They have a legging like material but with the jogger style fit. I‚Äôm definitely interested in buying more colors to add to my collection. Wore and washed a few times before my review, and there have been no fabric issues from either. They still look the same as delivery day! I am a medium in pants and they fit perfect. Not too tight and not as loose as some of my other joggers. I love the fit." ‚Äî Jessica$27 at AmazonAdvertisement
10AmazonA Skims-lookalike fuzzy three-piece setReviewers have noted that this cozy, sweet and super-soft fuzzy set is eerily reminiscent of Skims loungewear. It's available in sizes S‚ÄìXL and 24 colors, so you can find the one that best fits your personal style. It's definitely on the more casual, lounge-y side, but I think it's a great option for a long travel day. The longline sweater is as comfy as it gets and you'll feel deliciously cozy wrapped up in your airline seat.Promising review: "The material is so soft and feels good on. It looks exactly like the photo. The sizing was right on the money. Totally would order another one in a different color. We were looking for a comfortable outfit for the airplane. This delivered!! It's really so so cute!" ‚Äî Katura Rodriguez$55 at Amazon11AmazonA classic crewneck cardiganA crewneck cardigan will never go out of style, which is why it's the perfect little sweater to throw over your travel outfit, whether it's a tee and sweatpants or a more structured look. It's made with soft yarn and features a timeless design with ribbed detailing at the cuffs and hem. You can get it in 26 colors in sizes XS-6XL.Promising reviews: "Very nice lightweight sweater. Fashionable and comfortable. Can wear with jeans for a casual look, yet also goes well with a dress for a more business or mid-formal look." ‚Äî Lisa Smith"Classic cardigan that's very comfortable to wear. I was looking for a nice blue shade other than navy blue and this is a pretty shade of blue that goes with many colors of tops, pants or skirts. I will probably get a couple more colors in the future." ‚Äî Lois$16 at Amazon12AmazonA kimono-style blouse-y topFor the lightest of possible layers, try this beautiful open-front top. It's made with chiffon fabric that is sheer, airy and lightweight. It adds a ton of visual interest to your outfit and some nice extra coverage without making you feel super covered-up. It's available in a large range of colors and patterns in sizes S-5XL.Promising review: "Love it! Throw this on over a tank a Tshirt a dress or jumpsuit and it‚Äôs so much fun very feminine. I will be taking this to Europe to throw in my bag as I visit, museums etc. Where you need your shoulders covered. This can be easily rolled up and put it in your handbag and pull it out with no wrinkles. Just love all the color choices. You have to get at least one." ‚Äî kathryn$15 at AmazonAdvertisement
13AmazonA stylish two-piece sweater and wide-leg sweatpants setNot to pick favorites, but this sweat set might be my favorite look from the bunch. It's sophisticated, elegant and sharp enough to wear straight from your flight to dinner. It has a slouchy fit that doesn't look messy, while the striped top adds a bit of pizzazz without being garish. It's available in 20 color combos in sizes S-XL.Promising review: "I got this for my airport look and oh my it was a hug that I wore throughout my flight. Its very comfortable true to size and warm for the plane and just the negative is No pockets. Ladies it's a must have in your wardrobe, style it , flaunt it , casual meeting , airport look , grocery run , anywhere u can wear it. Its slightly warm , wash in cold water , you can use dryer as mine is in perfect condition. Its a must have wardrobe item value for money, true to size and very very comfortable and stylish." ‚Äî Mallika Bansal$46 at AmazonRelatedshoppingStyle travelClothing28 Newer Travel Products That Will Make You Feel Like A Genius28 Travel Products For People Who Are Dead-Set On Only Bringing A Carry-On38 Travel Items That'll Come In Handy On Both Big And Small VacationsThese Amazon Travel Clothes Feel Like Pajamas But Look Like Nice Outfits Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
