If you’re on the hunt for a new pair of shoes but don’t want to break the bank, then you need to check out the Vionic Uptown penny loafers. Not only are they comfortable and stylish, but they’re more than 60% off in certain autumnal colors and patterns. $49.99 at DSW (regularly $135)$62.10+ at Zappos (regularly $135)$89.99+ at Vionic (regularly $135)Advertisement
DSWThe Vionic loafers are majorly winning people over for their genius design — including my mom.My mother, who is in her mid-60s, has been raving about these “soft and comfortable” Vionic loafers. The interior lining is cozy without being overly warm, and she loves that they can be worn with or without socks, and thinks they’re the perfect everyday shoe. She also noted that thanks to the unique collapsible construction, they’re bendable and easy to pack, making them ideal for travel. It never occurred to me that a shoe ought to be (or even could be) considered “packable” but it’s a surprisingly logical selling point. The shoe is made with a removable EVA insole that provides plenty of arch support and shock absorption, making it perfect for long days spent walking or on your feet. It’s a great alternative to sneakers for days when you know you’ll be out and about but don’t want to sacrifice style for comfort.Advertisement
The real standout design detail is the shoes’ deep heel cup.According to the brand, it’s designed to soothe pain caused by common foot issues like plantar fasciitis or tendonitis.One reviewer described it as “walking on butter,” while another proclaimed that the loafer “feels like a cloud.” Reviewer Meg said, “They are even more comfortable than my gym shoes.”And lest you think these shoes are merely utilitarian, one shopper said, “I get compliments on them all the time.” There’s truly nothing better than when form meets function.

These shoes are available in sizes 5-13 in a range of colors and patterns, some of which are more deeply discounted than others. I normally shy away from bold patterns, but the snake print option is so chic that it has me doing a double-take. It’ll be a fabulous juxtaposition to a neutral, monochrome look. The fact that this style is 62% off at DSW is also compelling. $49.99 at DSW (regularly $135)$62.10+ at Zappos (regularly $135)$89.99+ at Vionic (regularly $135)Take a look at what other shoppers had to say then pick up a few pairs for yourself while the savings are hot.Promising reviews:“This is my 2nd pair of Uptown Penny Loafers.
