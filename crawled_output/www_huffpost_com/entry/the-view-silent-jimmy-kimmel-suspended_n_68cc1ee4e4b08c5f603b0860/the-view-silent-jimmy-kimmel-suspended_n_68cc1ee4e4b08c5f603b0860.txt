ABC and parent company Disney announced they were “indefinitely” shelving its marquee late night show on Wednesday night, in response to outrage over Kimmel’s comments about conservative pundit Charlie Kirk’s murder.During his Monday monologue, the comedian accused Republicans of trying to “score political points” in the fallout from Kirk’s assassination and also suggested the suspected shooter may have been aligned with the right-wing."The View's" Sara Haines, Ana Navarro, Sunny Hostin, Joy Behar, Alyssa Farah Griffin and Whoopi Goldberg appear from left to right.JEFF LIPSKYABCAdvertisement
It seemed like “The View,” which also airs on ABC, wasn’t going to risk ruffling any feathers by broaching the Kimmel controversy on Thursday’s show.Instead, they focused on FBI director Kash Patel’s tense congressional hearing the day before and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s ongoing efforts to reshape the Centers for Disease Control.“The View’s” historically contentious relationship with President Donald Trump now stands to be a serious liability in the wake of Kimmel’s ouster and CBS’s cancellation of Stephen Colbert’s late-night show back in July.Advertisement
Later on Thursday, Federal Communications Commission head Brendan Carr revealed how his agency might wield its power over the show during an appearance on conservative commentator Scott Jennings’ radio show.Carr signaled an interest in having his agency evaluate “The View’s” status as a “bona fide news show.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Losing its “bona fide news” label could force “The View” to make major changes about who it gives air time.Advertisement
