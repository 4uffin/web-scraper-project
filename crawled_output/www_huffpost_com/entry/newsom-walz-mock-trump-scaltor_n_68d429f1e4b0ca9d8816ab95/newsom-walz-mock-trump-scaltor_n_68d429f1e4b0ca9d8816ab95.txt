Trump was stymied by a malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter during his visit to the United Nations on Tuesday.Advertisement
“These are the two things I got from the United Nations — a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,” he complained during his speech. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later expressed her frustration with how things unfolded. “If someone at the U.N. intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately,” Leavitt wrote on X, formerly Twitter.Advertisement
Leavitt was referencing speculation that U.N. staffers had “joked” about tampering with both the elevators and escalators ahead of Trump’s arrival. But it was later reported that the glitches may have been caused by Trump’s own videographer and equipment.Govs. Tim Walz, left, and Gavin Newsom, right, both mocked President Donald Trump, center, on Tuesday.Getty ImagesLeavitt’s call for firings and an investigation didn’t quite land as intended, as Walz and Newsom seized the opportunity to mock the press secretary with a healthy dose of sarcasm.

“Not only do they need to be fired, they need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Walz sarcastically wrote on X. “It’s a miracle the President ever made it up the stairs.”Moments later, Newsom chimed in with his own brand of snark in response to the technical glitches that plagued Trump.

TYLENOL INCLUDED. ENJOY YOUR STAY, DON! — GCN.” Advertisement
In his post, Newsom doubled down on his claims that Trump is showing signs of dementia — as well as referencing the president’s recent unproven claim that Tylenol is linked to autism in children.
