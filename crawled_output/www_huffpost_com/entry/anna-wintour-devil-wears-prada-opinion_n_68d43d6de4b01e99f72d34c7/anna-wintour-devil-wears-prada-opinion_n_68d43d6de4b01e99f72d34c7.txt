“I went to the premiere wearing Prada, completely having no idea what the film was going to be about,” Wintour told Remnick on his podcast.“I think that the fashion industry were very sweetly concerned for me about the film ― that it was going to paint me in some kind of difficult light,” she said, adding that she looks at the portrayal as a “caricature.”The longtime Vogue editor-in-chief has a surprising take on the 2006 film.John Nacion via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
“I found it highly enjoyable. It was very funny,” Wintour said of the film. “Miuccia [Prada] and I talk about it a lot, and I say to her, ‘Well, it was really good for you.’” The movie “had a lot of humor to it,” she added.“It had a lot of wit. It had Meryl Streep. I mean, it was Emily Blunt ― they were all amazing,” she said. “In the end, I thought it was a fair shot.”Last year, Wintour told the BBC that it was “for the audience and for the people I work with to decide if there are any similarities between me and Miranda Priestly,” the character reportedly based on her.

The fashion titan has previously spoken about parts of the movie she found fair— and that she even liked — during a 2009 interview with David Letterman. “I seem to remember that actually the movie was fiction, and we really like fiction at Vogue,” she quipped.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
