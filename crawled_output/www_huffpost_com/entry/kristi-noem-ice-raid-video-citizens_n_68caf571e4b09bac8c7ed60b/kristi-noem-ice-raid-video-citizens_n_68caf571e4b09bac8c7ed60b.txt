One of them, 37-year-old Joe Botello, recounted the incident in detail to the Chicago Tribune. Botello, who was born in the U.S., told the Tribune that masked officers entered his home by force, destroying his front door, and that he was handcuffed and questioned inside a Customs and Border Protection vehicle. Botello does not appear on the list of men featured in the DHS press release on the raid.“I’m just blessed that I’m still alive,” Botello told the Tribune. “I’ve been hearing it and seeing it through social media. But it never crossed my mind that it was going to happen here at the house… where I live.”DHS disputed that any U.S. citizens were arrested, telling HuffPost in a statement that they had been “briefly” held.

“No U.S. citizens were arrested, they were briefly held for their and the officers’ safety while the operation in the house was underway,” the statement read. “This is standard protocol.”According to the Tribune, Botello was one of the men seen in handcuffs in the video of the raid posted by Noem.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
