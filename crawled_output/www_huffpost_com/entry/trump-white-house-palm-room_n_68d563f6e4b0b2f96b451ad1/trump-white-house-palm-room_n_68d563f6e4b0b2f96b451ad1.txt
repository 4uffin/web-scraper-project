He wrote alongside the photo, “New lobby leading to Oval Office — Magnificent marble floor, compliments of President Donald J. Trump!” A bench and plants that had previously occupied the space were conspicuously absent, although it is not clear whether they had simply yet to be put back after the flooring was complete. The White House did not immediately provide an answer.The Palm Room is seen in November 2019 as President Donald Trump talks with then-Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov.AlamyAdvertisement
Trump has notably removed other White House plant life in favor of objects, though.The Rose Garden’s grassy central expanse was paved over this summer for the stated purpose of preventing visitors’ heels from getting stuck in the dirt. An ivy plant that had maintained its home on the Oval Office mantle for decades was also removed in favor of an ever-growing collection of golden trophies or objets d’art.The Palm Room, generally a light and airy space evoking a greenhouse, sits between the residential part of the White House and the West Wing, where offices for the president and his top staffers reside.RelatedDonald TrumpWhite HouseLook What Donald Trump Has Done To The Oval OfficeTrump Is Tearing Up Part Of The White House To Build A $200 Million Ballroom'Facts Matter': Obama Photographer Outs Trump’s Teleprompter Rage With A Single Snap Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
