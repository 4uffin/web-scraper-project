“To my friend Charlie Kirk: Rest now, brother, we have the watch, and I’ll see you in Valhalla,” Patel said, referring to a realm featured in Norse mythology.Kash Patel: "To my friend Charlie Kirk. Rest now, brother. We have the watch. And I'll see you at Valhalla" pic.twitter.com/cZAsizzAAk— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 12, 2025The reference seemed strange to many because, as RawStory noted, Patel was raised Hindu and Kirk was an evangelical Christian, leading one person to remark, “What kind of Marvel Cinematic Universe government do we have right now?” Advertisement
Why in the world did Kash Patel mention Valhalla, what kind of Marvel Cinematic Universe government do we have right now?— Zaid Jilani (@ZaidJilani) September 12, 2025The Economic Times noted that Patel’s goodbye note to Kirk combines two longstanding military farewells: “We have the watch” is part of a Navy retirement tradition, while the Marines use “Until Valhalla” to honor fallen comrades.However, neither Patel nor Kirk served in the military.White supremacists also have adopted some symbols of Norse mythology, according to a 2020 report from the University of Alberta.Advertisement
In fact, the person who attacked two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 said, “I will see you all in Valhalla,” in a farewell note.People had thoughts about Patel’s farewell to Kirk.“I’ll see you in Valhalla.”WTAF?!?!@FBIDirectorKash, a Hindu, references Viking mythology in his press conference closing remark to Charlie Kirk, a devout Christian. Why not just wish to see him in Sto-Vo-Kor with the great Klingon warriors?— Steve Baker (@SteveBakerUSA) September 12, 2025“I’ll see you in Valhalla.”That phrase has zero connection to America or Christianity. It’s not even Indian or Hindu. Valhalla is literally a mythological, metaphorical place.And yet Kash chose it as his closing line.They’re not even hiding it anymore. Pure political…— Matt Kim (@FreeMattKim) September 12, 2025Advertisement
Kash Patel saying "See you in Valhalla" is quite something. pic.twitter.com/yDecoy6lEs— Lars Thorsell (@LarsThorsell) September 12, 2025Considering Kirk’s devout Christianity, saying you’ll see him in the pagan afterlife is weird.
