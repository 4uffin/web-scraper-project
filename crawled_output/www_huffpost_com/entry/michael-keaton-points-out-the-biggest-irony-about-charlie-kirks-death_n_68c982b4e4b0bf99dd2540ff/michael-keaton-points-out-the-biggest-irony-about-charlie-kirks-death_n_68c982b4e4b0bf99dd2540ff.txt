He continued, “Because in the end, shooting people will never answer anything, and the irony that he was killed with a gun is unbelievable.”Kirk, who was fatally shot during an event in Utah on Sept. 10, was an extremely vocal and unapologetic advocate for the Second Amendment.“It’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment,” Kirk said at a 2023 event organized by TPUSA Faith, the religious arm of Kirk’s conservative group Turning Point USA, a quote that has been widely shared among his critics after the shooting.Advertisement
Keaton wasn’t the only speaker at the IRE gala to mention Kirk’s killing. “60 Minutes” journalist Scott Pelley pointed out how the motives behind his death are similar to those of former Democratic Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, who were fatally shot in an attack at their home in June.

“Many admired Kirk; many did not,” Pelley continued. “His catchphrase was ‘Prove me wrong.’ To some, that phrase was controversial — even dismissive. But the core idea was: Bring the proof and let’s debate.”“Whether you agreed with Kirk’s ideas or Hortman’s, their murders, their silencing is blood on the First Amendment,” he concluded.Relatedcharlie kirkmichael keatonpolitical violenceCharlie Kirk Will Be Awarded The Presidential Medal of Freedom After His DeathJesse Watters’ ‘War’ Remarks After Charlie Kirk’s Killing Have Experts Sharing 1 Dire WarningExperts Are Calling Out The Right For Ironic Move After Charlie Kirk's Murder Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
