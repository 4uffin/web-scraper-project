Trump has threatened federal funding cuts for universities over pro-Palestinian student protests. The government alleges universities allowed antisemitism during the protests.Pro-Palestinian protesters, including some Jewish groups, say the government wrongly equates their criticism of Israel’s assault on Gaza and its occupation of Palestinian territories with antisemitism and their advocacy for Palestinian rights with support for extremism.Experts have raised free speech, due process and academic freedom concerns over the Republican president’s threats. Trump has also attempted to deport foreign pro-Palestinian student protesters but has faced legal hurdles.Advertisement
“UC is committed to protecting the privacy of our students, faculty, and staff to the greatest extent possible, while fulfilling its legal obligations,” a spokesperson of the office of the UC president added.UC Berkeley said the names of the 160 students, faculty and staff were sent to the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights and affected members of the campus were notified by the institution last week.It added the Education Department launched an investigation several months ago into its handling of complaints related to “alleged incidents of antisemitism” and demanded documentation.Advertisement
“Numerous documents were provided over recent months to OCR, including the names of individuals in those reports,” it added.Protesters march on campus at UC Berkeley on March 11, 2025.

Both accepted certain government demands. Settlement talks with Harvard University are ongoing.Advertisement
The Trump administration has also faced some judicial roadblocks in its drive to freeze federal funding.The government had proposed to settle its probe into the University of California, Los Angeles — another UC campus — through a $1 billion payment from the university. California Governor Gavin Newsom dismissed that offer, calling it an extortion attempt.PowerOurJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour membership fuels reporting that informs, inspires, and holds power accountable.
