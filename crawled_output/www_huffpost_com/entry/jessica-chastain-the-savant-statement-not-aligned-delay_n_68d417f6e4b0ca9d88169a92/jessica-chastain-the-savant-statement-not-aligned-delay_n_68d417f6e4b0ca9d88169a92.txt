“After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone The Savant,” said Apple’s statement. “We appreciate your understanding and look forward to releasing the series at a future date.” Chastain, who executive-produced the show and stars as a top-secret investigator who examines hate groups, alluded to them on Wednesday on social media.“I wanted to reach out and let you know that we’re not aligned on the decision to pause the release of The Savant,” she wrote on Instagram. “In the last five years since we’ve been making the show, we’ve seen an unfortunate amount of violence in the United States.”Advertisement
Chastain went on to cite numerous examples, including the attempted kidnapping of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-Mich.), assassination plots against President Donald Trump and the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University earlier this month.“These incidents, though far from encompassing the full range of violence witnessed in the United States, illustrate a broader mindset that crosses the political spectrum and must be confronted,” the actor wrote in her post, which was accompanied by a video of her text.“I’ve never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn’t so relevant, unfortunately it is,” she continued. “The Savant is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honoring their courage feels more urgent than ever.”Advertisement
Political tensions across the country have reached a fever pitch in recent weeks, with Kirk’s killing prompting escalatory rhetoric from numerous conservative pundits, lawmakers and the president himself. Chastain, an executive producer on the show, praised her "incredible collaborators" at Apple.Jordan Strauss/Invision/Associated Press“The Savant” was inspired by a 2019 Cosmopolitan article by journalist Andrea Stanley, who chronicled following the titular investigator’s attempts to thwart “the next large-scale attack.” In the trailer, Chastain’s character warns that “innocent Americans are going to die.”Advertisement
Kirk’s death was captured on video by people in the crowd who had gathered to watch the late Turning Point USA founder debate students. A suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, has been charged with aggravated murder and multiple other crimes.“While I respect Apple’s decision to pause the release for now, I remain hopeful the show will reach audiences soon,” Chastain wrote Wednesday. “Until then, I’m wishing safety and strength for everyone, and I’ll let you know if and when The Savant is released.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
