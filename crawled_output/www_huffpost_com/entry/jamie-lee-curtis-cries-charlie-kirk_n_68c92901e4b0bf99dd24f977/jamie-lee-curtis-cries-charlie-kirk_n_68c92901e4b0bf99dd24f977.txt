“I’m going to bring something up with you just because it’s front of mind,” she said. “Charlie Crist was killed two days ago.”After Maron corrected her slip of the tongue, Curtis said, “I just called him Crist, I think, because of Christ, because of his deep, deep belief.” (Charlie Crist was the name of a Florida governor.)Her voice cracked as she went on about Kirk.“I disagreed with him on almost every point I ever heard him say, but I believe he was a man of faith, and I hope in that moment when he died, that he felt connected to his faith,” she said, sobbing. “Even though ... his ideas were abhorrent to me, I still believe he’s a father and a husband and a man of faith. And I hope whatever connection to God means that he felt it.”Advertisement
