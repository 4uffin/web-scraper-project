Promising review: "These stackable stools are perfect for my tiny home! I love their minimalist design and how versatile they are — I use them as nightstands, side tables, and extra seating when needed. They’re sturdy, functional, and blend beautifully with my space. Definitely recommend if you’re looking for stylish, space-saving furniture." — Renato Burati$190 at Amazon2Amazon, www.amazon.comA bamboo pantry if you'd like to elegantly hide away your overflowing dishesPromising review: "Exactly as pictured. It looks nice and high quality. Assembly was pretty easy, and the needed tools were included. Very well and carefully packaged, it arrived in perfect condition. I love the size, design, and functionality. I got it to store glasses by my water cooler, and it’s perfect with the adjustable shelf. Overall — love it!" — Pamela H.$84 at Amazon3www.amazon.comA floating bookshelfPsst — the elastic bands work with paperback AND hardcover books.
Promising review: "I love these shelves. We have limited shelf space, so these are perfect. The installation was easy; it took only about 20–30 minutes. The shelves are very sturdy and well-designed. I like that they are compact, but you can fit so many books underneath, so they don't take up much space on the wall. Due to a lack of space, we got rid of many of our books, but we will be able to start collecting again, thanks to these. If you are on the fence about whether or not to buy these, don't hesitate, you won't regret it." — Tiffani$33 at AmazonAdvertisement
4Amazon, www.amazon.comA toy hammock in a gorgeous macrame designThe kit includes LED star lights, star wall decals, and a setup kit complete with three hooks and anchors. Also, the hammock measures about 56"x42"!
Promising review: "SO cute, SO high quality. My partner and I own a lot of stuffed animals. They were taking over the entire house. Stuffies EVERYWHERE! I was not expecting this to be so beautiful and sturdy in person, and I couldn’t be happier! I love that it came with a string light and star stickers, too. Absolutely precious. I don’t have kids, but I’m a kid at heart, and this was everything I could hope for! It saves us so much room, and it looks so nice! It’s high-quality, thick material. I love that it comes in my favorite shade of gray, and it holds a stupendous amount of plushies with no issues." — Skye$36 at AmazonAdvertisement
5AmazonAn accent chair with a footrest that slides out and doubles as a storage ottomanPromising review: "Just when I thought my reading nook couldn't get any cozier, this chair walked into my life. It's like sitting on a cloud with its plush upholstery, and perfect for snuggling into with a good book. It also comes with a storage ottoman — ideal for hiding away my reading clutter. It's modern, stylish, and fits beautifully in any room. Plus, the cream color adds a touch of elegance. A true gem for anyone looking to enhance their living space with comfort and style!" — none ya$257 at Amazon6Covogoods / Etsy, Covogoods / EtsyA panel of clutter-hiding books that'll fit seamlessly around an ugly power stripCovogoods is a Utah-based, woman-founded small business that specializes in storage solutions crafted from up-cycled books.
Promising review: "I love our fake books! I don’t like a lot of stuff out and having the router and everything else on my counter was frustrating me. I’m so glad I ordered this, because now my kitchen counter looks so much neater!" — Nicole Marko Polo$29 at Amazon HandmadeAdvertisement
7www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA lift-top coffee tablePromising review: "This is a unique table. It's perfect for my needs. I draw a lot. I can draw without leaning over. Then I can put the papers inside the table and all is clean and clear. It opens so smoothly that I don't have to remove the plant or other decorations to open and close it. I do remove drinks just to be safe. I should have bought it a long time ago." — CB$106 at Amazon8Amazon, AmazonOr, an adjustable side table if you're living true shoebox-stylePromising review: "Easy to assemble — quicker with two people, but this 79-year-old woman did it by herself! Easy to roll around and tilted top makes a wonderful book stand while reading, using a laptop or tablet. Sturdy and nice storage." — Judith Thomas$110 at Amazon9Amazon, AmazonA pack of space-saving hangersPromising review: "I was expecting these to create space, but I am blown away by how easy they were to use and how much they opened things up. My closet went from packed to bursting, and I was not able to even remove items to wear, let alone see what they were aside from a glimpse at a sleeve, to having room to add even more items and being able to see what each item is. They: - are easy to use -created 30% more space -don't have to be opened back up to remove items." — M. Stokely And if you've got bulkier items taking up space in your closet, these vacuum storage bags can help shrink 'em down!$23 at AmazonAdvertisement
10www.amazon.com, AmazonA rectangular lazy Susan that'll help reduce the clutter in your fridgeCheck out a TikTok of the rectangular lazy Susan in action.
Promising review: "Wow! I love this turntable organizer! I can fit so many items on it, and because of that, I now have so much more space on the door shelves.
With this organizer, I will have easy access to all of those extra items that just don't have their own space. Now they do have a place to go! I would highly recommend this product to
everyone who wants to feel more organized and doesn't want to lose items in their fridge." — Amazon Customer $20 at Amazon11www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA portable game board storage casePromising review: "We loved these containers and have now bought 20 to hold our entire game closet! We have been able to fit several games in some. Easy to store and easy for my kids to find and then put away when finished. Good quality, haven't had any problems with durability yet, and we play a LOT of games." — bradfieldfamily$49 at Amazon12Amazon, AmazonA wooden shoe bench for anyone who's committed to a strict "no shoes inside" policyPromising review: "The quality is fantastic! And it took me less than ten minutes to put together. It comes with everything you need to build it and really helps make my apartment look more organized." — Janette Sanchez$150 at AmazonAdvertisement
13www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comOr, a shoe rack organizer perfect for a larger collection of kicksDepending on your shoe size, this can fit a different number of pairs.
Promising review: "Obsessed with this cabinet. The quality is great for the price, and it’s so stylish and doesn’t take up much space for the storage it provides! I added a few hooks on the side to be able to hang dog leashes. The only con would be if you have large feet, you aren’t going to be able to fit as many pairs of shoes in. My size ten shoes fit just right, but my husband's shoes sometimes have to go sideways, so I can only fit one to three pairs in the bottom drawer. But still better than on the floor!" — Nancy$97 at Amazon14Amazon, AmazonA beanbag cover to store your kid's stuffiesPromising review: "These are perfect for any kids’ room! I was getting so tired of messy stuffed animals and blankets all over, so it’s nice to have them out of sight but still easily accessible. My 2-year-old loves to sit on hers and read books. She doesn’t have a ton of stuffed animals, so there is plenty of room to add to it for when her collection grows. I love the fun bright print and sturdiness — she drags it all over the ground, but I don’t worry about it tearing at all. Just what she needed in her room." — dd$25 at Amazon15www.amazon.com, AmazonA magnetic stove shelfPsst — it comes assembled and ready to install, so no tools needed!
Promising review: "The shelf installed in a snap. It has two sturdy magnets that hold it securely onto the slightly rounded back of my stove. I felt comfortable setting a full jar of honey on it, and I haven’t seen it move at all as I have been cooking. I have limited space in the kitchen, so I’m really happy to have an additional place to set things I need frequently. It doesn’t look like an add-on;
it looks like part of the stove. I’m really happy with it!" — Sylvia J. And if you're looking for some spice jars for that extra clean look, these have over 11,000 5-star ratings!$40 at AmazonAdvertisement
16www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAnd a magnetic fridge shelfPromising review: " Before and after picture. I was able to clear up space on my countertop by having this magnetic storage on the side of the fridge. The magnet is Super Strong, let me tell you. I could barely move it once it was stuck on — not like a normal magnet. I could always move it on the other side of the refrigerator and replace it later if it makes more sense, but for now it’s placed perfectly for how we maneuver in our kitchen. We live in an apartment, so vertical space is always something I’m looking to utilize. Great product I would recommend highly. — Kevin And if that magnetic knife holder in the reviewer image is catching your eye, they purchased this one and gave it a
5-star review!$23 at Amazon17www.amazon.comA tool organizing rackPromising review: "Love this broom/mop holder. So nice to save space and stay organized. Holds them so firm and flat to wall. Also has hooks that fold out as needed. I recommend this to anyone looking for space-saving storage!" — Jaclyn$17 at Amazon18www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA rattan litter box enclosureIf your cat is prone to kicking the litter every time they go to the bathroom, you may still want to use a mat outside the box to catch any spills.
Promising review: "I wish I had bought this sooner. It looks really nice in my living room. I previously had a white wooden box that was twice this size, but this new one fits my small home and decor much more nicely. It's lightweight and easy to move for cleaning and completely hides the cat box. I like that it's a plastic-type material that looks like rattan or natural material, bc if my cat happens to miss his box, I can easily disinfect and clean the hideaway. I have my mind set up sideways so my dog can't get in and eat turds. — A.M.$61 at AmazonAdvertisement
19www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA tilt-out hamperIt comes with a removable liner for the hamper that can be easily lifted out and wiped clean with a damp cloth.
Promising review: "Straightforward assembly and a beautiful product, I was really happy.
This looks perfect in a small bathroom, and hides the unsightly laundry pile nicely. I keep makeup on top and extra toilet papers in middle, with plenty of space. The bamboo is nice and water resistant too, so deals well with humidity." — AJohns$70 at Amazon20www.amazon.comA set of rust-proof, adhesive shower shelvesPromising review: "I saw these shelves on TikTok and really wanted to try them out, as I have no shelves in my shower. The adhesion is impressive — they’ve stayed stuck for the past two weeks with no sign of letting up, and are holding about four bottles of products on each of the two racks I have hanging. I thought for sure they would fall after showering or something, but they have stayed strong and held up. I’m so impressed! I’m sure I will purchase more in the future. Super duper easy to install, they look beautiful and modern, and give my bathroom a totally different vibe. It’s so nice to have a product like this available!! Thank you!" — Sara B$36 at Amazon21www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA slim storage cartPromising review: "I have a very small kitchen. This little cart gives me a handy place to keep kitchen items and gives me back much-needed counter space. I like the wheels so I can easily move it out of the way." — Diane Goble$54 at AmazonAdvertisement
22Amazon, AmazonA cabinet shelf organizer to maximize the space you havePromising review: "EXACTLY what we were looking for. Oak color blends right into the interior of the cabinets, and white supports match our dishes. Going to, for sure, buy more for every cabinet in the house. Instantly gained twice the storage. No longer have to pick up a stack of dishes to grab a tray, etc. Bargain as well. Looks way better and supports so much more than old wire shelves... Solid wood/metal. Easy to install each shelf with nothing but the four screws included and a Phillips head screwdriver. Had all four 'built' in less than five minutes. 100% recommend! — Amazon Customer$27 at Amazon23www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA sturdy storage bench for a gloriously spacious spot to throw in your blanketsPromising review: "This ottoman is exceptional quality for the price and has done wonders for my bedroom space. It stores a lot, and in a smaller apartment like mine, any aesthetically pleasing storage solution is a lifesaver for cutting down on clutter." — Natalie Rose$100 at Amazon24AmazonOr, a minimalist storage ottomanPromising review: "Exactly what I was looking for! I needed a small ottoman for my little reading corner in my bedroom and found the perfect fit! It’s small enough to fit the space but large enough to be comfortable. It has plenty of storage for a nice-sized blanket. It has thick fabric. It’s all around great quality! Don’t regret this purchase!!!!" — J Quinones$77 at AmazonAdvertisement
25www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA hanging jewelry cabinet that doubles as a full-length mirrorIt also comes with everything you need to mount it on your wall or door.
Promising review: "For the first time in a very long time, I have access to ALL MY JEWELRY! I've had a tendency to leave my jewelry in boxes all over, and when I needed something, I could never find it. Besides that, it was usually tangled up and not readily available. Now, I have a beautiful display cabinet with lights and a lock! It's well-made and I absolutely love it! I highly recommend this display jewelry box… You won't be disappointed. I hung mine on the wall because I liked the look better. But, it comes with the brackets of you wanted to keep it behind the door. 👍👍" — CindyS$130 at Amazon26www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA pair of versatile shelf dividersPromising review: "Love it. Love it. So glad I bought them. They have made the top of my closet go from chaos to beautifully organized. I can now find my shoes and have been able to stack some of my winter clothes. They are very sturdy. They were easy to install and slide based on the distance needed between items. My mom saw my closet a few weeks ago and ended up getting some for herself. I would highly recommend buying them." — Rivermont0326$18 at Amazon27www.amazon.comA steel toilet paper stockerPromising review: "I really love it. Living in a shoebox in NY, I constantly look for storage solutions. This design is incredible. It takes up so little footprint and fits perfectly between the toilet bowl and the wall, and is very functional. I hate having to go to the deli store to get a couple of rolls of toilet paper at a time. Now I can get 12 rolls at a time, though if you get the larger rolls, they won't come through the hole on the bottom. You will have to retrieve the larger rolls by removing the top, which is not a big deal. I put a wonderful Olavie diffuser and body scrub on top, and it looks really nice. It's a must-have for any small apartment living!" — Ken H$68 at AmazonAdvertisement
28www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAn adjustable ceiling garage rackPromising review: "We needed extra garage storage in our new home, and this garage rack solved that problem! It came with clear directions for installation. For the easiest installation, I suggest you have a second person for help. The moment we took the rack out, we immediately noticed the high-quality material it was made out of. If you need a garage storage solution, we can't recommend it enough! 10/10, 5 stars!" — JJ$131 at AmazonReviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.
