After Perkins ordered Kirk’s favored beverage, which has since been popularized by his supporters — a “Mint Majesty” tea with two honeys — the barista wrote “racists fav drink” on Perkins’ cup.Charlie Kirk, left, and a picture Autumn Perkins shared of her Starbucks order, right.Getty Images/Facebook (Autumn Perkins)“The girl at Starbucks thought she was cute,” Perkins wrote in the Sep. 21 post alongside a photo of the message on her drink. “I don’t even support Starbucks [because] of everything they stand for starting with their satanic logo, but I support Charlie Kirk so I thought you know what…I’ll get his drink.” (The Starbucks logo features a mermaid.)Advertisement
Perkins continued: “Thank you Starbucks for proving to me exactly why I prefer to support my small local Christian owned and operated coffee shop. Well done [applause emoji].” Kirk was fatally shot while speaking with students at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. In the aftermath of his death, the Trump administration and others have attempted to silence critics of Kirk’s bigoted, racist, xenophobic and misogynistic remarks.In a statement to HuffPost, a Starbucks spokesperson said, “Writing this on a cup is unacceptable. We have policies that prohibit negative messages to help preserve a welcoming environment.”Advertisement
The spokesperson added that the unidentified employee has been terminated by Kroger. The Starbucks location is operated and licensed by Kroger. Perkins couldn’t be reached for comment.

The campaign, called “Get Charlie Kirk’s Starbucks Order On Every Starbucks Menu,” kicked off on Change.org on Sept. 14. Nearly a week after Kirk’s death, Starbucks said in a press release that it has “clear policies that prohibit political slogans or negative messages to help preserve a welcoming environment.”Advertisement
The coffee chain also noted that a customer is entitled to “use a different name — including the name Charlie Kirk” if they desire when placing an order.RelatedStarbuckscharlie kirkStarbucks, Union Approach 4-Year Mark Without A ContractStarbucks CEO’s Pay Was Over 6,000 Times More Than Typical Barista’s Last YearStarbucks Is Beefing With Its Workers Over A New Dress CodeRudy Giuliani Is Thrilled With Starbucks' Latest Announcement About Charlie Kirk Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
