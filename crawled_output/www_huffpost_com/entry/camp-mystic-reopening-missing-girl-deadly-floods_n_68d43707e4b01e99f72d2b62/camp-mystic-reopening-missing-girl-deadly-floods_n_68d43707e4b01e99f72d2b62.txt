The camp’s Lake Cypress location will reopen, but not the Guadalupe River location, which was most affected by the deadly flooding, the email says.Advertisement
“We are not only rebuilding cabins and trails, but also a place where laughter, friendship and spiritual growth will continue to flourish,” reads the email, obtained by CBS Austin. “As we work to finalize plans, we will do so in a way that’s mindful of those we have lost.”But the families of those who died in the flooding are reportedly not happy with the camp’s reopening. The family of 8-year-old flood victim Eloise Peck told Fox 4 that the families of the dead campers and counselors were not consulted about the reopening and did not approve the planned memorial. Peck’s family added that all resources should be used to find Cile Steward, an 8-year-old camper who has yet to be located. Cici Steward, Cile’s mom, said in a statement that Camp Mystic “failed our daughters.”“Recovery teams are still out there, scouring the river, risking and sacrificing so much to find her so we can finally lay her to rest. For their efforts, we are eternally grateful,” she said, according to The New York Times. “Camp Mystic, however, has only added to our grief.”Advertisement
She continued: “For my family, these months have felt like an eternity. For the camp, it seems like nothing more than a brief pause before business as usual. Camp Mystic is pressing ahead with reopening, even if it means inviting girls to swim in the same river that may potentially still hold my daughter’s body.”A 10-foot cross is seen along the banks of the Guadalupe River in front of Camp Mystic on July 18, 2025, in Hunt, Texas.

In a separate email to the families of the dead campers, the Eastland family said they had “not been perfect at communicating,” according to the Times, adding that the “distance that has grown between some of us saddens us all.”In a statement to HuffPost, Camp Mystic said it had “received no negative comments from any of the bereaved families regarding plans to reopen or build a memorial to the 27 campers and counselors.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

The email also said that campers will not return to cabins that had floodwaters inside them, and promised more information on signing up for camp next summer.“You mean the world to us, and we look forward to welcoming you back inside the green gates,” the email reads.
