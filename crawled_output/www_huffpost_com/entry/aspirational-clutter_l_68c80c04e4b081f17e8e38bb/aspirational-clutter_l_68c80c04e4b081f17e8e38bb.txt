Here’s What You Should Know.Professional organizers reveal how this kind of mess sneaks into our homes and why it’s so hard to part with.By Caroline BolognaSenior Reporter, HuffPost LifeSep 23, 2025, 07:00 AM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGWe’ve all dealt with clutter: the junk drawer full of mystery cords, the receipts stuffed into bags, the pantry items past their prime.But not all clutter is created equal. And some of the hardest things to part with are the objects tied to our hopes and dreams. Think “aspirational clutter.”Advertisement
What exactly is aspirational clutter, and how does it impact our lives? Below, professional organizers break down this common phenomenon and ways to tackle these items to achieve actual happiness. What is aspirational clutter?“Aspirational clutter refers to possessions we hold onto for our ‘future self,’ or an idealized future lifestyle,” said Seana Turner, founder of The Seana Method. “Aspirational clutter can be anything, but some common examples include untouched hobby supplies, unused fitness equipment or clothing we hope to ‘fit into again someday.’”As these items go unused, they simply become clutter in your home, as valuable kitchen cabinet space is devoted to highly specialized baking gadgets you’ve never used, and your closets fill up with fancy ball gowns that still have their tags on.

“These things tend to represent an idealized, unrealistic version of ourselves,” said Tova Weinstock, the professional organizer behind Tidy Tova. “That old, sentimental T-shirt collection ― ‘I’m going to turn them into a quilt.’ Painting supplies from the college years when you took a class ― ‘I’d love to start painting again!’ Cutouts from magazines of things that ‘inspired’ you at the time ― ‘One day I’m going to decorate my house and use them as inspo.’”You might fantasize about making elaborate cakes, diving into cool crafting projects or reading all the Penguin Classics. But the reality doesn’t exactly match this vision. Still, the supplies sit there quietly, taking up space and reminding us of unmet goals. The aspirational clutter problem extends beyond physical items to the time and energy we spend thinking about the life you could be living, rather than focusing on the one you actually have and taking action.

“There’s the gym equipment that never gets used, an expensive dress that’s too small, a pasta maker when you never make pasta ― but the worst aspirational clutter is social media,” said professional organizer Barbara Reich of Life Organized.Why do people hold on to aspirational clutter?“People keep aspirational clutter because it represents hope, identity and endless possibilities,” said professional organizer Regina Lark. “Letting it go can feel like giving up on a dream version of yourself, or that you’ve failed yourself in some way.”Aspirational clutter differs from ordinary clutter, such as receipts or expired pantry items, because it evokes complex feelings of guilt and unfulfilled potential, which can make letting go of this stuff quite disheartening.

“We hold on to aspirational clutter because it represents who we want to be,” said Dina Smith, a professional organizer and founder of Closet Therapy with Dina. “The treadmill holds the promise of a healthier self. The Pinterest boards symbolize a creative self we imagine we’ll finally have time for. At first, those items feel exciting and motivating. But over time, when they go unused, they quietly shift from symbols of possibility to reminders of what we haven’t done.”People may feel that as long as they have these items, they still have the possibility or likelihood of pursuing certain goals. “But it’s usually not a truly strong, realistic desire,” noted Lisa Zaslow, professional organizer with Gotham Organizers. “Otherwise, they would be using the item. Some people knit sweaters. Others hold onto bags of yarn and knitting needles, hoping they will be the kind of person who knits sweaters.” Advertisement

“The downside is that it clogs your home with guilt and ‘shoulds,’ reminding you of what you’re not doing instead of celebrating who you are in the moment,” Lark said. “Over time, that self-criticism erodes both mental clarity and physical space.”She believes that holding onto unused items can make you feel like a failure and lead you into the trap of comparing yourself to others, assuming the people you see are more successful. It’s a toxic cycle. “The guilt creeps in ― the money we spent, the time we never made, the goals left unfinished,” Smith said. “It becomes a constant, subtle weight on our minds.”Advertisement
That is all the more reason to let go of these harmful reminders, Zaslow explained. “The irony is that aspirational clutter doesn’t inspire people to take action,” she said. “It makes them feel bad about themselves.”She pointed to the example of a client’s tortilla press, which she had purchased with the hope of becoming the kind of person who prepares homemade tortillas from scratch.“She envisioned herself surrounded by her family in her kitchen as she rolled out and pressed perfect, warm tortillas for taco dinners,” Zaslow said. “But, she didn’t. At first, she professed that she really wanted to make them and wanted to keep the press. Then she got a bit sheepish about the fact that she never made them. After a couple of years, she laughed about it, realized she could let go of the idea that she should be a woman who could ‘do it all,’ along with the tortilla press.”Advertisement
How can people tackle their aspirational clutter?“I encourage clients to give themselves permission to let go and move on,” Turner said. “Tying ourselves to objects which, for a variety of reasons, are no longer serving us is equivalent to making ourselves carry around a backpack full of bricks.”Instead, it’s better to take a look at who you are at the present moment and determine what your current goals are. Katie Hubbard of Turn It Tidy emphasized that your aspirations may no longer align with your past goals, which is totally natural as life evolves. “For example, you might want to start a new hobby, like crocheting,” she said. “Maybe you buy all your supplies, but find out you’re going to be a first-time mom. With a new baby, you won’t have time to crochet, and it’s not a failure to let go of the supplies. Priorities shift, and it’s essential to recognize that.”Advertisement
As you face your own aspirational clutter, be kind and compassionate to yourself. Embrace that it’s OK to not be a certain type of person right now, even if you at one point envisioned yourself that way. Allow yourself to process any disappointment or grief, and then prioritize the life you are actually living. “Then, focus on the benefits of letting it go,” Zaslow urged. “You’ll have more space for the things you do use. Your home will look and feel better. You’ll free up mental and emotional energy when you’re not constantly reminded of what you’re not doing.”As for the nitty-gritty of the decluttering process, the key is developing a system to overcome the initial hurdles.

“Sometimes it’s just really scary to let go, and lots of emotions can come to the surface,” Weinstock said. “Start with ‘lower hanging fruit’ and get rid of something that doesn’t sting ― you’ll instantly feel relief. As you get more comfortable getting rid of the aspirational clutter, it will actually start feeling great. I see this all of the time with clients throughout a working day. The beginning can feel painful, but by the end, they truly feel liberated and lighter.”Focus on utilizing your valuable storage space on items you actually use and need.“Most people don’t have space for the essentials, so by eliminating the aspirational clutter, they can live in the here and now more comfortably and efficiently,” Reich said. Julie Naylon of No Wire Hangers Professional Organizing recommended asking how long each “aspirational” item has gone unused and how hard it would be to replace it, if and when you decide you actually want to use it.Advertisement
“Over the years, technology and style change, so maybe you will want something different in the future,” she noted. Lark similarly suggested asking yourself, “Will adding this project to my life today serve my life today?” If the answer is no, then donate, gift or recycle it. “When clients struggle to part with items, I instruct them to designate a small area for aspirational clutter,” Hubbard said. “They must select items based on what they believe is most essential. Go down from most to least essential.”Advertisement
For example, with crochet supplies you’ve never used, perhaps you don’t need to hold onto endless skeins of yarn, but you could keep one small crochet kit. “It’s small enough to fit in a designated area but enables one to keep their dreams alive without letting clutter take over their space,” Hubbard explained. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

You just need to have a plan. “If you are unable to say goodbye to something, maybe add a label with a reasonable expiration date on it,” Naylon said. “This will give you some time to think about it and could be a motivational tool to use it or lose it.”Advertisement
