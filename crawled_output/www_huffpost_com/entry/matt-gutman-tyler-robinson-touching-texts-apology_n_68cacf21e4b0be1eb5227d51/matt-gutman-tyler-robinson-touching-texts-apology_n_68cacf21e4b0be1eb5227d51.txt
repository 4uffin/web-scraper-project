Ron DeSantis (“Legacy media in all its glory”), Indiana Sen. Jim Banks (“Wait, what???”) Fox News host Will Cain (“Fundamentally, irredeemably, broken”) and Meghan McCain (“Is everyone @ABC out of their minds?!”).Advertisement
After the prosecution laid out its case at a press conference with text messages as evidence, Gutman focused on Robinson’s lovey-dovey language: “It was very touching in a way that many of us didn’t expect.

On Wednesday, Gutman addressed the outrage he’d provoked:“Yesterday I tried to underscore the jarring contrast between this cold blooded assassination of Charlie Kirk - a man who dedicated his life to public dialogue - and the personal, disturbing texts read aloud by the Utah County Attorney at the press conference,” Gutman, ABC’s chief national correspondent, wrote on X.“I deeply regret that my words did not make that clear,” he continued. “But let there be zero doubt here: I unequivocally condemn this horrific crime and the pain it caused Charlie Kirk’s family, those who were forced to witness it at UVU, and the millions of people he inspired.”1.
