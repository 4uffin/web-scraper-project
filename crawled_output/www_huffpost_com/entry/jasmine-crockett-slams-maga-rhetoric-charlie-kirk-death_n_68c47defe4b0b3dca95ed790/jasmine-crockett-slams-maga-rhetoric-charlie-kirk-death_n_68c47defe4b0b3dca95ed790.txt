Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) is tearing into conservatives who “immediately” blamed Democrats for the death of Charlie Kirk, the right-wing activist and President Donald Trump ally who was fatally shot Wednesday at Utah Valley University.Crockett condemned the partisan rhetoric during an appearance on “The Breakfast Club.”“I hate that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle immediately came out and they were like, ‘Oh, you know, this is on the Democrats,’” Crockett said Friday. “Like, we don’t even know who did what. And ya’ll are like, ‘This is on the Democrats.’”Advertisement
Numerous conservatives have argued that Democrats and the media are to blame for Kirk’s death. Fox News host Jesse Watters told his viewers that “they” are “at war with us,” while Trump directly accused “the radical left” during an Oval Office address on Wednesday.“I mean obviously, the first thing that anybody would say, and you didn’t have any Democrat that went out there and said otherwise, is, ‘We’re denouncing political violence,’” Crockett said Friday, adding that it hasn’t even been confirmed that Kirk’s killing was political.The Democrat explained that most of the violence she saw during her time as a criminal defense attorney was personal. She went on to do what some of her Republican peers haven’t, however, by noting that this doesn’t confirm a motive for Kirk’s shooter, either.Advertisement
“And still, even if it came from our side of the aisle,” said Crockett. “Let’s assume the worst.”“OK, let’s talk about it,” she continued. “Let’s talk about what ‘radicalized’ him, right? We’ve seen writings and manifestos, and we’ve seen where it looks like — the two people that went after the president, before he was the president — had ties to the Republican Party.”Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was gunned down after attempting to assassinate Trump in Pennsylvania last year, was reportedly a registered Republican. Ryan Routh, who allegedly tried to shoot Trump at his Florida golf club, reportedly once supported him.Trump on Wednesday blamed "the radical left" for the "terrorism" that cost Kirk his life.Julia Demaree Nikhinson/Associated PressAdvertisement
Crockett noted that some conservatives blamed the trans community for Kirk’s death “as soon as it happened.” Donald Trump Jr. and Megyn Kelly respectively said Thursday that trans people are “more violent” than Al-Qaeda and that many are “murderous.”While a suspect in Kirk’s shooting has been caught, a motive remains unclear. Shell casings found at the scene were inscribed with “transgender and antifascist ideology,” according to a Wall Street Journal article. Those details, however, are already being walked back in an editor’s note.Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.

“There’s no legislation that they [Republicans] want to bring,” she added. “Every time you say ‘white supremacy,’ they want to yell, ‘Oh, you’re race-baiting.’ No, I am going on facts.”RelatedDonald Trumpmagajasmine crockettcharlie kirkJesse Watters’ ‘War’ Remarks After Charlie Kirk’s Killing Have Experts Sharing 1 Dire WarningTrump Rejects Opportunity To Unite Country In Wake Of Kirk Death: 'I Couldn't Care Less'The Backlash To Charlie Kirk's Killing Is Already Disturbing.
