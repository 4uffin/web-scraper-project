I feel very happy to be up here with you, nevertheless, and that way you speak more from the heart. I can only say that whoever is operating this teleprompter is in big trouble.”Advertisement
Fox News’ Laura Ingraham shared the moment on social media. She praised Trump for not missing “a beat” and suggested that former President Joe Biden would have had terrible issues had it happened to him.Vance shared Ingraham’s post accompanied by a series of laughing emojis.🤣🤣🤣https://t.co/NsPSaejzLK— JD Vance (@JDVance) September 23, 2025Then, following up, the VP posted: “All kidding aside did everyone notice how despite the lack of a teleprompter, he delivered a clear, reasonable address on US foreign policy?It’s nice to have a president with a brain!”All kidding aside did everyone notice how despite the lack of a teleprompter, he delivered a clear, reasonable address on US foreign policy? It's nice to have a president with a brain!— JD Vance (@JDVance) September 23, 2025Critics took issue with Vance’s characterization of Trump’s speech and the final part of his post:“It's nice to have a president with a brain!”If you find one, let me know. The current one is a moron, and that’s being charitable.— MikeBates (@MikeBates) September 23, 2025You mean parody speech! What a clown— Elham Ishmael ✍︎ (@EIshmael_) September 23, 2025Advertisement
Trump's UN speech was his worst EVER. How do you not see how deeply embarrassing this is?— 𝐂𝐡𝐢𝐝𝐢 (@ChidiNwatu) September 23, 2025Mass delusion https://t.co/wtuEItsFaf— kuss (@dontkuss) September 23, 2025Did you just say, “a clear, reasonable address (by Trump)”, @JDVance ? Get yourself checked with a neuropsychiatrist, Vance, and do it ASAP! https://t.co/owVklr5KR0— Priyanka (@prinstaz) September 23, 2025Advertisement
Seriously?— Irfan Ali (@iiamirfanali) September 23, 2025He was reading in monotone with skills less than a third-grader. His speech was offensive and full of lies. You guys continue to make us a worldwide embarrassment while insulting allies.— The Great Gig in the Sky (@thegreatgig8) September 23, 2025Actually no. It was awful and embarrassing.— Trump Tracker (@trackingdonald) September 23, 2025Advertisement
Anatomically, we all have a 'brain'.So trump having one is not the win you think it is...— olli'smom (@Ollies_Mother) September 23, 2025That's what you would call this?It was an utter joke.— Ryca (@_oRyca_) September 23, 2025It's strange when you have to emphasize that as something special. It should be a matter of course for a president to master this.— Lepus (@LepusNox) September 23, 2025Advertisement
Clear and reasonable? Which speech were you watching? He gave a campaign speech meant for simpletons to world leaders 🤦♂️— Lib Dunk (@libdunkmedia) September 23, 2025The bar is set so low at this point that our president gets credit for being able to speak.— Angry Millennial (@AngryMillenia1) September 23, 2025TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
