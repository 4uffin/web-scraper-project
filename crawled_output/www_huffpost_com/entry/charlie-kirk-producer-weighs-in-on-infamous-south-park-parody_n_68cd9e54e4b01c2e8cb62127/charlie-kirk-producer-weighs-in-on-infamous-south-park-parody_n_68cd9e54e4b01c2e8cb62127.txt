The episode also skewered Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Vice President JD Vance, and the government’s ICE raids on migrants, but Kirk seemed to take it in stride, sharing a clip on social media and writing, “Not bad, Cartman.”The episode can still be watched on Paramount+, but earlier this week Andrew Kolvet, a former producer for Kirk, said his former boss would have not liked his episode being “buried.”“Hey @paramountplus, as someone who can speak with some authority on this, Charlie loved that he was featured in South Park. He told me many times. He would want the episode back up,” he wrote.Advertisement
