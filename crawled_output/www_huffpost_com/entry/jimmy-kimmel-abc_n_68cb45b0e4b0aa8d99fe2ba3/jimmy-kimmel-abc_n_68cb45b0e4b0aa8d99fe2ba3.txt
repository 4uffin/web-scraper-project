Kimmel’s monologue came after Republicans swiftly blamed “the radical left” in the aftermath of Kirk’s killing despite having limited information about the suspected shooter and motive at the time. Kimmel then went on to mock President Donald Trump for talking about the construction of his ballroom after a person asked him about Kirk’s death. Video of the monologue is available via Kimmel’s YouTube channel here. Advertisement
ABC pulled Kimmel’s show indefinitely in the wake of his comments as conservatives — and FCC Chair Brendan Carr — seized on them, accusing the late night host of misleading viewers about the ideology of the suspected shooter. ″@jimmykimmel is explicitly stating that MAGA killed Charlie Kirk and is victim blaming the assassination on Charlie’s movement,” YouTuber Benny Johnson alleged.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

“It’s another example of Donald Trump’s administration’s threats to free speech, or at least free speech that doesn’t praise Trump,” Goodykoontz wrote in a Wednesday column about ABC’s decision.
