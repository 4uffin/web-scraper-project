So you can imagine my skepticism when a video came across my TikTok feed suggesting The Ordinary’s 10% Argireline Solution could do just that. But I also wasn’t about to let my cynicism get in the way of me doing some digging. My reporting uncovered exactly why it works so well, per dermatologists. Even better? The already-affordable serum is a rare 15% off for the first time ever on Amazon right now.$8.24 at Amazon (regularly $10)Compare: $10 at SephoraI tell you no lies, The Ordinary —a brand that I’ve always loved for its longstanding reputation of offering simple and effective skin care at accessible price points —hasn’t discounted this beloved wrinkle-fighting serum on Amazon until today. And per my reporting, this isn’t just a sweet deal. It’s actually a solid skin care product.Advertisement
While I have yet to try the serum out for myself, my research did present me with some pretty undeniable testimonials by those who had. One Sephora reviewer flat-out touted it as “literally Botox in a bottle.” Others went so far as to call it a “miracle product,” “life-changing” and so effective at reducing deep lines that “I don’t even need Botox anymore.”Still, as convincing as these statements were, I’m a reporter first so I also sought out professional opinions.Advertisement
New York City-based board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Brendan Camp, explained that to understand how The Ordinary’s formula might work for preventing and softening wrinkles, we must first understand how treatments like Botox work 💉:AmazonThe Ordinary Argireline serum can soften visible dynamic facial lines. $8.24 at Amazon (regularly $10)Compare: $10 at SephoraAdvertisement
According to Camp, neurotoxins, the active ingredient in Botox, “interfere with the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, into nerve synapses.” This temporarily freezes the muscles to reduce the appearance of dynamic lines and prevent new ones from forming. The Ordinary’s lightweight and water-based solution features a 10% concentration of Argireline, otherwise known as Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, “a skincare ingredient that may reduce the appearance of expression lines by working as a neurotransmitter-inhibiting peptide,” Camp said.One Sephora reviewer corroborated Argireline’s temporary muscle-freezing potential.“I’ve been on a (seemingly futile) journey trying every serum under the sun in a desperate attempt to delay botox,” they wrote. “After just two weeks of usage, my forehead lines have faded SIGNIFICANTLY. An effective topical product for people with overactive forehead muscles? At this price point?? Life-changing.”Advertisement
The Ordinary brand suggests using this serum after cleansing but before heavier solutions and moisturizers. Camp also reminds us that topical serums will not deliver the same type of results as in-office procedures like neurotoxin injections. And, as someone who regularly receives Botox injections, I don’t think this serum will be able to achieve that desired lift that can sometimes occur when neurotoxin is placed in areas like the outer corners of the brow or along the forehead. That being said, I think this is a great supplementary product to possibly extend the life of my Botox and help me go longer in between treatments. And for only below $10 on a 15% off discount, you’ve really got nothing to lose. Advertisement

I cannot recommend this product enough for deep lines.” — lxlaine“MIRACLE product is not an understatement! I cannot believe EVERYONE is not raving about this product. I’ve been on a (seemingly futile) journey trying every serum under the sun in a desperate attempt to delay Botox. After just two weeks of usage, my forehead lines have faded SIGNIFICANTLY. An effective topical product for people with overactive forehead muscles? At this price point?? Life-changing.” — Noctiflorous“I’ve been using this for a week and am seriously impressed.

Just a fingertip’s worth was all she needed to lock in moisture and keep her skin soft, smooth, and somehow ageless. It was her secret weapon — no fancy bottles, no 12-step routine — just one simple jar that always got the job done.$2 at TargetTargetA drugstore “holy grail”This moisturizer delivers major results thanks to its powerhouse combo of hyaluronic acid, pro-retinol, and vitamin C.
