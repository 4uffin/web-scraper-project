But recently, several TikTok videos have claimed it has skin and hair care benefits, too.One TikToker says she slathers castor oil on her face every night as a moisturizer and claims it can “help with literally any skin care condition.” Another video says using castor oil on your face can minimize fine lines. TV host Keltie Knight said soaking her hair in castor oil and letting it sit for as long as possible is her “secret to hair growth.” Another video shows a woman smoothing castor oil through her long, dark locks.

So that leads one to wonder: Is castor oil actually good for your skin and hair? Even though castor oil is a common ingredient in soaps, lotions and other skin care products, there’s little scientific evidence to support its benefits as a single ingredient for your hair and skin, experts say. But there’s so much anecdotal evidence from people like these TikTokers who believe it could work — so we decided to ask some medical experts about the qualities that have gotten people talking. Let’s dig in and get to the bottom of this.What is castor oil? Castor oil is a vegetable oil from the ricinus communis plant that’s odorless and typically yellow in color. Advertisement
It’s only approved by the Food and Drug Administration for one purpose: taken orally as a stimulant laxative, explained Dr. Hala Al-Jiboury, a gastroenterologist at AdventHealth Tampa. But it’s not typically recommended as a first-line treatment for constipation these days. “Castor oil has been around for years, but patients don’t use it much anymore,” she said. “There are better options available that are more effective, have fewer side effects and taste better.” Tatiana Maksimova via Getty ImagesWhenever you have dry skin or hair or hope to boost your hair growth, the best approach is to see a dermatologist.Advertisement
It can cause cramping, abdominal pain and diarrhea, added Dr. Joseph Jennings, a gastroenterologist at MedStar Health in McLean, Virginia. Castor oil is only meant to be taken occasionally as a laxative. Taking it too frequently can “induce dependence,” he said: “The colon gets used to being told to move and waits for more medicine.” Is castor oil good for your skin?Ricinoleic acid, which is the main ingredient in castor oil, is a monounsaturated fatty acid that can help the skin hold moisture when it’s applied topically, according to the Cleveland Clinic. This is often why it’s found in cosmetics and moisturizers. Advertisement
Castor oil is known to be “deeply moisturizing,” Dr. Kseniya Kobets, director of cosmetic dermatology at Montefiore Einstein Advanced Care in Elmsford, New York, told HuffPost. Using the oil alone could help people with dry skin — it offers a protective barrier against moisture loss. It could be helpful for anyone living in harsh, cold climates who needs extra moisture for their skin, Dr. Rehan Karim, a dermatologist at U.S. Dermatology Partners North Dallas, told HuffPost.“It is also known to be anti-inflammatory, which can benefit sensitive skin or those with conditions like eczema and psoriasis,” Kobets said.

However, Karim said castor oil is likely most beneficial when combined with other moisturizing agents, like ceramides or niacinamides. Kobets agreed: “I tend to suggest multitasking formulas to my patients that offer hydration, barrier protection, and other benefits, such as exfoliation or supporting the skin’s microbiome.”Because it’s a heavy oil, it can create a greasy feeling on the skin and clog pores, which may cause or worsen acne, Karim said. So if you have acne-prone skin, he suggested being careful about using castor oil.Can it boost hair growth?On social media, people claim castor oil can help their hair grow, moisturize their scalps and add shine.

When massaged into your scalp, castor oil may have properties that could help hair grow but Kobets said there are no “strong or conclusive clinical trials linking castor oil directly to promoting hair growth.”Using castor oil on your hair may make it “healthier-looking” though, as it coats the strands, reduces breakage, moisturizes and creates a shinier appearance, Karim said. It’ll be more beneficial on thicker, coarser hair, he said, as the heavy oil may weigh down thin hair. Massaging castor oil into your scalp can soothe dryness and flakiness, Karim said. Kobets said she often recommends castor oil in combination with other oils, like rosemary oil, for scalp hydration, as the mix of oils may offer combined benefits. Advertisement
Are there any risks to using castor oil?Castor oil is generally safe for most people to use on their hair and skin, Karim said. But it could clog pores and cause acne. There’s also a risk of an allergic reaction — he suggested stopping using it if you notice redness, itching or a rash. It’s also messy and greasy, and may not feel great on your skin or in your hair, Kobets said. Another important thing to note: Castor oil can be potentially harmful during pregnancy, Al-Jiboury said. Taking castor oil orally or using it on your hair or skin may cause premature contractions and induce labor, so it’s best avoided if you’re pregnant. Should you try it?“Castor oil can work as an occlusive moisturizer by creating a seal to lock in that hydration, but it is somewhat heavy and thick, which isn’t beneficial for everyone,” Karim said.Advertisement
It may be better used as a body moisturizer rather than on the face if your goal is to help soothe irritated skin, he said. Whenever you have dry skin or hair or hope to boost your hair growth, the best approach is to see a dermatologist. They’ll make recommendations based on your specific needs. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
