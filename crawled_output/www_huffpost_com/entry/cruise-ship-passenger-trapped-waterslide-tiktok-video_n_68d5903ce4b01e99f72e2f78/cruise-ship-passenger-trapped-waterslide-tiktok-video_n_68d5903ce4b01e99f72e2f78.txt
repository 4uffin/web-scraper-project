WongSenior Culture Reporter, HuffPostSep 25, 2025, 04:36 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGHarrowing footage of a passenger apparently trapped inside an enclosed waterslide on a Norwegian Cruise Line ship is garnering a chilly response from scores of viewers. The 13-second video, first shared on TikTok last week, shows an unidentified woman attempting to wiggle her way down the slide, which loops out over the side of the ship and over the ocean. Interestingly, the slide doesn’t appear to include much flowing water to help propel the woman toward the slide’s exit. Advertisement
The clip is set to the song “Hold My Hand” by Jess Glynne, and features the viral declaration: “Nothing beats a Jet2 holiday.” As of Thursday afternoon, the footage had been viewed more than 7.7 million times and drawn a wide assortment of eyebrow-raising responses.“Stuck in a waterslide over actual ocean water would send me into a psychosis,” one person wrote. Added another: “Oh hell no. I don’t like waterslides as is. There’s a death tube over shark soup.” The video doesn’t include much in the way of details, including the name of the ship or the location to which it was sailing.The Norwegian Bliss ship features the Ocean Loops waterslide, which hangs 11 feet off the side of the ship and 159 feet above the ocean.

However, The Independent, People and other outlets have pointed out that the vessel’s exterior resembles that of the Norwegian Cruise Line’s Bliss, which would have been sailing up the Canadian coastline to Alaska at the time the video was filmed. A press release touting the ship’s amenities features a photo of the “Ocean Loops” waterslide. “Enjoy the rush of whooshing down Ocean Loops, a double loop waterslide that hangs 11 feet off the side of the ship and 159 feet above the ocean,” the slide’s description notes. Norwegian Cruise Line didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the video. A representative for the company, however, told USA Today the slide shown in the footage “features an escape hatch for guests to exit safely when they cannot complete the experience due to factors like not wearing the recommended swim attire, weight of the guest, etc.,” but did not share additional specifics.

For many, the video brought to mind a similar viral clip from last month in which a passenger traveling aboard Royal Caribbean’s Icon of the Seas captured a panel on a waterslide shattering mid-ride, injuring a guest and sending water gushing into a public area. A spokesperson for Royal Caribbean later told People that the unidentified guest was in stable condition after receiving medical care.
