This definitely confirms it.” Advertisement
Charlamagne tha God, whose real name is Lenard Larry McKelvey, went on to point to CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios journalist Alex Thompson’s book “Original Sin,” which claims to uncover details about Biden’s aides’ efforts to cover up Biden’s physical and cognitive decline from the public, as more damning evidence against Biden’s legacy. Charlamagne then mentioned a forthcoming insider account about a “broken White House” under Biden’s administration from former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, which could further tarnish Biden’s image. “To me, nobody was closer to [the Bidens] than the vice president,” he continued of Harris. “So it’s very damning what she says about Biden in the book, to me. I think the Biden legacy is trash.”Advertisement
In Harris’ memoir, the politician highlights her regrets about letting Biden seek reelection in the presidential campaign.“Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness,” Harris wrote of Biden’s decision to run. “The stakes were simply too high.” Former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Joe Biden.Getty ImagesAdvertisement
She added, “This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”Elsewhere in the episode, Charlamagne praised Harris for “holding herself accountable” in the “fantastic read,” which he said he read “cover to cover.” TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

But no, she holds herself accountable as well.” Advertisement
