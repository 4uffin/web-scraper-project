“Whoever’s operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,” the irritated president warned from behind the podium. Luckily, the teleprompter was back in action just moments later.During Tuesday’s episode of “The Five,” Watters sarcastically accused staffers at the U.N. of “sabotage,” likening the snafus to “an insurrection.”Fox News host Jesse Watters, here in March, had some over-the-top ideas for how to deal with the U.N. after President Trump's snafu-laden trip to its New York headquarters on Tuesday.Jemal Countess via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
“What we need to do is either leave the U.N. or we need to bomb it,” he smirked, prompting his co-hosts to giggle off-camera.Thinking his plan through a bit, Watters wondered, “It is in New York, though, right? Could be some fallout there. Maybe gas it?”“Let’s not do that,” co-host Dana Perino chimed in.“Don’t gas it. OK, but we need to destroy it,” Watters continued. “Maybe we can demolish the building? Have everybody leave and then we’ll demolish the building.”Advertisement

Trump’s escalator incident caused enough drama that the U.N. was forced to issue a statement. It turns out the president’s personal videographer inadvertently triggered the escalator’s emergency safety mechanism, which halts the apparatus “to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing.”RelatedDonald TrumpUnited Nationsjesse wattersTrump Gets Instant Fact Check Over 'Proud' Brag At The UN: 'Does He Just Not Know?'Trump Takes His Many Lies And Grievances To The United NationsKaroline Leavitt Calls For Firing Whoever Stopped Trump's Escalator — Except There's A ProblemJimmy Fallon Gleefully Rides Donald Trump Over Escalator Snafu Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
