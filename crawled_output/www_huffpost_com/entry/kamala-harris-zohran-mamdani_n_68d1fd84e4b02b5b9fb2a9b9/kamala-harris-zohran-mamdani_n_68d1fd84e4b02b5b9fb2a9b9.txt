High-profile Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.), have been scrutinized for failing to throw their support behind Mamdani even though he won a decisive victory in the primary earlier this year.Both have declined to share their reasoning in recent press statements, while noting that they’re still considering the decision.Their hesitation comes as former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has refused to drop out of the race and as establishment Democrats have grappled with Mamdani’s progressive policies and identity as a democratic socialist. Advertisement
Harris ultimately backed Mamdani’s candidacy, but used the moment to draw attention to other “stars” in the Democratic Party. “I support the Democrat in the race, sure,” she said. “But let me just say this. He’s not the only star. I know that, you know, he’s in New York. And I know New Yorkers think they’re the center of the world.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Barbara Drummond, who’s running for mayor in Mobile, as well as New Orleans City Council Member Helena Moreno, who’s running for mayor of New Orleans.Advertisement
“They’re all running for mayor, too, and they are stars,” she said. “So I hope that we don’t so over-index on New York City that we lose sight of the stars throughout our country.”Harris’ tepid endorsement is the most prominent Mamdani has received thus far and follows that of New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, whose backing underscored how moderates have begun to coalesce around his candidacy.
