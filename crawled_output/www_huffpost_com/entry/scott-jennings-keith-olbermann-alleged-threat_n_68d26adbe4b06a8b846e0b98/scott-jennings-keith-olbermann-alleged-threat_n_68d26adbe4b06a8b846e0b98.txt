They were part of a thread of responses to Jennings’ mockery of the reinstatement of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”The late night show was suspended last week after Kimmel’s comments about Charlie Kirk’s alleged killer angered conservatives and spurred threats from the Federal Communications Commission.Advertisement
“We won, you stupid pieces of shit,” Olbermann wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “Last fold to fascism was last week.” “Now we get the fascists off real tv,” Olberemann wrote in another post. “That’d mean your career is next, Jennings. Send a tape to Real America ’s Voice.”“But keep mugging to camera, amateur,” he added.Jennings, a political pundit who worked in President George W. Bush’s White House, regularly ticks off left-leaning CNN viewers with his takes defending President Donald Trump and his administration.Advertisement
