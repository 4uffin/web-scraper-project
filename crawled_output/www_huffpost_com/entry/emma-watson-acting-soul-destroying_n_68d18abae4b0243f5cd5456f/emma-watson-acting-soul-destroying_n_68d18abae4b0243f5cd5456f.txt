“The balance of that can get quite thrown off,” Watson went on. “I think I’ll be honest and straightforward and say: I do not miss selling things. I found that to be quite soul-destroying.”The “Beauty and the Beast” star also called the pressure to maintain a polished public persona exhausting.Emma Watson, here at a 2023 event in New York City, said she doesn't miss the "soul-destroying" responsibility of promoting a film in the years since she stepped back from the industry.Arturo Holmes via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
“I think what’s interesting about being an actor is, there’s a tendency to sort of fracture yourself into multiple personalities,” she said. “I’m not just talking about the roles you play, but having the weight of a public persona, that sort of needs constant feeding and sprucing and glamorizing. It’s very energy-intensive stuff.”Watson did add how she misses the “art” of filmmaking and the opportunity to disappear into a role.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It’s so freeing. I miss that profoundly. But I don’t miss the pressure.”Since finishing “Harry Potter” and later pulling back from the entertainment industry, Watson has been focused on her education. She graduated from Brown University with a BA in English in 2014 and is pursuing a master’s degree in creative writing at Oxford University.Advertisement
