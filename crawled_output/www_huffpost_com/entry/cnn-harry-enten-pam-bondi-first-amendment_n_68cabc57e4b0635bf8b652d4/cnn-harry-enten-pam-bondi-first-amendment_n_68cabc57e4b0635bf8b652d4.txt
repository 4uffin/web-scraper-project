Who is he having to answer for? Oftentimes, it’s for Pam Bondi,” he said.Advertisement
Bondi, who’s faced intense criticism over the Department of Justice’s handling of the files related to Jeffrey Epstein, is dealing with a fresh wave of backlash for suggesting the DOJ would “absolutely target” people for alleged hate speech.On Tuesday, she seemingly walked back her controversial comments, telling Axios that freedom of speech is “sacred” in the U.S. and her office would “never impede upon that right.”Enten noted that weekly Google searches for “free speech” have increased by 186% this week compared with the average amount over the past five years.Advertisement
The top trending topic alongside free speech, he said, is Bondi.Enten added that the attorney general’s net popularity (the percentage of those who view her positively minus the percentage who view her negatively) is “underwater” at -19 percentage points, declaring that he “wouldn’t be surprised” if that figure sinks lower due to the fresh wave of backlash against her.Bondi’s net popularity is lower than that of other key Trump Cabinet members like Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (-7), Secretary of State Marco Rubio (-10), Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem (-11) and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (-13).TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
