(Watch the full interview above.)“I’ve been in this business 30-plus years, and this is really the first time I’ve been the lead of a show,” he says. “And that’s not lost on me. No pun intended.”Advertisement
That milestone is more than a personal win. For Asian American men, who have historically been pushed to the sidelines of Hollywood storytelling, Kim’s first lead role represents a seismic shift.For decades, Asian American men were depicted through a narrow lens: martial arts fighters, math nerds, comic sidekicks or quiet background characters. They were rarely portrayed as complex leads, and almost never as romantic ones.“Often in the past I’ve done action and I’ve been in sci-fi shows. I’ve been in deep space way into the far future,” he says. “But I very rarely had the chance to do a kitchen sink drama where I can just talk about the struggles of my relationship, romantically, or, in this case, with family.” Advertisement
That’s why “Butterfly” feels like a breakthrough — not just for Kim, who finally gets the space to explore emotional depth and intimacy as a husband and father wrestling with love, loyalty, and the fragility of family, but also for audiences who have long awaited more nuanced Asian American male leads.At the same time, global culture is shifting, opening the door to a wider spectrum of Asian representation. In recent years, the rise of K-pop, led by groups like BTS, has helped disrupt outdated stereotypes, reshaping masculinity on the world stage and showing that Asian men can be desirable and multifaceted.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

At its heart, the 57-year-old actor and producer hopes the Prime Video show speaks to something larger than representation alone. “There are certain human traits that are universal,” he says. “Whether you’re Korean, American, Asian, whatever nationality you are, there is a path to understanding and there is a path to love.”“Butterfly” is now streaming on Prime Video.RelatedAsian AmericansKorean AmericanDaniel Dae KimAsian VoicesEntertainmentWhy Daniel Dae Kim’s First Leading Role Is A Big DealThis Bombshell Docuseries About 'The Biggest Loser' Is The Top Show On Netflix Right NowWhy Ke Huy Quan’s The Ultimate Action Hero Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
