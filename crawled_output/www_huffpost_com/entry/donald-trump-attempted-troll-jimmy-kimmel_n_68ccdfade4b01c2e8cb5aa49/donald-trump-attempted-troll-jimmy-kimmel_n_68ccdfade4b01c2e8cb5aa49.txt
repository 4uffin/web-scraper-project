In the clip, Kimmel responded in real time to Trump’s “review” of his performance, in which the then–GOP presidential candidate sneered that Kimmel’s opening to the ceremony was “that of a less than average person.”Trump captioned the new post: “Jimmy Kimmel, just before announcement of the Best Picture of the Year, felt that he had to respond to a TRUTH put out by me toward the end of the Show. He made a total FOOL of himself, his wife and agent begging him not to do it, while also proving to be one of the Worst Hosts in the History of the Academy Awards. WATCH THE CLIP!”Advertisement
But Trump’s version conveniently cut off before Kimmel landed the jab: “Thank you, President Trump. Thank you for watching I’m surprised you’re still— isn’t it past your jail time?”Watch the full clip here:TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
