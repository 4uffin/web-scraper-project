Last month, Brian Glenn of the right-wing network Real America’s Voice asked Trump about the rumors that Howard Stern and SiriusXM Radio are “parting ways.” Advertisement
“Howard Stern announced that he and SiriusXM Radio are parting ways. Do you think that the hate-Trump business model that has been in the business is going out of business because it’s not popular with the American people?” Glenn asked Trump. Claiming that the model “hasn’t worked for a long time,” Trump took aim at Stephen Colbert, whose late-night show was canceled in July, before alleging that “no-talent” Kimmel and “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon would be the next to go. “Colbert has no talent,” Trump said. “I mean, I could take anybody here, I could go outside on the beautiful streets and pick a couple of people that would do just as well or better. They got higher ratings than he did. He’s got no talent.” Advertisement
He added: “Fallon has no talent. Kimmel has no talent. They’re next. They’re going to be going. I hear they are going to be going. I don’t know, but I would imagine, because Colbert has better ratings than Kimmel or Fallon.” Donald Trump and Jimmy Kimmel.Getty ImagesKimmel made several comments during the Sept. 15 episode of his show about right-wing reactions to Kirk’s killing, suggesting that Trump supporters are trying to exploit Kirk’s death following the arrest of Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old charged in the shooting.Advertisement
“The MAGA gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” Kimmel said.Meanwhile, over on social media, Kimmel expressed sympathy for Kirk’s family. “Instead of the angry finger-pointing, can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human?” Kimmel wrote the same day Kirk was slain. “On behalf of my family, we send love to the Kirks and to all the children, parents and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence.”Kirk was fatally shot while speaking with students at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10.Nexstar was first to announce on Wednesday that it would no longer air Kimmel’s late-night show on its ABC affiliates. The move came amid public pressure from FCC Chair Brendan Carr, who was appointed by Trump, and ABC affiliates. Advertisement
Nexstar is notably seeking the Trump administration’s green light for a $6.2 billion acquisition, which is subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission.The Walt Disney-owned ABC, which has aired “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” since 2003, announced shortly afterward that it would be suspending Kimmel’s show.Kimmel has not yet publicly addressed his suspension. Trump celebrated the news in a Truth Social post on Wednesday. “Great News for America: The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED,” he wrote. “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that’s possible.” Advertisement
Trump then went off on two other late-night hosts, Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers, calling them “two total losers.”“That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC,” he added. “Their ratings are also horrible.
