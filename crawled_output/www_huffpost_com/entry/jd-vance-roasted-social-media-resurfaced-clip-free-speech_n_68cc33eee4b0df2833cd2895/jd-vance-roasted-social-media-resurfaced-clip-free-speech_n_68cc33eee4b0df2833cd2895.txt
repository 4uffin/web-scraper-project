“In Washington, there is a new sheriff in town,” he continued at the time. “And under Donald Trump’s leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square, agree or disagree.”Critics on social media have highlighted the clip following Kimmel’s show being pulled.“Unless you are Jimmy Kimmel. Or anyone else who disagrees with us,” one user wrote Thursday on X, formerly Twitter, with another person commenting: “Guess he changed his mind in substantially fundamental ways that completely shut down free speech.”The suspension of Kimmel’s show has spawned utter outrage from Democratic lawmakers, pundits and celebrities. Even conservative commentators such as former Fox News host Tucker Carlson decried the apparent blow against free speech as “dark.”Advertisement
Vice President JD Vance took charge of "The Charlie Kirk Show" on Monday and ramped up his divisive rhetoric.Doug Mills/The New York Times/Associated PressThe move comes after Nexstar Media Group said it would stop airing Kimmel’s show over concerns about his comments. Nexstar is pursuing a major merger with media company Tegna — and needs approval from Trump’s Federal Communications Commission.“The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” was notably also canceled earlier this year amid similar plans of a merger, between CBS parent company Paramount Global and Skydance Media. The Trump administration approved it in July after Colbert was officially ousted.Advertisement
Vance ramped up his divisive rhetoric after last week’s fatal shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. He took charge of Kirk’s show on Monday from the White House and urged citizens to report people to their employers for insensitive comments about it.His clashing vow to defend free speech in February has thus led critics to speak their mind.This is not aging well https://t.co/sgXjccnzrF— Jenin Younes (@JeninYounesEsq) September 18, 2025 uh-huh https://t.co/wXp5SqlUL0— John Harwood (@JohnJHarwood) September 18, 2025 Advertisement
