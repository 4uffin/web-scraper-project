The lawyers wrote that “a recent, tragic, high-profile murder has only increased this prejudicial rhetoric,” an apparent reference to the fatal shooting of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Luigi Mangione, accused of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, arrives at court in New York City on Sept. 16.TIMOTHY A.CLARY via Getty ImagesRight-wing pundits and officials have characterized the Kirk shooting, along with other recent acts of violence, as left-wing terrorism, prompting Trump to designate the antifa movement as a “terrorist organization.” Antifa, which is short for “anti-fascist,” is a decentralized movement and the word is generally used as an umbrella term for loosely affiliated far-left-activists and groups against fascist ideology.

Mangione’s lawyers cited several instances in which they said government officials linked his alleged motives to left-wing ideology. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt referred to Thompson’s killer as a “left-wing assassin” while speaking to reporters during Monday’s press briefing.Advertisement
She grouped Thompson’s killing with incidents of violence against the right, including Trump’s attempted assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania, and attacks against former special government employee Elon Musk’s Tesla centers.Lawyers also cited comments made Tuesday by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller on Fox News, where he stated, “of course the health care CEO was brutally gunned down by another self-described so-called anti-fascist that was then celebrated by other self-described anti-fascists, so of course, really communist revolutionaries.”"This country is dealing with a rising threat of radical left-wing terrorism... President Trump took decisive action yesterday by formally declaring Antifa to be a domestic terror organization. As we speak... we are working on a broader counterterrorism strategy."— @StephenM https://t.co/1S6QLbjqKJ— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) September 23, 2025Advertisement
“The attempts to connect Mr. Mangione with these incidents and paint him as a ‘left wing’ violent extremist are false, prejudicial, and part of a greater political narrative that has no place in any criminal case, especially one where the death penalty is at stake,” the lawyers argued Tuesday. They claim that Mangione “in fact does not support these violent actions, does not condone past or future political violence, nor is he in any way aligned with the group mentioned in the White House press release.” 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
