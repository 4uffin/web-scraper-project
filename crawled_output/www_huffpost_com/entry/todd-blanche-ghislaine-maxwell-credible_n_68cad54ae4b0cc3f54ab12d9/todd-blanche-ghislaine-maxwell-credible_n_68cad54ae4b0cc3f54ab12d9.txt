To determine whether a witness is credible takes weeks and weeks and weeks.”Advertisement
In August, the Justice Department released the transcripts of Maxwell’s July interview, in which she openly praised Trump, adding that she “never” saw him in any compromising situation with Epstein. “I don’t think they were close friends ... I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way,” Maxwell, who is serving 20 years in prison for sex trafficking charges, said in the transcript of her interview with the Justice Department in July. Blanche told Collins the point of the interview was not to “pressure-test” Maxwell’s answers, but to allow her to speak because, he claimed, no one had given her that chance before. Advertisement
“It’s really up to the American people to determine if they believe that her answers were credible, or whether they found her not credible,” Blanche said.Todd Blanche on whether he found Ghislaine Maxwell to be credible: "It's an impossible question to answer.

She was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Last month, she was moved to a minimum-security prison in Texas. Advertisement
Trump ordered the Justice Department to interview Maxwell after Democrats and Republicans pressured the Trump administration to release any and all files related to Epstein’s case. Trump socialized with Epstein and Maxwell for many years, and it appears that he gave Epstein a suggestive birthday note in 2003, though the administration denies that the note is Trump’s.Maxwell also said during her interview that there is no Epstein client list — something Attorney General Pam Bondi once suggested was sitting on her desk.

I struggle to recall actual people that I met ... So I don’t have, and there’s no list. There was never a list.”Advertisement
