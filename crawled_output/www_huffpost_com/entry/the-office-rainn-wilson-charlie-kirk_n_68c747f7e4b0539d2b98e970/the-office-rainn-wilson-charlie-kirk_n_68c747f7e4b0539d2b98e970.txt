Wilson said that Kirk was “a courageous man, actually.” “He was unafraid to speak his truth and would go often into hostile environments in order to do that. How many of us have that same courage?” Wilson asked his followers.

“We need to build bridges of love and unity, especially between those we disagree with,” Wilson explained. “As Arthur Brooks says, we need to learn how to disagree better, and still know that we all love our country, and we all want to build a better tomorrow. We just have very different ideas of how to do that.” Kirk was shot and killed on Sept. 10 during a speaking engagement at Utah Valley University.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
