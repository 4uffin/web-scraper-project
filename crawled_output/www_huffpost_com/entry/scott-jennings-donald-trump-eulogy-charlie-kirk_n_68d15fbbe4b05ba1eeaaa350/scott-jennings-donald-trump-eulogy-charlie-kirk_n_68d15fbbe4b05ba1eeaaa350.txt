(Watch the video below.)The former George W. Bush aide evaded comment Monday on Trump’s remark that he refused to follow Kirk’s example of not hating his opponents. “I hate my opponents, and I don’t want the best for them,” Trump said to laughter. “I’m sorry.”Advertisement
On “CNN News Central” anchor John Berman asked Jennings for his opinion on Trump’s “discordant” tone, which contrasted with Kirk’s widow Erika saying she forgave the alleged killer.“Yeah, look, I’m not going to criticize the president,” Jennings replied. “His friend died and he gave the eulogy. And he, you know, he did it in the way that Donald Trump would do it.”Trump and his administration have parlayed the controversial Kirk’s murder into a war on free speech ― against them. Jimmy Kimmel’s ABC talk show was pulled by Disney amid FCC pressure over remarks the host made about Kirk’s assassin, ramping up concerns over censorship.Advertisement
But Jennings kept it all positive when it came to the president.“He made some very beautiful remarks,” the “NewsNight” foil continued. “He made some jokes that only Donald Trump can make. And, you know, he did it in a way that, frankly, I expected him to do it. And I think the crowd responded to it. I think what you saw on the stage yesterday, from Trump to Erika Kirk to all the other speakers – and I thought it was extremely well done and very powerful – was a reflection of the range of emotions that Republicans and conservatives and Christians have felt since Charlie was assassinated.”TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

“Although I think it’s natural for us to try to analyze the politics of this or to nitpick the political actors, to me, yesterday’s event was as much a faith event and a spiritual awakening for the country as it was anything,” Jennings said. “And so how it affects the midterms or, you know, how it affects Donald Trump the political person, I don’t know. But I know how it affected Scott Jennings the Christian.”RelatedDonald Trumpcharlie kirkScott JenningsCNN’s Abby Phillip Hits Scott Jennings With A Painful Truth About His CriticsCNN Panelist Trounces Scott Jennings During Debate Over Dean Cain Joining ICEJordan Klepper Has Just 1 Brutally Blunt Question For Scott JenningsTrump Used Charlie Kirk Eulogy To Brutally Attack Opponents.
