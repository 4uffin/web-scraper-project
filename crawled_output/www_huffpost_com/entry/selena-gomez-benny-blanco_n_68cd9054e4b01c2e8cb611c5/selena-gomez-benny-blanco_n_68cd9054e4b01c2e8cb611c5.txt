News’ Instagram post about it, the star revealed: “Noooooo I told Taylor about two of my friends who hooked up. Not that that’s anyone's business."Michael Buckner / Getty ImagesAnd when Meryl Streep and Martin Short were spotted holding hands at the "Only Murders in the Building" Season 4 premiere in August of that same year, people put two and two together and basically decided that Streep and Short were the two friends that Gomez was talking about.Kevin Winter / Getty ImagesIt’s worth noting that Gomez herself has never confirmed this, and Streep and Short are also yet to publicly confirm their romance — but they’ve been spotted looking pretty cozy together on other occasions since.Advertisement
