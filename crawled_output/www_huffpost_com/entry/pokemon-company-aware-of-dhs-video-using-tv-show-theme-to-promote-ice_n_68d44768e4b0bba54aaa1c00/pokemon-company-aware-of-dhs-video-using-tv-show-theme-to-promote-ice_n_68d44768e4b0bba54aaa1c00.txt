“Gotta Catch ’Em All,” DHS captioned the video, in reference to the beloved game’s tagline.ICE has been running a recruitment campaign since receiving a huge funding boost over the summer. Given that The Pokémon Company is owned by Nintendo, which regularly files intellectual property suits, fans of Pokémon and opponents of President Donald Trump’s extremist immigration rhetoric predicted an impending lawsuit, tagging the gaming giant in their posts. (Fans also pointed out that the purpose of catching Pokémon in the game is to befriend them and help them grow, not send them away.)Nintendo directed HuffPost to The Pokémon Company for comment. A spokesperson did not reveal whether the company was considering taking action against the Trump administration, but confirmed that its leadership has viewed the video.Advertisement
“We are aware of a recent video posted by the Department of Homeland Security that includes imagery and language associated with our brand,” the company said in a brief emailed statement.It noted, “Our company was not involved in the creation or distribution of this content, and permission was not granted for the use of our intellectual property.” Don McGowan, a former chief legal officer for The Pokémon Company, told the gaming news site IGN that he did not think a lawsuit was likely due to concerns about potential retaliation and a desire to avoid negative publicity.

“They are INSANELY publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand,” McGowan told the outlet. “Second, many of their execs in the USA are on green cards,” he said. “Even if I was still at the company I wouldn’t touch this, and I’m the most trigger-happy CLO I’ve ever met. This will blow over in a couple of days and they’ll be happy to let it.”TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
