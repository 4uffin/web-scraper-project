Now, LaBelle is setting the record straight — and putting some r-e-s-p-e-c-t on her history with Franklin.“What were your conversations like with Aretha Franklin? What did you two bond over, talk about?” Andy Cohen asked during a Sunday episode of his show “Watch What Happens Live.”Advertisement
Not surprisingly, given LaBelle’s well-known love for cooking, she shared that the two connected over food. She also mentioned they shared a deep appreciation for their “voices” and revealed that Franklin had even expressed interest in collaborating. Sadly, those plans never came to fruition due to Franklin’s death in 2018 at age 76. “We just talked about life,” LaBelle told Cohen. “A lot of people think that we didn’t get along, but we did.”R&B legends Patti LaBelle and Aretha FranklinGetty ImagesAdvertisement
Cohen also brought up LaBelle’s 1993 tribute to Franklin, when she performed “Ain’t No Way” at the Essence Awards.“It is unclear from Ms. Franklin’s face what she is really thinking of your performance,” he remarked. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
