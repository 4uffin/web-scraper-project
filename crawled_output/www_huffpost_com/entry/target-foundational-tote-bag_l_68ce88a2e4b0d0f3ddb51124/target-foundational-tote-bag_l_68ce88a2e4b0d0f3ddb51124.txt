That’s exactly what happened the first time when I spotted the Universal Thread Foundational tote handbag. At first glance, I had to do a double take. The structured shape, the durable appearance, the leather-like trim, even the slightly sporty vibe — it’s giving major Longchamp energy. In other words: this is a designer-lookalike you don’t want to sleep on. And the best part? It’s only $25!$25 at TargetAdvertisement
Let’s address the elephant in the room: no, this isn’t Longchamp’s iconic Le Pliage tote bag, a perennial fashion-crowd favorite that’s beloved for its nylon construction and unique foldable design. (“Not Target having a Longchamp dupe,” intoned one TikToker who echoed the sentiments of many.) But here’s why this Target tote looks like it belongs in the same conversation: It’s got that same minimalist French-girl practicality that makes Longchamp so beloved. Sleek lines, generous space for your laptop and water bottle, handles that look sturdy without feeling clunky — it’s the kind of bag you can take everywhere, from the office to the gym to a weekend trip.TargetThe bag is available in three go-with-everything colors.$25 at TargetAdvertisement
Thanks to its exterior resemblance to Longchamp’s famous purse, Target’s Foundational tote has that same effortless commuter vibe we’ve all been chasing since the days of TikTok’s “clean girl” aesthetic. It’s not fussy, it doesn’t scream “trendy,” but it still manages to elevate whatever you’re wearing. Whether you’re throwing it over a blazer on your way to a client meeting or pairing it with sweatpants for your Sunday grocery run, the bag plays along.One of the reasons the Pliage blew up in the first place was the bag’s mix of utility and understated chic, and Target’s version offers a similar vibe. Made with either canvas or recycled polyester and faux leather handles and accents, this tote looks like it costs way more than its price tag. It’s roomy without being bulky and comes with thoughtful details — like interior pockets so your keys and phone don’t vanish into the abyss, and a zip closure to keep everything secure.$25 at TargetAdvertisement
And let’s be real: in this economy, a bag that looks luxe but doesn’t require an actual paycheck sacrifice? That’s the dream. Spending hundreds on a designer bag isn’t always realistic, but Target manages to bottle up the same vibe for a fraction of the cost. It’s giving champagne taste on a kombucha budget.It’s also the perfect travel companion. You can slip it under the seat in front of you on a plane, stuff it with snacks and a book for the train, or use it as a chic overnight bag. It’s got plenty of room for all your goods, but is still polished enough that you’ll actually want to carry it around.Bottom line: you must grab it before it’s sold out. Keep scrolling to see what some other shoppers had to say, or if you’re still shopping, you’ll find a collection of roomy weekender bags on Amazon that all cost less than $50.Advertisement

Luckily, Amazon supplied us with this beautiful lookalike at nearly a fraction of the cost. This Etronik bag has the same generous bottom zippered compartment as the Béis option, along with a similar trolley strap, interior laptop pocket and three other interior pockets to keep you organized. It even has a USB port and side pockets for additional functionality. You can get it in one of 30 colors in two sizes.Promising review: "I got this for a gym bag, but it has become my bag for everything. I love how much I can fit in this bag. I love the shoe compartment. I also love the small bag that comes with it. I love the lining on the inside. I also love that there is an inside pocket and the cord for charging through the bag. It does have a luggage strap which works great for airport travel. It is a soft shell bag so it does not stand up as pictured when not filled. The quality is great and is very easy to clean.

I don't normally like carry-on luggage because it's hard for me to lift it into the overhead bins. This carries what I need and slips right under the seat so I don't have to lift anything. It is easy to carry and looks very nice. It comes with an extra strap for carrying cross-body or, carry by the normal handles. I'm very thankful to have made this purchase especially after traveling with it." — Nana$25 at Amazon3AmazonA meticulously-designed timeless weekender bagRating: 4.6 out of 5 starsAvailable in 13 colors and patterns, this weekender is made with high-quality canvas with buttery faux leather details.

4AmazonA casual and lightweight bagRating: 4.7 out of 5 starsFor a more relaxed vibe, try out this casual weekender.

I have now done so for a few months and completely love it. I have traveled locally with the bag for a weekend and have taken it on a plane trip as well. Both have worked out superbly. I particularly love the quality of the fabric, the handles, and the stitching. And the underside compartment for shoes works out so well. The interior smaller bags are very useful and well-made. I love the colors of the bag and the striped design - very thoughtfully done. I don't think I could love this bag more and plan to purchase it in the future as a gift. I highly recommend this wonderful travel bag!" — Kindle customer$36 at AmazonAdvertisement
7AmazonA roomy weekender bagRating: 4.5 out of 5 starsAnyone who loves patterns is going to be excited by the varied assortment of options for this bag, though it comes in a few solid colors as well.

There is a separate compartment along the bottom of the bag, a cushioned shoulder strap and plenty of roomy pockets as well as a trolley-pass through on the back.Promising review: "Well made and good quality.
