Dear Mom and Dad and Chris,Well, here I am — once again at the “famous” Sound City Recording Studio. I am getting very tired of sitting around listening to 12 hours of music per day. Oh well, I know it will pay off in the end, and when I am sitting in my small but luxurious Beverly Hills home overlooking my small but tasteful pool that is totally secluded, where I can sun in the nude and tan my entire fat body while waiting for my plastic surgery leg lift — it will all be worth it. Otherwise, everything here is just “peach-y”.At the time Nicks was in the midst of recording “Buckingham Nicks” with then-boyfriend Lindsey Buckingham. The album would catch the attention of Mick Fleetwood, who asked Buckingham to join his band. But Buckingham insisted that Nicks be included in the deal. The rest is rock ’n’ roll history.The revamped Fleetwood Mac took its first album together, 1975’s “Fleetwood Mac,” to No. 1 and produced nine top 10 hits, including “Dreams” and “Rhiannon.” Nicks then collected four Top 10 singles without Fleetwood Mac.Advertisement
A billboard sign posted last summer on Sunset Boulevard advertises the cover art from the 1973 album "Buckingham Nicks" by Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.via Associated PressBut in the letter, which she posted to mark the re-release of “Buckingham Nicks,” she was still just a young adult who wanted to make sure her family celebrated her birthday properly.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

I shall leave it to the three of you to plan it. By the way, presents will be accepted any time after the first of May — no C.O.D’s please.”Advertisement
