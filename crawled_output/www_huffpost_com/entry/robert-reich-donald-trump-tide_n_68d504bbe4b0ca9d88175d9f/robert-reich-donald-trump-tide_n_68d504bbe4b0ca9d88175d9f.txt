“Maybe I’m being too optimistic, but I’ve seen a lot. I know the signs,” he continued. “The sleeping giant always remains asleep until some venality becomes so noxious, some action so disrespectful of the common good, some brutality so noisy, that he has no choice but to awaken.”“And when he does, the good sense of the American people causes him to put an end to whatever it was that awakened him,” he concluded.RelatedDonald Trumprobert reichEric Trump’s Wild Tale Of Watching His Father Stop A War Raises EyebrowsTrump’s Biden White House Troll Spirals Into Awkward Epstein FlashbackLawrence O'Donnell Marvels At UK Newspaper's Utterly Brutal Description Of TrumpRobert Reich Spells Out ‘Bigger Picture’ Of Trump’s ‘Most Brazen Move Yet’ Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
