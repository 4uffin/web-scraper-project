That’s not my focus at all, it really isn’t,” Harris said while appearing Monday night on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” to discuss her new book, “107 Days,” among other topics such as President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden.

Harris announced in July that she gave “serious thought” to running for governor of California but ultimately declined. Her decision ended months of speculation that she would seek the position after her loss to Trump in the 2024 presidential race. Harris previously served as a U.S. senator for California before resigning to take on the vice presidency after Joe Biden won the 2020 election. She later replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee last year after he pulled out of the race. Maddow went on to ask Harris to clarify if her announcement about not running for governor of California meant she didn’t plan to run for any office again. Advertisement
“That was the decision before me. And I made the decision not to run for governor of California. By the way, there are a lot of great candidates running,” she told Maddow. In Harris’ memoir, which was released Tuesday, she discusses a wide range of topics, including her regrets about letting Biden seek reelection in the presidential campaign.“Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness,” Harris wrote of Biden’s decision to run. “The stakes were simply too high.” Advertisement
She added: “This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.”After reading the excerpt aloud, Maddow then asked Harris: “Whose decision should that have been? How should that decision have been made?” TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
