It’s a hit on Christianity. It’s a hit on religion. It’s a hit on freedom. ... This could have been the greatest mistake these people have ever made.”Advertisement
Throughout Trump’s seven-minute segment, the son of President Donald Trump continuously referred to “they,” seemingly referring to Democrats and those on the left, when talking about blame for Kirk’s murder, and called out Donald Trump’s opponents, who tried “to take down” the president and impeach him.“More and more Americans read through just the chaos that is the left, the intolerant left,” Eric Trump said. Tyler Robinson, 22, is suspected of fatally shooting Kirk while the right-wing Christian nationalist podcaster was speaking at Utah Valley University as part of his “American Comeback” tour. A neighbor who knew Robinson described him to NBC News as “very considerate,” “quiet” and “respectful.” Robinson has no criminal history and his political party was listed as undeclared, according to the NBC News report.Advertisement
Still, Republicans have been claiming, without evidence, that Robinson is “of the political left” or fueled by “transgender ideology.” Before a suspect was in custody, Donald Trump blamed the “radical left” for Kirk’s killing. “We have radical left lunatics out there and we just have to beat the hell out of them,” the president said Thursday. Eric Trump fueled this rhetoric Sunday while on Fox News, saying, “They wanted to eliminate a powerful voice. They wanted to eliminate the future of a movement.”Advertisement
Eric Trump, who promoted his new book “Under Siege: My Family’s Fight To Save Our Nation” while on Fox News, said proceeds from the book will be donated to Turning Point USA, the nonprofit Kirk founded to promote conservatism among college students.Eric Trump said Kirk wasn’t afraid to visit any college campus to debate with students, adding that Kirk “changed the soul of the youth vote” in America. He claimed that, just five years ago, college students were being “indoctrinated” by their teachers and being taught revisionist history.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
