The trio of concerns he raised included an escalator stopping while he was on it, his teleprompter malfunctioning while he spoke and the sound system allegedly glitching throughout his remarks.

Headquarters, Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025.. (AP Foto/Stefan Jeremiah)via Associated Press“This wasn’t a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. “I’m sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary General, and I demand an immediate investigation.”The U.N. has responded to some of these issues, noting in a statement on Tuesday that a videographer with the U.S. delegation may have triggered a safety feature on the escalator, causing it to stop while Trump and the first lady were on it.

A U.N. official has also said that the White House was in charge of Trump’s teleprompter during his speech, while a White House official has said the U.N. team was, according to CNN.And while Trump claimed that attendees could not hear his speech unless they were wearing interpreters’ earpieces, a U.N. official noted that this may have been due to the system’s design.“The sound system was designed to allow people at their seats to hear speeches being translated into six different languages through earpieces,” the official told the BBC.Advertisement
The U.N. Secretary General’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump’s digs this week follow years of broadsides he’s levied against the U.N. and have only been used to justify his dissatisfaction with the body. “No wonder the United Nations hasn’t been able to do the job that they were put in existence to do,” he wrote.
