The same scrubs that are “on the backs of many health care workers across our country and around the world,” Wyle added.“We were in New York at the Gotham Awards, and I was wearing a tuxedo, and someone asked if it was as comfortable as the scrubs I wear at work,” Wyle explained. “And so I looked into the camera and I made a challenge to Figs, ‘Hey, Figs, can you make me a tuxedo that’s as comfortable as the scrubs I wear?’ And they went and did it.”Noah Wyle attends the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards at Peacock Theater in Los Angeles.Kevin Mazur via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
