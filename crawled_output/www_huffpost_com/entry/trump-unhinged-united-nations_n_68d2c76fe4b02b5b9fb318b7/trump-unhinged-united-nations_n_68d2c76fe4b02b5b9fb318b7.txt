DateSenior White House Correspondent, HuffPostSep 23, 2025, 01:08 PM EDTLEAVE A COMMENTLOADINGERROR LOADINGPresident Donald Trump took his familiar lies about his supposed accomplishments to the United Nations Tuesday while also complaining about a malfunctioning escalator and teleprompter and whining that he did not receive a renovation contract from the world body decades ago.“Grocery prices are down,” he told the delegates and world leaders gathered for annual General Assembly in New York City.Advertisement
“Inflation has been defeated.”“More than $17 trillion is being invested in the United States. And it’s now pouring in from all parts of the world.”“In a period of just seven months, I have ended seven unending wars.”None of his claims is true. Inflation is now running higher than it was in the final year of predecessor Joe Biden’s administration, and grocery prices have increased even faster. The $17 trillion figure is complete fiction, as is the assertion of “ending” seven wars, let alone 10 wars, which Trump occasionally claims.World leaders typically use their appearances to at the UN to discuss common problems, and speakers were asked to limit their speeches to 15 minutes. Trump, instead, went on for nearly a full hour, giving a version of his familiar lie- and grievance-packed rally speech that even falsely boasted about his poll numbers. He closed in the same style of invoking various cities and the people who built them years ago — an ending his speechwriters began using in 2018.Advertisement
“From Rome to Athens, from Paris to Seoul from Cairo, to Tokyo and Amsterdam to right here in New York City, we stand on the shoulders of the leaders and legends, generals and giants, heroes and titans who won and built our beloved nations,” he said.President Donald Trump speaks to the United Nations General Assembly, Tuesday, Sept. 23, in New York.via Associated PressIn between, Trump disparaged the nations of western Europe for accepting Muslim refugees — “Your countries are going to hell” — and Great Britain for phasing out oil drilling in the North Sea. He attacked Brazil for prosecuting and convicting its former president, his friend and fellow coup-attempter Jair Bolsonaro.Advertisement
He mocked at length nations working to stop climate change and repeated his false assertion that it was a “scam.”“If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,” he said.Trump also took the time to criticize the U.N. itself, on matters both serious and frivolous.He claimed that the body had intentionally encouraged migrants to enter the United States illegally — “The UN is supporting people that are illegally coming into the United States and then we have to get them out” — and that it had failed to help him seek peace between nations at war.“Sadly, in all cases, the United Nations did not even try to help in any of them. I ended seven wars, dealt with the leaders of each and every one of these countries, and never even received a phone call from the United Nations offering to help in finalizing the deal,” he said.Advertisement
Trump gave equal attention to an escalator that stopped working as he was riding it and a teleprompter that failed as he began his remarks. “These are the two things I got from the United Nations, a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,” he said.He then raised a complaint that the U.N. had not awarded him a renovation contract he had bid on decades ago.“I said at the time that I would do it for $500 million, rebuilding everything. It would be beautiful. I used to talk about, I’m going to give you marble floors. They’re going to give you terrazzo. I’m going to give you the best of everything. You’re going to have mahogany walls. They’re going to give you plastic,” he said.Advertisement
“But they decided to go in another direction, which was much more expensive at the time, and which actually produced a far inferior product. And I realized that they did not know what they were doing when it came to construction and that their building concepts were so wrong and the product that they were proposing to build was so bad and so costly.”Trump also repeatedly attacked Biden, who had been popular with many world leaders, particularly those from western Europe, for his ability to forge a united front to oppose Russian dictator Vladimir Putin’s bloody invasion of Ukraine in 2022.“The most corrupt incompetent administration in history, the Sleepy Joe Biden administration,” Trump said.Advertisement
Trump even managed to denigrate former President Barack Obama, accusing him of hypocrisy for using Air Force One while he warned of climate change.“President Obama would get into Air Force One, a massive Boeing 747, and not a new one, an old one with old engines that spew everything into the atmosphere,” he said. “He’d talk about the carbon footprint: ‘We must do some—’ Then he’d get in and he’d fly from Washington to Hawaii to play a round of golf, and then he’d get back onto that big, beautiful plane, and it fly back and talk about, again, global warming and the carbon footprint.”TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.

In contrast, Trump has used that same plane for many hundreds of hours specifically to play at courses he owns, including a 14-hour round trip to Scotland this summer to play golf at and promote one of his courses there.Advertisement
