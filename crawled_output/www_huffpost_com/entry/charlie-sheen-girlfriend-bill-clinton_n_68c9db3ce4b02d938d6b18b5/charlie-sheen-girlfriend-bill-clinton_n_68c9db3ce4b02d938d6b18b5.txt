In his new memoir, “The Book of Sheen,” the actor, 60, alleged that the former president tried to shoot his shot with his then-girlfriend, Dolly Fox, when he was filming 1987’s “Three for the Road” in Arkansas, according to multiple outlets.

The Golden Globe winner said that the alleged ordeal took place after Clinton, who was governor of Arkansas at the time and had been married to his wife Hillary Clinton since 1975, invited him and his co-stars Alan Ruck and Kerri Green to his home to do a photo op. Calling the invitation “pretty surreal,” Sheen wrote that he invited Fox to tag along.The “Wall Street” star said something unexpected happened next after Clinton apparently took interest in Fox, with Ruck telling Sheen that he allegedly witnessed Clinton discreetly trying to get information about Fox from his aides. “I was answering a reporter’s question when Ruck overheard Clinton whisper to one of his aides, ‘Find out what you can about the brunette,’” Sheen recalled. “The brunette was Dolly.” Advertisement
“And to this day, Alan swears it was an exact quote. Clearly the behavior that transformed an intern a few years later into a household name had been in play long before her blue dress became famous,” Sheen wrote, referring to Clinton’s infamous affair with Monica Lewinsky.

“Alan gave Dolly the rundown in the bar later on that same night. To her credit, she laughed and was actually flattered,” he added of the alleged incident. Reps for Sheen and Clinton didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment.
