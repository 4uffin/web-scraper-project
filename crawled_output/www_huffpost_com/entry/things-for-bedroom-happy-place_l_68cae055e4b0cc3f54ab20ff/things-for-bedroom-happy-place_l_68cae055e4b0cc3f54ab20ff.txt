Actually really nice quality, and the size choices are great. Love the artwork, frame, and TBH this would‚Äôve been $200 at Pottery Barn. Amazing!" ‚Äî Anna$16 at Amazon2Amazon, www.amazon.comA glamorous set of feather-trim pajamasP.S. The feathers are removable for easier washing!
Promising review: "Obsessed...they are literally perfect. Thin without being see-through, soft, exactly the right size and fit I expected (I didn‚Äôt want shorts that were too long, and these are just right) with just enough space to be comfortable! The cherry on top is that the feather cuffs come off but don‚Äôt seem to be too fragile. I was worried they would slide around or fall off, but they seem really sturdy." ‚Äî M Deely$25 at Amazon3AmazonA Kitsch satin pillowcase that'll be gentle on your hairKitsch is an LA-based, self-financed, woman-owned small business established in 2010 that specializes in hair accessories.
Promising review: "I'm really liking this pillow. I woke up today with nice wavy hair, not dry tangled hair. I've been trying to grow out the layer of hair on the top back of my head and it's been so stubborn! Keeps getting tangled and breaks here and there from bleaching and dye damage, but with this new pillow I notice it doesn't tangle, which means it can grow right without rubbing and tangling/pulling! So I'm excited to see what happens by the end of summer! Also the pillow is soft and is so much prettier in person! üòçüòçüòçüíñüíñüíñ" ‚Äî Amazon Customer üå∑$19 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonA headboard lamp for anyone who loves the ample lighting options found in fancy hotelsThis is designed to slide over headboards up to 1.5 inches thick but reviewers say it will stretch for larger headboards. It's designed to work with a 40W bulb max.
Promising review: "Great little headboard lamps. Make reading before going to sleep a joy. No more trying to find the right light angle. Love them, so I decided to get a couple for my husband." ‚Äî Gurpreet$30 at AmazonAdvertisement
5www.amazon.comA strip of LEDs that'll wrap behind your TV to help with eye strainLearn more about eye strain and how bias lighting can help from the International Journal on Computer Science and Engineering.
Promising review: "I've had this LED strip for about two months now and I haven't had ANY issues with them. They made my work desk look so edgy and beautiful! Anytime I'm at my desk, I turn these on because I feel that they actually have a positive impact, as cheesy as that may sound." ‚Äî Matt Zefi$7+ at Amazon6Buffy, BuffyBuffy's Wiggle Pillow for people who love to cuddleGrab a pillowcase here.
Promising review: "The most comfortable pillow and the best sleep ever with it. I hate that it took me so long to realize these pillows exist!! Now I can never go back to sleeping without one. Love!!!" ‚Äî Amanda A.$87 at BuffyAdvertisement
7AmazonA lightweight lap desk if you're not quite ready to work from a deskPromising review: "It was better than expected. Very nice craftsmanship. Much more productive with the lap desk, almost regardless where I am using my laptop...beach or in bed. ü§ó" ‚Äî Kindle Customer$39 at Amazon8www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comOr a gaming/reading/laptop pillow in a convenient U shapePromising review: "I work from home a few days a week, and every once in a while, my work extends into the evening hours. I have a home office, but sitting at my desk all day is sometimes very tiring. I purchased this big memory foam desk pillow so that I can relax on my couch and still put my laptop up and have a comfortable working area. This pillow is big but very comfortable.
It has armrests that wrap around your sides, and they also have little pockets for random things like your cell phone or the remote. It‚Äôs so nice to just lean back into my comfortable couch and have this big soft desk in front of me." ‚Äî Jenn Butterfield $57 at Amazon9www.amazon.comPleated paper shades if you find that the sun is waking up way before youPromising reviews: "These things are fabulous. It couldn‚Äôt be easier to put up, and once I trimmed the extra off the bottom, they‚Äôre a perfect fit. I put them in the master bedroom behind our nice-looking wood blinds AND in the kids' room. Our 7-year-old used to wake up with the sun even with good blinds...she now sleeps through the night and will sleep in later than us! I would pay for these time and time again to get the extra peace and quiet in the morning! Thank you for these inexpensive miracle workers! Parents, do yourself a favor and get these!" ‚Äî Kate
"I love these so much that I just keep buying them. I think I've reviewed them like five times already but whatever. They are that awesome. If you are renting a home, traveling in hotels/at a family's house, moving to a new house, or just having kids ‚Äî these are LIFE.
I've used them for years under my kids' curtains since they were babies because they truly are blackout. We are military and move A LOT and the first thing I do is buy these before our trip because it's not always possible to hang curtains right away. They are literally just paper; they come extra wide, so you can cut them with scissors to fit your window, and they are peel-and-stick. Too easy." ‚Äî esskay$30 at AmazonAdvertisement
10www.amazon.comA set of wildly popular "hotel" pillowsPromising review: "These had great reviews, but I was still a bit skeptical. I'm a bit of a pillow snob. These pillows ‚Äî these amazing, heavenly pillows ‚Äî are now my favorite part of going to bed. Soft but firm. How does that work? It gives support for me to sleep slightly propped up but I sink into this comfortable personal cloud. Soft but firm. My head isn't sinking through the pillow to rest on my mattress, but I feel comfortably enveloped. Heaven. I bought two but think that would be too much fluff, so now my husband and I each have one. Buy them. Add to cart. Buy now with one click. Stop the research. You've found the pillows you were looking for." ‚Äî Marissa Urey
"God himself must use these pillows. I
have (or had, haha) insomnia, not to mention a bad neck/back and hot flashes. The comfort and the cooling is AMAZING (even with a silk pillowcase). Thank you, TikTok, for influencing me!!!!" ‚Äî Rickie White$60 at Amazon11www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAnd a set of extra soft "hotel" bedsheetsPromising reviews: "I never write reviews, but I am the snob of all snobs when it comes to soft sheets, and these make me not want to get out of bed. Nine months pregnant and with complete insomnia, but these sheets make me not want to get out of bed ever. I just can't believe the prize. Seems like good quality. I'm in bed heaven!" ‚Äî Samantha
"Feel like expensive high-end hotel sheets. I normally use flannel sheets year-round because it‚Äôs the only material I like but these are my new favorite. Very soft. Fit our bed perfectly. I purchased both for our bed and our spare room and have only gotten compliments from guests. Great sheets without the huge sticker price." ‚Äî Anna$35 at Amazon12Melanie Aman / BuzzFeed, Girlfriend CollectiveGirlfriend Collective high-rise compression leggings made from recycled water bottlesGirlfriend Collective is a favorite on our team. BuzzFeed editor Melanie Aman says:
"Right off the bat, I was impressed by how buttery soft these leggings were. They're super stretchy (definitely squat-proof!) and supportive without being constricting. And at $68, they're a total steal given how high-quality they are. I usually wear them for low-impact workouts, like Pilates and yoga (and lounging on the couch), but they didn't let me down during high-impact HIIT cardio classes either. The material is really breathable so even though I'm sweating a lot during my workouts, the leggings don't get swampy."

13www.amazon.comA pair of horizontal glasses ‚Äî don't laugh! ‚Äî that let you read a book or watch TV while lounging in bedPromising review: "I saw these on a couple of TikTok videos and immediately bought them.
They are literally the best thing I‚Äôve ever bought. I was scared they wouldn't fit over my glasses but they do just fine.
I use them to read, watch TV, and scroll through my social media all while lying down. Such a great buy!" ‚Äî Kivy$12 at Amazon14www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comAn affordable sunrise alarm clock you'll really appreciate when you have to wake up before the sunThis can be programmed with seven different light settings, seven different calming "wake up" noises, and to start gradually lighting up at 30, 20, or 10 minutes before they wake.
Promising review: "I got this recommendation from TikTok and it really has helped, especially with Oregon winters where the sun is not out by the time the alarm rings. It has several peaceful alarm settings and even has night music to put you to sleep. The sunrise with the alarm piano is what I play to wake me up every morning, and it is a way better way than to wake up to an annoying phone alarm." ‚Äî Amazon Customer$33 at Amazon15AmazonA faux-sheepskin area rugPromising review: "My parents went to Europe and sat outside on furs like these, and now they do the same at home. They live in the mountains in Utah. They put these on their metal patio chairs and then cover themselves with a blanket outside in the winter. The faux furs keep your backside insulated, and then, topped with the blanket, they are able to have a cocktail hour(s) on the deck all year long! It‚Äôs honestly pretty sweet, and the dog gets her own to lie on when she‚Äôs outside, too." ‚Äî Amazon Customer$15 at AmazonAdvertisement
16www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA set of three remote-control flameless flickering candlesSince you're not really a witch, you'll need some IRL magic to make them work ( AA batteries). There's also a remote to set the dimness, mode, and timer. Check out a TikTok of the flameless candles in action.
Promising review: "I bought the gold glass candle set.
It's almost iridescent gold and looks very elegant. The flame actually moves back and forth. I have mine set to come on in the evening and go off after four hours. The remote allows you to control the brightness of the candle, set a timer for auto on and off, and you can control how bright you want the actual candle inside the glass. I love them and plan to buy the gray glass set for my bedroom. Buy them, you will love them!" ‚Äî Tammy B.$30 at Amazon17Schoolhouse, SchoolhouseA 100% cotton Schoolhouse quiltBy June, I like to swap my comforter for a quilt because they're lighter but still provide some weight. I fell in love with this floral design the second I saw it. It's so retro and fun, and I like that it's reversible. The stitching is A+, it washes well, and it's just really pretty. $300 at Schoolhouse18www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA northern lights projectorPromising review: "I love this light! The stars are beautiful, the colors are beautiful. I like that it shuts off in four hours. I use it in my house so I don‚Äôt have to turn lights on all the time. I like it so much, I just ordered three more to give to my grandchildren.
It also has sounds like the sound of rain, or ocean waves. And you can even play your regular music on it. Don‚Äôt be afraid to try it! It‚Äôs like having the northern lights anytime you want." ‚Äî Amy J Nelson$36 at AmazonAdvertisement
19www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA pair of energy-efficient stained-glass lightbulbsThe LED bulbs could potentially save you up to 90% on your electricity bill when you switch from 40-watt incandescent bulbs.
Promising review: "I love these bulbs. They make any room all warm and cozy. Also a fantastic night-light for the little ones. :) Get you some!" ‚Äî Amazon Customer$20 at Amazon20www.amazon.com, AmazonA wiggly table lamp to properly illuminate your amazing roomPromising review: "I want another one!!! This lamp is so cute and sooooo worth the price! The shade is exactly what I was looking for!" ‚Äî Becky$37 at Amazon21www.amazon.comA cult-favorite luxury-scented candle that reviewers loveIf you're wondering what oud is, think of the smell of fallen trees in the woods after a hard rain.
Lulu Candles is a US-based small business that specializes in scented candles and perfumes.
Promising review: "I was staying over at a friend's house and sitting next to her coffee table. She had this candle on the table and even though it wasn't lit I could smell it, and it was so delicious that I instantly went online to find it and bought it for myself! If this came in a perfume I would buy enough to last the rest of my life. I don't know how to even explain the scent but if you are an amber/patchouli/vanilla fan, this is absolutely for you. The jasmine adds an unbelievable freshness without a flowery scent. I even bought the shampoo and conditioner which I will probably use as more of a body wash and shaving cream but that is how desperate I am to get this scent on me! " ‚Äî

22Heather Braga / BuzzFeed, AmazonAnd a rechargeable lighter with an extra long neckThis butane-free lighter charges with a USB cord and the igniting spark shuts off automatically in seven seconds.
Promising review: "This is seriously the coolest device of my winter holiday. It makes lighting candles a breeze. Yes, there is a weird crackling noise, but that's a super minor annoyance. It's a super intuitive device. Plus the lighter with the USB (included), charge for a bit, then pop it open and light ALL THE THINGS; well, candles. I don't know how well it lights cigarettes or whatever. However, for my personal intended use, it's awesome!" ‚Äî Jee W$10 at Amazon23AmazonDecorative mirrors to add some extra charm to your gallery wallPromising review: "Royalty, that's what I am. I feel like a duke, a prince, a future king." ‚Äî Cristian Ballack $26 at Amazon24www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA Vintage Bookshelf Edition of Candy Land packaged in a book-like boxCheck out a TikTok of the Vintage Bookshelf Edition of Candyland.
Promising review: "I was born in 1983 and this is the EXACT version I adored and obsessed over as a young girl.
Thrilled that I can share this game with my now 4-year-old daughter exactly the way I remember it. Also the book box is amazing. Keeps all the pieces tidy and in good condition. Looks great on the shelf." ‚Äî Elle MK Check out the rest of the vintage game collection on Amazon. $47 at AmazonAdvertisement
25www.amazon.com, AmazonA heart-stoppingly adorable night-light offering a soft glow at bedtimePromising review: "So cute and they work great! The light is the perfect brightness to see, but not too bright that it‚Äôs annoying in the middle of the night. Changing the colors is easy, and I like how it goes off when there‚Äôs enough light in the room." ‚Äî Jas$14 at Amazon26AmazonA shaggy faux-fur duvet cover lined with soft velvet on the bottomOne side is faux-fur and the other side is plush velvet; the twin set comes with one pom-pom fringed pillow sham, and other size sets include two.
Promising review: " This product saves me a ton of money on heat! I got this before fall/winter started and I‚Äôm so happy I did, because I never ever have to turn my heat on at night. Even my boyfriend who gets pretty cold always feels perfect under this (with no heat on). It keeps me extremely warm and locks heat in like no other blanket. I use a regular cheap duvet inside. I have a full-sized mattress and it works great with the queen size ‚Äî but I almost wish I had the king size. When my boyfriend spends the night, it‚Äôs easy for one of us to have too much blanket. If I had gotten the king, it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. So DEF upsize. The color is beautiful and it‚Äôs so cozy! Sometimes i sleep with the fur-side down and sometimes I sleep with it normal. Either one is super soft and cozy." ‚Äî Hannah$52 at Amazon27www.amazon.comA chenille tufted pillowPromising review: "Cozy vibes. I purchased two of these. I think they‚Äôre wonderful. Soft. Comfortable. Perfect floor pillows." ‚Äî Courtney R.$36 at AmazonAdvertisement
28www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA scrunchie or hair claw holderPromising review: "Super cute and good for organizing. You won‚Äôt really see the stand‚Äôs color if you load it to the top, so it doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt like the color. Good price, and I dropped it and it was fine, so that‚Äôs cool too." ‚Äî Maria S.$10 at Amazon29www.amazon.comA pack of 12 shoe storage boxes that snap togetherPromising review: "I bought one set because I had very low expectations. When the small box arrived, I was prepared to be 100% disappointed, BUT these are amazing!!! I didn‚Äôt at all think they were going to be sturdy when connected. I was just negative the entire time. BUT once together, they were great. I have a size 11 foot, and my sneakers fit nicely. I just ordered three more sets, and by the way, they work really well for hats. My husband has all his hats in them, too. They are perfect for hats as well as shoes. I highly recommend." ‚Äî Rochelle Andress$30 at Amazon30www.amazon.com, @miriam. gin1A digital alarm clock so beautiful, you may finally use an actual clock over your phonePromising review: "Love love love this clock... sleek and definitely a statement piece. Alarm is subtle it will definitely wake you up however it will not scare the B-Jesus out of you.

It is tough to adjust if it‚Äôs not attached and I like that. Highly recommend!" ‚Äî Dottie$17 at Amazon33www.amazon.com, www.amazon.comA six-outlet wall charger with two USB fast-charging ports and a night-lightPromising review: "Love this. I have many items to plug in now that I have to office at home. There‚Äôs plenty of room to plug in two laptops, a computer, a monitor and my Alexa safely. It‚Äôs a little bulkier than I was expecting but that is due to the room your items will need." ‚Äî Jennifer$13 at AmazonAdvertisement
34Urban Outfitters, Urban OutfittersA fleece blanket sporting a puffy checkered patternPromising review: "I love this blanket sooo much. It‚Äôs cute, so soft, heavy, and warm. My cats also adore it.
