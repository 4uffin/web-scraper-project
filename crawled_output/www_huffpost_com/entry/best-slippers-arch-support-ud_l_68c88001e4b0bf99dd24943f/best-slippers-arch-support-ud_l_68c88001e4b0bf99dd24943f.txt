Aside from swapping out my sandals for boots to wear outside, the colder weather means it’s also time to pull out only the coziest of slippers. And not just any kind of slippers — slippers with arch support. When your feet have pronounced arches, shopping for shoes can be a struggle, and slippers are notoriously unsupportive. A lot of slippers I’ve come across fail to keep my arches in mind and don’t offer the support they need, leaving me limping around my apartment all day.Advertisement
Thanks to this conundrum and because I’m tired of having achy feet every year, I sought to find the best slippers that offer arch support — and who better to offer recommendations on this topic than other high-arched bipeds like myself? I scoured reviews from fellow slipper-wearers all over the internet to find out which ones are worth buying and which ones to skip. Some reviews even mentioned that certain slippers helped alleviate pain from plantar fasciitis. Check out my findings below. 1AmazonA pair of Zigzagger men's slip-on mocsSlip on these wool-like moc slippers for all day comfort. A closed-back heel gives you extra security as you walk or lounge with a high-density memory foam insole that will mold to your feet while still giving you support. They're machine washable and have a rubber sole to give you traction on indoor flooring or when wearing outside. These come in a bunch of colors in sizes 5-15. Promising review: "My wife bought these for me and I couldn’t be more impressed. The materials these slippers are made of are top notch and the craftsmanship is excellent. These slippers provide great arch support and fit very close to the size chart. Actually perfect! I have flat feet and need a lot of cushioning. They absolutely provide comfort and softness to the feet. The leather material is super high end quality and will last me for sometime to come. The color is very true to the pictures displayed. My wife did good as I needed them. You won’t be disappointed!" — Robb & Shelley$29 at Amazon2KuruKuru Draft II house shoeAiry but still supportive, these reliving slippers have a warm fleece-like lining and a breathable upper. Lighter than previous models, they're easy on the feet while still cupping your heel and giving you countoured support throughout the sole. These come in women's sizes 6-11 and men's sizes 7-13. Promising review: "I'm not usually much of a slipper fan because they are rarely supportive enough for my high arches and supination. These are quite close to perfect for me, and I may become a fan of wearing slippers after all. I love the Kuru shoes I already have, and these are keepers for me, too. Thank you!" — Alexandra V. Women's: $110 at Kuru FootwearMen's: $110 at Kuru Footwear3AmazonUnisex Crocs lined clogRegardless of how you feel about them, Crocs are here to stay — we even spoke with a podiatrist who recommended them as a recovery sandal.

It comes in multiple colors, including olive green, yellow, white, lavender and blue. These roomy Crocs offer a snug fit that will hug your foot and reviews mention they're supportive for high arches, as shown below. Promising review: "This was my first purchase of Crocs. I was looking for a warm slip on with good support to wear at home in winter due to a recent dx of arthritis. I ordered an 8-6 because I generally wear an 8 in slides or summer sandals. They were a perfect fit; plenty of toe space and support for my high arches. By day two the pain in my back was greatly alleviated and they were so comfortable. I definitely will purchase more." — Chris$40 at Amazon$60 at CrocsAdvertisement

I have wood floors and stone tile in my kitchen and it is murder on my high arches. The soles are thick, grip surfaces, and aren't showing any wear after one year. And the inside is plush and provides great support. I do always wear socks to keep the lining clean as these are not machine washable. I do like the style, too. If I didn't need them at home so desperately, I would wear them out and about as a street shoe, too.” — C C$100 at Amazon11AmazonSollbeam fuzzy house slippersWhether you're on the hunt for a slipper to lounge around indoors or to take out the trash, this fuzzy option offers both function and comfort.
