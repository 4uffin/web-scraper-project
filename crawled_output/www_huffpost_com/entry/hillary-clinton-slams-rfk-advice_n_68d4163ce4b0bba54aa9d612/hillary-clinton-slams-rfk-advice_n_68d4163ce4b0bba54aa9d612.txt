Kennedy Jr. over his slew of false and misleading claims on health topics, calling his latest wild medical theories “very destructive.” While appearing on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Wednesday, Clinton warned that Kennedy wants America to revert back to a time when life expectancy rates were much lower.Advertisement
“When I hear people like Kennedy and others talking about getting back to a time when we aren’t vaccinating, we’re drinking raw milk — yeah, and people didn’t live,” Clinton said. “I mean, this is so crazy, it’s so wrongheaded, it’s so shortsighted, and it’s going to cause deaths.” She added: “We just saw two children die from whooping cough. We saw the deaths from measles.” Clinton’s comments come after Trump stood beside Kennedy on Monday to make an announcement linking Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists blasted the administration’s unproven guidance as “irresponsible” and “unsettling” in a Monday statement. Kennedy, who was appointed by Trump, has a long history of making misleading and erroneous statements about health, including making repeated public statements about vaccines that have cast doubt on their safety.

Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials have called out Kennedy over his sweeping changes to the nation’s vaccine policies after the White House terminated Dr. Susan Monarez as CDC director in August. While discussing the efforts of the Clinton Health Access Initiative, Clinton turned her sights to criticizing the Trump administration’s overhaul of the Department of Health and Human Services.Hillary Clinton and Robert F.

“We’re doing a series of working groups, and in those working groups are experts, not just from the United States but all over, and one of the biggest concerns is what we are doing in our own country to put our own people’s health at risk: dismantling public health, listening to literally crackpot ideas about what’s happening,” she said. Clinton then argued that Kennedy and Trump want to “literally turn the clock back” on the country’s medical advancements. “When I see what is likely to happen because people are being confused — when your president says something, when a Kennedy who’s the secretary of HHS says something, what are you supposed to believe?” she said.

Clinton added: “When you fire experts who’ve spent their entire life studying something that I want to know about. I have three grandchildren. I want to make sure they’re healthy.” Clinton went on to declare that “people are being confused” by the Trump administration’s “very destructive, anti-science tirade.” TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
