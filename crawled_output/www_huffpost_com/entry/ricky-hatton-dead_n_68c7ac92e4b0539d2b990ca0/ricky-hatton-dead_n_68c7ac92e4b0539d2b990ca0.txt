He hadn’t fought since losing for the third time in his career, against Vyacheslav Senchenko in 2012.Advertisement
Pacquiao’s tributeHatton won world titles at light-welterweight and welterweight and at the height of his career shared the ring with the best boxers of his generation including Kostya Tszyu, Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao.“He was not only a great fighter inside the ring but also a brave and kind man in life,” Pacquiao posted on X. “Ricky fought bravely, not just in the ring, but in his journey through life.

A legend, a warrior, and a great person,” said former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney on X.Advertisement
Hatton was open about the mental health issues he endured upon his retirement from the ring.“As fighters, we tell ourselves we’re strong — we train, we sweat, we take hits, we get up. But sometimes the hardest fight happens in silence, in the mind,” Khan added on X. “Mental health isn’t weakness. It’s part of being human. And we must talk about it. We must reach out. We must lean on each other.”Top of the sportHatton’s all-action style added to his popularity. He built up a passionate following in the UK before truly announcing himself on the world stage with his epic victory against Tszyu for the IBF world super lightweight (light welterweight) title in 2005.Pound for pound great Tszyu had only lost twice before, but was forced to retire on his stool in front of 22,000 fans in Manchester.Advertisement

While he lost to Senchenko, the very fact he managed to return to the ring was seen as a personal triumph.The British Boxing Board of Control said it was “very saddened” to hear of his passing.Man City fanOutside of the ring, Hatton was a lifelong fan of Manchester City.The Premier League club had a minute’s appreciation for Hatton at Sunday’s derby against Manchester United. Before kickoff at the Etihad Stadium, fans from both teams rose to applaud Hatton in a show of unity and affection for the boxer.Advertisement
“Ricky was one of City’s most loved and revered supporters, who will always be remembered for a glittering boxing career that saw him win world titles at welterweight and light-welterweight,” City said in a statement. “Everyone at the Club would like to send our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends at this difficult time.”The announcement of Hatton’s return to the ring later this year came after he had enjoyed success as a trainer, coaching Zhanat Zhakiyanov to a world bantamweight title win in 2017.
