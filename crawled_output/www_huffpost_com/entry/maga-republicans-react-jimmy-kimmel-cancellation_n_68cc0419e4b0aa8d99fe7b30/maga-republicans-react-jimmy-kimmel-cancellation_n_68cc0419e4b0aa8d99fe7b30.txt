That prompted Nexstar, the nation’s largest television station owner, to pull Kimmel’s show from their nearly 200 local channels.While critics worried about what the move meant for the future of free speech, President Donald Trump’s most ardent supporters celebrated Kimmel’s ouster.In a furious screed on X, formerly Twitter, Megyn Kelly accused Kimmel of “smearing an entire movement” with a “vile disgusting lie,” while claiming the “threat against those on the right is at an all-time high.”Advertisement
I’m not sure who needs to hear this but Jimmy Kimmel got on the air and falsely stated as a fact that Charlie Kirk’s killer was MAGA, smearing an entire movement and Trump in particular with a vile disgusting lie - and at a time when the threat against those on the right is at an…— Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) September 18, 2025Don't threaten us with a good time https://t.co/1nh3qlMys6— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) September 18, 2025“This was an intentional lie to GIN UP HATRED toward the very group of ppl most suffering in the wake of our devastating loss of Charlie and Kimmel did it willfully and even gleefully to a cheering complicit audience,” she wrote, adding that any media organization would have sacked Kimmel for his remarks.Advertisement
Ben Shapiro glibly responded to someone suggesting major ABC and Disney talent strike in support of Kimmel by saying, “Don’t threaten us with a good time.”The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh said the late night host was merely handed the same fate as conservatives fired for controversial comments in years past.“These are the repercussions that conservatives have been experiencing for years for infractions not nearly as egregious,” he wrote on X. “Good riddance, Kimmel, you disgusting scumbag.”Advertisement
Jimmy Kimmel’s career just got assassinated. Who is laughing now? @jimmykimmel— Laura Loomer (@LauraLoomer) September 17, 2025Yeah imagine an administration putting pressure on a television channel to fire a comedian they didn’t like. https://t.co/gR3hTSVJ9f— Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) September 18, 2025White House insider Laura Loomer was surprisingly flippant given the context, posting, “Jimmy Kimmel’s career just got assassinated. Who is laughing now?” Advertisement
Rage-bait peddler Libs of TikTok weighed in with a repost from conspiracy-theory-enthusiast Roseanne Barr, who responded to a Kimmel supporter saying, “Yeah imagine an administration putting pressure on a television channel to fire a comedian they didn’t like.”Back in 2018, ABC canceled Barr’s “Roseanne” reboot in 2018 after she compared former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to an ape.TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
