Among the guests were White House adviser Stephen Miller, who vowed to channel “righteous anger” to go after “left-wing organizations” in the aftermath of Kirk’s death.The vice president continued in a similar vein during his outgoing monologue as he made claims about left-wing violence and implied, without evidence, that Kirk’s killer was motivated by far-left ideology.In a sign that the Trump administration is preparing for a crackdown on liberal and leftist groups, Vance said unity in America would only emerge “when we work to dismantle the institutions that promote violence and terrorism in our own country.”Advertisement
Among many pointed remarks, Vance falsely claimed it was a fact that “people on the left are much likelier to defend and celebrate political violence.” “This is not a both-sides problem. If both sides have a problem, one side has a much bigger and malignant problem, and that is the truth,” he said.He went on to argue that “while our side of the aisle certainly has its crazies, it is a statistical fact that most of the lunatics in American politics today are proud members of the far left.”Advertisement
Vance also attacked The Nation, a progressive magazine, and accused it of misquoting Kirk.He blasted the “well-funded, well-respected magazine whose publishing history goes back to the American Civil War. George Soros’ Open Society [Foundations] funds this magazine, as does the Ford Foundation and many other wealthy titans of the American progressive movement.”“Charlie was gunned down in broad daylight, and well-funded institutions of the left lied about what he said so as to justify his murder,” Vance claimed.Vance noted the Ford Foundation and the nonprofit run by Soros, a Democratic megadonor, receive “generous tax treatment,” suggesting they could be targeted in any crackdown.Advertisement
Bhaskar Sunkara, president of The Nation, made clear the magazine is “not funded, not one dime, by Soros or Open Society Foundation.” A spokesperson from the Open Society Foundations denied Vance’s claim that it funds political violence, saying: “We oppose all forms of violence and condemn the outrageous accusations to the contrary. Our work is entirely peaceful and lawful.”“It is disgraceful to use this tragedy for political ends to dangerously divide Americans and attack the First Amendment,” they added. In his broadcast, Vance also asked his followers to identify anyone rejoicing in Kirk’s death to get them fired from their jobs.“When you see someone celebrating Charlie’s murder, call them out, and hell, call their employer,” he said. “We don’t believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.”PowerOurJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour membership fuels reporting that informs, inspires, and holds power accountable.
