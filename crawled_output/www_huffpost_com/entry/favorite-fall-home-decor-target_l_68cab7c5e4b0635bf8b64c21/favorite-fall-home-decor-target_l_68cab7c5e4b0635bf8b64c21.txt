As a kid, I loved spending fall weekends outside with my dad raking leaves and later go inside to admire the way my mom had decorated the mantle and living room, with homemade soups and stews cooking on the stove. To me, this season is synonymous with the feeling of love, family, and home.Today, I enjoy recreating fall memories with my family (when my girls were little, I was known to show up in my witch costume at the bus stop), and capturing that feeling of coziness at home. Dad’s no longer with us, but it’s always in the fall I miss him most, so having my home decorated for fall like my mom always did reminds me of those long ago days, and why the season means so much to me. Today, I love sharing my fall decor finds with my mom — now she visits my home to admire the ways I decorate for our family’s favorite season, and of course we’ll reminisce about memories of the old days.

An autumnal arrangementA faux eucalyptus arrangement to add a touch of quintessential fall warmth in your space without overdoing it. It looks great on a mantle, as a table’s center piece, or tucked in a corner on your kitchen counter. Get this in two sizes: 11 inches or 22 inches.Promising review: “Perfect little fall plant. I like the realistic look and feel of the leaves on this one since that’s what I’m most picky with when shopping for faux stems/plants. I needed a smaller moody fall plant for my coffee nook and this does not disappoint!” – Justrunningerrands $17+ at TargetSome expensive-looking glass pumpkinsThese amber glass pumpkins look like they costs more than they actually do and add a warm sophisticated, element of autumn to your home. I have the small and tall sizes on either side of my mantle. They’d also work well as a centerpiece for your fall table. Get these in a total of three sizes and/or shapes.Promising review: “These pumpkins are made of a high-quality glass in a beautiful amber color with the ability to match any style. They exceeded my expectations and I would absolutely purchase again!” — Briauna $10+ at TargetJennifer Samson-AckerOr a clear version that "looks like Pottery Barn," according to one reviewerIf you tend to opt for a clean, classic aesthetic, or just love anything pumpkin, this clear gourd feels airy with a hint of glam with a simple design that can work with any decor you already have. These are available in the same mix of sizes as the previous option.Promising review: “Gorgeous. Looks like pottery barn. Coffee cup for size reference.Target also wrapped it safely for delivery, which doesn’t happen often for me.” — Missa $10+ at TargetAdvertisement
Jennifer Samson-AckerA harvest chestnut candle in a glass jar that smells earthy, woody, musky, and slightly sweetScent preferences can be personal, but I’ve had this candle for a year now (they’ve changed the design slightly from last fall) and love it just as much as when I first lit it – it reminds me of the woods. With no labels, or anything to distract your eye, it’s elegant and calming. The glass is so pretty you’ll want to save it when the candle burns down. You can also get it in three different scents. (It's pictured here on my sideboard with an adorable ceramic witch figurine that you can read more about in slide 13.)Promising review: “Great price candle! It smells wonderful and the candle is beautiful! Perfect fall scent and style for my coffee table!” – Allison Burks$7 at TargetAdvertisement
A few fall leaf stems to bring some of the outside inIn my experience, these artificial stems fit well in this Target vase and will look lovely adorning your mantle or entryway. I added two bunches to my vase (see next slide) and fanned them out a little. For three months they’ll be on my hearth. Promising review: “Very nice stem, the picture shows a single stem to show size. Coloring and materials are good as well and this stem doesn’t scream “fake” to me. I would definitely add more for a full arrangement but I’m very happy with the quality overall.” – home8279$12 at TargetJennifer Samson-AckerA textured ceramic vaseThis piece will work for any season, but pairs perfectly with my fall stems. It’s simple and classic so your seasonal arrangements remain the focal point. Get this in two versatile sizes for fresh or artificial greenery.Promising review: “The quality is just amazing. The texture gives it an expensive feel without costing too much money.” – EmilyL$20+ at TargetAdvertisement
A woven striped square pillow that you can add to a basket or your favorite arm chairThis striped pillow is a nice size, plush, and comfortable to rest on. The neutral color scheme pairs great with throw blankets. I have one in a basket near my fireplace.Promising review: “Love love love this pillow. If you’re wanting a little dimension and texture I think this one is perfect. It’s comfortable to lay on and cute to look at, which I think is a win.” – Kate“The colors are so beautiful and perfect for fall! I’m hoping to get away with having them out year long! I love that the cover is removable for easy care too.” – themariss $20 at TargetOr a cotton velvet throw pillowI have a few of these pillows on my light gray couch and arm chair. They add warmth and dimension to a room, and also work well as a bolster pillow for your back, or arms. The throw pillows look and feel luxurious and like they’d be from more expensive mid century retailers. Be warned these are selling fast and only a few colors are left. Promising review: “Beautiful color that goes great with my fall decor!” – Mommybreen$20 at TargetA woven basket for storing your favorite fall blankets and pillowsHaving a cozy spot to stash some extra blankets and pillows will make a room feel homey and inviting. (Be on the lookout for baskets that are sometimes out of stock online, but possibly available at your local Target.) Promising review: “Such pretty baskets for a good price. I put two of these under my entryway table with a blanket stuffed in one. Looks amazing.” – Jenna $20+ at TargetAdvertisement
A chunky knot-pattern throw blanketA soft cozy throw blanket for movie nights and slow Sunday afternoons is an easy way to make a room feel inviting and relaxing. Give yourself permission to indulge in some hot apple cider with your favorite read underneath this warm throw on a chilly fall day. (Three other color options are available.) Promising review: “I got the orange color and it's absolutely, stunning. Very fall like and soft. Washed excellent.” – Shopping craze$34 at TargetA witch figurine to cast some spells this fall, and add an element of haunt to your homeThis little witch is also available in a set of three figurines, but she can stand on her own perfectly fine, like every good witch can. She's more cute than scary, but maybe witches are after all. At just $5, these are a deal. (You can also buy a purple- or gray-haired gal individually.)Promising review: “Love it so cute good quality would definitely purchase it again. Would definitely recommend it and I bought the other one.” – Mat$5 at TargetOr a whimsical ghost that a self-described "crazy cat lady" lovesThis cute little ghost can add some whimsy and fun to your room. I love some playful elements of decor to make the child in us all smile, and remind us of the magic of the spooky season. Promising review: “This little ghost adds a cute spooky flair to any living space. As a 'crazy cat lady' I always love finding Halloween decor that has a cat element to it. The paint job on my figure was solid which I appreciate, but sometimes those little imperfections carry their own charm. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.” – Autumn5.00 at TargetAdvertisement

Promising review: "These have been my go to taper candles for a few years now, you won't find better quality for the price. They burn well, don't drip, and last a long time.
