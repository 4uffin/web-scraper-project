“Our Council of Autistic Advisors shared that the language and tone of the press conference caused profound hurt across the Autism community,” the Autism Society of America said in a statement. “To describe an individual as being at the heart of a ‘horrible, horrible crisis’ that is ‘destroying families’ is not only inaccurate, it is dehumanizing and dangerous.”Comments from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. describing autistic people also drew criticism, as well as the suggestion that mothers could be blamed for their children having autism. “For decades, autism has been explained through scapegoating mothers ― cold parenting, wrong feeding, wrong choices, wrong medical decisions,” Sara Rodrigues, Executive Director of Balanced Learning Center, a nonprofit that works on therapies for autistic people, told USA Today. “The targets shift, but the underlying message is the same… autism is your fault, and you should feel guilty.”Advertisement
Advocates called for increased investment in research and a focus on inclusive education and health care policies. The White House has told NPR that the announcement this week included two parents of children with autism, who “praised President Trump for actually listening to the questions and concerns of parents across the country ― questions and concerns that this President and Administration remain committed to addressing.”20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
