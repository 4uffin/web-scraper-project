An elevator chat with a woman before this interview proved that.“She asked me what band I was in and I told her I was a guitarist doing solo shows and my day job is a band called Tesla,” Hannon recalled. “And she immediately said, ‘Oh, the car?’ And I said, ‘No, the band.’”Advertisement
Hannon, 59, is carving out his own space with a new Western-inspired instrumental album called “Reflections.” He played tracks for a small audience at the Cutting Room last week and also spoke to HuffPost.Frank Hannon at Cutting Room 2nd clip—

But Hannon said he still needs to “make a living.” “We’re fortunate that we still get paid pretty good as a band and that people still love our songs,” he said. “Tesla has always been a working man’s band.”Tesla guitarist Frank Hannon is out with a Western-style instrumental album.Brandon GullionSocial media commenters often refer to Tesla as “underrated,” a label Hannon embraces.“I think we’ve always been underdogs a little bit in the sense we’ve never had a huge household main hit in a way,” he said. “Forty years and we’re still doing residencies at House of Blues in Vegas (one begins next month) and still playing all over the country. Being underrated, or whatever, is better than being overrated.”Advertisement
Hannon won’t be accused of being political, however.“I stay away from it, man,” he said. “I believe in guitar and I believe in just creating an escape for people to not think about politics ... I wanna create music to give people a place to go where they’re not thinking about that.”Frank Hannon, right, with his Tesla bandmates at Detroit's Joe Louis Arena in 1987.Icon and Image via Getty ImagesRelatedteslafrank hannonRoger Waters Launches Brutally Blunt Attack On The Late Ozzy OsbourneSabrina Carpenter Says New Album Cover Is 'Approved By God'Kid Rock Goes Into Meltdown Mode After Getting Punked By Gavin Newsom’s X AccountCritics Cringe Over Sean Hannity's Fawning Fox News Interview With Elon Musk Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
