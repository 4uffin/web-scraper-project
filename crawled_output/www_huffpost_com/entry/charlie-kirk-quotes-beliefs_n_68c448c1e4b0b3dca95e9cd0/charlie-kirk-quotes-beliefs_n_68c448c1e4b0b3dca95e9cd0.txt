Here are 14 moments of Kirk’s that are going viral once again:1. At a Turning Point USA event in 2023, Kirk said he thinks gun deaths are “worth it” to have a Second Amendment.“We must also be real. We must be honest with the population. Having an armed citizenry comes with a price, and that is part of liberty... We need to be very clear that you’re not going to get gun deaths to zero. It will not happen. But I think it’s worth it. I think it’s worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year, so that we can have the Second Amendment,” he said.

2. On his self-titled radio talk show, Kirk expressed his dislike of the word “empathy.”“I can’t stand the word empathy, actually,” he said. “I think empathy is a made-up, new age term that does a lot of damage.”The Charlie Kirk Show / Twitter: @FortunateRamen3. Appearing on Jubilee’s internet show “Surrounded,” Kirk insisted Black people were “better” in the 1940s under Jim Crow laws.While debating a college student, Kirk said, “They were actually better in the 1940s. It was bad. It was evil. But what happened? Something changed. They committed less crimes.”The person he debated responded, “4,000 Black men, women, and children were killed in violent lynch mobs. Racial terror permeated American culture for hundreds of years. You don’t think that affected the generational psyche of an entire group of people?”“Black America is worse than it has been in the last 80 years,” he interrupted. youtube.comAdvertisement
4. During this same Jubilee episode, Kirk was asked what he would want his daughter to do if she were 10 years old and pregnant following rape.After calling the scenario graphic, he responds, “The answer is yes. The baby would be delivered.”youtube.com5. At a Turning Point USA event, Kirk suggested trans people are wearing the gender equivalent of “Black face.”He said, “A man who calls himself trans is wearing ‘woman face,’ no different than I would wear Black face trying to be a Black person. It’s assuming an identity that isn’t yours.” Instagram: Charlie Kirk 1776 / Instagram: @charliekirk17766. On his radio show, Kirk not only said that Joy Reid, Michelle Obama, Sheila Jackson Lee, and Ketanji Brown Jackson are “affirmative action picks”...Proof if you don’t believe it: pic.twitter.com/E8x6n35Bhc https://t.co/PxgXf74beB— JaValle (@JaValle) September 10, 20257. ...He also said certain Black women “do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.”Andrew Harnik / Getty ImagesAdvertisement
8. After Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announced their engagement, Kirk fantasized about Kelce making Swift “more conservative” and begged the pop star to “submit to her husband.”“This is something that I hope will make Taylor Swift more conservative,” he said. “Engage in reality more… Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor. You’re not in charge.”Olivier Touron / Getty ImagesAdvertisement
9. On X, Kirk insisted, “Gun control, like vaccines and masks, is focused on making people feel ‘safe’ by taking freedoms away from others. Don’t fall for it.”Gun control, like vaccines and masks, is focused on making people feel “safe” by taking freedoms away from others. Don’t fall for it.— Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) May 30, 202210. Following the tragic January collision between an American Airlines plane and a Black Hawk Army helicopter, Donald Trump suggested diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts were at fault. Kirk added to this, saying:“If I see a Black pilot, I’m going to be like, ‘Boy, I hope he’s qualified.’”The Charlie Kirk Show: Thought Crime / Instagram: @blklivesmatter11.

Instead, Kirk, who is not a medical examiner and did not examine Floyd’s body, said his death was caused by “overdose.”Telling how so many pastors were mad that George Floyd overdosed but don’t care a white woman was brutally murdered by a 14 count repeat offender.— Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) September 8, 202513. Kirk wanted to raise the age of retirement, and didn’t think people should retire at all.“Now, I will say that for future retirees, people under the age of 45, we should absolutely raise the retirement age. I’m going to say something very provocative. I’m not a fan of retirement. I don’t think retirement is biblical,” he said. “You say, ‘Charlie, I’m just gonna retire and I’m just gonna go golf.’ I think, what a waste of the gifts that God has given you.”Advertisement
14. And finally, but certainly not last:During Pride Month, children’s show host Ms. Rachel, aka Rachel Griffin-Accurso, wished followers a happy Pride and responded to subsequent backlash by quoting the Bible and expressing the importance of ”[loving] every neighbor.” In response, Kirk attempted to cite the Bible to prove a point about his anti-gay views, but he ultimately misquoted a mixture of passages from Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus 20:13. He said, “Thou shall lay with another man, shall be stoned to death. Just saying... The chapter...affirms God’s perfect law when it comes to sexual matter.” TruthSavesLivesYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionDangerous myths about medicine spread fastest when watchdogs are silenced.
