Jenna Ortega raised (bleached) eyebrows with the most interesting look of the night, as the “Wednesday” actor donned a custom bejeweled Givenchy look created by Sarah Burton. Meg Statler also made headlines for showing up in a simple Hanes and Levi’s outfit, paired with a homemade, statement-making bag referencing a Gaza ceasefire.
