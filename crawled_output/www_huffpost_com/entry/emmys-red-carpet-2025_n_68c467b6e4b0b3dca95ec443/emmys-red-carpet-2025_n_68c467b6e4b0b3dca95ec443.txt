The show, hosted by stand-up comedian Nate Bargatze, took place at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Advertisement
Jenna Ortega raised (bleached) eyebrows with the most interesting look of the night, as the “Wednesday” actor donned a custom bejeweled Givenchy look created by Sarah Burton. Meg Statler also made headlines for showing up in a simple Hanes and Levi’s outfit, paired with a homemade, statement-making bag referencing a Gaza ceasefire. On the E! red carpet, “power red” was a theme that resonated for many of the women, including Sydney Sweeney in a glamorous, Old Hollywood look by Oscar de la Renta, and Selena Gomez in Louis Vuitton.
