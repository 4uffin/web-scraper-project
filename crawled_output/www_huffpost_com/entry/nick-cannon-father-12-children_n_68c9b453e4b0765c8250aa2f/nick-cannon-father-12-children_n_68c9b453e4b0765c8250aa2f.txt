Cannon responded: “Yeah… I’m learning that now.”“It wasn’t like I was acting out, It was more of being careless, being frivolous of my process because I could do it,” he continued.Nick Cannon attends WayMaker Men's Summit Presented By BET Experience at The Beehive on June 6 in Los Angeles, California.Paras Griffin via Getty ImagesHe went on to say his “access” as a celebrity figure played a significant role in his journey as a father of many. Cannon acknowledged that in hindsight, he lacked maturity. He said he never intended to have a dozen children, but adopted a carefree approach that led him to his current outcome. Advertisement
“Being almost 45 now, I can sit back… If I would have thought the process through a little bit more and took time to actually do the inner work, things might have been a little different in certain scenarios,” he said. When asked if he would still have 12 children, Cannon emphasized the love he has for them — but returned to the idea of doing “the work” to heal from his past divorce from Carey.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
