“We deeply regret this mistake and sincerely apologize to the family of Charlie Kirk and to all. We made an error in judgment. The cartoon has been removed from our digital platforms,” the statement said.The death of Charlie Kirk, memorialized in a makeshift shrine at Orem City Center Park in Utah, continues to inflame sensitivities over media coverage.MELISSA MAJCHRZAK via Getty ImagesThe syndicated cartoon by former Pulitzer finalist Chip Bok ran Saturday, showing an empty chair with splattered blood above it. An arrow points from the words “Turning Point USA,” the name of Kirk’s organization, to the chair.Advertisement
Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Donald Trump ally, wrote that the “unconscionable” work “trivialized” the death of Kirk. “Cancel Newsday!” he urged on X.U.S. Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.) also joined the outcry that the cartoonist, who is not employed by Newsday, be fired.Suffolk County Republican Party Chairman Jesse Garcia had demanded a boycott of Newsday until it apologized to Kirk’s family, readers of Newsday “and to every American who still believes in freedom of speech.” But he accepted the newspaper’s mea culpa on Sunday.Advertisement

Instead of generating debate, it inflamed emotions. We regret the upset it caused.”It has been a tightrope walk for media in the aftermath of Kirk’s death, given his controversial views. Reporters and others who were critical of him or perceived to not properly mourn his passing have paid the price in job loss, suspension, ridicule from a network colleague and online abuse.Advertisement
