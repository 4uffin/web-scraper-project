“Finding the perfect place in Trump Tower to hang a framed copy of Donald Trump’s birthday note to Jeffrey Epstein,” the duo wrote Tuesday on X, formerly Twitter, with an accompanying photo showing Selvig holding up the letter on a wall next to the directory.The 2003 note for Epstein’s 50th birthday was typed inside the hand-drawn silhouette of a naked woman, with Trump’s apparent signature forming her pubic hair. It said “enigmas never age” and included the sentiment “may every day be another wonderful secret.”While the president sued The Wall Street Journal in July for reporting on the document and claimed he didn’t write it, the Epstein estate was later subpoenaed for the original copy. Some say Trump is thus “running out of options” in terms of his ongoing litigation.Advertisement
Epstein died while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019, with his death behind bars and ties to powerful people fueling theories of a “client list.” Trump officials vowed to get to the bottom of this, only to later reverse course — and enrage his own base.The Good Liars have been demanding answers in their own way, most recently by flooding the Trump Tower gift shop in July with a photo of Trump and Epstein palling around Mar-a-Lago in 1997. The president’s former friendship with Epstein has been well documented.🚨🚨HERE IT IS: We got Trump’s birthday note to Jeffrey Epstein that the President said doesn’t exist.Trump talks about a “wonderful secret” the two of them shared.

The White House reiterated Trump’s denial about the letter in a statement Tuesday.“This isn’t the President’s signature — and it’s not news that Epstein knew Donald Trump, because Donald Trump kicked Epstein out of his club for being a creep,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson told The Daily Beast about Epstein being kicked out of Mar-a-Lago in 2007.Epstein and his former partner Ghislaine Maxwell victimized women and children, with Tuesday’s stunt once again drawing attention to the scandal. The prank spawned a flurry of comments on social media but didn’t quite go over well in person.PowerOurJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour membership fuels reporting that informs, inspires, and holds power accountable.
