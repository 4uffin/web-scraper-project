If your toothbrush’s bristles have lately looked like those of an old broom, it’s probably time to replace them. Here’s your sign to do so while electric-powering your dental health. This popular, Oral-B iO Deep Clean rechargeable electric toothbrush is loved by many for its battery life, travel case and light-up pressure sensor that warns you if you’re brushing too hard. And for the time first in weeks, it’s 40% off for Prime Members, as part of Amazon’s Early Prime Day sales, ahead of the Big Deals Day event on Oct. 7 and 8. This model doesn’t go on sale often and the last time it did — it was not for this good of a price. So believe us when we say, you’ll want to act fast. Advertisement
$59.99 for prime members at Amazon (regularly $99.99)Reviewers love this brush because of its cleaning power — “I literally feel like I’ve gone to the dentist after using this toothbrush,” one wrote. This Series 3 electric toothbrush includes a travel case, a charging cord and an extra brush head. It also has a built-in two-minute timer, which breaks down brush time into four 30-second intervals for each quadrant of your mouth, and three cleaning modes for customized brushing: daily clean, sensitive, and whitening. A pressure sensor alerts you when you’re brushing too hard or need to apply more pressure, plus it claims to last up to two weeks on a single charge, and many customers seem to agree.Advertisement
“I’m really glad I bought this,” says one reviewer. “It is way better than the budget old-school ones like my 5000 series. The brush spins better, it is quiet in comparison, the battery lasts a really long time, and it gets my teeth squeaky clean.”If you need that dentist-clean feel, grab this Oral-B electric toothbrush while it’s on sale today, and read on for more promising reviews.$59.99 for prime members at Amazon (regularly $99.99)Advertisement
Read on for more promising reviews of the Oral-B iO Series 3 electric toothbrush:“I’ve had a few Oral-B electric toothbrushes over the years. They are always great. I usually buy the budget models. And I have had lots of luck with them as far as reliability. I wanted to try the io series when it launched, but I couldn’t see the point in spending so much$. The budget ones keep my teeth clean just fine. Well I finally got my chance. The battery in my 5000 series weakened so I could justify replacing it. I read some reviews and the io series 3 seemed to be great - I don’t need more than it offers. I don’t want Bluetooth or anything. And it was only $99. More than I’d usually want to spend… but I’m willing to splurge for super clean teeth. I’m really glad I bought this. It is way better than the budget old school ones like my 5000 series. The brush spins better, it is quiet in comparison, the battery lasts a really long time, and it gets my teeth squeaky clean. I love the light that tells me if I’m brushing too hard. It is easy to get used to. And when you complete a full brushing - it does a little rainbow light show to celebrate your accomplishment. Fun. The brush heads are easy to rinse and the unit came with a little stand to stick the brush heads too while they are drying. Always wash your electric toothbrush heads after use and store them separate from the unit to dry - or they get skunky, funky and gunky. It’s a little extra work compared to just rinsing off a manual toothbrush. But hygiene is important. I want to buy one of these Oral B io3 toothbrushes for everybody I know.” — Spunky Punky Sparkle Princess “My dentist recommended this toothbrush―-any of the oral b, io models. I bought the least expensive and the thing is the absolute best toothbrush I have ever had. I have only used it twice and feel a significant difference in how clean my teeth feel. It feels like the plaque is being shook off my teeth in a good way. Just like how your teeth feel after a good cleaning at the dentist. HIGHLY recommend.” — Kelly Brock “I literally feel like I’ve gone to the dentist after using this toothbrush. It’s so effective without feeling harsh. I love this toothbrush. Prior to this Oral-B toothbrush, I was using Philips Sonicare. I will never go back. Oral B is way better. Now I just need to see if it lasts longer. The carrying case it comes with is great, it charges fast, and I’m just overall really happy with this toothbrush.” — Spenser “I had an older Oral-B electric toothbrush that I loved, but it was getting older. So I bought this one, liking the fact that it had a carrying case for travel. Wow! This brush is almost ultrasonic on your teeth, and so easy to use! It will hold a charge for about a week (I haven’t tried longer), so I can take it on trips without the charger, and not have to go without my electric toothbrush- yay!” — Kindle Customer “If you are new to the electric toothbrush world or have dabbled with cheaper disposable AA battery-powered brushes, this is the best entry point. This is a great brush—it has everything you need and nothing extra. The pressure light is helpful, and the 30-second timer pulse is great. Everything is well thought out. Your teeth will feel dentist-visit clean everyday.” — Caleb M Smith “WOW! This is the best toothbrush I’ve ever used! It lets you know if you are brushing to hard, or soft, by a flashing light around the top. And it gives you that after dentist cleaning feeling. Worth ever penny!!” — Amazon Customer$59.99 for prime members at Amazon (regularly $99.99)Advertisement
