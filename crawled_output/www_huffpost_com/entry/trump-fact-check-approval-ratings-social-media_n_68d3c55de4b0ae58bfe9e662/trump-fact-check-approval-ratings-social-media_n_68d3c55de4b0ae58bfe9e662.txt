“By them not coming, we’re saving tremendous numbers of lives,” he added. “My people have done a fantastic job in doing what they did, and the American public agrees with it. I mean, I was very proud to see this morning I have the highest poll numbers I’ve ever had.”Trump was almost immediately fact-checked by critics on social media, however, who noted that the latest YouGov/Economist poll published earlier this month placed his overall approval rating at an all-time low of 39%.“Highest poll numbers? It must have been a private polling of sycophants and ass kissers because in the real world his poll numbers are far below sea level,” wrote one user on X, formerly Twitter, with another person asking: “He reading the charts upside down?”Advertisement
While Trump certainly has numerous polls to pick from, none from reputable sources appear to make his case.Trump: "I was very proud to see this morning I have the highest poll numbers I've ever had." pic.twitter.com/8xakEegoDm— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 23, 2025 That point was made just as swiftly Tuesday on social media, where several users shared summaries of the president’s current approval rating — with Reuters/Ipsos, Gallup and Quinnipiac polls showing his overall approval rating at 42%, 40% and 37%, respectively.Advertisement
“It must be nice to be this fucking delusional all the time,” one user wrote Tuesday on X, with another person commenting: “So someone’s spoon-feeding him fake news in bite-sized pieces and dumb cartoons that totally distort reality, huh?”Trump has had an obsession with ratings at least as far back as when he hosted NBC’s “The Apprentice.” With the numbers clearly not in his favor now, one user wondered: “Serious question, is he lying, are people lying to him, or does he just not know?” pic.twitter.com/84qeCp50Ag— Chris Havens 🇨🇦 (@birddman19) September 23, 2025 Advertisement
