Heated blankets are made with heating wires underneath the soft materials to provide some extra warmth and comfort, as well as potentially save you some money on heating bills if you want to be warm but don’t want to turn the heat on in your whole house.If you’re new to heated blankets, you might have heard some safety concerns arise with them in the past, but don’t worry — we’re here to make it all clear. Though there’s a myth that the electric and magnetic fields (EMFs) in heated blankets can cause cancer, there’s no substantial evidence to support that hypothesis. As for the idea that electric blankets can cause house fires, the Electrical Safety Foundation reports that almost all of the 500 fires caused per year by electric blankets are because of blankets that are more than 10 years old (all the more reason to buy a new one).Advertisement
Basically, as long as your blanket isn’t super old or misused, you shouldn’t have to worry about it posing a threat to your safety. Many blankets now have auto-shut off features as well to avoid overheating. Better yet, you can look for blankets that have an ETL (Electric Testing Laboratories) certification or UL certification, both of which indicate that they’ve been tested for compliance with safety standards.Or, in this case, you don’t have to look, because we’ve done the work for you. We rounded up some of the best electric heated blankets on Amazon, and made sure that all of them are either ETL- or UL-certified. We’ve also made sure that they’re all machine-washable, because who has the time to hand-wash or dry clean a whole blanket? Just always unplug the power cord first and follow any other care instructions provided by the manufacturer.Below, keep reading for some of the most beloved heated blankets available on Amazon, and get ready to curl up with your new cozy companion.Advertisement
1AmazonThis bestselling electric heated blanketThe top bestseller in the electric blanket category, this heated blanket comes in 19 colors and patterns and five sizes, from throw to king. It has six heat settings and four time interval settings with a customizable auto-off timer. The queen and king sizes have dual controls, so couples sharing the blanket can each set their own preferences for their side.$36 at Amazon2AmazonA fast-heating, patterned heated throw blanketTo spice up this list of mostly solid-colored options, here's a throw blanket from Ventimi that comes in four patterns and colors. The blanket has an 8.5-foot power cord, is machine-washable and can get up to 115 degrees within 45 minutes. It also has an auto-shutoff feature after three hours, aka the perfect length for a nap on the couch. The blanket is made with a thick sherpa and flannel material, and has five heat settings.Promising review: "We love this blanket! First purchased as a gift from one daughter to my other (for Christmas) but all of my kids fight over it! I’ve since bought several more. It works great and it’s super soft. Great blanket for the price." — B&R$30 at Amazon3AmazonOr this eye-catching blanket with a cool textured designAvailable in five colors and four sizes, this Texciting heated blanket stands out thanks to the fun, boxy textural fabric, which can add something new to your decor. The throw size has six heat settings, while the largest size (queen) has 10. There's a two to 10-hour automatic shutoff timer as well as overheat protection, and the reverse side is a soft cream color.$32 at AmazonAdvertisement
4AmazonThis oh-so-soft, lightweight flannel heated blanketFor those who want a blanket that's warm without being too heavy, opt for this Tefici blanket that's made of double-layered flannel. It comes in a throw, twin or queen size in six colors. It has three heat settings from 95 to 113 degrees, and automatically shuts off after four hours to avoid overheating.Promising review: "Best purchase for myself and my family. I am one of those people that are always cold at night no matter what. I decided to try a heated throw to see if that would help. I wish I had got one of these a long time ago lol. I love how it has the 3 settings of heat and it has a really long cord to reach different places. I love how it will turn off after a few hours. My family tries to steal it from me when I got to get up because they have fallen in love with how warm you are with the throw. I never get too warm with this product it has a perfect amount of warmth coming out of it." — S@r@h_C$33 at AmazonAdvertisement
5AmazonA Homemate blanket with intelligent temperature technologyHomemate, the makers of this heated mattress pad we previously covered, also offer a heated blanket. It uses intelligent temperature adjustment technology to save energy and keep you at a comfortable temperature while you're using it. The blanket has 10 heat levels between 86 and 122 degrees, and you can set the auto shut-off feature at one of five time settings. This one also features a 12.5-foot power cord so you're not stuck sitting right by an outlet. It's available in five sizes and eight colors.Promising review: "I bought this during Prime Day specials and it’s by far my FAVORITE purchase. It’s so snuggly and warm. I recently had surgery and have been sleeping on the sofa with this as my blanket. It’s been PERFECT. So easy to adjust the temp (if needed) during the night so I’m not too hot/cold. Even my pup loves it and has become the best snuggle bug. If you’re wanting a cozy blanket for the winter months - THIS IS IT!!" — Rachel C.$35 at Amazon6AmazonA blanket that comes with an oversized throw optionIf the standard 50-by-60-inch throw blanket size feels small for you but you don't want to commit to getting a full twin-size blanket, this Beautyrest blanket has an option for a 60-by-70-inch oversized throw, as well as four other sizes in 11 colors.HuffPost editorial director Kristen Aiken owns this blanket in the queen size, which has controls for each side and 20 heat settings, and keeps it on her bed. "Honestly I usually crank it all the way up to 20, and it's just enough for my ice-cold body," she says. "It's got a sleep timer that makes it automatically turn off after 10 hours, and I've been able to turn down the thermostat in my bedroom since I've had this, which I'm guessing is saving money!"Promising review: "Everything about this blanket was pleasing from the color to the fabric to the temperature settings and control--but most of all, for keeping my perpetually cold husband warm and content. He now sleeps much,much better since discarding the old (not so old) electric blanket he had and rewarding him with this one instead. Best one we have ever had!!!" — Sharon Esterkyn$67 at AmazonAdvertisement
7AmazonThis cozy velvet and sherpa blanket that's reversibleSo many heated blankets have the white sherpa underneath, no matter what color you choose. If that's not your style and you want the color to be uniform on both sides, this Bearhug blanket (doesn't that name sound so cozy?) has options for reversible blankets that are the same color on both sides, with one side being velvet and the other sherpa. It comes in seven colors and five sizes, has six heat settings between 90 and 108 degrees, and has a four-hour auto-off feature.$110 at Amazon8AmazonA heated blanket with fun pattern optionsOne downside of the heated blanket market is that so many of the options are plain solid colors. And there's nothing wrong with that, but for folks who prefer a more whimsical take, a blanket like this one by Soganasa can be a welcome change: It comes in three fun prints, in addition to three other standard solids. The blanket itself is otherwise a classic throw, with four heat levels between 84 and 112 degrees, and a three-hour auto-off feature.$31 at Amazon9AmazonA shaggy faux fur heated throw blanketOffering a touch of luxurious elegance is this Serta heated throw with a shaggier design that mimics fur. It comes in four colors and offers five heat levels, plus an auto shut-off feature after three hours.Promising review: "I love this electric blanket. I got it in the light color. It is luxurious and works well. I like that you have to click the dial. In the past with a different electric blanket, the dial moved on it's own and would shut off, etc. I also purchased this for my son and his wife. They both like it, but my son really raved about it. The color goes with everything." — ChristineArtist$63 at AmazonAdvertisement
10Amazon, AmazonA cozy heated blanket with a foot pocketOnce you have a throw blanket that comes with a foot pocket, it's pretty hard to go back — there are few things that feel as cozy. This Wapaneus heated blanket is made with skin-friendly flannel and has 10 heat settings between 95 and 113 degrees. The auto shut-off feature turns it off after up to four hours. It comes in eight colors and three sizes, though only the throw comes with the foot pocket.$38 at Amazon11AmazonA heated blanket you can wearIf you really want to snuggle up in a blanket, why not get one you can literally wear? This wearable heated blanket is a fun option to get extra cozy (and also makes for a great gift).
