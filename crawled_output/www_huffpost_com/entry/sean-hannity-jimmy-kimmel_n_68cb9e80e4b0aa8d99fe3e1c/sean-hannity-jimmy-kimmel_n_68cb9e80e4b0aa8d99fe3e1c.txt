People on “the left” like California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) are “predictably claiming, ‘This is a conservative censorship. The MAGA crowd, Donald Trump, got Jimmy Kimmel,’” said Hannity.“That is false,” he continued. “I can’t find a single prominent conservative voice in the country that even remotely wanted or hoped or was pushing to get Jimmy Kimmel taken off the air.”He added, “It was simple. People changed the channel. They didn’t watch him. Not one person can I think of, maybe there’s one, but I can’t think of him.”Advertisement
Watch here:Critics on social media, though, were quick to point out how Trump — the leader of the MAGA movement — was most definitely one such person.The president has for years attacked Kimmel and even only last month predicted that he and NBC’s “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon would be “next” to go after CBS’ cancellation of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”Advertisement
