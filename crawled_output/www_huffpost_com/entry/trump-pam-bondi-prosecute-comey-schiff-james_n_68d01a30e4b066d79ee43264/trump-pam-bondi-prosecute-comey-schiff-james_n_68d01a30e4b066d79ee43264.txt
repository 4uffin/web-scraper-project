“They’re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,” he wrote, specifically pointing to former FBI Director James Comey, Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff (Calif.) and New York State Attorney General Letitia James.The president appeared to confirm reports he forced Erik Siebert, the former U.S. attorney from the Eastern District of Virginia, out of his position after determining there wasn’t enough evidence to pursue mortgage fraud charges against James or build a case against Comey.Donald Trump, here on Sept. 21, is pushing hard for Attorney General Pam Bondi to go after his political enemies.Tasos Katopodis via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
“There is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so,” Trump wrote before going on to endorse his former personal attorney, Lindsey Halligan, as Siebert’s replacement.Trump doubled down on his demands to Bondi while crossing paths with reporters later that evening.Asked if he was criticizing his attorney general in his social media post, Trump said, “No, I just want people to act. They have to act and we want to act fast.”Pam Bondi pictured here at a Sept. 11 remembrance in Arlington, Virginia.Win McNamee via Getty ImagesAdvertisement
As Trump talked, he seemed to reveal how any cases against his “ruthless and vicious” enemies would be more about getting retribution than any actual evidence of crimes.“We have to act fast one way or the other, one way or the other. They’re guilty, They’re not guilty,” he said, adding, “If they’re not guilty, that’s fine. If they are guilty or if they should be charged, they should be charged. And we have to do it now.”Stand With UsAgainstCensorshipYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionThe Trump administration is cracking down on free speech and targeting the media.

Schiff led Trump’s first impeachment trial while James oversaw a sprawling civil fraud investigation into the president’s business organization. That case resulted in a half-a-billion-dollar judgment against Trump and his sons, but the massive monetary penalty was pared down by an appeals court earlier this year.RelatedDonald TrumpJames Comeyadam schiffLetitia Jamespam bondiWSJ’s New Editorial Slams Pam BondiThe 2026 Election Hinges On 1 Case That Could Get In Trump’s WayTrump And MAGA Movement Will Honor Charlie Kirk At Arizona MemorialMAGA, Elon Musk Torch Trump Over Pam Bondi Defense And Epstein Files Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
