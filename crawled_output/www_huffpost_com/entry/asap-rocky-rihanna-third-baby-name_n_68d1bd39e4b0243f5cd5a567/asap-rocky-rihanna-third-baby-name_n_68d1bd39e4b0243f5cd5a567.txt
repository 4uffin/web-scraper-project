In a new interview with GQ, the rapper teasingly told the outlet that he’s planning to name their baby after his “Highest 2 Lowest” co-star Denzel Washington. Advertisement
“Denzel, no matter what,” he quipped after the interviewer asked him whether he would name their baby after the Oscar winner. “The first female come out named Denzel, it’s lit. We got it figured out.”Rihanna first debuted baby No. 3 at the Met Gala in New York City in May. Rocky and the “We Found Love” singer, who have been romantically linked since 2020, welcomed sons RZA and Riot in 2022 and 2023, respectively.

The couple have not announced their little one’s due date as of yet. Rocky appeared to reveal the sex of his and Rihanna’s third baby at the “Smurfs” world premiere in Brussels in June. Rihanna starred as Smurfette in the live-action animated film. After Entertainment Tonight asked Rocky if their kiddo is “the girl you’ve been waiting for,” he responded, “It is, man, it is.”Rocky then cheekily held up a Smurfette doll before hedging his answer, adding, “Right here, you know what I’m saying? Right here.” Advertisement

Rocky added: “So, I got nothing but love to give to these little ones. And as you can see, that’s what occupies a lot of my heart capacity, is my family.”RelatedRihannaasap rockyA$AP Rocky May Have Just Confirmed The Sex Of His Third Baby With Rihanna'You're F**ked': Rihanna Gets Feisty With Trump Fans Commenting On Her Election PostRihanna's Stomach-Baring Ensemble Before The Met Gala Has The Rumor Mill In OverdriveA$AP Rocky Shares Heartwarming Family Tradition He'll Carry On With Third Child Go to HomepageLEAVE A COMMENTSuggest a correction|Submit a tipAdvertisement
