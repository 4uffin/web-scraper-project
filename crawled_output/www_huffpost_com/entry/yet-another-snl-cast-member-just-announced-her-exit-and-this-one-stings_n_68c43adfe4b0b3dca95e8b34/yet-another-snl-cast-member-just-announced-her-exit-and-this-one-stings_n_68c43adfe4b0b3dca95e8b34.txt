In an Instagram story posted Friday morning, Ego Nwodim, who has been a heavily used player on “SNL” for the past seven years, announced she was leaving the long-running sketch show.

“The hardest part of a great party is knowing when to say goodnight,” Nwodim wrote. “But after seven unforgettable seasons, I have decided to leave SNL. I am immensely grateful to Lorne for the opportunity, to my castmates, the writers, and the crew for their brilliance, support, and friendship.” She continued, “Week after week on that stage taught me more than I could have ever imagined, and I will carry those memories (and that laughter) with me always.” “Now invite me to your weddings please!!!” she concluded.A screenshot of Nwodim’s statement via Instagram story.Screenshot @eggyboom via Instagram StoryAdvertisement
Nwodim’s announcement follows the departure of four other cast members who will not be returning for Season 51.These cast members include Heidi Gardner, Michael Longfellow, Emil Wakim and Devon Walker. Although Longfellow, Wakim and Walker were relatively new additions to the show, and did not receive a ton of screen time, Gardner and Nwodim have been fixtures on the variety show for nearly a decade.And although Nwodim implied that she left on her own terms, Gardner has not publicly commented on her departure — leading to rumors that she may have gotten the ax.

Nwodim has portrayed several beloved characters on “SNL” — including the hilariously weird “Lisa from Temecula,” whose love for overcooked steaks caused host Pedro Pascal to break character in a fit of giggles in 2023. Last season, Nwodim’s “Weekend Update” character “Ms. Eggy,” a cheesy 50-year-old stand-up persona, went viral after she accidentally prompted audience members to curse on live TV during a joke. 20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
