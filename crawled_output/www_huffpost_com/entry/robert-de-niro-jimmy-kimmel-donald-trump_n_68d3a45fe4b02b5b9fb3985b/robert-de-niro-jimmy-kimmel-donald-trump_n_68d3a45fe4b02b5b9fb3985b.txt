In the skit, De Niro was first seen sending a menacing message about “The View” host and Trump critic Whoopi Goldberg, prompting Kimmel to suggest that Trump’s FCC was using “mob tactics to suppress free speech.”“What the fuck did you just say to me?” De Niro shot back.“I didn’t mean any offense. You know you can’t curse, or we’ll get fined by the FCC,” Kimmel replied.“I am the fucking FCC. I can fucking say whatever the fuck I want,” De Niro declared, before later mock-telling Kimmel that he was “gently suggesting that you gently shut the fuck up.”Advertisement
