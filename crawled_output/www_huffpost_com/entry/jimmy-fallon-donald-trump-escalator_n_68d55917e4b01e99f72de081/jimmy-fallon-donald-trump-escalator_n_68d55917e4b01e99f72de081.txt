(Watch the video below.)Trump and first lady Melania Trump were on the escalator Tuesday for a meeting of the General Assembly when it suddenly stopped, forcing them to walk up.Advertisement
“Everybody’s still talking about President Trump’s trip to the United Nations,” the “Tonight Show” host began on Wednesday. “And the White House now claims that someone at the U.N. sabotaged the escalator to stop working when Trump got on it. ”“Yep, this is the big issue people want answers to. All day long, Americans were shouting, ‘Release the escalator files, release the escalator files!’” Fallon cracked.“The White House is now looking into who would have a grudge against Trump,” the comedian continued. “And so far they’ve narrowed it down to 189 countries. The whole thing was a headache for Trump, and even worse: He couldn’t take any Tylenol.”Advertisement
The White House claimed it was sabotage, and the president followed suit, even though the U.N. said a videographer with the U.S. delegation might have triggered a safety mechanism, halting the escalator.Trump said something “sinister” was afoot and demanded an investigation because the teleprompter (which was reportedly operated by the White House) and sound system also had glitches.20 Years OfFreeJournalismYour SupportFuelsOur MissionYour SupportFuelsOur MissionFor two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.
