We consider the needs, passions and curiosity of our readers in all of our journalism.

We aim to write for, and not just about, those left out of traditional power structures; to approach stories inclusively; and to serve a diverse audience with stories that matter to them.

HuffPost strives to verify and corroborate information via multiple sources whenever possible. HuffPost grants anonymity to sources so they can provide information in the public interest without putting themselves at risk; HuffPost does not grant anonymity to sources so they can avoid accountability for their opinions.HuffPost works to correct any misstatements in a timely manner, with a correction note appended to the bottom of an article to indicate what has been fixed and how. More prominent notices may be included for more egregious errors. HuffPost will only retract an article after extensive review by a senior editor has found fundamental flaws in the reporting, and always with an editor's note.HuffPost includes labeling to indicate when an article is advertising content (including sponsored content), and we disclose relationships with outside partners who may underwrite any area of coverage.HuffPost is owned by digital content company BuzzFeed, Inc.MASTHEAD EDITORIALEditor-in-Chief: Whitney SnyderExecutive Editor: Kate PalmerNews Director: Paige LavenderManaging Editor: Robyn MalcolmHead of Operations: Marta RodríguezEditorial Operations Coordinator: Alexandra Niforos BREAKING NEWSManaging Editor, Breaking News: Mollie ReillySenior News Editor: Claudia KoernerAssignment Editor: Andy Campbell, Marita VlachouSenior Reporters: Sara Boboltz, Graeme Demianyk, Nina Golgowski, Ryan Grenoble, Sanjana Karanth, Sebastian Murdock, Lydia O’Connor, Li ZhouAssociate Reporters: Taiyler Mitchell, Paige Skinner TRENDSDirector, Trends: Buck WolfDeputy Editor, Trends: Hilary Hanson, Ed MazzaEurope Correspondent: Lee MoranSenior Reporters: Ron Dicker, Carly Ledbetter, David Moye, Kelby Vera, Elyse Wanshel, Curtis WongReporters: Ben Blanchet, Marco Margaritoff, Jaz Tolliver, Corey TownsendAssociate Reporter: Pocharapon Neammanee POLITICS Senior Editor: Kevin RobillardSenior Reporters: Akbar Ahmed, Jennifer Bendery, Paul Blumenthal, Igor Bobic, S.V.
