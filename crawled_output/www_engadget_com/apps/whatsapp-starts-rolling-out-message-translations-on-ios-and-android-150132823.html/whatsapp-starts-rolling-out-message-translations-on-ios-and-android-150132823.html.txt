Starting today, Android users will be able to translate messages between six languages: English, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian and Arabic. On iPhone, there's support for translation between the following languages (i.e. all of the ones supported by Apple's Translate app):ArabicDutchEnglishFrenchGermanHindiIndonesianItalianJapaneseKoreanMandarin ChinesePolishPortuguese (Brazil)RussianSpanishThaiTurkishUkrainianVietnameseTo convert a message into a different language, long press on it, select Translate, then the language you'd like to translate the message to or from. Android users will get an extra-handy bonus feature with the ability to switch on automatic translation for an entire chat.Translations are handled on your device to help protect your privacy — WhatsApp still won't be able to see your encrypted chats. Your device will download relevant language packs for future translations. WhatsApp says translation works in one-on-one chats, groups and Channel updates. The platform will also add support for more languages down the line.There's no word as yet on if or when WhatsApp will support message translations on the web or in its Windows app. "Translating messages on WhatsApp is only available on certain devices and may not be available to you yet," a note on a support page reads. "In the meantime, we recommend keeping WhatsApp updated on your device so you can get the feature as soon as it's available."AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
