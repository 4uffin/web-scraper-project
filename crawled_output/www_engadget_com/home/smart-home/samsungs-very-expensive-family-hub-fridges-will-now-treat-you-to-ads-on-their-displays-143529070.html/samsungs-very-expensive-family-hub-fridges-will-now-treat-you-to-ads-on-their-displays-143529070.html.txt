But that is no longer the case — following a recent update, you’ll start seeing ads on the fridge’s display.According to Android Authority, the new software update is being rolled out to Samsung’s Family Hub refrigerators in the US, and will now display ads and promotions while the display is idle. In a statement to the outlet, Samsung confirmed that it’s conducting a pilot program as part of its commitment to (brace yourselves for this one) "enhancing every day value for our home appliance customers."The Cover Screen on which ads show up appears when a refrigerator is not displaying something else, such as Samsung’s Art Mode or a photo album. Samsung told Android Authority that advertising won’t appear when one of these modes is active, adding that specific ads can also be dismissed and won’t appear again while the campaign is running.AdvertisementAdvertisementWhat the statement doesn’t make clear is whether advertising can be turned off altogether, which again, seems like a reasonable option given that you can expect to pay anything between $1,800 and $3,500 for a Family Hub-equipped fridge. But it doesn’t appear to be possible while the pilot period is live. It also isn’t clear if any specific models are omitted from the testing.Back in April, Samsung’s head of R&D for digital appliances, Jeong Seung Moon, told The Verge that at that time the company had no plans to bring ads to its smart home displays, but in the case of its refrigerators it appears to have changed its mind pretty quickly.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
