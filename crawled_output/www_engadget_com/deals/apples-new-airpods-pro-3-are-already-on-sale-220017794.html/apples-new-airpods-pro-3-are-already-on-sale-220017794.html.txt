ANC is twice as effective as that of the AirPods Pro 2, thanks to a combination of ultra-low noise microphones, computational audio and new foam-infused ear tips, which make for both a better fit and improved noise isolation, according to Engadget's Billy Steele, who spent some hands-on time with the earbuds. The Live Translation feature fared well when tested on Spanish-to-English and French-to-English translations, making the earbuds a potentially handy tool to have for travel. (You'll need an iPhone with Apple Intelligence in order to use Live Translation, though).AdvertisementAdvertisementThe earbuds earned a score of 90 in Engadget's review, which notes noticeable improvements in sound quality and battery life. Apple says you'll get up to eight hours on a charge with ANC enabled. With the addition of heart-rate monitoring and support for 50 workouts using Apple's Fitness app, the AirPods Pro 3 allow you to get heart rate metrics during exercise without wearing an Apple Watch.There's a lot to like about the latest version of the AirPods Pro, so discount or not, you can't go wrong if you've been holding out for a meaningful upgrade.
