The best iPad deals available today include $150 off the iPad Air M3The iPad mini and entry-level iPad are also on sale, as are the MacBook Air and Mac mini.Valentina Palladino, Amy Skorheim, Jeff DunnUpdated Fri, September 19, 2025 at 2:06 PM UTCAdd Engadget on GoogleJeff Dunn for EngadgetIt’s been a big week in Apple world: The new iPhone 17, iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pros went up for sale globally on Friday, while the latest major updates for iOS, macOS and Apple’s other operating systems were released to the public on Monday. If you’re looking to buy a new iPad, meanwhile, there isn’t much new on the hardware front — but there are a few good deals on the devices already on the market, including a $150 discount on the iPad Air. We’ve rounded up all of the best iPad deals we could find this week below, alongside some noteworthy discounts on other Apple devices that are available right now.Best iPad dealsAppleApple iPad Air (11-inch, M3)$449$599Save $150The latest iPad Air is a relatively minor update; the only major addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend the Air over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is more color-rich and better at fending off glare, its speakers are more robust, it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. (Though both have most of the same benefits released with iPadOS 26.) This $150 discount matches an all-time low and applies to several color and storage configurations. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target. $449 at AmazonApple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nate Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart; otherwise, the two slates are the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for taking in movies and multitasking for work. This is another all-time low, and it applies to several color options and storage configs.Apple iPad (A16) for $299 ($50 off): The most recent entry-level iPad comes with a faster A16 chip, 2GB more RAM and 128GB of storage by default. It earned a score of 84 in our review — if you only need a tablet for roaming the internet, watching shows and doing some lighter productivity tasks, it should do the job. With the new iPadOS 26 update, it also has most of the same multitasking features available with the more expensive models. We've seen this price for most of the past several months, but it's still a bit cheaper than buying direct from Apple. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target.AdvertisementAdvertisementApple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. This latest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — along with 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. As before, you’d buy it if you value the smaller 8.3-inch display and want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. This deal is only $20 more than the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target and Best Buy.Apple iPad Pro (11-inch, M4) for $899 ($100 off): The iPad Pro is much more tablet than most people need, but it’s the ultimate iPad for those who can stomach its price tag. It’s wonderfully thin, its OLED display is one of the best we’ve seen on a consumer device and its M4 chip can handle virtually anything you’d ever do on an iPad. It’s also the only Apple tablet with Face ID and it has a better speaker setup than the iPad Air. We gave it a score of 84 in our review, with the only real drawback being its price. Also at Best Buy, Target and B&H.The 13-inch model is on sale for $1,099 as well, a $200 discount, but be warned: Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that Apple could release updated iPad Pros as soon as October. So if you can hold out, you probably should.Best Apple dealsApple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This discount ties an all-time low for base config with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. Models with more memory or storage are also $200 off. Also at Best Buy.AdvertisementAdvertisementApple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but has better speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. Outside of one very brief drop around $980 in June, this ties a record low for the base model. Other configs are similarly discounted if you need more power. Also at B&H and Best Buy.Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports (finally!), an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It doesn't have any USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90. This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD — we’ve seen it fall as low as $469 in the past, but this is still a decent savings. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and B&H.Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $75 ($24 off): We may see an updated model by the end of 2025, but the current AirTags are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone users thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultrawide band features that make it easy to locate things that are close by. Just note that you'll need a separate AirTag holder to attach them to your keys, wallet or bag. This isn't a great deal for a four-pack — the bundle was as low as $65 in July — but it's still a bit lower than its list price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The highest-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the year, but it's a solid discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and Target.AdvertisementAdvertisementApple 35W Dual USB-C Port adapter for $39 ($20 off): It's always good to have a few extra ports around. This is the adapter that ships with the M4 with 10‑core GPU MacBook Air, and it can quickly charge iPads, iPhones and anything else powered by USB-C, too. Walmart is also selling Apple's 2-meter fast charge cable for $23 (a $6 discount).Read more Apple coverage:The best AirPodsThe best Apple WatchesThe best MacBooksThe best iPhonesThe best iPadsFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
