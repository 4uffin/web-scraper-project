Whether you're looking for a new tablet for yourself or someone else, the next few months should present plenty of worthy discounts to consider. Case in point: this iPad Air M3 deal, which knocks $150 off the 11-inch Wi-Fi model, bringing it down to a record low of $450.We gave the iPad Air M3 an 89 in our review, thanks, in part, to its new chip. The M3 chip gives this generation's iPad Air a big boost over the M2 model — despite coming out less than a year apart. Plus, even without the discount, it's a more affordable option across Apple's iPad range.AppleApple iPad Air 11-inch (M3)$449$599Save $150Get it now for 25 percent off.  $449 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$450 at Target$599 at AdoramaIn fact, we named the iPad Air M3 as our choice for the best iPad for most people.
