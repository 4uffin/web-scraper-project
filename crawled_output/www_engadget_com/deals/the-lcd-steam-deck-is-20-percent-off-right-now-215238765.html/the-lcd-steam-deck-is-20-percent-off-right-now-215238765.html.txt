The Steam Deck starter model is currently on sale for 20 percent off its usual $399 price tag. That means you can snag yourself the gaming handheld with an LCD screen and 256GB of storage for $319. Steam hasn't set an end date for this offer, so it might be worth acting quickly if you want to get in on this particular sale.ValveLCD Steam Deck$31920 percent off the starter model of the gaming handheld. $319 at ValveThe Steam Deck is still the go-to for most PC gamers who want a handheld. Its balance of power, portability and price have kept it one of our top recommendations, even three years after the product's debut. But keep in mind before you add this to your cart that this iteration does have a few limitations compared to the higher end Steam Decks. The LCD screen doesn't have the true blacks of the OLED option, and serious players may run up against the storage limits of this model pretty quickly. But if you've been curious about a Steam Deck and aren't looking to have a full library of big AAA downloads available all at once, this is a good time to pick up one of your own. Besides, with the $80 you'll save, you can also grab a copy of current indie darlings Hollow Knight: Silksong and Hades II and still have money leftover.Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
