A world of perfectly- cooked fries awaits you. But which model to get? Well, you can save some cash right now if you pick Ninja’s Foodi DZ090C 5-in-1 air fryer, which is down to $120 from its regular price of $180 when purchased directly from the brand. That’s a sizable saving of $60.A smaller version of the air fryer we featured as the best dual-zone option in our 2025 air fryer buyers guide, the two-basket DZ090C lets you cook up two totally different foods in separate baskets simultaneously.
