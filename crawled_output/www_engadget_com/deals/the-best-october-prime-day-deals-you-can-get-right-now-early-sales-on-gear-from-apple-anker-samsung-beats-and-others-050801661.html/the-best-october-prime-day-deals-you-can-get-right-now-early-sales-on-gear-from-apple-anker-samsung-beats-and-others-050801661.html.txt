Prime Day will return on October 7 and 8, but really, you don't have to wait until the official start date to save. Amazon typically always has early Prime Day deals in the lead-up to the event, and this year we’re already seeing some solid discounts on gadgets we like. Here, we’ve gathered all of the best Prime Day deals you can get right now, and we’ll keep updating this post as we get close to Prime Day proper.Best Prime Day deals: Engadget's top picksAppleApple iPad (A16)$299$349Save $50Apple iPad (A16) for $299 ($50 off): The new base-model iPad now comes with twice the storage of the previous model and the A16 chip. That makes the most affordable iPad faster and more capable, but still isn't enough to support Apple Intelligence. $299 at AmazonApple Mac mini (M4) for $499 $100 off): If you prefer desktops, the upgraded M4 Mac mini is one that won’t take up too much space, but will provide a ton of power at the same time. Not only does it come with an M4 chipset, but it also includes 16GB of RAM in the base model, plus front-facing USB-C and headphone ports for easier access.Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off): The only major difference between the latest iPad Air and the previous generation is the addition of the faster M3 chip. We awarded the new slab an 89 in our review, appreciating the fact that the M3 chip was about 16 percent faster in benchmark tests than the M2. This is the iPad to get if you want a reasonable amount of productivity out of an iPad that's more affordable than the Pro models.AdvertisementAdvertisementApple MagSafe charger (25W, 2m) for $35 (29 percent off): The latest version of Apple's MagSafe puck is Qi2.2-certified and supports up to 25W of wireless power when paired with a 30W adapter. The two-meter cable length on this particular model gives you more flexibility on where you can use it: in bed, on the couch, at your desk and elsewhere.Anker 622 5K magnetic power bank with stand for $28 (42 percent off): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up.8BitDo Pro 2 controller with travel case for $40 (34 percent off, Prime exclusive): We generally love 8BitDo controllers, and the Pro 2 has been one of our favorites for a long time. This model works with Switch 2, Steam Deck, Android and more, plus it has Hall Effect joysticks and a slew of customization options.Anker Nano 5K ultra-slim power bank (Qi2, 15W) for $46 (16 percent off): A top pick in our guide to the best MagSafe power banks, this super-slim battery is great for anyone who wants the convenient of extra power without the bulk. We found its proportions work very well with iPhones, and its smooth, matte texture and solid build quality make it feel premium.Best Prime Day deals on techSAMSUNGSamsung EVO Select microSD Memory Card + Adapter (256GB)$20$27Save $7Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $20 (26 percent off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. $20 at AmazonAnker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 (34 percent off): This small Bluetooth speaker gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust.AdvertisementAdvertisementAnker Soundcore Space A40 for $45 (44 percent off): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity.Anker MagGo 10K power bank (Qi2, 15W) for $60 (25 percent off): A 10K power bank like this is ideal if you want to be able to recharge your phone at least once fully and have extra power to spare. This one is also Qi2 compatible, providing up to 15W of power to supported phones.Levoit Core 200S smart air purifier for $75 ($15 off with clippable coupon): This compact air purifier cleans the air in rooms up to 140 square feet and uses a 3-in-1 filter that removes microscopic dust, pollen and airborne particles. It has a mobile app that you can use to set runtime schedules, and it works with Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.Amazon Fire TV Cube for $100 (29 percent off): Amazon's most powerful streaming device, the Fire TV Cube supports 4K, HDR and Dolby Vision content, Dolby Atmos sound, Wi-Fi 6E and it has a built-in Ethernet port. It has the most internal storage of any Fire TV streaming device, plus it comes with an enhanced Alexa Voice Remote.AdvertisementAdvertisementRode Wireless Go III for $199 (30 percent off): A top pick in our guide to the best wireless microphones, the Wireless Go III records pro-grade sound and has handy extras like onboard storage, 32-bit float and universal compatibility with iPhones, Android, cameras and PCs.Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 for $200 (20 percent off): These Beats earbuds have a hook design that will be good for anyone who wants the most secure fit while doing strenuous workouts. They also have a built-in heart rate monitor and up to 45 hours of battery life with their included charging case.Nintendo Switch 2 for $449: While not technically a discount, it's worth mentioning that the Switch 2 and the Mario Kart Switch 2 bundle are both available at Amazon now, no invitation required. Amazon only listed the new console for the first time in July after being left out of the initial pre-order/availability window in April. Once it became available, Amazon customers looking to buy the Switch 2 had to sign up to receive an invitation to do so. Now, that extra step has been removed and anyone can purchase the Switch 2 on Amazon.Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
