A mainstay of Prime Day sales, a pair of Blink Mini 2 cameras is on sale for only $35. That's 50 percent off, a record low and less than what you'd usually pay for one. It's also Engadget's pick for the best budget security camera.This is the newest (2024) model of Blink's budget wired model. The camera is well-suited for nighttime video: It has a built-in LED spotlight, color night vision and a low-light sensor. Day or night, it records in sharp 1080p resolution. It also has a wider field of view than its predecessor.BlinkBlink Mini 2 (newest model) — 2 cameras$35$70Save $35Get two for less than the price of one. $35 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$35 at Best Buy$70 at Lowe'sThe Blink Mini 2 is primarily designed for indoor use.
