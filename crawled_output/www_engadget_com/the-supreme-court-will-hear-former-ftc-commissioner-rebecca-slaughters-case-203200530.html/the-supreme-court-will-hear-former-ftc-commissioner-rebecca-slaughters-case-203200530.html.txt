Democrats Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya were fired from their posts as commissioners in the FTC by President Donald Trump in March. As has been the case with several of the Trump administration's actions to remove possible critics from their roles in civil service, the pair said their dismissal was illegal. Commissioners’ terms may only be ended early for good cause under a law designed to protect the FTC as an independent agency. The FTC is also not allowed to have more than three commissioners from a single political party, meaning Slaughter and Bedoya could not both be replaced by additional Republican members.In July, US District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled in favor of Slaughter, who has moved ahead with a suit to contest her dismissal, and a federal appeals court reinstated her to the FTC in September. Today, however, the Supreme Court ruled that her firing may stand while it considers her case.
