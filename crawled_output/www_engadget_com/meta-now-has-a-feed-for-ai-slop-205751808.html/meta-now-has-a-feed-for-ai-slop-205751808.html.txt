The Vibes feed is a home for AI-generated short-form videos in the Meta AI app and website. Users can scroll the creations of other people, or can make their own clips, either by building from scratch or adapting other videos from the feed. The videos people make can also be shared via DM or cross-posted to Instagram or Facebook.The company said it plans to add more features for AI-generated creation in the future. According to a Threads post by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Vibes is "an early look at some of the new product directions we're exploring." He added that Meta Superintelligence Labs will work with Midjourney and Black Forest Labs on upcoming AI projects.
