The best Apple Watch in 2025There are only three models, but each of Apple’s smartwatches makes its own case for becoming your next wearable.Amy SkorheimSenior Reporter, Buying AdviceAmy SkorheimSenior Reporter, Buying AdviceUpdated Wed, September 17, 2025 at 4:00 PM UTCAdd Engadget on GoogleCherlynn Low for EngadgetApple released an entirely new lineup of Apple Watches during its “Awe dropping” launch event in mid September. There’s now a new flagship, Apple Watch Series 11, a revamped entry-level model, Apple Watch SE 3, and the next generation of the premium wearable, Apple Watch Ultra 3. We didn’t get a new version of either the SE or the Ultra last year, and Apple made up for the wait by giving those two significant updates. The Series 11 is still what we recommend for most people, but the other two are more compelling than ever. Here, we break down the differences between the models so you can pick the best Apple Watch for your wrist computer needs.Quick OverviewBest Apple Watch overallApple Watch Series 11 (GPS, 42mm)More options$399 at AmazonBest budget Apple WatchApple Watch SE 3 (GPS, 40mm)More options$249 at AmazonBest Apple Watch for adventurersApple Watch Ultra 3 (GPS + Cellular, 49mm)More options$799 at AmazonTable of contentsBest Apple Watch in 2025What to look for in an Apple WatchHow we tested Apple WatchesApple Watch comparison chartApple Watch FAQsBest Apple Watch in 2025Cherlynn Low for Engadget90100Expert ScoreBest Apple Watch overallApple Watch Series 11 (GPS, 42mm)Chip: S10 SiP | Sensors: Electrical heart, optical heart, blood oxygen, temperature, compass, altimeter, accelerometer, gyroscope, light, depth gauge, water temp | Display: Always‑on Retina wide-angle OLED display, max 2,000 nits brightness | Battery life: 24 hours | Case size: 42mm or 46mm Read our full Apple Watch Series 11 review The specs for the Apple Watch Series 11 look pretty similar to the previous generation. The new watch uses the same S10 chip, has the same case and screen size, and employs the same sensors. Plus, new software features like sleep score and hypertension alerts will work with the Series 10 (and the Series 9, for that matter). But two hardware upgrades make the Series 11 model notably better than the last: a tougher screen and a battery that lasts longer. Oh, and the price didn’t go up. The battery now lasts for 24 hours instead of the previous 18. That’s still shy of the 30 hours promised for Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 8 and Google’s Pixel Watch 4, but it’s an improvement. In her review, Engadget’s Cherlynn Low said that she managed to get more than 24 hours on a charge — during a day that included a workout, camera remote use and sleep tracking. Apple added a ceramic coating to the Ion-X glass on the standard Series 11, making it twice as scratch resistant as the Series 10 (the titanium Series 11 has an even tougher sapphire front crystal). If you're the type to immediately apply screen protectors to your new gear, you may be able to skip that step. New features for watchOS 26 include hypertension alerts (available for the Series 9 or later and the Ultra 2 or later), which use the optical heart sensor and an algorithm to look for patterns of high blood pressure over the course of 30-day periods. There’s also a new sleep score, a Workout Buddy to motivate you through your runs and rides, as well as a new wrist flick gesture to dismiss notifications. A new design was introduced with the Series 10, and the Series 11 maintains that more comfortable, thinner profile and larger screen. The display is easy to read in bright light and at wide angles thanks to the 2,000 nit maximum brightness and the LTPO3 panel. And, as always, the flagship Apple Watch is an excellent companion for your iPhone, does a great job of tracking your workouts and now monitors your health stats even better than before. If you opt for the cellular-enabled model, you’ll now be able to access 5G networks for faster data connections without your phone.

But now we have the Apple Watch SE 3, which starts at $150 less than the Series 11, but you get many of the same features as the more expensive model including the same S10 chip, seven of the 11 sensors, an always-on display and on-device Siri processing. The SE 3 supports most of the new watchOS 26 features, including the new sleep score and wrist flick gesture, as well as the new Workout Buddy. It can handle Emergency SOS features, wrist temperature monitoring and fall and crash detection. One of our biggest gripes with the old model — painfully slow charging — has been replaced with fast charging capabilities that can reach 80 percent in about 45 minutes. And if you go for the cellular-enabled model, your watch can access 5G networks. Here’s what you don’t get: Hypertension alerts, a blood oxygen sensor, the ECG app and a bigger battery. The screen on the Apple Watch SE 3 is smaller, too, with the same display area as the SE 2 (and the Series 4 for that matter) and the brightness maxes out at 1,000 nits instead of 2,000. The case is a full millimeter thicker and there’s no ceramic coating on the glass. The SE 3 color and case material options are more limited, with just two finishes and aluminum-only cases. Still, if you’re looking for an entry-level smartwatch, and don’t mind a smaller screen, the Apple Watch SE is a great choice at an attractive price. ProsUses the same chip as the Series 11 and Ultra 3 modelsHandles most of the same fitness and health features as the Series 11A lot of watch for just $250Fast charging makes it more viable as a sleep trackerNow has an always-on displayConsNo hypertension alerts or blood oxygen monitoringScreen is small$249 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$250 at Target$249 at Best BuyCherlynn Low for EngadgetBest Apple Watch for adventurersApple Watch Ultra 3 (GPS + Cellular, 49mm)Chip: S10 SiP | Sensors: Electrical heart, optical heart, blood oxygen, temperature, compass, altimeter, accelerometer, gyroscope, light, depth gauge, water temp | Display: Always‑on Retina wide-angle OLED display, max 3,000 nits brightness | Battery life: 42 hours | Case size: 49mm Read our satellite assessment of the Apple Watch Ultra 3 The Apple Watch Ultra 3, like its predecessors, is geared towards the outdoor adventurer, with perks like a siren, depth gauge, night mode and now satellite SOS, Find My and messaging connectivity. The titanium case, sapphire crystal display and raised edges make it tougher than other models and it can handle water depths of up to 100 meters. It also has the largest case of all Apple Watch models at 49mm and the highest peak screen brightness at 3,000 nits. All of this adds up to a watch that can handle the rigors of open-air escapades — but it could also be a good pick for those who want a timepiece with a roomier screen and higher-than-standard durability. The new features this time around are the larger screen, which Apple accomplished with no increase to the size of the case by reducing the width of the bezels by 24 percent. The always-on display now has a quicker refresh rate, and 5G access comes standard. The listed battery life has gone up by six for a total of 42 hours, and the watch can now refill to 80 percent in 45 minutes instead of an hour. All the new watchOS features are here, including sleep score, hypertension alerts, Workout Buddy and wrist flick gesture support. As always, the main drawback for the Ultra model is the price. It still starts at $799, like the previous model, and a trade-in, if you have one, will bring the cost down. Otherwise it’s one pricey smartwatch — with plenty of deluxe features. ProsRugged but comfortable designLarger screen didn't increase case sizeSatellite connectivityComprehensive activity and health monitoringConsExpensive$799 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$800 at Verizon$799 at Best BuyWhat to look for in an Apple WatchLike all Apple products, Apple Watches will only work with other devices from the brand's ecosystem. You won't be able to pair any Apple Watch to your Android phone. Note that you can pair other wearables (like a Garmin tracker or a Fitbit band) with your iPhone. There are some more features that are specific to Apple Watches and that set each of the three models apart from one another.Chips and sensorsAll three models in the current lineup have the same S10 SiP (system in a package) chip with a four-core Neural Engine. The chip allows for on-device processing of Siri requests as well as dictation, translation, automatic workout detection and the double tap and wrist flick gestures that let you control your watch hands-free.AdvertisementAdvertisementYou get an optical heart rate sensor, temperature sensor, compass, altimeter, accelerometer, gyroscope and light sensor in every Apple Watch model, but the Series 11 and Ultra 3 have a more advanced heart monitor that in part enables the new hypertension detection feature. The two higher-end watches also have sensors that can generate an ECG and detect blood oxygen, water temperature and water depth.Fall and crash detection come standard no matter which Apple wearable you pick and all support near field communication (NFC) for Apple Pay. If you opt for the cellular versions of the Series 11 or SE 3, your watch will have access to 5G networks. Cell connectivity comes standard on the Ultra 3 and the watch now also has satellite-enabled SOS, messaging and Find My abilities.Cherlynn Low for EngadgetDisplays and case optionsEvery Apple Watch model now has an always-on display. The wide-angle OLED display on the Apple Watch 11 and Ultra 3 lets you see the always-on display from more angles. The SE can reach a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits, the Series 11 can get as bright as 2,000 and the Ultra 3 hits 3,000 nits. Both higher-end screens can dim to a single nit, making them less distracting in the dark. And the Ultra model has the added night mode feature on certain watch faces that turns the dial red to preserve your night vision.As for case sizes, the SE 3 is available in 40 or 44mm. The Series 11 has a choice of a 42 or 46mm case. The Ultra 3 comes in just one size measuring 49mm. The SE 3 has an aluminum case in two colors (Starlight or Midnight). The Series 11 lets you pick from aluminum (in Rose Gold, Silver, Space Gray or Jet Black) or titanium (in Natural, Gold or Slate). And the Ultra 3 only comes in titanium (either Natural or Black).Battery lifeThe Apple Watch Ultra 3 sports the biggest battery and can last for a claimed 42 hours on a charge. The Apple Watch 11 is rated to go for 24 hours and the SE 3 gets an estimated 18 hours before it needs a visit to the charger. Low power mode will get you many more hours, going for as long as 72 hours for the Ultra 3, 38 hours on the Series 11 and 32 hours on the SE 3. All three are now capable of fast charging and Apple states an 80 percent charge in 45 minutes for the SE 3 and Ultra 3 and 80 percent in 30 minutes for the Series 11.Cherlynn Low for EngadgetFitness and wellness featuresAll three Apple Watches have similar fitness tracking chops. The Activity app uses three “rings” to keep tabs on how much you’re moving in a day: The Move ring tracks your active calories; the Exercise ring monitors the minutes you’ve spent walking, running, doing yoga and so on; and the Stand ring tells you how many hours in a day you’ve stood up and moved around for at least one minute.AdvertisementAdvertisementDifferent internal sensors detect those activities, for example the accelerometer senses when you’re moving versus sitting still, and the optical heart rate sensor judges how hard you're working out and how many calories you’ve burned. You can set your goals for each ring and you’ll earn badges and animations when you hit them.The Workout Buddy will work with all three watches, but you’ll need to have an Apple Intelligence-enabled iPhone nearby as well as Bluetooth headphones to use it. All three can access offline maps, which could prove useful when hiking far from cellular coverage. But if going off-grid is something you plan to do often, you may appreciate the satellite connectivity of the Apple Watch Ultra 3.SiriYou can get the weather, start a workout, identify a song and dictate a text just by asking Siri. All Apple Watch models support the Raise to Speak feature that bypasses the need to say “Hey Siri” and will instead listen for your request when you lift your wrist near your mouth.Every Apple Watch model utilizes onboard processing of Siri requests now, too. That means executing simple requests like starting workouts and timers are quicker, as they won’t need to access external networks. However, requests like sending texts or getting weather forecasts still need to communicate with Wi-Fi or cellular, so you’ll need to have your phone nearby if you have a GPS-only model.Cherlynn Low for EngadgetCarbon neutral claimsApple declared the Series 9 with the aluminum case its first carbon neutral product. But has since dropped those claims, possibly due to legal challenges in a German court. Instead, Apple states that all three watches have been designed to “reduce environmental impact” and the company still maintains its commitment to becoming carbon neutral by 2030.PricePerhaps the most surprising thing about the three new wearables was the lack of price increase from previous models. The Apple Watch SE still starts at $249, the Series 11 goes for $399 and up, and the Ultra 3 begins at $799. That puts a $550 difference between entry prices for the cheapest and most expensive Apple Watches.AdvertisementAdvertisementFor $250 you can get the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3 with GPS-only connectivity; adding cellular connectivity ups the price by $50. The Apple Watch Series 11 starts at $399 for the 42mm, non-cellular model in aluminum and goes as high as $749 for the 46mm titanium case (which comes with cellular). The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is $799 for a titanium 49mm case with both GPS and cellular, but the price goes up with different bands. You may also need a few Apple Watch accessories, if so, you can factor that into your purchasing decision.Cherlynn Low for EngadgetAdvertisementAdvertisementHow we tested Apple WatchesEngadget has been reviewing Apple Watches since the first one came out in 2015. Since then, we’ve tested every subsequent model Apple has released, including the Ultra and SE models, spending at least a few days or even a couple weeks with one strapped to our wrists. During that time, we run, hit the gym, go on hikes and wear it while sleeping, all the while gauging how it tracks various metrics, integrates with the iPhone and performs every other trick Apple claims its smartwatches can do.Since we also review smartwatches from other companies, such as Samsung's Galaxy Watches and Google Pixels, our editors can compare Apple Watches not just to previous generations, but also to other wearables on the market. Our buying guides and recommendations rely on first-hand testing by Engadget staff.Apple Watch comparison chartProductApple Watch Series 11Apple Watch Ultra 3Apple Watch SE 3Release dateSeptember 2025September 2025September 2025Case sizes42mm or 46mm49mm40mm or 44mmCase materialAluminum or titaniumTitaniumAluminumDisplayLTPO3 OLED Always-OnLTPO3 OLED Always-OnLTPO OLED Always-onMax brightness2,000 nits3,000 nits1,000 nitsChipS10 SiPS10 SiPS10 SiPMax battery life24 h./38 h. low power42 h./72 h. low power18 h./32 h. low powerWater resistance50 m.100 m.50 m.Featured sensorsElectrical heart, optical heart (3rd gen), blood oxygen, temperature, compass, altimeter, accelerometer, gyroscope, light, depth gauge, water tempElectrical heart, optical heart (3rd gen), blood oxygen, temperature, compass, altimeter, accelerometer, gyroscope, light, depth gauge, water tempOptical heart (2nd gen), temperature, compass, altimeter, accelerometer, gyroscope, lightApple Watch FAQsWhat are the best Apple Watch apps for fitness tracking?All three watches use the same Fitness and Workout apps to track your progress, and they all have sensors to track speed, cadence, distance and heart rate. But the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11 have more sensors than the Apple Watch SE 3.Additional tech includes an electrical heart rate sensor and a depth gauge. The two pricier watches also have a blood oxygen app and an ECG app, all of which may give you a better picture of your overall health. All three models are compatible with the AI-powered Workout Buddy from watchOS 26 (the feature also requires an AI-compatible iPhone).Are any of the Apple Watch series waterproof?All three models are water resistant. But they can all handle immersion in water, including a swim. The Apple Watch SE 3 and Series 11 can handle a depth of up to 50 meters while the Ultra 3 can be submerged up to 100 meters.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
