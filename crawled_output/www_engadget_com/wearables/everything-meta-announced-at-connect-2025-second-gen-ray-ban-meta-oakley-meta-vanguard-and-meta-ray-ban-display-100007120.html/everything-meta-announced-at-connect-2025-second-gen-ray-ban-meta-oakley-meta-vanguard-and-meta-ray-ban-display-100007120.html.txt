Meta's boss also announced the second generation Ray-Ban Meta, as well as a pair of Oakley-branded sunglasses designed for athletes. In addition, Zuckerberg launched Horizon TV, a new entertainment hub for the Quest headsets, which will give you easy access to Disney+, Prime Video and other streaming services in virtual reality. Here's everything you might have missed.Ray-Ban Meta "Gen 2"MetaThe second-gen Ray-Ban Meta glasses come with improved battery life that the company says can now last up to eight hours with "typical use." Even their accompanying charging case provides an additional 48 hours of juice, compared to the previous version's 32 hours. The model is equipped with a 12-megapixel camera that can capture videos in 3K Ultra HD, with up to 60 frames per second and HDR support, as well as 32GB of storage. This fall, Meta will also roll out updates that will bring hyperlapse and slow-motion video capture to all its glasses, including this one. The Gen 2 Ray-Ban Meta glasses are now available with the same three base frames as their predecessor, namely Wayfarer, Skyler and Headliner, and will cost you at least $379.Read more: Meta unveils its second-gen Ray-Ban smart glasses at ConnectOakley Meta VanguardMetaUnlike the original Oakley Meta glasses, the Vanguard was clearly designed to cater to athletes. It features the wraparound frames Oakley is known for, with reflective swappable lens in different colors. Due to how it curves around the face, Meta placed its 12-megapixel camera in the center of the frames so that helmets and hats don't ruin your shots. The camera on this model has a wider 122-degree angle lens and adjustable video stabilization so that you can still take videos while moving. Meta told us that the device's battery was optimized for a wider range of temperatures, as well, allowing it to hold up better in harsh environments. In addition to the better battery life, the Vanguard also has louder onboard speakers and will come with integrations for Strava and Garmin. The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses are now available for preorder for $499 and will be officially available on October 21.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementRead more: Oakley Meta Vanguard are the smart glasses athletes might actually wantMeta Ray-Ban DisplayMetaThe Meta Ray-Ban Display is the company's first pair of AR glasses. Its lenses function as translucent heads-up displays (HUD) that can show you texts, AI prompts, turn-by-turn pedestrian navigation and video calls. The dedicated EMG wristband it's paired with will allow you to interact with the HUD's interface and will even give you the ability to type out responses. Video calling didn't work properly during its on-stage demo, but Zuckerberg was able to play a song on Spotify, demonstrate a real-time subtitle feature that could be a huge help for those with hearing impairments, as well as capture and view images. The Meta Ray-Ban Display will be available through a limited number of brick-and-mortar stores, including Best Buy, LensCrafters, Ray-Ban and Verizon, since you'll have to be fitted for the wristband. You'll be able to get it for $799 starting on September 30 in the US and starting early next year in Canada, France, Italy and the United Kingdom.Read more: Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses offer an AR display for $799Meta Horizon TVMetaAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementNear the end of the Meta Connect keynote, Zuckerberg announced a new entertainment hub for Quest headsets.
