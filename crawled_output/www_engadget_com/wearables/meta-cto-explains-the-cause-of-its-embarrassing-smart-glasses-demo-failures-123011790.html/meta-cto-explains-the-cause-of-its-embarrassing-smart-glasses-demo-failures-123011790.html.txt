Now, Meta's Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, said in an AMA on Instagram that they were demo failures and not actual product failures. The first glitch took place in the middle of a live demo with a cooking content creator, who asked Live AI for instructions on how to make a Korean-inspired steak sauce on his Meta glasses. Instead of giving him detailed instructions, his glasses' AI skipped ahead by several steps and continued glitching. The chef told Zuckerberg that the "WiFi might be messed up" in the venue.Bosworth said, however, that it was not the case. Apparently, when the chef said "Hey Meta, start Live AI," it fired up every single Meta Ray-Ban's Live AI in the building. And since the event was all about the company's smart glasses, there were a lot of them in the venue at the time. The company had also routed Live AI's traffic to its dev server to isolate it, but it ended up routing the Live AI traffic of everyone's glasses in the building to its server. "We DDoS'd ourselves, basically," he said. He continued that it didn't happen at rehearsal, because there weren't as many people wearing the glasses when they tested it out.Zuckerberg also ran into an issue when he tried demonstrating taking WhatsApp video calls on the Meta Ray-Ban Display. The audience could see him getting calls on the glasses' HUD, but he couldn't answer them to start the call. Bosworth said that it was caused by a "never-before-seen bug" that had put the display to sleep at the very instant that the notifications came in that someone was calling. Even after Zuckerberg woke up the display, there was no option to answer the call. The CTO said Meta had never come across that bug before the demo and that it has since been fixed. "You guys know we can do video calling... we got WhatsApp, we know how to do video calling," he said, but admitted that it was a missed opportunity to be able to show on stage that the feature actually works.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
