With this resource, users can direct an AI chatbot to execute basic email tasks such as scheduling meetings, organizing and prioritizing emails, and drafting replies. At launch, Gmail and Outlook are the only supported email clients. Email assistant is only available to members of the company's pricey Max plan, which costs $200 a month. Perplexity added this upscale subscription option in July. Once an Max user has signed up for the feature, they can write to Perplexity's assistant email address to access its capabilities. Although the company emphasized that the AI assistant does not train on a user's emails, it does adopt their writing style when drafting replies. The feature is available starting today.
