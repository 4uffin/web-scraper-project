You can scroll down to read our liveblog and see how the event played out in real-time.Who's excited for smart glasses? No, really, Mark Zuckerberg would like to know. The Meta CEO is kicking off Meta Connect 2025 with a poorly-timed keynote tonight, where we'll likely hear more a ton more about his plans for smart frames. In particular, rumors point to Meta debuting its first smart glasses with built-in displays, codenamed "Hypernova." That would be a huge leap ahead of the current Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses, which can play audio, take photos and video and tap into Meta's AI features, but have no display at all.As usual, we'll also likely hear more about Meta's AI plans, as well as more details about metaverse updates for Horizon Worlds. Meta doesn't seem to have any new VR headsets incoming this year (the $299 Quest 3S debuted last year), but we could hear more about third-party headsets from ASUS, Lenovo and others running Quest OS. The company initially announced plans to create a broader Quest headset ecosystem last April, but we haven't heard any progress updates since then. (The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition doesn't count.)AdvertisementAdvertisementJoin me and Engadget Senior Editor Karissa Bell live as we cover the Meta Connect 2025 keynote! We'll have commentary throughout the day, but the event officially kicks off at 5PM PT/8PM ET. You can also watch the livestream of the keynote at the Meta Connect 2025 site.Live coverage is over140 updatesWed, September 17, 2025 at 9:15 PM EDTMeta unveils its second-gen Ray-Ban smart glasses at ConnectAs expected, Meta introduced new smart glasses during its Connect conference today. The announcements included a “Gen 2” of the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, which retail starting at $379.There are a bunch of upgrades over the $299 Ray-Ban Meta set that the duo released in 2023. Meta highlighted improvements to battery life, which it says now lasts up to eight hours with "typical use." The included charging case now provides an additional 48 hours of juice, versus 32 hours for the current one. The glasses can also charge to 50 percent battery in 20 minutes.The second-gen glasses are equipped with a 12-megapixel camera and offer 3K Ultra HD video capture, with “up to 60 frames per second” and HDR support. Meta says it will release updates that add hyperlapse and slow-motion video capture to all of its AI glasses later in the fall. The second-gen Ray-Ban Meta has 32GB of storage and is IPX-4 rated for water resistance.Read more: Meta unveils its second-gen Ray-Ban smart glasses at ConnectWed, September 17, 2025 at 9:13 PM EDTMeta Ray-Ban Display glasses offer an AR display for $799The rumors were true: Meta's first pair of AR glasses with a built-in screen is the Meta Ray-Ban Display. They'll cost $799 and will come to a limited number of brick-and-mortar stores in the United States on September 30. Those retailers include Best Buy, LensCrafters, Ray-Ban and Verizon, and availability will expand to Canada, France, Italy and the United Kingdom in early 2026.The Ray-Ban Displays have a camera, audio functionality, and a translucent heads-up display that shows and allows the wearer to respond to text chats, AI prompts, directions and video calls. You're able to use gestures to interact with the HUD, including small actions like swiping your fingers to type out a chat reply. Each pair requires and comes with a dedicated EMG wristband, the Meta Neural Band, which enables these interactions.Read more: Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses offer an AR display for $799Wed, September 17, 2025 at 9:09 PM EDTOakley Meta Vanguard are the smart glasses athletes might actually wantFirst up, Karissa got some time with the Oakley Vanguard before the show and came away pretty impressed:The $499 sunglasses feature Oakley's familiar wraparound frames and shiny (swappable) lenses. They are the first of Meta's smart glasses to change the placement of the camera, which is now in the center of the frames above the nose. According to Meta, this should make it harder for a hat or a helmet to ruin your shots, which was a consistent issue for me with the HSTN glasses.Meta is making other camera adjustments that should make the glasses more reliable for capturing first-person action cam-style footage. The 12 megapixel camera now has a wider, 122-degree angle lens and adjustable video stabilization. There are also now dedicated modes for capturing slow motion videos as well as Instagram-ready hyperlapse slips.There are other spec upgrades too. Battery life has been improved to six hours of continuous music playback and nine hours of "mixed use". The charging case can provide another 36 hours of battery life. Meta also told me the glasses have been optimized for a wider range of temperatures, so the battery should hold up better in very cold or very hot environments.Read the full story: Oakley Meta Vanguard are the smart glasses athletes might actually wantWed, September 17, 2025 at 9:07 PM EDTNow the event's over, here are some of the highlights for you to dive a little deeper with.AdvertisementAdvertisementWed, September 17, 2025 at 9:01 PM EDTThat ending had serious National Aerobic Championship USA 1988 vibes:Wed, September 17, 2025 at 9:00 PM EDTKarissa BellAnd looks like that's a wrap on the Connect keynote!
