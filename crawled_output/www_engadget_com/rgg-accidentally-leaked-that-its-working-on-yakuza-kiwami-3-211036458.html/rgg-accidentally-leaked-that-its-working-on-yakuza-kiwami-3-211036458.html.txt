The leak was discovered on developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios' website. Fans noticed that there was an entry for Yakuza Kiwami 3 alongside the listings for the remakes of the first two Yakuza games — Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami 2 — on the RGG site. Although the listing has since been removed, screencaps shared on social media documented the accidental reveal.The timing of the leak also aligns nicely with the upcoming Tokyo Game Show, where RGG is scheduled to host a dedicated event. That certainly looks like the prime moment to officially announce Yakuza Kiwami 3 as its latest remake project. It is still technically possible to play the original Yakuza 3, which was released on PlayStation 3 in 2009. The game got remasters for the PlayStation 4 and later for the Xbox One and PC, but a full overhaul to the third entry in the franchise will be welcome news for its many loyal fans. The action-adventure Yakuza game series is known for its excellent combat mechanics, memorable characters, and storytelling that manages to weave deftly between ludicrous and profound. The whole franchise got a revamp in 2020 under the new name of Like A Dragon, and the latest entry is the wordily titled Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii.
