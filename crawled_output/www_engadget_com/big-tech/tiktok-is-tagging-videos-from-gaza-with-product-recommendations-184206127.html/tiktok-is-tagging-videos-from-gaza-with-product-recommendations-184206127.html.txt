The publication detailed a scenario in which footage of a Palestinian woman walking amidst rubble presented TikTok shop recommendations that matched what she wore in the video.The algorithm suggested products with names like "Dubai Middle East Turkish Elegant Lace-Up Dress" and "Women’s Solid Color Knot Front Long Sleeve Dress." The original footage showed the woman searching for lost family members.TikTok/The VergeThis is thanks to a new addition to the TikTok app that uses AI to identify objects in posts. When a user pauses a video, the shop will automatically recommend products that resemble those objects. Today's reporting indicates that the company didn't give much forethought as to which types of videos this technology should be applied to.The new tool isn't available to everyone just yet, as it's rolling out on a limited basis. To check if your app has been updated, simply pause a video and look for the "Find Similar" pop-up. We reached out to TikTok to ask about how this technology is being used and a spokesperson said it is "conducting a limited test of a visual search feature" and that it "should not have appeared on these videos." The company also says it's working to correct the issue.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
