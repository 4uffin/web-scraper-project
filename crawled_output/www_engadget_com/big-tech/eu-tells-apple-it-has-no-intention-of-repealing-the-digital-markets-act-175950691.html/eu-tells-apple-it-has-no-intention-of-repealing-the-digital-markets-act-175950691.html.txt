As first reported by France 24, EU digital affairs spokesperson Thomas Regnier responded to Apple's open letter regarding the DMA's effect on users in the EU."Apple has simply contested every little bit of the DMA since its entry into application," said Regnier. He added that the Commission had "absolutely no intention" of dismantling the DMA. The landmark legislation was passed in 2022 in an effort to rein in the ever-growing reach and power of big tech and to level the playing field for smaller would-be competitors.Since then, Apple has found itself in hot water in the EU over its App Store rules, cross-device interoperability and its browser options. Earlier this year, the Commission fined Apple approximately $570 million for anti-competitive activities, which the company is appealing.AdvertisementAdvertisementThis summer, the Commission opened a period of public consultation for the DMA with a deadline for submission of September 24. Apple submitted an official response, while also taking the time to publicly decry the DMA through a blog post.In the post, Apple says "it's become clear that the DMA is leading to a worse experience for Apple users in the EU." The company says it is "urging regulators to take a closer look at how the law is affecting the EU citizens who use Apple products every day," alleging that the implementation of these laws is opening users to higher risks of scams, exposure to harmful apps and weakened security surrounding user data.The back-and-forth over the DMA and the hefty fines being levied against big tech companies has become part of the political discourse amid trade negotiations between the US and the EU. President Donald Trump expressed his ire at American companies facing such heavy fines, and The Wall Street Journal alleged that the EU was using these fines in part as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
