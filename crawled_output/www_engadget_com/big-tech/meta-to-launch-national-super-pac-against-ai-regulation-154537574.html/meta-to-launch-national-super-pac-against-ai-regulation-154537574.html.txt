This super PAC will be committed to fighting "onerous" AI regulation across the country. It's called the American Technology Excellence Project and Meta spokesperson Rachel Holland said the company is investing "tens of millions" into the effort.The goal of the PAC is to elect pro AI state candidates from both parties. It's being run by longtime Republican operative Brian Baker with an assist from Democratic consulting firm Hilltop Public Solutions.The tech-friendly federal government has no plans to regulate AI but fell short on banning states from doing so. There have been over 1,000 state-level policy proposals introduced this year, which Meta thinks could hurt America in the AI race with China.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement"State lawmakers are uniquely positioned to ensure that America remains a global technology leader," Meta VP of public policy Brian Rice said in a statement. "This is why Meta is launching an effort to support the election of state candidates across the country who embrace AI development, champion the U.S. technology industry and defend American tech leadership at home and abroad."The company has not released any information as to which forthcoming state elections would be disrupted by the aforementioned tens of millions of dollars. We also don't know how many people the PAC will employ.This is just the latest move into politics by Meta. It recently launched a PAC in California to protect tech and AI interests. The state has been fairly proactive about enacting protections against potentially harmful AI use cases. It passed a law protecting the digital likenesses of actors and has attempted bills that block election misinformation and protect against "critical harm" caused by AI.While the Trump administration loves itself some AI, there are limits. The president recently signed an executive order banning "woke AI" from being used in the federal government. I haven't come across any woke AI in the wild, but I have seen whatever this is.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
