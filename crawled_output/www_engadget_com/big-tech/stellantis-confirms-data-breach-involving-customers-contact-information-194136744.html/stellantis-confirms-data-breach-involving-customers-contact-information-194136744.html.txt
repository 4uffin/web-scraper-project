The automaker said in a statement that "contact information" was procured, but not "financial or sensitive personal" data, as that is not stored on the third-party platform that was breached."We recently detected unauthorized access to a third-party service provider’s platform that supports our North American customer service operations," Stellantis said. "Upon discovery, we immediately activated our incident response protocols, initiated a comprehensive investigation and took prompt action to contain and mitigate the situation. We are also notifying the appropriate authorities and directly informing affected customers." The company encouraged customers to be on guard against phishing and social engineering attacks, and to be careful about sharing personal information with anyone who contacts them unexpectedly.Stellantis has not disclosed what types of contact information were involved in the breach, how many customers were affected or whether it's offering them privacy or credit protection services. A spokesperson told Engadget the automaker is "not providing any additional information beyond our statement."Bleeping Computer says a group called ShinyHunters claimed credit for the breach. The group told the publication it obtained more than 18 million records, containing contact details and names, from Stellantis' Salesforce instance. ShinyHunters has reportedly stolen data from other Salesforce clients over the last several months, including Google, Qantas, Adidas and LVMH.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
