The study will be held through an FDA investigational device exemption. "If you're imagining saying something, we would be able to pick that up," Neuralink president DJ Seo said this week.The idea is to help people with speech impairments communicate through thought. Neuralink is among the companies testing implants that help patients control a computer with their minds. That can include using virtual keyboards. Translating thought directly from the patient's speech cortex could speed things up by cutting the middleman.The company already has five other clinical trials underway. The first was in the US. It has since added studies in Canada, the UK and the United Arab Emirates.Neuralink / Chey Institute for Advanced Studies / YouTubeNeuralink's plans for people with severe impairments sound like utopian sci-fi. Regardless of anything else, success in this field could be beyond life-changing for them. Still, this is a commercial company in which Elon Musk owns a majority share. Neuralink's long-term plans are where it's hard not to worry a little.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement"We're currently envisioning a world where in about three to four years, there will be someone who's otherwise healthy who's going to get a Neuralink," Seo said. The company president hinted at what that might look like. "We think that it's actually possible to demonstrate abilities to speak to the latest AI model, or LLM models, at the speed of thought, even faster than how you're speaking, and being able to potentially get that information back through your AirPods, effectively closing the loop," he said.Our world today has revealed where things can go wrong when we turn too much of our humanity over to technology. You can start with smartphone addiction and social media algorithms and quickly move on to (alleged) AI-enabled suicide. Consumer brain implants can conjure the darkest images painted by our great sci-fi works. Think Neuromancer, Star Trek's Borg or Cyberpunk 2077's cyberware.Add what we know about Musk's ideas about politics, and it's hard not to be at least a little cynical. Is it too much to hope that the technology will advance enough to help those in need, but not so much that it devours humanity?AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
