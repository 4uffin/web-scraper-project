The social media platform introduced a chatbot called dating assistant that can help find prospective dates based on a user's interests. In the blog post announcing the features, the example Meta provided was "Find me a Brooklyn girl in tech." The chatbot can also "provide dating ideas or help you level up your profile." Dating assistant will start a gradual rollout to the Matches tab for users in the US and Canada. And surely everyone will use it in a mature, responsible, not-at-all-creepy fashion.The other AI addition is Meet Cute, which uses a "personalized matching algorithm" to deliver a surprise candidate that it determines you might like. There's no explanation in the blog post about how Meta's algorithm will be assessing potential dates. If you don't want to see who Meta's AI thinks would be a compatible match each week, you can opt out of Meet Cute at any time. Both these features are aimed at combatting "swipe fatigue," so if you're 1) using Facebook, 2) using Facebook Dating, and 3) are really that tired of swiping, maybe this is the solution you need.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBUYING GUIDESContributeComment guidelinesSupportBUYING GUIDESFollow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
