The movie follows on from the events of Disney+ series The Mandalorian — a show that director Jon Favreau created — and the fall of the Empire in Return of the Jedi. It's set to hit theaters on May 22, 2026.The 94-second clip doesn’t offer much in the way of plot details, though it does show Sigourney Weaver as a fighter pilot and Jabba the Hutt’s son Rotta (Jeremy Allen White). Mando (Pedro Pascal) and Grogu battle against bots and beasts, and the pair blows up an AT-AT. I'm sure there's nothing to be read into seeing a lumbering giant attempting to traverse a precarious path only to fail spectacularly at this specific moment in Disney's history.The trailer does make it seem like the movie will retain the adventurous spirit and humor of The Mandalorian, with Grogu getting to be as cute as ever. In a fun beat, the diminutive creature uses the Force to try to steal a snack from Weaver's character, only to be denied.The Mandalorian and Grogu will be the first Star Wars movie to hit theaters in over six years. Star Wars: Starfighter is slated to arrive a year later.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
