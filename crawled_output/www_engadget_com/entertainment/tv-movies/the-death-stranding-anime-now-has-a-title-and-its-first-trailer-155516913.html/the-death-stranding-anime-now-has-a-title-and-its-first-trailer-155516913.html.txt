Kojima somehow nearly got into double figures on Metal Gear games without any of them receiving the adaptation treatment (though not for the lack of trying on his part), but it’s looking like a very different story for the Death Stranding series on which he’s been working since departing Konami.A live-action adaptation of the post-apocalyptic walking simulator landed a writer and director back in the spring, and it was announced a few months later that an animated Death Stranding movie was also on the way, with Aaron Guzikowski (Raised by Wolves) penning the screenplay. We now know what film will be called, and there’s a trailer.Death Stranding Mosquito is directed by ABC Animation’s Hiroshi Miyamoto, with Kojima himself serving as a producer, and will apparently tell an original story within the "surreal and emotionally resonant" Death Stranding universe. If you’ve played the original game or its 2025 sequel, the teaser will look very familiar, with the film seemingly focusing on a character who definitely isn’t Norman Reedus’ Sam Porter Bridges, but is sporting very similar get-up.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementThe hooded figure comes face to face with what appears to be a BT-ified doglike creature, and then has a brutal fist fight with another character. We don’t get any more context than that, nor any whiff of a release date, but visually Death Stranding Mosquito looks absolutely stunning.It’s been a busy few days for Kojima-related announcements. We got the first gameplay trailer for Kojima Productions’ upcoming horror game, OD, and found out that Kojima is also releasing his own credit card in Japan. Yes, really.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
