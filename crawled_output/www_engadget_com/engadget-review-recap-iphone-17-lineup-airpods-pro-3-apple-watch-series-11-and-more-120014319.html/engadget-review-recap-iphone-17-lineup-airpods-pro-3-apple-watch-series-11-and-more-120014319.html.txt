Engadget review recap: iPhone 17 lineup, AirPods Pro 3, Apple Watch Series 11 and moreA roundup of the reviews published on Engadget over the last few weeks.Billy SteeleSenior reporter, reviewsBilly SteeleSenior reporter, reviewsSun, September 21, 2025 at 12:00 PM UTCSam Rutherford for EngadgetLast week's Apple event meant we were in for a barrage of reviews this week. We spent lots of time putting the iPhone 17 family, including the new iPhone Air, through its paces. We also tested the AirPods Pro 3 and Apple Watch Series 11 that were unveiled just over a week ago. In non-Apple reviews, there's in-depth analysis of a premium Chromebook and the latest Tamagotchi device. Read on to catch up on everything you might've missed over the last few weeks.Quick OverviewApple iPhone Air$999 at AppleApple iPhone 17$799 at AppleiPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max$1,099 at AppleApple AirPods Pro 3$249 at AmazonWatch Series 11More options$399 at AmazonSee 2 moreApple iPhone AirApple/Engadget86100Expert ScoreApple iPhone AirIt might not be the most affordable iPhone or the one with the most cameras, but for anyone who puts a premium on style and sleekness, the iPhone Air is without a doubt Apple's coolest handset in years. ProsExquisite designSurprisingly good battery lifeGorgeous displayStrong titanium frameConsMono speakerSingle rear cameraNo mmWave 5G support$999 at AppleApple replaced the iPhone 16 Plus with the ultra-thin iPhone Air, but the new phone is more than just a gimmick. As senior reviews writer Sam Rutherford observed, the company opted for sleekness with a purpose, and it did so without sacrificing too much battery life. "While Apple might not want to say so just yet, I'm willing to bet that this device will also be the template for an upcoming foldable iPhone," he concluded.Apple iPhone 17Apple/Engadget91100Expert ScoreApple iPhone 17The “regular” iPhone got a big refresh this year with the addition of a ProMotion display and Center Stage camera. ProsFinally, a 120Hz displayCenter Stage front camera works greatDual 48MP Fusion rear cameras take sharp photosCons6.3 inches will be too small for someBest camera performance is reserved for the 17 Pro$799 at AppleWe've become bored with Apple's tickle-down scheme for the regular iPhone over the years. The company has repeatedly opted to bring features from the Pro line down to these devices. This time, it finally gave the iPhone 17 a 120Hz display, and you won't have to wait for the best camera updates. "Even if you’re coming from the iPhone 16, you’ll reap the benefits of the overhauled display and improved cameras," I wrote. "I don’t say any of that lightly as I’m not a person who recommends getting a new phone every year."Apple iPhone 17 Pro and Pro MaxApple / Engadget93100Expert ScoreiPhone 17 Pro and Pro MaxThe iPhone 17 Pro is a powerful smartphone with an innovative selfie system, versatile rear cameras and a redesigned exterior that feels sturdy.  ProsInnovative and useful Center Stage selfie cameraVersatile triple-sensor system for rear camerasAluminum unibody feels sturdy and scratch-resistantImproved AI and thermal performanceConsExpensive$1,099 at AppleThe Pro and Pro Max versions of the iPhone have always held a camera advantage over the regular model, and that's still true. But the main differences now also include better thermal management, an aluminum unibody case and an optional 6.9-inch display. "This year’s iPhone lineup is forcing me to re-think the idea of a Pro phone," managing editor Cherlynn Low said. "Is it one that looks and feels expensive or is it one that’s slightly more durable and maybe doesn’t appear as stylish?"Apple AirPods Pro 3Apple/Engadget90100Expert ScoreApple AirPods Pro 3The most significant update to the AirPods lineup delivers a host of ANC-powered improvements, including Live Translation. Plus, the arrival of heart-rate tracking makes the AirPods Pro 3 a more capable workout partner. ProsImpressive ANC updatesImproved sound qualityLive Translation finally arrivesExtended battery life on a single chargeConsNew fit takes some getting used toTotal battery life is actually less than beforeLive Translation languages are limited at launch$249 at AmazonIf Apple had only improved both the active noise cancellation (ANC) and sound performance of the AirPods Pro 3, it would've been a decent upgrade. However, the company went well beyond that with the additions of Live Translation and heart-rate tracking. But the best part about this model is the strong possibility that the company isn't done with it yet. "If recent history is any indication, the company will continue to add new features to this third-generation version," I said. "I highly doubt that Apple is finished exploiting the power of the H2 chip, so it's just getting started with what the AirPods Pro 3 can do."Apple Watch Series 11Apple90100Expert ScoreWatch Series 11With improvements to battery life and new health metrics, the Apple Watch Series 11 is a refinement on what was already the best smartwatch for iPhone owners.

With upgrades to design, battery life, health monitoring and more, the Series 11 is a big refresh for the wearable device. However, it might not be the best option for most people. "With the Watch SE 3, you’ll still be able to access a wide range of health and fitness features like wrist temperature monitoring, sleep score, emergency SOS, fall and crash detection and more," Cherlynn concluded. "It’s a compelling option at an appealing price."Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514Acer85100Expert ScoreAcer Chromebook Plus Spin 514Between its powerful chip, great battery life and solid hardware, Acer’s Chromebook Plus Spin 514 is one of the best ChromeOS laptops you can buy. ProsGreat battery lifeExcellent performanceSolid keyboard, trackpad and displayReasonably thin and light for the priceConsExpensiveI wish there were USB-C ports on both sidesSpeakers and webcam are just okay$700 at Best BuyThere's some wide variance in performance among Chromebooks, but Acer's Chromebook Plus Spin 514 offers power, longevity and utility. The main downside is you'll have to pay a premium for it. "At $700, we’re pushing the top of what anyone should spend on a Chromebook," deputy editor Nathan Ingraham wrote. "While the more powerful chip and long battery life will be worth it for some people, Acer itself is providing some strong competition with its standard Chromebook Plus 514 which came out this summer."Tamagotchi ParadiseBandai / Engadget89100Expert ScoreTamagotchi Paradise Tamagotchi Paradise feels like a wholly fresh experience for the classic virtual pet, with new characters, fun games and a reimagined approach to caretaking.

"All in all, Tamagotchi Paradise feels fuller than 2023's Uni, especially as the latter existed at its launch before all the downloadable content started coming in," she said. "There's a lot of fun to be had with this one, so long as you're open to a little (okay, a lot of) change."AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
