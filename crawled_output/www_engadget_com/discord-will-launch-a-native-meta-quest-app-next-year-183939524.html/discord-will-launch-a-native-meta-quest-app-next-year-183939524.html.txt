The company revealed that Discord will be making a native app for the Meta Quest headset. According to Meta, the native window app will be available some time in 2026.The development makes sense. VR is a platform with a lot of gaming presence, so having Discord for easy social and voice connections while playing is a win for players and a natural match for the two businesses. Having a native app can make a big difference in the ease of use. I'm primarily a member of the PlayStation nation, and I swear I heard an angelic choir singing when the PS5 finally got call support. Meta positioned the upcoming availability of the native app as a boon for the developers of VR experiences to reach new audiences, thanks to Discord's more than 200 million monthly active players.
