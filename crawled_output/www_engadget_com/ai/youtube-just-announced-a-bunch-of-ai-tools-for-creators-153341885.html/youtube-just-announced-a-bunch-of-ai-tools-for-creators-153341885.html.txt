Let's get into some of the more interesting drops.There's an AI tool that can automatically edit raw footage into a "compelling first draft." It'll create a video complete with "music, transitions and voiceover." It's being tested right now and should roll out in the coming weeks.The platform is also launching software that will automatically create voiceovers in English and Hindi. It'll be available on the YouTube Create app and when making Shorts. It's launching later in the year. Additionally, there's software coming that turns the dialogue from videos into "catchy soundtracks" for Shorts.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementYouTube is also expanding Veo 3 integration in Shorts, so users can "easily turn any idea into high quality videos with sound, all from a text prompt." It could already make short videos, but now it can add sound and the video quality should be better. The platform also promises "better prompt matching" and new tools that can animate characters or stylize Shorts in other ways.YouTube Studio is adding a "conversational AI partner" to help users get insight on traffic analytics and that type of thing. That's rolling out right now.The event wasn't just for AI. There's a new collaboration feature that lets creators team up with up to four other people to make a video. This will increase discoverability by showing the footage to all audiences. It'll be available globally in the next couple of weeks. The platform is also finally introducing A/B testing for titles, allowing up to three variants.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
