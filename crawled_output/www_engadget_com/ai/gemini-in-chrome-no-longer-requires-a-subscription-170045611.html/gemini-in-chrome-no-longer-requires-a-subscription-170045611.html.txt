At the time, you needed an AI Pro or AI Ultra subscription to access the AI assistant in the browser. That's changing today. Google has begun rolling out the tool to all Chrome desktop users on both Windows and Mac. Provided you have Chrome's language set to English and live in the US, you'll see a new sparkle icon at the top of the interface. Tapping it will allow you to start making requests of Gemini.You can also use the tool on a smartphone. On Android, you can do so by holding your phone's power button. On iOS, meanwhile, Google is working on bringing the assistant to the Chrome app.GoogleSince its introduction at I/O, Google has made some enhancements to how Gemini works inside of Chrome. To start, the tool can now work across multiple tabs, allowing it to compare and summarize information from different websites. At the same time, Gemini can access your browsing history thanks to a new recall feature. Google suggests this can be helpful in situations where you can't quite remember where you saw something online. Instead of manually sifting through your browser history, you can write a prompt like "what was that blog I read on back to school shopping?" and Gemini will take care of the rest.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementThe new version of Gemini for Chrome also offers deeper integrations with other Google services, including Calendar, YouTube and Maps. For instance, you can ask the assistant to schedule meetings for you, and if you're working through a long YouTube video, Gemini can generate timestamps you can use to jump around the video.GoogleAt the start of May, Google began using Gemini Nano to upgrade Chrome's Enhanced Protection suite. On Thursday, the company said Gemini Nano would also soon work to protect users against websites that use fake viruses or giveaways to trick them. Google has also added an algorithm that will learn your preferences for granting permissions. When it determines you're unlikely to grant a website permission to access your computer's camera or location, it will present those requests in a less intrusive way. Similarly, Google will add an AI designed to make it easier to update compromised credentials through Chrome's built-in password manager. Starting with a handful of supported websites — including Coursera, Duolingo and Spotify — you'll be able to change your passwords with a single click.In the coming months, Google plans to bring agentic capabilities to Chrome, meaning Gemini will be able to complete tasks for you. For example, the company envisions people using this feature to do their weekly grocery shopping through Instacart. The company first previewed this capability with Project Mariner at the end of 2024. Over the last year, a few different companies have released their own takes on web-surfing agents with mixed results. For example, people have complained of OpenAI's Operator failing to complete some tasks.Google"Our hope is that by the time this gets to users, we've done away with many of the potential snafus," said Mike Torres, vice president of product for Chrome, during a media briefing Google held ahead of today's announcement. "This is an experimental experience we're continuing to improve. We're not going to do something that compromises the user experience."AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementLast but not least, Google is adding an AI Mode mode shortcut directly to Chrome's address bar. If you need a refresher, AI Mode is Google's dedicated search chatbot. At I/O 2025, the company made it available to every Search user in the US. Now you can access it without navigating to Google first. When I asked Torres about the button, he was quick to note users don't have to use the shortcut. "What we're trying to do is maintain users' existing behavior," he added.As with any major update from Google, it may take a few days for the new features to roll out to your installation of Chrome.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
