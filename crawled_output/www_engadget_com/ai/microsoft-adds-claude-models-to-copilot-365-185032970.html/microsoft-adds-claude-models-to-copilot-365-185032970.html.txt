As The Information's sources tipped, Microsoft 365 Copilot is adding Anthropic's AI models. Microsoft announced today that Claude access is now rolling out for beta testers. For starters, it's being integrated into Copilot's Researcher and its agent development tool."Copilot will continue to be powered by OpenAI's latest models," Microsoft's announcement was quick to stress. Following that report from earlier this month, it was easy to imagine growing tensions between the two. It didn't help that the story came on the heels of reports of uneasy negotiations between the pair.Whether or not there's anything to that, OpenAI models like GPT-5 still fuel most of Copilot… for now. But Microsoft 365's Researcher now allows testers to use Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.1. Copilot's reasoning tool launched earlier this year. It's designed to help you "tackle complex, multistep research."AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementMicrosoft posted the brief video below. It shows a new "Try Claude" button in the upper-right corner of the research agent's interface.Copilot Studio, Microsoft's AI agent dev tool, offers similar functionality. There, a drop-down menu lets you choose between OpenAI's and Anthropic's models.Anthropic integration is currently rolling out through Microsoft's Frontier program. (That's its optional beta program for AI previews.) After signing up, you'll need to opt in to use Anthropic. This will all presumably roll out to the wider public later.This won't be the end of Copilot's Anthropic integration. "Anthropic models will bring even more powerful experiences to Microsoft 365 Copilot," Microsoft's Charles Lamanna teased.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
