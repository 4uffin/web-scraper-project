The move affects around 30 percent of the company's staff, The Register writes, and it's not uncommon among tech companies in 2025. Duolingo announced similar plans to become "AI-first" in April.Kaufman describes this process as returning to "startup mode" and writes that his ultimate goal is to turn Fiverr into "an AI-first company that's leaner, faster, with a modern AI-focused tech infrastructure, a smaller team, each with substantially greater productivity, and far fewer management layers." Part of the justification Kaufman offers for why Fiverr doesn't "need as many people to operate the existing business" is that the company has already integrated AI into its customer support and fraud detection programs.The first sign that Fiverr might justify layoffs with AI came when Kaufman was interviewed by CBS News in May 2025 about the danger the technology posed to employees. Kaufman specifically advised employees to "automate 100 percent" of what they do with AI, while also claiming that wouldn't make them replaceable because they were still capable of "non-linear thinking" and "judgement calls." That advice doesn't seem like it was ultimately helpful for Fiverr's own employees.The company's cuts affect fewer people than a larger firm like Workday, who announced plans to eliminate 1,750 roles in February 2025. Regardless of the size of the company or its level of investment in AI, though, layoffs have the same effect: More work has to be done by fewer people.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
