The strategic partnership announced today is gargantuan in scale. The 10-gigawatt buildout will require millions of NVIDIA GPUs to run OpenAI's next-generation models. NVIDIA's investment will be doled out progressively as each gigawatt comes online.The first phase of this plan is expected to come online in the second half of 2026, and will be built on NVIDIA's Vera Rubin platform, which NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang promised will be a "big, big, huge step up," over the current-gen Blackwell chips.“NVIDIA and OpenAI have pushed each other for a decade, from the first DGX supercomputer to the breakthrough of ChatGPT,” said Jensen Huang in a press release announcing the letter of the intent for the partnership. “Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale," said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. NVIDIA has made a number of strategic investments lately, including making a $5 billion investment in Intel, shortly after the United States government took a 10 percent stake in the American chipmaker. The company also recently spent more than $900 million to license AI technology from startup Enfabrica and hire its CEO and other key employees.OpenAI has also formed other strategic partnerships over the last few years, including a somewhat complicated arrangement with Microsoft. This summer it struck a deal with Oracle to build out 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity using more than 2 million Oracle chips. That deal was part of The Stargate Project, the strategic partnership between SoftBank, OpenAI, NVIDIA, Oracle, Arm and Microsoft with a promise to spend $500 billion in the US on AI infrastructure.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
