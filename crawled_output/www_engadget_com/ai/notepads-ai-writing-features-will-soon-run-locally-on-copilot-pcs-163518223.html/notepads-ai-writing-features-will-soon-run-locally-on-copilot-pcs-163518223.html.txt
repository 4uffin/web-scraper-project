Your AI PC will soon perform Notepad's AI writing features on-device — no subscription required. The app's summarize, write and rewrite options were introduced earlier this year.Up to this point, you've needed a CoPilot Pro or Microsoft 365 subscription to use Notepad's AI writing tools. So, if you've splurged on an AI PC, this could save you a few bucks each month. And if you have both a subscription and a CoPilot+ PC, it lets you choose between local and cloud generation.Microsoft is rolling out the new local AI feature now for its Windows Insider beta testers. It's available in English only, at least for now.MicrosoftPaint is also getting some love in the latest Insider builds. You can now save projects, Adobe-style. If you're in the middle of an edit, you can choose File > Save as project. You can then select a location to save the .paint file and pick up later where you left off.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementOn top of that, Paint is also adding an opacity slider to the pencil and brush tools. Nobody in their right mind will describe MS Paint as a Photoshop rival. But at least the simple drawing and editing app is growing slightly more advanced. It's gotten a renewed focus from the company after adding AI image generation chops last year.Last but... definitely least is an update to Snipping Tool. Insiders will see a new quick markup option in the screenshot app. After snipping something onscreen, you'll find the feature in the capture toolbar. You can then scribble away before saving.All the Windows updates are available in the Canary and Dev Insider channels. Anyone with a Microsoft account can sign up for free. The company does occasionally cancel beta features before they're released to Windows proper. But that's more the exception than the rule.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
