And today, the General Services Administration (GSA) announced that it has reached an agreement with xAI that will allow it to buy Musk’s Grok AI models for $0.42 per organization.As part of the Trump administration’s OneGov procurement initiative, the deal with xAI will allow federal agencies access to the Grok 4 and Grok 4 Fast advanced reasoning models. The 18-month contract is the longest OneGov AI procurement agreement to date. xAI announced its Grok for Government strategy earlier in the summer, which signalled its intention to provide the government with a suite of AI products, including custom models for national security, science and healthcare purposes.As well as opening its models for government use, xAI is also providing dedicated engineers to speed up the implementation of its AI tools for participating agencies, and will offer an "upgrade path" for expanded features and higher rate limits. Such access is a crucial part of Trump’s AI Action Plan, designed to position the US as the global leader in AI. And his administration doesn’t appear to have been put off by Grok’s bizarre behavior in recent months, such as its preoccupation with far-right conspiracy theories regarding "white genocide" in South Africa, or its brief but enthusiastic turn towards antisemitism.xAI is the latest in a line of AI companies to strike deals with the GSA. Back in August, Anthropic began offering its Claude AI model to three branches of the US government for $1, following Gemini and xAI’s arch rival OpenAI joining a list of approved vendors.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
