What's that? It's actually pretty easy to do. Well, Google says otherwise and has a solution for you: conversational editing, a feature that lets you tell Google your requested edits, rather than have to make them yourself.Google first introduced conversational editing to Pixel 10 phones, but the company is now rolling it out to Android users in the US. It should be available for any adults who have their Google account set to English, have Face Groups turned on and location estimates enabled.To use conversational editing, first click "help me edit" in the editor. Then you can say exactly what edits you want either using your voice or text. The feature uses "advanced Gemini capabilities" to make the changes. You can do things like edit strangers out of the background, lighten the colors or get rid of a glare. It will show you the original and updated photos side-by-side to compare.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
