At the moment, they're the only television models that feature Google's AI assistant, but Gemini will be available on more devices later this year. Google says it will make its way to the Google TV Streamer, Walmart's onn 4K Pro streaming device, certain Hisense TV models and more TCL TVs. The company also intends to add more Gemini capabilities for televisions in the future.Google introduced Gemini integration for TVs when it presented an early look at new software and hardware upgrades coming to the product category at CES in January. If you've ever used a Google-powered streaming device or television, you'd know that they already have Google Assistant that you can use for search. But Gemini on TV, like its counterpart everywhere else, enables free-flowing conversations using natural language. You can activate it with a "Hey, Google" or by pressing the mic button on the remote.The company says you can ask Gemini to find you something to watch based on your preferences. For example, you can say: "Find me something to watch with my wife. I like dramas, but she likes lighthearted comedies." You can also ask it to summarize the events in the previous season of a show you're watching if you need a refresher before you start the next one. You can also ask Gemini to show you reviews for a particular show, or even ask it vague questions, such as "What's the new hospital drama everyone's talking about?"You're not just limited to asking questions about TV shows and movies, either. When Google demonstrated the AI assistant at CES, a company rep asked Gemini on TV to "explain the solar system to a third grader." The AI assistant did, and it also suggested relevant YouTube videos. You can ask it questions if you're learning a new skill, as well as recipes, to get answers with video suggestions you can follow. And after it's done answering your first query, you can make follow-up questions for clarity and more information.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
