Since its launch last week, it quickly rose in popularity, but the service was taken offline today. TechCrunch reported that it found a security flaw that allowed any logged-in user to access other accounts' phone numbers, the phone numbers called, call recordings and transcripts. TechCrunch said that it contacted Neon founder Alex Kiam about the issue. "Kiam told TechCrunch later Thursday that he took down the app’s servers and began notifying users about pausing the app, but fell short of informing his users about the security lapse," the publication reported. The app went dark “soon after” TC contacted Kiam. Neon does not appear to have a timeline about if or when the service will resume or what additional security protections it may add. The full report from TechCrunch is here and certainly worth reading if you've used Neon.
