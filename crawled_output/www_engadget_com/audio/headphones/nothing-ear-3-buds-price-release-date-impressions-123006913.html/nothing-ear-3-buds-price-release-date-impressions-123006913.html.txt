The company has refined its headphone series with an aluminum finish (in places) across both the buds and the case.Also housed inside the case is the Ear 3’s new standout feature/gimmick: the Super Mic. It’s like a walkie-talkie for your wireless headphones, pitched as a noise-banishing mic option — but I’ll get to that later.A slightly revamped design apparently gives the Ear 3 20 percent more signal sensitivity for less audio dropout, something that the company’s buds have occasionally been guilty of in the past. The design revamp should also mean the buds fit better. There’s a “more natural” stem angle, according to Nothing, and internal venting to reduce in-ear pressure.Image by Mat Smith for EngadgetThe case is a similar blend of recycled aluminum and plastic, but made with a new nano-injection process that fuses together the metal and plastic parts. That means there’s no glue, which normally means a win for repairability. However, you can wrench off glue. Fused-together plastic and aluminum will probably be far more challenging. Alongside the USB-C charger, there’s the grill of the aforementioned Super Mic, small enough to be confused for a 3mm headphone jack. Another nice design touch is a lanyard loop on the opposite side of the ports. Companies like lanyards now.AdvertisementAdvertisementWhat is a Super Mic? It's a second pair of mics that live inside the charging case. The premise is that — thanks to beamforming tech and the ability to be positioned just like a traditional handheld mic — the Super Mic is better able to block out everything that isn't your voice. The process feels like you’re still talking on earbuds, but with a walkie-talkie from the distant future. That distant future doesn’t have full software support, however. Supported in-app calls include Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, WhatsApp and WeChat.However, voice recordings are a little different. There is support for native voice memos on both Android and iOS, as well as in Blackmagic’s third-party video app. But if you like sending voice notes in Messages, WhatsApp and the like, you’re out of luck. Nothing told me that it couldn’t force the Super Mic to override the default mic inputs on smartphones. Likewise, you can’t use it as a remote mic for video recording either — unless you use the Blackmagic app.In use, the Super Mic makes calls and voice notes sound clearer. That was the verdict from both my own iOS Voice Memos and a handful of calls I made with friends and family, switching between just the Ear 3 bud mics and the Super Mic. I was surprised that listeners didn’t detect any significant reduction in environmental noise when I made calls in a coffee shop, but conversation partners said I sounded clearer. What I liked was being able to talk at a lower volume and still be picked up by the Super Mic — a notable difference from the buds.Image by Mat Smith for EngadgetThere are upgrades within the buds themselves, too. Each has three directional mics and a bone conduction VPU (voice pickup unit) to improve how well it can pick up speech. We’ve seen countless bone conduction headphones and headsets over the years, but Nothing’s implementation is a little subtler. The benefit of bone-conducted signals is that they’re less likely to be affected by wind and other noises. Nothing says its noise cancellation tech can reduce external noise by over 25 dB.AdvertisementAdvertisementHowever, while listening to them over the last few days, the Ear 3 doesn’t seem to isolate sound well enough from noise. I’d often hear an environmental hiss while using the ANC. Compared to recent buds I’ve tested like the Pixel Buds Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 2, the noise cancellation seems a little weak. Priced at $179, the Ear 3 aren’t as keenly priced as its predecessors (Ear 2 launched at $149, while the Ear Stick was $99), which means expectations are higher.Nothing has improved the sound of the Ear 3, thanks to the redesign of the 12mm dynamic driver and other adjustments. I noticed far more prominent bass tones compared to the Ear 2, while trebles sounded richer and less whistly. You can also use Nothing X companion app to tweak the equalizers for your preferred listening experience.Image by Mat Smith for EngadgetThat’s not the only software hook. Nothing has integrated a handful of AI features, but these require a recent Nothing phone to be used. Essential Space — the company’s take on pulling together voice notes, reminders, screenshots and more — can be directly connected to the Super Mic. Outside of call apps, you can press and hold to record voice notes, which will sync and be transcribed automatically. (There’s also ChatGPT functionality built in; by double-pinching, you can make requests to OpenAI’s chatbot.)The Ear 3 lasts longer than its predecessor, too. On Nothing’s Ear 2, you could expect around four hours of listening with ANC, with the case adding 22.5 hours of listening. On the upgraded model, Nothing estimates you’ll get roughly 5.5 hours of ANC listening, and then a further 22 hours from the case. With a five-minute charge, Nothing claims the buds will last up to an hour of audio (without ANC).The Ear 3 will launch in both white and black colors on September 25 for $179, and preorders are open now on Nothing’s site and retail partners.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
