This new entry brings a bevy of updated features, many of which were pulled from the recently-released Px7 S3 headphones.They feature new audio drivers, a built-in digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and an improved digital signal processor (DSP.) This allows for a 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio signal. The headphones can handle high-res audio from streaming services like Tidal and Qobuz, thanks to Qualcomm's aptX Lossless audio codec.The sound is aided by a five-band customizable EQ, which is accessible via a proprietary app. This app also lets users set other parameters and play audio directly from streaming platforms.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementThe Px8 S2 headphones also include more microphones for ANC, which should allow for better noise cancellation and a more nuanced transparency mode. The battery lasts for 30 hours, which is in line with all of the other Bowers & Wilkins models.Bowers &amp; WilkinsThe overall design has been refreshed, with a slimmer form factor. The company says it's the "most considered and comfortable over-ear headphone design we've ever made." The exterior has been crafted with Nappa leather and die-cast aluminum.

These headphones are also slightly lighter than the original Px8 cans.Each unit ships with a new carry case that's been designed to fit in most bags. The Px8 S2 headphones cost $800, which is $100 more than the original Px8 cost when they were released in 2023. Bowers & Wilkins does promise future software updates, including one that brings spatial audio.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
