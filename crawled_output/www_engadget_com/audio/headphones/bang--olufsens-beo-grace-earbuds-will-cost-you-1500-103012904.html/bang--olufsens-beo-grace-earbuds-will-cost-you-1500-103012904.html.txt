The Beo Grace, as the model is called, will set you back $1,500, £1000 or €1200, depending on where you are. It has a silver aluminum casing with a pearl finish, which you can protect with a bespoke leather pouch, though the accessory will cost you an additional $400. The company says Beo Grace was "inspired by the elegance of fine jewelry," with aluminum stems reimagined from its iconic A8 earphones. Bang & Olufsen's A8 had stems made of metal, as well, but they transition into ear hooks that enable a more and secure and snug fit.The earphones, the audio manufacturer explains, were "inspired by the acoustic principles" of the $2,200 Beoplay H100 headphones. Beo Grace has Spatial Audio and is optimized for Dolby Atmos, with an Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation technology that's "four times more effective" than the manufacturer's previous best earbuds. Specifically, its ANC tech is powered by six studio-grade microphones and can adjust itself in real time, based on the ambient noise. The model comes with tactile controls, so that every press to pause, play or skip is "crisp, deliberate and satisfying," but you will be able to adjust the volume by simple tapping. When it comes to battery life, the Beo Grace can last up to 4.5 hours of listening with ANC, and up to 17 hours with the charging case.Beo Grace is now available for pre-order from the Bang & Olufsen website and will be widely available on November 17. The model comes with a three-year warranty, so you at least know that the company will fix your $1,500 earbuds if they break in the near future.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
