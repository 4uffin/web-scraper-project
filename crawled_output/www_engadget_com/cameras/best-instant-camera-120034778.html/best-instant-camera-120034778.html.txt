The best instant cameras for 2025Fujifilm, Polaroid and others offer a wide range of prices and features.Steve DentReporterSteve DentReporterUpdated Thu, September 25, 2025 at 9:01 AM UTCAdd Engadget on GoogleEngadgetInstant cameras are popular for one simple reason: they’re fun. You can bring one to a party or event and capture a spontaneous moment, then after a couple of minutes, everyone can enjoy a physical photo instead of staring at a phone screen. The quality isn’t perfect, but those snaps have a nostalgic quality that people love.Buying one can be tricky though — you need to consider factors like price, film size, photo quality and more. Plus, there are a lot of models to choose from. This guide will help you choose the best Instant camera for your needs so you can wring the most fun possible out of it.Quick OverviewBest instant camera overallFujifilm Instax Square SQ40More options$150 at AmazonBest instant camera overall - runner upFujifilm Instax Mini 12More options$93 at AmazonHonorable mentionFujifilm Instax Mini 99 Instant Film Camera$199 at AmazonBest basic instant cameraPolaroid Go Generation 2More options$110 at AmazonBest instant camera with large filmPolaroid Now+ (2nd Generation)More options$129 at AmazonSee 7 moreWhat to consider before buying an instant cameraThe main factor for most people is the size of the film. When most people think of retro instant cameras, they think of a square image size. That’s why Instagram, which used to have a Polaroid-like app icon, only supported square images for years. If that’s what you want, then Fuji’s Square or either of Polaroid’s formats are best.However, if you want as large an image as possible, Fujifilm’s Instax wide is the way to go. For those who prefer a smaller size to pin on their fridge or slip in an envelope (or the cheaper film), Fujifilim’s Instax Mini or Polaroid’s Go format are best.AdvertisementAdvertisementWith that in mind, here are the choices. Fujifilm’s Instax alone offers three formats: Mini, Square and Wide, with film sizes of 3.4 x 2.1 inches, 3.4 x 2.8 inches and 3.4 x 4.3 inches. The corresponding image sizes are 2.44 x 1.81 inches, 2.44 x 2.44 inches and 2.44 x 3.9 inches.Leica’s Sofort 2 and Lomography models also uses Fujifilm’s Mini format, while Polaroid’s smaller Go format is 2.64 x 2.13 inches (1.81 x 1.83-inch image) and its i-Type size is 3.46 x 4.21 inches, with a square image size of 3.11 x 3.11 inches.As for prices, Fujifilm’s Instax films are generally around $1 - $1.20 per shot for square or wide color film and $.60 - $.75 for mini color film. Those prices go up a bit if you choose custom models with colorful or patterned borders, and down if you buy in bulk. Polaroid’s i-Type film is a bit more at about $2.00 per shot or $1.00 - $1.35 per shot for Go color film.Image quality isn’t really the point with instant cameras of course, as they’re always going to be fuzzy compared to digital photos. However, some models (notably Fujifilm and Polaroid models) are a bit better than others.AdvertisementAdvertisementAnd in terms of pricing for the cameras themselves, models with larger film are generally more expensive. It also increases if you add hybrid features like USB-C connectivity, smartphone sharing, the ability to print out photos and more, along with niceties like a selfie mirror. The best, most feature-laden cameras can cost upwards of $200 and basic versions can be well under $100.Best instant cameras for 2025FujifilmBest instant camera overallFujifilm Instax Square SQ40Wireless connectivity: Bluetooth | Camera weight: 436g (without batteries, strap, and film) The best instant camera is the Fujifilm Instax Square SQ40. It looks great thanks to the leatherette details and retro design, while offering minimal controls for ease of use. It takes 3.39 x 2.83-inch Instax Square prints that fully deliver on the retro vibes. You also get a flash, selfie mirror, front shutter release and hand strap, plus it’s relatively light and easy to carry around. The camera alone is priced at $150, but you’ll need to budget for film as well. $150 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$235 at Adorama$150 at Best BuyFujifilmBest instant camera overall - runner upFujifilm Instax Mini 12Wireless connectivity: Bluetooth | Camera weight: 306g (without batteries, strap, and film) If you’d rather spend less on both camera and film, take a look at Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera ideal for newbies that lets you get started shooting in just a couple of minutes. The controls couldn’t be simpler as well, as you just need to twist the lens into the “on” or “off” position. It’s also small and thin, so can be slipped into a pocket and fits nicely into the small hands of fledgeling young photographers. $93 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$94 at Macy's$94 at TargetFujifilmHonorable mentionFujifilm Instax Mini 99 Instant Film CameraWireless connectivity: Bluetooth | Camera weight: 12 ounces (without batteries, strap, and film) Where the Instax Mini 12 is cheap and cheerful, the Instax Mini 99 offers far more control and features. The best feature is the four-colored LEDs inside the camera that can be enabled to produce in-camera “looks,” like “Faded Green” and “Light Leak,” that produces a glow simulating a broken camera. At the same time, unlike other models, you can turn the flash off completely for a more natural look. Other nice features are a rear display and sports mode, with the one downside being the lack of a selfie mirror. $199 at AmazonPolaroidBest basic instant cameraPolaroid Go Generation 2Wireless connectivity: Bluetooth | Camera weight: 240g (without batteries and film) The Polaroid Go might be basic and relatively cheap, but it offers a lot. You get a self-timer and double-exposure modes, along with Polaroid’s square Go format film that delivers that nostalgic feel. It’s also pretty small and light, so it’s an easy choice to bring it along to any occasion. The main drawback is the autofocus, which delivers spotty results unless you’re a good way from the subject. $110 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$110 at Target$110 at Best BuyPolaroidBest instant camera with large filmPolaroid Now+ (2nd Generation)Wireless connectivity: Bluetooth | Camera weight: 451.5g (without film) Polaroid is a name synonymous with instant cameras, and its Now+ model is the best choice for larger film. Though the prints are slightly smaller than those produced by Fujifilm’s Instax Wide 400, I prefer the square format that evokes old school Polaroid photos. It also offers a host of features like an updated app with creative shooting modes including manual modes, a self-timer, double exposure, light painting and an aperture priority option for depth of field. Though the 2nd-generation model suffered from occasional exposure issues, the new model has largely corrected that and added a tripod mount to boot, along with some new colors. The main downside is the relatively high price of Polaroid’s i-Type film. $129 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$150 at Adorama$130 at Best BuyFujifilmBest instant camera with large film - runner upFujifilm Instax Wide 400Wireless connectivity: Bluetooth | Camera weight: 616g (without battery, strap, film cartridge, and close-up lens) For the biggest prints possible (as long as you don’t mind the rectangular format), Fujifilm’s new Instax Wide 400 is your best bet. It offers simple operation with one-button, fully-automatic shooting along with a new close focus option to add tight shots to your repertoire. The main downside is a lack of hybrid options, but the fact that it’s relatively basic helps keep the price down. Film is also considerably cheaper than Polaroid’s i-Type. $150 at B&H PhotoPolaroidBest premium instant cameraPolaroid FlipWireless connectivity: Bluetooth | Camera weight: 30.4 ounces (without batteries and film) Earlier in 2025, Polaroid introduced the Flip, its most advanced modern instant camera to date. While expensive compared to other models, it has some serious photography features. Those include a sonar autofocus and a hyperfocal four-lens system that improves sharpness, along with a big powerful flash that can vary brightness to nail exposure. It has a (very) colorful, retro compact design that folds shut for storage and to protect the lens. It uses Kodak’s larger (but more expensive) i-Type film, so it produces beautiful, sharable prints. $220 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$220 at Target$220 at Best BuyFujifilmBest premium instant camera - runner upFujifilm Instax Mini EVOWireless connectivity: Bluetooth | Camera weight: 285g For the next most fully-featured instant camera, look no further than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo. It marries the vintage charm of instant photography with digital shooting, giving you the ability to preview shots on the three-inch rear display and only print out the ones you want. Another great trick is that it can function as a printer for your smartphone photos. Design-wise, it matches the aesthetic of Fujifilm’s charming digital cameras like the X100 VI, and is considerably more compact than other Instax models. And much like the X-series cameras, you have the ability to apply numerous simulations and effects to prints. The downside is that it’s more complex to operate than other instant cameras, but that versatility will appeal to many buyers. $235 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$235 at Target$235 at Best BuyLomographyHonorable mentionLomography Instant WideWireless connectivity: None | Camera weight: 725.7g If you’re very particular about your instant photography, Lomography’s Lomo’Instant Wide Glass is the model to get. It has perhaps the best lens of any instant camera with a 90 mm multi-coated glass model that delivers very sharp photos. It also comes with a host of advanced features, including exposure compensation control, a built-in flash, multiple exposure capability, a manual focus lens, a sync socket for an external flash, selfie mirror and the ability to add optional wide-angle and macro conversion lenses. The main disadvantages are its large size and relatively high price. $169 at LomographyLeicaBest luxury instant cameraLeica Sofort 2Wireless connectivity: Bluetooth | Camera weight: 320g (without batteries and film) If the canape table at your typical gathering has caviar blinis and quail egg tartines, your instant camera of choice may be Leica’s Sofort 2. It’s a point-and-shoot model with a 28mm equivalent f/2.0 lens that shoots mini-sized Sofort film (or Fuji’s Instax film). While the specs aren’t too impressive for a $400 instant camera, Leica did nail the social aspect with the ability to capture digital images to a microSD card, view them on the three-inch LCD display and then share them with friends using Leica’s FOTOS app. It doesn’t take the best photos of any instant camera, though it does offer great battery life and nice portability. However, the main reason to get this model is the Leica brand and red dot. That lets others know that you may be taking lighthearted pictures, but you definitely know what you’re doing. $399 at B&H PhotoFujifilmBest instant photo printerFujifilm Instax Link Wide PrinterIf you have an instant camera that can save images to a memory card, an instant printer lets you share favorite photos with friends and family. The best of those is Fujifilm’s Instax Link Wide Printer. It’s portable and prints quickly with true to life colors, plus the photos last forever. It’s also very affordable. $150 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$150 at Best BuyCanonBest instant photo printer - runner upCanon Ivy 2Canon has a fun take on photo printers with the Ivy 2 printer. It uses special photo paper (that’s also a sticker!) so it never needs ink and allows you to print photos with graphics and funky borders. At the same time, it’s easy to set up, reliable, very portable and affordable. $100 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$109 at Adorama$110 at Best BuyAdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
