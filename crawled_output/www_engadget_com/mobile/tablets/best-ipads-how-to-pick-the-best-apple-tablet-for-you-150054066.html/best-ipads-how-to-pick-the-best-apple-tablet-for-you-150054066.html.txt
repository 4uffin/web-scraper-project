The best iPad for 2025: How to pick the best Apple tablet for youWe've tested and reviewed every model in Apple's iPad lineup, so let's make sense of it.Jeff DunnSenior Reporter, Buying AdviceJeff DunnSenior Reporter, Buying AdviceUpdated Thu, August 28, 2025 at 7:01 AM UTCAdd Engadget on GoogleEngadgetFiguring out the best iPad for you can be tricky. Apple now sells three 11-inch tablets and two 13-inch ones, each with key differences in pricing, specs and accessory support. The iPad mini is still hanging around, too. Ahead of the big changes coming with the iPadOS 26 update later this year, we’ve tested each current iPad and broken down which ones best fit different needs, whether you want a laptop replacement or just a big screen for streaming.Quick OverviewBest iPad for most peopleApple iPad Air (M3)More options$449 at AmazonBest budget iPadApple iPad (A16)More options$299 at AmazonBest (and only) compact iPadApple iPad mini (A17 Pro)More options$489 at AmazonBest iPad for power usersApple iPad Pro (M4)More options$898 at AmazonTable of contentsThe best iPads for 2025How we test the best iPadsiPad FAQsRecent updatesThe best iPads for 2025Nathan Ingraham for Engadget89100Expert ScoreBest iPad for most peopleApple iPad Air (M3)Screen size: 11 inches or 13 inches | Display resolution: 2360 x 1640 (11-inch), 2732 x 2048 (13-inch) | Storage: Up to 1TB | RAM: 8GB | Weight: 1.01 pounds (11-inch), 1.36 pounds (13-inch) | Battery life: Up to 10 hours | Front camera: 12MP | Rear camera: 12MP Read our full Apple iPad Air M3 review The recently refreshed iPad Air remains the Apple tablet we’d recommend to most people. Yes, it costs more than the entry-level iPad, and yes, there’s still a gulf between it and the higher-end iPad Pro. But no iPad strikes a better balance between price, performance and features. It’s Apple’s “just right” tablet — advanced enough to be a pleasure every day but not eye-wateringly expensive. The newest iPad Air, launched in March 2025, earned a score of 89 in our review. It starts at $599 for an 11-inch model or $799 for a variant with a 13-inch display. Outside of a higher brightness rating on the 13-inch model (600 nits versus 500 nits), the two are virtually identical, so which one is best simply depends on what screen size you prefer. Most will probably spring for the 11-inch version given that it’s cheaper and much easier to hold. But the added screen real estate on the 13-inch version is great if you typically use your iPad with a keyboard case, or just want more room for watching movies, playing games or multitasking for work. Both models are much pricier than the base iPad, but the Air’s upgrades mostly justify the premium. It now runs on Apple’s M3 system-on-a-chip (SoC), which is the same silicon found in last-gen MacBooks and iMacs. It’s overkill for web browsing, video streaming and other basic tasks, but it means performance should rarely, if ever, be an issue. It should also make the Air a little more futureproof, as a number of iPadOS features are only accessible with M-series chips or newer A-series silicon. All of the Apple Intelligence AI tools, for instance, aren’t available on the newest entry-level iPad, nor are the ports of demanding video games like Death Stranding and Resident Evil 4. The Stage Manager multitasking mode is also restricted to more powerful iPads today — though that's changing with the upcoming iPadOS 26 update, which will bring a more robust windowing system in general. (The base iPad still won't have full external display support, however, and it may not run Stage Manager as well on the whole.) The M3 Air also has a healthy 8GB of RAM and 128GB of base storage; the standard iPad also starts with 128GB now but still has a bit less memory at 6GB. The iPad Air’s 60Hz LCD display isn’t as vibrant or smooth in motion as the 120Hz OLED panel on the latest iPad Pro, and it’s starting to show its age in 2025 when some smartphones offer a higher refresh rate for hundreds of dollars less. Still, it’s bright, sharp and relatively accurate. It’s also a step up from the entry-level iPad, as it’s fully laminated, which means there’s no visible gap between the display and the front glass. That may not sound like much, but it’s one of those things that’s hard to ignore once you’ve seen the difference. The Air’s panel also has an antireflective coating to further minimize glare, plus it supports a wider P3 color gamut. The iPad Air has had virtually the same square-edged design for four generations now, but it remains sturdy, elegant and reasonably comfortable. It still offers a solid 10-ish hours of battery life, a USB-C port and a Touch ID fingerprint scanner built into its power button (but no Face ID, annoyingly). Apple moved the front-facing camera to the tablet’s long edge with the previous-gen model, and that remains a much more natural position for FaceTime calls in landscape mode. Unlike the entry-level iPad, the Air works with the Pencil Pro, Apple’s most featured stylus. (Though it’s not compatible with the older second-gen Pencil — yes, the stylus situation is messy.) It doesn’t work with the company’s best aluminum keyboard case, but it supports a new Magic Keyboard with some of that model’s upgrades, including a more spacious trackpad and a dedicated function row. This version is still mostly made of plastic, and its lack of backlit keys is hard to excuse when the older Magic Keyboard — which is thankfully still available — didn’t have that issue, but it remains highly comfortable for typing. All of these accessories add a good bit to the Air’s bottom line, but for digital artists or frequent typers, they’re there. The M3 iPad Air is a straightforward spec bump, so there’s no real need to upgrade if you’re coming from the M2 or M1 models. In fact, if you can still find a refurbished version of the M2 Air at a lower price, that'll be a better value on the whole. But if your iPad is slowing down, you’re buying your first Apple tablet or you want a 13-inch iPad without totally torching your savings account, the Air should be the first model you consider.

For $349, that makes it a compelling bargain for those who want a modern iPad for as little cash as possible. The base iPad looks virtually identical to the iPad Air from afar. It’s only marginally thicker and heavier, while its 11-inch panel is just as sharp and bright. Battery life comes in at the same 10-ish hours, and there’s still a USB-C port and Touch ID sensor. The cameras are nearly the same, too, with the selfie cam located along its long edge. Most importantly, it gets you nearly all the same conveniences of iPadOS for $250 less. This model runs on a slightly cut-down version of the A16 Bionic chip found in 2022’s iPhone 14 Pro and 2023’s iPhone 15, plus 6GB of RAM. This combo won’t hold up as well as higher-end iPads years down the road, and it can’t run Apple Intelligence or extend to an external display via Stage Manager. Plus, the M3 Air is already noticeably faster for exporting 4K videos or playing the most taxing iPad games.  But the A16 is more than quick enough for the tasks most people actually do with an iPad, be it watching Netflix, sending emails, playing casual Apple Arcade games or even editing photos in Lightroom. If anything, many people will prefer to not have their tablet push AI on them. And with the iPadOS 26 update later this year, this iPad will have access to many of the same Mac-style productivity and multitasking features as its pricier siblings. Beyond that, it starts with the same healthy 128GB of storage as the Air. The iPad (A16) does have a worse display than the Air, with no lamination, no support for the wider P3 color space and no antireflective coating. Put the two side by side and the Air indeed produces slightly bolder colors and holds up better against glare. The lack of lamination makes writing with the Apple Pencil feel more abstracted on the cheaper model, too. For the price, though, this screen is still sharp, comfortably sized and devoid of major color accuracy issues. The gap here isn’t nearly as dramatic as the one between the Air’s and iPad Pro’s displays. Likewise, while the Air’s dual speakers sound fuller and more rounded, the base iPad gets loud and clear enough to avoid serious problems. There are other downgrades. The iPad (A16) isn't compatible with the Apple Pencil Pro, just the lesser USB-C Pencil — which lacks pressure sensitivity — and ancient first-gen model. It doesn’t work with the same Magic Keyboards; instead, it uses its own Surface-like accessory called the Magic Keyboard Folio, which has a function row but isn’t as stable on your lap. It supports Wi-Fi 6 but not Wi-Fi 6E. The USB-C port is technically slower for data transfers, too, maxing out at 480 Mbps instead of 10 Gbps. Like we said with our top recommendation, a refurbished M2 iPad Air is worth considering over the iPad (A16) if you can find one at a good price. It’s been discontinued, so we can’t make it a formal pick, but it remains a better piece of hardware. But if that’s not an option, the base iPad is a strong bargain. It’s worse than the iPad Air, but it’s not $250 worse for those on a tighter budget, folks upgrading from the 9th-gen iPad or anyone who just doesn’t push their iPad to the limit most of the time.

Apple updated it in late 2024 with a new chip and support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and it's still the shortest and lightest iPad in the current lineup by some distance. As before, it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display that’s easier to use with one hand. We gave the iPad mini a review score of 83. Its design follows closely after that of the iPad Air: squared-off edges, thin bezels, no Home button, a Touch ID sensor in the power button, stereo speakers, decent cameras and a USB-C port. Its display is technically sharper, but otherwise gives you the same max brightness, lamination, antireflective coating and wide color gamut. It doesn’t have a “Smart Connector” to hook up Apple-made keyboards, but it does work with the top-end Apple Pencil Pro and the less expensive USB-C Apple Pencil. The Pencil Pro is a step up over the older second-generation Apple Pencil the prior mini used, with haptic feedback, a gyroscope and a “squeeze” feature for opening up a brush palette. The mini runs on Apple’s A17 Pro chip, the same as the one in 2023's iPhone 15 Pro series. While this chip isn’t quite as powerful as the M3 in the iPad Air, it’s more than capable enough to handle what most people will want to do with this iPad. Notably, it’s also powerful enough for Apple Intelligence. That might not be something that compels people to upgrade right now (or maybe ever), but the point is that the new mini is more futureproof than its predecessor. The mini starts at $499 for a 128GB model. Apple finally saw fit to double the base storage, which makes the cheapest model easier to recommend than before. If you specifically want a smaller tablet — whether it’s to easily stuff in a bag, use with one hand or treat like a high-end e-reader — this is the only one Apple sells, and the best option in its size range.  ProsA compact but full-featured iPadSupports the Apple Pencil ProA17 Pro chip is plenty powerfulStarts at 128GB of storageApple may have fixed jelly-scrolling display issuesConsDisplay is limited to 60Hz refresh rateBezels are a bit thickNo Face IDNo M-series chip$489 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$500 at Target$499 at Best BuyApple84100Expert ScoreBest iPad for power usersApple iPad Pro (M4)Screen size: 11 inches or 13 inches | Display resolution: 2420 x 1668 (11-inch), 2752 x 2064 (13-inch) | Storage: Up to 2TB | RAM: Up to 16GB | Weight: 0.98 pounds (11-inch), 1.28 pounds (13-inch) | Battery life: Up to 10 hours | Front camera: 12MP | Rear camera: 12MP Read our full Apple iPad Pro (M4) review The latest iPad Pro is the most expensive iPad and more tablet than most people need, full stop. But if you have cash to burn, are determined to use an iPad as your main mobile computer or just want the most technically impressive iPad possible, this is it. We gave the new iPad Pro a score of 84 in our review. Like the iPad Air, it comes in 11- and 13-inch models: The former starts at $999, while the latter starts at $1,299. That’s prohibitively expensive for most people, but for the money you get a number of premium, if inessential, upgrades over Apple’s other tablets. The most significant of these is the Pros' “tandem OLED” display. Compared to the LCD screen on the iPad Air, this produces richer colors and deeper, more uniform black tones. Gaming and scrolling web pages look more fluid thanks to its faster 120Hz refresh rate. It can also get significantly brighter, reaching up to 1,000 nits in SDR and up to 1,600 nits with HDR highlights. This is where the “tandem” part comes in. Essentially, Apple is stacking two OLED panels on top of one another to improve peak brightness, which is often a (relative) weakness of traditional OLED displays. It’s a breakthrough, but all you really need to know is that this screen is an absolute delight — one of the best we’ve seen on any consumer device, let alone a tablet. For watching movies or editing media, you really can’t do better. This same display tech is used on both the 11- and 13-inch iPad Pro, unlike previous models, so which one is best merely comes down to personal preference. The design here is broadly similar to that of the iPad Air, but slightly thinner and lighter. The difference isn’t huge on paper, but the Pros' slimmed-down frames make them just that little bit easier to hold. This is particularly meaningful with the 13-inch model. The other headline upgrade is Apple’s M4 SoC. If the M3 is overkill for the vast majority of casual and pro-level iPad tasks, then the M4 is mega-kill; it easily chewed through just about anything we threw at it. But it should be even more futureproof, and it'll save a few seconds here and there if your work involves high-res media editing, heavy use of machine learning and the like. Beyond that, the base iPad Pro has 256GB of storage, which is twice as much as any other iPad. Like the M3 Air, it also supports advanced features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing on its GPU, which can aid lighting in games, plus a faster neural engine, which can help with the AI features Apple has been rolling out. If you really want to max things out, note that the 1TB and 2TB configurations have twice as much RAM (16GB) and use a technically more powerful version of the M4 with an extra performance core unlocked. Jumping to one of those SKUs costs a minimum of $1,599, though — and that’s before you add accessories. Those looking to use the iPad Pro as a (very expensive) media consumption device don’t need this, but if you work with memory-hungry apps or need the absolute best, just note it’ll cost you. The iPad Pro is the only iPad with Face ID, which remains a bit more convenient than reaching for a fingerprint scanner. It’s the only one with a Thunderbolt USB-C port, which is technically faster for transferring large files. It sounds more robust than the Air, with four built-in speakers instead of two. Its camera system isn't that different, but it includes a flash for more easily scanning documents, and it can record video in Apple's ProRes format. Its front camera is on the long edge, too. As for accessories, the Pro alone can use Apple’s best Magic Keyboard, which itself is wildly expensive but has a more premium aluminum finish, backlit keys and haptic feedback alongside a larger trackpad and a row of function keys. It also supports the Pencil Pro stylus (but not the second-gen Pencil). If most of these features sound niche to you, well, yeah, that’s the idea. Unless you're willing to pay for that terrific OLED screen, the iPad Air gets close enough for a much more palatable price. And though the iPad Pro is a class-leading tablet, it is ultimately still an iPad. Certain creative professionals have used it just fine as a laptop replacement, but up to now, iPadOS has made multitasking and other computer-y tasks more convoluted than they are on a Mac. The iPadOS 26 update appears to go a long way towards rectifying power users' longstanding complaints, but many of the features coming there will also be available on the cheaper models. Regardless, the Pro is a wonderful iPad — fast, slim and luxurious. And expensive.

To better measure performance specifically, we use benchmarking tests like Geekbench 6, 3DMark and GFXBench Metal, plus we measure how long it takes for each tablet to boot up and open various apps. We also check how well each tablet holds up long-term, whether it’s with a review unit provided by Apple or an iPad model that’s owned by a member of the Engadget staff.To help compare the color performance and brightness of the displays, we play the same videos on different iPads, side-by-side, at equal brightness levels. We use each tablet in direct sunlight outdoors to see how well they hold up to glare, and we play a handful of the same musical tracks to evaluate speaker performance. For battery life, we keep track of how long each tablet generally lasts before it needs a recharge, but we also play a 1080p movie on a loop at roughly 70 percent brightness with power-sapping background processes off. We also test each device with an Apple Pencil and note how responsive the stylus feels. Finally, we carefully pore over spec sheets and software updates to keep track of which features are available on certain iPads but not others.iPad FAQsThe iPad (A16) on top of an 13-inch iPad Air.(Jeff Dunn for Engadget)What are some new features coming to iPadOS 26?Apple first previewed iPadOS 26 during its WWDC keynote in June. The update looks to be a major overhaul, one that brings iPadOS closer to macOS than ever before. New features include the ability to open more windows simultaneously and resize or tile them more freely; a Mac-style Menu bar; a dedicated Preview app; an upgraded Files app; an improved ability to export or download large files in the background; an Exposé view that shows all open windows; a pointier cursor and the option to add folders to the Dock. It’ll also use the new “liquid glass” design language Apple is rolling out across all of its platforms in 2025. Importantly, Apple says these features will be available across its tablet lineup, from the iPad Pro to the entry-level iPad. That could make the latter a particularly enticing value. You can find the full list of compatible devices at the bottom of Apple’s press release.How long do iPads typically last?If history is any indication, expect Apple to update your iPad to the latest version of iPadOS for at least five years, if not longer. The current iPadOS 18 update, for example, is available on iPad Pro models dating back to 2018 and other iPads dating back to 2019. How long your iPad’s hardware will last depends on which model you buy and how well you maintain it. (If you’re particularly clumsy, consider an iPad case.) A more powerful iPad Pro will feel fast for a longer time than an entry-level iPad, but each model should remain at least serviceable until Apple stops updating it, at minimum.What’s the difference between the iPad and the iPad Air?Compared to the 11th-gen iPad, the iPad Air runs on a stronger M3 chip (instead of the A16 Bionic) and has 2GB more RAM (8GB total). Both come with 128GB of storage by default. The Air is also available in two sizes, 11 and 13 inches, whereas the 11th-gen iPad doesn't offer the larger screen option. The M-series SoC gives the Air better long-term performance, plus access to certain iPadOS features such as Apple Intelligence and Stage Manager. Its display supports a wider P3 color gamut, has an antireflective coating and is fully laminated. The latter means there’s no “air gap” between the display and the glass covering it, so it feels more like you’re directly touching what’s on screen instead of interacting with an image below the glass. The Air also works with the newer Pencil Pro stylus and more comfortable Magic Keyboards, and its USB-C port supports faster data transfer speeds. It technically supports faster Wi-Fi 6E, too, while the lower-cost iPad uses Wi-Fi 6.AdvertisementAdvertisementStarting at $349, the 11th-gen iPad is $250 less expensive than the iPad Air. It has a similarly elegant design with flat edges, thin bezels, USB-C port, and a Touch ID reader. Battery life is rated at the same 10 hours, and both devices have their front-facing camera on their long edge, which is a more natural position for video calls. The cheaper iPad works with the first-gen and USB-C Apple Pencils – which are more convoluted to charge – and a unique keyboard accessory called the Magic Keyboard Folio.Jeff Dunn for EngadgetWhat’s the difference between iPads and Android tablets?The operating system, duh. But to give a few more specifics: Android devices are available from more manufacturers and cover a wider price range. You won’t see an $80 iPad anytime soon. Android is also more malleable in that you can easily sideload apps from places beyond Google’s official app store and more extensively customize the look of the OS. Several Android tablets still have features like a headphone jack or a microSD slot for adding storage, too, though those are getting rarer.But we tend to recommend Apple tablets to those who have no allegiance either way. iPad apps are still a bit more likely to be designed specifically for larger screens, rather than looking like blown-up phone software, and Apple is just about peerless when it comes to long-term software support. Every new iPad hits a certain baseline of hardware quality and performance — none of them feel cheap, and all of them are fast enough for most needs. Plus, you’ll get the most out of an iPad if you use other Apple devices.Can an iPad replace a laptop?This is a loaded question, since laptop workflows differ from person to person. If you mostly use a notebook for browsing the web, watching videos or writing emails and word docs, then sure, you can get along just fine with an iPad and the right iPad accessories. It’ll be easier to carry around, the battery life is great and having the touchscreen and stylus support is handy (though many Windows users have that regardless). Even beyond the basics, plenty of media editors, graphic designers and digital artists have shown they can get things done on an iPad.AdvertisementAdvertisementBroadly speaking, though, a laptop OS tends to be more flexible when it comes to file management, multitasking, coding or other “heavy” tasks. Safari on the iPad isn’t quite on par with desktop browsers either. So the answer really depends on you. That said, the iPadOS 26 update could close the gap, so check back on this in a couple of months.How do I take a screenshot on an iPad?As we note in our screenshot how-to guide, you can take a screenshot on your iPad by pressing the top button and either volume button at the same time. If you have an older iPad with a Home button, simultaneously press the top button and the Home button instead.Recent updatesAugust 2025: We've taken another sweep to ensure our picks are still accurate and added a few more notes to our FAQ section.June 2025: We’ve made a few minor edits to reflect the announcement of Apple’s latest iPadOS update, which we detail above.AdvertisementAdvertisementMay 2025: We’ve lightly edited this guide to ensure all details and links are still correct.
