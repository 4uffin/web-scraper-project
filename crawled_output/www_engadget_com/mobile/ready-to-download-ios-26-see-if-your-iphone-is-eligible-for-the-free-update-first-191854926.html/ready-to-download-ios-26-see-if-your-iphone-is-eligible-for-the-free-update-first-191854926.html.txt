And, of course, you won't be able to access the latest features iOS 26 offers.Should I upgrade to iOS 18.7 or iOS 26?When you first open Software Update in Settings, you'll notice two different upgrade options: iOS 18.7 and iOS 26.

It also gives you more time to wait for Apple to take care of any bugs on the new OS.However, if you're excited to finally have the Liquid Glass aesthetic on your phone and use all the new features iOS 26 has to offer, go ahead and install that one. After all, Apple had all summer to weed through the most problematic bugs during its beta phase and usually releases a new update shortly after the initial launch.iOS 26 features to try out firstLiquid Glass design: Your home screen is getting revamped with new app icons, including dark mode and all-clear options. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass, in Apple's terms, was designed to make all of the company's operating systems more visually cohesive.AdvertisementAdvertisementPhone app redesign: You can finally scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.Live Translate: iOS 26 brings the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.Polls feature: Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members can now create polls.
