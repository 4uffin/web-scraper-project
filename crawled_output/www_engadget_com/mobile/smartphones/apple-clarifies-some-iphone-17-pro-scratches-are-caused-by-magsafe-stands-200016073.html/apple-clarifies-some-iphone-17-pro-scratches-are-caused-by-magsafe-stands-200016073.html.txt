Bloomberg reported on September 19 that in-store iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro were already showing scratches, including circular marks from where the phones mounted on MagSafe stands. Now Apple tells 9to5Mac those marks aren't scratches but rather "material transfer" from the stands to the body of the phone.Apple's explanation suggests that simply cleaning demo iPhone 17 Pro units and replacing old MagSafe stands will prevent those markings from happening in the future. That doesn't account for the scratches some iPhone 17 Pro owners have noticed around the phone's camera bump, though. In a recent scratch test video, YouTuber JerryRigEverything speculated that Apple's decision to not add a chamfer or fillet to the sides of the iPhone 17 Pro's camera bump left it more prone to damage. Through 9to5Mac, Apple says it designed the Pro's aluminum camera bump in the same way as its other aluminum products and that it's durable, but prone to "small abrasions" over time.So Apple has effectively denied one instance of the iPhone 17 Pro scratching and sidestepped another. Notably, at no point in 9to5Mac's reporting is Apple or a spokesperson actually quoted, though, which might suggest the company isn't ready to stick to a single explanation for the issues some users are dealing with. Engadget has contacted Apple for more information and will update this article if we learn more.Switching from the titanium frame of the iPhone 16 Pro to the unibody aluminum one on the iPhone 17 Pro lets Apple's new phone be both more performant and offer longer battery life. Aluminum does come with a natural drawback, though: It's less scratch-resistant than titanium. It's entirely possible reports of iPhone 17 Pro scratches are just a way to squeeze a few more drops of attention out of Apple's launch, but if the company does have a problem, its choice of material might be the cause.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
