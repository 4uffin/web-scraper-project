As seen in the teardown, the iPhone Air can easily swap batteries, has a modular USB-C port and offers day-one repair guides. Even though the iPhone Air represents Apple's thinnest iPhone ever at 5.6mm, iFixit said the slim design makes repairs "more approachable, not less."Apple kept the same battery design that was introduced with the iPhone 16 lineup, which switched to an electrically released battery adhesive for more consistent replacements. Similarly, you don't have to ever risk damaging the OLED display when swapping an iPhone Air battery, since there's still that dual-entry access allowing you to access it from the back glass.Being a smartphone that emphasizes thinness, Apple had to sacrifice some battery life with the iPhone Air. However, in our review, we found that the iPhone Air was comparable to other models in the iPhone 17 lineup and lasted nearly an entire day in real-world testing. iFixit also discovered that the battery is the same exact one found in the accompanying MagSafe Battery accessory that goes for $99, which iFixit likened to a "spare tire." On top of that, the included battery is encased in metal, making it easier to replace and offering some protection against bending.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
