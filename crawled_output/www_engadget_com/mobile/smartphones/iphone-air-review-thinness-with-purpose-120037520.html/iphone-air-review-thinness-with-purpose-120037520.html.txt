iPhone Air review: Thinness with purposeAs long as you don't mind giving up cameras for thinness, the Air's cool factor is off the charts.Sam RutherfordSenior Writer, ReviewsSam RutherfordSenior Writer, ReviewsUpdated Fri, September 19, 2025 at 1:01 PM UTCAdd Engadget on GoogleAs long as you don't mind the lack of extra cameras, the iPhone Air is the super sleek smartphone Apple fans have dreamed about. (Sam Rutherford for Engadget)The iPhone Air is a device with shorter battery life, fewer cameras and a price tag that’s $200 more than a base iPhone 17. Sure, it’s got a bigger screen and it's unbelievably sleek, but no matter how you slice it, that value proposition doesn’t make sense. At least on paper. That’s because as soon as you hold an iPhone Air, you instantly get a sense that this handset represents much more than a simple quest for thinness. The iPhone Air is a device with a mission: To push the company’s design and engineering further than ever before while doubling down on style. Plus, it’s potentially laying the foundation for something even more radical down the line.Editor's note (on September 19, 9:00AM ET): The iPhone Air is now officially available in retail outlets, and those who have pre-ordered their devices will be receiving them starting today. As you make your decisions on whether or which of these you should buy, make sure to check out our reviews of the iPhone 17, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, as well as the AirPods Pro 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11. We also published a closer look at the Apple Watch Ultra 3’s satellite connectivity feature, which has some impressions of what it’s like to use in real life.What is the iPhone Air?New iPhones generally don't need to be explained, but the Air is a different sort of iPhone. On a purely practical level, it could be viewed as a (very) glowed-up replacement to the iPhone 16 Plus. However, the Air starts at $999, which is $100 more than the launch price of last year's closest Apple equivalent (or $200 more after its recent price drop). Furthermore, the Air has a smaller 6.5-inch display (versus 6.7 inches on the 16 Plus) and only a single rear camera instead of the two you typically get on a base model iPhone. Then, to make things a touch more confusing, the Air has nearly the same A19 Pro chip used in Apple's Pro series this year instead of a regular A19 processor. But most importantly, the Air’s design is unlike any iPhone that's come before it, and it may end up becoming a bridge to Apple's next era of smartphones (while also being irresistibly thin and stylish today).Apple/Engadget86100Expert ScoreApple iPhone AirIt might not be the most affordable iPhone or the one with the most cameras, but for anyone who puts a premium on style and sleekness, the iPhone Air is without a doubt Apple's coolest handset in years. ProsExquisite designSurprisingly good battery lifeGorgeous displayStrong titanium frameConsMono speakerSingle rear cameraNo mmWave 5G support$999 at AppleDesign: Simply stunningEven with the arrival of Samsung's super sleek Galaxy S25 Edge earlier this year, Apple is setting new highs for mobile design with the iPhone Air. Not only is it even skinnier at just 5.6mm (versus 5.8mm for the S25E), it's the best example yet of what I like to call “the sci-fi space pebble look” thanks to its rounded corners and beautifully polished edges. It's a proper marvel of engineering and while I generally don't like saying this, you really do have to hold one to fully appreciate Apple's craftsmanship.AdvertisementAdvertisementDespite its dimensions, the Air isn't all sleekness and no strength. You still get a full IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, while the titanium frame makes the whole handset remarkably sturdy. On top of that, the Air has a screen covered by a new Ceramic Shield 2 panel that also comes with an anti-reflective coating. And while it doesn't completely eliminate glare, it does a good job of preventing annoying bright spots.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAs for the display itself, there's not much to complain about here either. The Air's screen has a peak brightness of 3,000 nits and it has ProMotion support with a refresh rate that varies between 1Hz and 120Hz depending on the situation. But the real impact is that when you put a display this good in a device this thin, sometimes it really does look like someone has ripped a page out of a magazine and made it float in your hand. It's kind of uncanny and I can't get enough. To be fair, Samsung's S25 Edge does produce a similar effect but it isn't quite as pronounced.I also appreciate that Apple still found room for the iPhone's Action button and a flush Camera Control key. Around back, there's subtle sophistication in the way the Air's Ceramic Shield rear panel slopes up gently to create Apple's camera plateau (though I don't love that name). And weighing just 5.82 ounces (165 grams), the Air's heft (or lack thereof) adds even more to its ethereal in-hand feel.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetMy main issue with the Air's design is that it only has a single mono speaker. Granted, it packs a punch both in terms of volume and presence, but after years of stereo sound being the de facto equipment on premium smartphones, one-sided audio doesn't sit quite right. The other potential sore spot is that the Air's USB-C port isn't perfectly centered in the bottom edge. But I fully admit that this is the most minor of nitpicks, and when you consider that due to the Air's thinness Apple had to 3D-print the connector out of titanium (a first for the company), I'm not bothered.Performance: Way better than good enoughCompared to the base iPhone 17, the Air has a more powerful A19 Pro chip. However, unlike the silicon available in the iPhone 17 Pro line, the Air's processor has one fewer GPU core (five instead of six). But even with that small shortfall, the phone was never hurting for speed. Flipping between apps is essentially instantaneous and thanks to the new Liquid Glass visual design in iOS 26, doing so looks better than ever.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetAdvertisementAdvertisementMore intense tasks like gaming didn't do much to slow it down either. Frame rates remained stable in demanding titles like Destiny: Rising while more casual fare like Sword of Convallaria looked effortlessly fluid. The only time the phone seemed mildly taxed was when using tools like Apple's Image Playground. Just watch out if when do you any high performance tasks for a prolonged time, because the the Air can get a bit warm — particularly on its camera bump. Thankfully, in my experience, it never got too hot to touch.Elsewhere, the addition of Apple's new N1 and C1X chips rounds out the package that the company claims makes this the most power-efficient iPhone yet. That's important because without a vapor chamber like on the Pro line, or room for a large battery, the Air doesn't have much leeway for excess heat or power draw. The downside is that Apple's C1X modem doesn't support mmWave 5G. This may not be an issue depending on where you live or what network you're on, but for those demanding peak mobile data speeds, it is something worth considering before upgrading.Camera: Crisp images but is one lens enough?Sam Rutherford for EngadgetThe photos and videos the iPhone Air takes are excellent. But at the end of the day, there still isn't a real replacement for more glass, and with only a single lens in back, Apple's lone 48MP rear camera may be the phone's biggest limitation. In a shot of some homemade cookies, details were sharp and colors were so rich that my mouth was still watering long after the treats were eaten. Same goes for a tricky photo at sunset, where the Air still managed to capture the warmth and subtle tones of the day's fading light. And at night, it kept pace with or even outshot its biggest rivals, including the Pixel 10 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge — like in my image of a local mural and flower in low-light. However, if you're the kind of person who loves a good telephoto shot or the extra field of view an ultra-wide lens provides, the Air's 2x optical quality zoom means you’re out of luck.Impressively, despite only having a single rear camera, the Air still manages to take portrait pics that look practically just as good as those from iPhones with two. Apple says that it reengineered its portrait pipeline to work without the need for stereo cameras for the Air, and it totally works. Now, if you do some serious pixel peeping, you might notice some small discrepancies between the iPhone 17 and the Air on things like flyaway hairs. But in the end, it's nice to see that even without the same number of lenses, there isn't a major drop in quality.In this photo of some homemade cookies, the sharper details and warmer colors of the iPhone Air win out.

However, in front, Apple's Center Stage feature and the Air's new 18MP selfie cam might be the next big photo revolution that other companies will copy soon. By using a square sensor instead of a rectangular one, the phone can flip between wider landscape shots or taller portrait-style pics at a moment's notice. In fact, there's even an auto setting that allows the phone to switch between the two on its own, depending on how many people are in the frame.AdvertisementAdvertisementAs someone who is selfie-averse, the times that I do want to take a photo of my face are usually when I'm standing in front of a big vista and want to capture myself and the scenery. Center Stage lets me do just that without needing to awkwardly turn the phone on its side. Additionally, while the photos you see here were taken with Apple's default “Standard” Photographic Style, I must admit I like the new "Bright" option in iOS 26, which adds just enough pop and color to your photos without going overboard.Battery life and charging: Not a problemThe iPhone Air's emphasis on thinness means there's less room for a big battery, so you might think longevity would be a concern. But in my experience, it's been a complete non-issue. Officially, Apple doesn't provide specs for the size of the power cells in its devices, though the company does state the Air should provide 27 hours of continuous video playback, which is only three less than what you get from a base iPhone 17. That's a drop of just 10 percent and, considering the sleekness of the Air, it's a trade-off I'm happy to make.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetFurthermore, my results generally line up with Apple's numbers. In a streaming video rundown test over Wi-Fi, the iPhone Air lasted 23 hours and 39 minutes — barely an hour less than what I got from a base iPhone 17 (24:45). And in the real world, the Air fared even better than expected. Even on a day with over seven hours of screen on time (which includes running benchmarks and gaming), the phone has 25 percent juice left in the tank. And on lighter days when I'm not working or constantly checking my phone, I often had 40 to 45 percent energy remaining. When it comes to recharging, the Air keeps things simple: a 30-minute charge (either wired or wirelessly) can add 50 percent battery in just 30 minutes.Apple's MagSafe battery pack: The Air's best buddyI don't normally mention peripherals during a review, since I'm not a fan of cases but I can understand wanting extra protection for a $1,000 phone. However, I'd argue that Apple's MagSafe Battery for the iPhone Air may be an essential accessory for folks who like to travel light but don't want to worry about their electronics dying — even if its $99 price tag stings.Sam Rutherford for EngadgetIn keeping with the iPhone Air's design, Apple's power pack is exceedingly slim at just 7.5mm and it snaps neatly onto the back of the device magnetically, so there are no wires to worry about. On its own, recharging tops out at 12 watts. Though if there's a cord lying around, you can boost speeds up to the Air's 20-watt limit. Alternatively, you can also use the pack’s built-in USB-C port to power up any of your other gadgets. And when you need to recharge the portable battery, all you have to do is keep it attached to the iPhone while it’s charging and it will automatically pass through juice as needed.AdvertisementAdvertisementBut my favorite part is that not only does the battery pack refill the iPhone Air, it can recharge the AirPods Pro 3 wirelessly as well. Admittedly, Apple's slim MagSafe Battery doesn't have the biggest capacity at 3,149mAh (which is enough to add an extra 65 percent charge to the phone). So even though you're paying a premium to keep things super thin and breezy, between the handset, the power pack and Apple's latest earbuds, I really appreciate the convenience for what might be the ultimate lightweight travel kit for iPhone faithful.Wrap-upSam Rutherford for EngadgetAdvertisementAdvertisementWhile the iPhone Air's thinness may be its most striking quality, it's abundantly clear that this handset is so much more than that. Not only does this device represent a radical evolution of Apple's design chops, it forced the company's engineers to come up with more power-efficient solutions to make all this possible. And in that respect, the iPhone Air is a massive success. It's sleek, it's fast and it's wildly stylish in a way that both fashionistas and people who just like packing light can appreciate.One interesting wrinkle in all of this is that the true potential of the Air's success might not be truly felt for another year or two. While Apple might not want to say so just yet, I'm willing to bet that this device will also be the template for an upcoming foldable iPhone. You slap two Airs together, connect them with a hinge and a flexible screen and baby you got stew going. That said, for fans of previous Plus models, the Air's increased price, smaller screen and single rear cam certainly aren't ideal. As long as you don't mind the lack of extra lenses, for those who appreciate a powerful but still eminently effervescent mobile companion, the iPhone Air is in another stratosphere.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
