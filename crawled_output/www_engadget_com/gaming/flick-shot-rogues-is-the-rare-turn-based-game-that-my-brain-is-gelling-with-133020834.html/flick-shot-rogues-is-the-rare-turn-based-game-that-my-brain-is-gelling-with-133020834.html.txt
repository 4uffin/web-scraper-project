That's one reason I haven't yet dipped into Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, many people's favorite of the year so far. I'd almost always rather be playing a more action-based game.But after trying the demo for Flick Shot Rogues on a whim during the most recent Steam Next Fest, the game hasn't been far from my thoughts. The debut title from Butter By The Fish, a three-person studio in Germany, arrived on Steam this week. Despite the likes of Hollow Knight: Silksong tugging at my attention, I keep turning back to this pirate-themed, turn-based roguelite.It's a bit like Subbuteo but with crabs, monkeys and lasers. Each level features several enemies on red discs that you have to take out by flicking your character toward them. One hero causes damage when you clatter into enemies, and another will smash every foe within a certain radius after they stop moving. My favorite, the Froggomancer, collects frogs and uses them to attack goons that they slide by or end up next to.You can take a couple of characters into each run (and swap to the other one before your turn) and equip each with a relic. These include fire damage, lightning attacks and sticky bombs. Many of these have chain effects, so you can use them to attack multiple bad guys in one turn. Since this is a roguelite, you'll upgrade your abilities as you go. After the first couple of stages, each level has at least one enemy or boss with a yellow disc. Once you take those out, you beat that wave or level.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementThere are no prizes for guessing that putting together a strong build is a big part of this game. In one run, I tripled up on a trinket that gave me a 50 percent attack boost (so 150 percent extra damage) when I had full shields, making the first shot of each round all the more important.Flick Shot Rogues echoes one of my favorite games of 2023, Subpar Pool. I played quite a bit of snooker and pool growing up, and I always enjoyed figuring out the angle and power of my shot — executing it successfully was an entirely different matter. Being able to replicate that here is one reason why I'm digging this game so much.You can see where your character will end up after hitting a wall or enemy to help you better plan your turn. So, for once in a video game, I'm slowing down and taking more time to actually consider the consequences of my actions before doing anything.The tactility of slamming my character's disc into enemies and causing a killer chain reaction helps make Flick Shot Rogues feel more active and engaging to me than many other turn-based games I've tried. Each runs can take up to an hour or so, but they don't feel anything like that long.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementI do wish the game did a better job of communicating the enemies' next moves and how their attacks work. It's not clear to me, for instance, when a yellow-disc enemy is about to teleport to the other side of a level. You'll often get an indicator of what your foes are about to do, but not every time. That makes it a little more difficult to decide whether to attack, make a defensive move or reposition for a better angle on my next turn.But still, I keep coming back for more. Launching a barrage of fire-inducing frogs after squeezing through a narrow gap on a bank shot is pretty fun. I'm looking forward to finding out what other characters, relics and enhancements can do.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
