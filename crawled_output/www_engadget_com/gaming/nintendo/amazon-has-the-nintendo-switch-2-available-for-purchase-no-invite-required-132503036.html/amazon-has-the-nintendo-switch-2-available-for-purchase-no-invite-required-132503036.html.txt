Amazon has the Nintendo Switch 2 available for purchase, no invite requiredBoth the stand-alone console and the Mario Kart World bundle are available.Andre RevillaContributing ReporterAndre RevillaContributing ReporterUpdated Mon, September 22, 2025 at 1:05 PM UTCAdd Engadget on GoogleSam Rutherford for EngadgetWhile it was difficult to get your hands on a Nintendo Switch 2 back in June when it first became available, that's no longer the case. It just got even easier now that Amazon has the console listed for sale, with no invitation required. The handhelds have been selling at a blistering pace, with just under 6 million units sold in the first four weeks.Online inventories in those initial weeks sold out in a flash, and sparse restocks were gone just as quickly. Amazon was left out of the initial pre-order process and didn't list the console at all until over a month after its release. This conspicuous absence may have been due to Nintendo's frustration with third-party sellers undercutting the company's own pricing for games on the site.Nintendo Switch 2$449See at AmazonWe really loved the Nintendo Switch 2 in our hands-on review, and thought it was a great follow-up to the 2017 console that launched a handheld renaissance. We gave the Switch 2 a score of 93 out of 100, and were particularly impressed with its larger 7-9-inch LCD screen, the magnetic Joy-Cons, better base storage and, of course, significantly improved performance over the original. The pricing is a bit steep, the battery life could be better and the dock could more USB-C ports, but aside from those details the Switch 2 is almost perfect.AdvertisementAdvertisementIf you've been waiting to pick up a Nintendo Switch 2 without having to go on a scavenger hunt, then the Amazon listing should be a welcome option. The months since release have also seen a great selection of Switch 2 ports and exclusive games hit the market. Amazon's listing offers the standalone console for $449 or the Mario Kart World bundle for $499. Sales are limited to one unit per customer.Follow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBUYING GUIDESContributeComment guidelinesSupportBUYING GUIDESFollow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
