The early access version will feature 10 playable characters, with more coming down the line.For the uninitiated, this is a 2 vs. 2 tag-based fighting game that's somewhat similar to the Marvel vs. Capcom series. Folks can play solo or recruit friends as tag partners. Riot promises the game will feature a "high level of depth and mastery."AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement2XKO has already experienced a bit of controversy, as LoL fans have found the game's name somewhat difficult to pronounce.
