The publisher says the "Annapurna Interactive Direct from Tokyo" will stream on YouTube and feature new games from Kyoto-based developer Marumittu Games, Iridium Studios and Yarn Owl. Annapurna Interactive held its previous games showcase this past February to show off games like Skin Deep and Wheel World.Marumittu Games' Annapurna project was initially detailed in 2023 when the publisher announced it was working with the studio. At the time, Marumittu said it was pulling from the work of journalist Rutger Bregman and Homo Deus author Yuval Noah Harari to make a game that's "thinking about humanity in the future." Developer Yarn Owl similarly teased its project a year earlier in 2022, saying that it was inspired by The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Annapurna Interactive hasn't formally announced its partnership with Iridium Studios, but the developer does list its next game as "an unannounced RPG with an unannounced partner" on its website, which certainly sounds like it could be what Annapurna plans to show off at its showcase.Despite what seems like a fairly normal past year of game releases, the future and long-term stability of Annapurna Interactive has been in question since the mass-resignation of the publisher's staff in 2024. Since then, Annapurna Interactive has continued to announce and release games, while the publisher's former staff spun up a new publisher to support in-development projects from Take-Two's shuttered indie label, Private Division.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
