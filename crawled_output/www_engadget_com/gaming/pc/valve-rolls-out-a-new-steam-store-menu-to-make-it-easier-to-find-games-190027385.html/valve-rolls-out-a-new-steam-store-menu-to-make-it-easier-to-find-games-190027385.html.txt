This redesign is available for the standard Steam PC client, the Steam Deck and Steam Mobile.The big news here is that the update makes it easier to find stuff you want to play, which is a good move given the clutter of the current Steam store. Everything has been streamlined, with a new search menu existing up top. This search menu includes options for top sellers, new releases, discounted games and more. These criteria were already available, but all options are now grouped together in a nice and colorful menu.The new "Categories" pull-down menu provides a more tailored feed, as it snags content from your top genres and offers suggested tags to find similar games.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementValve says the pre-existing search bar has gotten some upgrades underneath the hood. It can now offer suggestions based on common searches and can bring up a list of games you've recently searched for."With these changes, we’re aiming to make your experience smoother and more tailored to your needs," Steam wrote in a blog post back in July. "We've been hearing from players, and experiencing ourselves, that some of the most commonly visited areas of Steam were hard to get to."The store update is rolling out now, so check your preferred Steam client to get started. It might be time to start clearing out that long-neglected wishlist.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
