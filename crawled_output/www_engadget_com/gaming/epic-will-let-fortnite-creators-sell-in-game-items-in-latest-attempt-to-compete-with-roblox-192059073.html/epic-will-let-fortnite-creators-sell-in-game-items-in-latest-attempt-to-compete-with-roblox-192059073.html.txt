Epic says developers will soon have the ability to make and sell in-game items in Fortnite, and earn a cut of the V-Bucks users spend to buy them. Previously, developers only earned money through Fortnite based on the amount of time users spent on their "islands," the in-game name for third-party experiences creators can offer through Fortnite.Developers will be able to create their consumable and durable in-game items using soon-to-be-released tools in Unreal Editor for Fortnite and a new "Verse-based API," according to Epic. The company also plans to be generous with the revenue split its offering, at least at first. Developers "will ordinarily earn 50 percent of the V-Bucks value from sales in their islands," but from December 2025 through the end of 2026, they'll get to keep 100 percent.Epic says its 50 percent cut — notably more than the 30 percent popularized by Apple's App Store — is to help "contribute to server hosting costs, safety and moderation costs, R&D and other operating expenses" of running Fortnite. It's also a make-good of sorts, since Epic claims it's been "investing and operating the business at a loss."AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementHow much 100 percent or 50 percent of "V-Bucks value" actually equals in real money unfortunately isn't as simple as converting Fortnite's digital currency to dollars, though. Epic offers the following explanation for how it calculates V-Bucks value:To determine the V-Bucks value in US dollars in a given month, we take all customer real-money spending to purchase V-Bucks (converted to US Dollars), subtract platform and store fees (ranging from 12 percent on Epic Games Store to 30 percent on current consoles), and divide it by the total V-Bucks spent by players. Fortnite's average platform and store fees are currently 26 percent (with specific fees ranging from 12 percent on the Epic Games Store to 30 percent on console platforms). So, 50 percent of V-Bucks value translates to ~37 percent of retail spending, and 100 percent of V-Bucks value translates to ~74 percent.EpicAlongside the new ability to create in-game items, Epic says Fortnite developers will be able to pay to be featured in a new "Sponsored row" inside Fortnite's Discover feed. And to better engage new and returning players, developers are also getting access to new tools for creating community forums and sharing updates on their islands.All of these changes are in service of further extending Fortnite's ability to act as a platform for games and social experiences, rather than just a battle royale game (with racing, rhythm game and LEGO spin-offs). Epic clearly wants Fortnite to be Roblox, and reap the benefits of having an active community of adult and child users creating experiences for its platform. Cultivating that audience has led to all sorts of child safety problems for Roblox, but Epic clearly views the risks to be worth it.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
