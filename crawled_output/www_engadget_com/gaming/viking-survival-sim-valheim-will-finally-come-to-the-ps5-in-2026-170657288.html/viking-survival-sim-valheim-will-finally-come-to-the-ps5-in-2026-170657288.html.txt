The year is all we got, as developer Iron Gate AB didn't announce an actual release date. Still, it's better than nothing.We do know that the PS5 version will feature full crossplay with all other platforms, so that's good. Piktiv, a company that regularly assists Iron Gate with Valheim stuff, is working on the port so the main development team can focus its efforts on updates and DLC drops. To that end, there's a massive expansion coming called Deep North that introduces a new biome.For the uninitiated, Valheim is a popular survival sim based on Norse mythology with a strong emphasis on cooperative play. Players team up to hunt, build bases, explore and take down bosses.It first popped up on Steam as an early access title at the beginning of 2021, where it became a bona-fide sensation.
