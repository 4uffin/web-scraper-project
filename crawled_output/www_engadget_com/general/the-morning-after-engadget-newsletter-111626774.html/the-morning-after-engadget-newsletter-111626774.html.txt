Oh, another fun find: iFixit discovered the iPhone Air’s battery is the same cell found in the accompanying MagSafe Battery accessory. iFixit likened it to a “spare tire.”AdvertisementAdvertisementContinue reading.Watch the new trailer for Disney’s The Mandalorian and GroguDouble billing now.DisneyThe Mandalorian and Grogu follows on from the events of Disney+ series The Mandalorian — a show that director Jon Favreau created — and the fall of the Empire in Return of the Jedi.
