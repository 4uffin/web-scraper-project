The newly revived company — which now acts as a NFT music marketplace rather than a file-sharing service — bought the rights for $245,000 in an eBay auction, The New York Times reports. A separate plan to use the Fyre Festival name to launch a new music streaming service was announced in April 2025."Fyre became a symbol of hype gone wrong, but it also made history," LimeWire CEO Julian Zehetmayr shared in a press release. "We're not bringing the festival back — we’re bringing the brand and the meme back to life. This time with real experiences, and without the cheese sandwiches."It sounds like LimeWire might want to turn Fyre Festival into a physical perk of the digital collectibles it sells through its NFT marketplace. The company is planning to reveal "a reimagined vision for Fyre" in the coming months that "expands beyond the digital realm and taps into real-world experiences, community and surprise." During the height of their popularity, NFTs were frequently sold as memberships to exclusive communities and events, so if that's the tack LimeWire takes, it wouldn't be a particularly original one.Of course, originality might not be the goal when a key strategy for your company is apparently acquiring and reinventing old brands. LimeWire's bet seems to be that the name recognition of buying a musician's NFT from LimeWire or attending a Fyre Festival event and not getting stranded in The Bahamas will be enough for some people.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
