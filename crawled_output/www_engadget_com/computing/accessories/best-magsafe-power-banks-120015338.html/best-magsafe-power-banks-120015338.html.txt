The best MagSafe power banks for your iPhoneSticky power on the go.Amy SkorheimSenior Reporter, Buying AdviceAmy SkorheimSenior Reporter, Buying AdviceUpdated Fri, September 19, 2025 at 9:01 AM UTCAdd Engadget on GoogleAmy Skorheim for EngadgetAs smartphones get thinner, their batteries necessarily get smaller — but all phones, includingiPhones, like to die at inopportune moments. The best MagSafe power bank can provide extra juice when you need it, no cables required. And, thanks to new charging standards, charge-ups are quicker.I’ve been testing power banks for Engadget for around three years and have watched portable chargers get more efficient in real time. After testing around a dozen magnetic banks, I think Anker’s Qi2 MagGo 10K power bank is the best MagSafe power bank. But you’ll also find a budget option, a Qi2 25W pick and an ultra-slim model (which we think is better than Apple’s own iPhone Air MagSafe battery).Quick OverviewBest MagSafe power bank overallAnker MagGo Qi2 Power BankMore options$70 at AmazonBest Qi2 25W MagSafe BatteryUgreen MagFlow 10,000mAh Power Bank, Qi2 25W$70 at AmazonBest slim MagSafe power bankAnker Nano 5K MagGo Slim power bank$46 at AmazonBest budget MagSafe power bankIniu P73 10K power bank$40 at AmazonThe best MagSafe power banks for 2025Amy Skorheim for EngadgetBest MagSafe power bank overallAnker MagGo Qi2 Power BankSpecs: 10,000mAh capacity, Qi2 certified, display, stand, USB-C port Who is this for? The person who never remembers to charge their phone overnight. Anker’s MagGo power bank was one of the first Qi2-certified products to come to market — and it’s still one of the most well-rounded MagSafe banks you can get. It charged an iPhone 15 from 5 percent to 60 percent in a little over 45 minutes. It took under two and a half hours to get the phone from near-dead to full, and it had enough power left over for an additional 70-percent refill. A small display tells you just how much charge remains (and how long until it’s full when you’re recharging the battery). The kickstand is sturdy so you can use the phone hands-free in portrait mode, or you can twist the phone to watch something in landscape orientation. Like many Anker products we’ve tried, it has a sturdy build and a clean aesthetic. Plus, it comes in purple, blue and green in addition to the standard (and comparatively boring) black and white. Though it’s on the pricier end of the battery pack spectrum at $90, it’s often on sale for $70 and has sold for as little as $50 on Amazon.

The person who wants the latest charging tech for their iPhone 17. Ugreen was the first to market with a Qi2 25W-certified power bank with its MagFlow 10K brick. Belkin and Anker have debuted their stationary charging accessories and we’ll likely see portable chargers from them and others soon. As I don’t have an iPhone 17 yet and the public version of iOS 26 wasn’t available for my iPhone 16 at the time of testing, I didn’t get the fastest possible speeds out of the bank — but it was still a solid performer with plenty of perks. It charged an iPhone 15 from near-dead to 50 percent in around 45 minutes and it’s got a display to tell you about how much charge the bank has left, which I found to be pretty accurate. Its attached USB-C cable doubles as a handle and the overall design feels premium. At 10,000mAh, it’s got enough capacity for a refill and a half for a standard iPhone. That also makes it a little bulky, but not so much that you can’t use the phone as it charges. There’s also no built-in stand so it’s more awkward to watch while you charge with this one.

The minimalist; the person who wants their power bank to blend in. iPhones are sleek and slim — if you want the same from your portable charger, Anker’s new Nano 5K MagGo Slim is a good pick. It’s one of the thinnest chargers I’ve ever tested and has a nice, smooth matte texture. Since it’s thinner and a little wider than many battery packs, it’s ideally proportioned for a standard iPhone, stretching edge-to-edge on the back and sitting just below the camera. That makes it easy to grip your phone and use it as it recharges. There’s no stand, strap, screen or any other extras, but that’s the point with a minimalist accessory like this. It took an iPhone 15 from 5 percent to 90 percent in about two and a half hours. Like all power banks, it slowed down significantly after the pack was half drained, so it’s worth noting that it charged the phone to 40 percent in less than an hour.

The person who wants the most charge for the lowest price. This is the first product from Iniu that I’ve tested and I was impressed by both the features and the value. The P73 10K Magnetic Power Bank managed to get an iPhone 15 from five percent to full in around two hours and fifteen minutes. It had enough left over to deliver another impressive 90 percentage points to the iPhone in round two — that’s actually a slightly better performance than our top Anker pick. As it’s the first of its kind, I’m not as certain of the bank’s long-term reliability (like I am with Anker batteries), but so far, Iniu seems pretty capable. Instead of a display on the bank, the remaining power is indicated with a cute, lit puppy paw. The lights on the toe pads and center pad disappear as the battery discharges; it's a cute variation on regular LEDs. The stand at the bottom works in either landscape or portrait mode, but the strap gets in the way when it’s in the latter position. Speaking of the strap, it’s not just a handy way to grab the bank — it’s also a detachable USB-C cable. That may come in handy when it’s time to recharge the pack or you want to lend some charge to another device. ProsGreat capacity for the priceIncludes a standAttached strap doubles as a short USB-C cableConsStrap gets in the way of the stand$40 at AmazonWhat to consider before buying a MagSafe power bankChoose the right capacity. Most portable MagSafe chargers have either a 5,000 milliamp hour (mAh) or 10,000mAh capacity. Obviously, the larger capacity batteries are physically bigger, but thanks to an iPhone’s magnetic attachment points, you can still use the phone comfortably as it charges. If you’re worried about overall bulk, you may prefer the slimness of a 5,000mAh battery.Just note that a 5K battery pack won’t deliver its entire capacity to your phone due to energy loss from voltage conversion and heat dissipation. Over the years, I’ve measured around a 60-percent delivery rate for wireless banks. For example, that means an iPhone 16 with its 3,561mAh battery will get about 85 to 90 percentage points from a 5K battery. A 10K bank will charge that same phone fully once, with enough for a 50- to 60-percent boost next time.AdvertisementAdvertisementUnderstand MagSafe versus Qi2. All iPhones model 12 and later have MagSafe technology, which rely on embedded magnets to align the phone with a wireless charger and can support charging speeds of up to 15 watts. The MagSafe name is owned by Apple — third-party chargers can’t freely use the term and instead call their accessories “magnetic,” or apply a branded name like Anker’s MagGo or UGreen’s MagFlow. Be sure to check the product details before buying: anything that works with Apple’s technology will be listed as MagSafe-compatible.Qi2 is a standard from the Wireless Power Consortium (of which Apple is a member) and has the same stipulations as MagSafe (15W charging and magnetic alignment). Any company can submit their tech for this certification. iPhones 13 and later are Qi2 compatible.The newest standard is Qi2 25W and bumps wireless charging speeds up to 25W. The WPC says a certified smartphone using a certified charger can wirelessly go from dead to half full in about 30 minutes (keep in mind that both the charger and phone need to be certified to get those speeds).Accessories, like power banks that support the new standard are starting to hit shelves now. As for phones, Google’s Pixel 10 Pro XL, Apple’s iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max all support the standard as well. iPhone 16 models (except the 16e) will likely support the standard after an update to iOS 26.AdvertisementAdvertisementRemember travel restrictions. You may have seen news reports of flights being grounded because a power bank caught fire in the cabin. Currently, the TSA allows them in your carry-on luggage as long as they’re rated at 100 watt-hours or lower (about 27,000mAh for lithium ion batteries).But some airlines have enacted further restrictions. Southwest, for example, requires you to keep power banks out of the bag and visible while charging. Even if your airline doesn’t make such demands, keeping a power brick out in the open while it’s in use is a good idea — it’ll keep it cooler and you’ll be more likely to notice if it starts to overheat. Most, if not all, MagSafe battery packs come in at under the 100-watt-hour limit, so traveling should be easy with one.Consider the extra features. You may not need them, but the little extra perks of a MagSafe power bank can come in handy. Some have stands so you can watch your phone while it refills. Some have LED displays that tell you how much charge is left, which can be a little more precise than the lighted pips other banks use. Some also have straps to make the bank easier to carry around or fish out of your bag.What about the iPhone Air MagSafe Battery?When Apple introduced the iPhone Air, it announced the new $99 iPhone Air MagSafe Battery in the same breath. It’s now the only Apple-branded MagSafe power bank — but it only works with the iPhone Air. A quick peek at the shape of the battery will clue you in as to why: the Air is the only model with a camera array that allows the battery to attach.AdvertisementAdvertisementWe think Anker’s Nano MagGo Slim is a better bet. It has the same minimalist look and pocketable thinness, but it’ll attach to other phones in addition to the Air. Plus it’s $35 cheaper and, judging from the size and specs, Anker’s bank is likely higher capacity (Apple doesn’t list the battery’s size).Other MagSafe batteries we testedBelkin BoostCharge Pro 10KBelkin’s BoostCharge Pro is Qi2-certified and was only a touch slower than other models in terms of charging speeds, boosting an iPhone 15 from 5 percent to full in about two and a half hours. The feel is premium and the stand is sturdy, but it got quite hot during charging, took overly long to refill itself and is pricer and a bit bulkier than similar models.Baseus Picogo 5KThe Picogo 5K from Baseus is teensy but still packs a stand and a 5,000mAh capacity. It’s Qi2-certified and delivered a 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. The slim slab of the Anker Nano battery is sleeker. But that one doesn’t have a stand — so if you want to prop up your phone while it charges, go for this one.MagSafe power banks FAQsWhat does MagSafe do?MagSafe is Apple’s own technology that supports up to 25W wireless charging speeds and incorporates embedded magnets to align the phone with chargers and other accessories.Which iPhones support MagSafe?iPhones 12 and later support 15W MagSafe technology, though only iPhones 13 and later can reach the 15W charging speed with third-party Qi2 accessories. The iPhone 12 maxes out at 7.5W with non-Apple accessories.AdvertisementAdvertisementThe new iPhone 17, 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max support up to 25W charging speeds with Qi2 25W-certified chargers. iPhone 16, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max should also support those speeds after an update to iOS 26. The iPhone Air supports MagSafe charging at a max speed of 20W.Can you use MagSafe batteries with a case?In most cases (heh), yes. The wireless charge can travel across a distance of a few millimeters. If the case is more than 5mm thick or contains metal components, the wireless charge can be blocked. Many iPhone cases are marketed as MagSafe-compatible, which means the case itself has complimentary magnets inside and should not interfere with charging accessories. We tested a MagSafe power bank on an iPhone 15 with and without a MagSafe case and got the same charging speeds and amounts in both tests.How much power do MagSafe batteries provide?That depends on the power bank. If it is Qi2-certified, it can provide up to 15 watts of wireless power. Qi2 25W-enabled chargers can deliver up to 25 watts to a compatible handset. Non-Qi2 batteries typically deliver around 7.5 watts.The amount of charge delivered depends on the capacity. Most MagSafe portable chargers are rated at 5,000mAh or 10,000mAh. The former can get a standard iPhone 15 from five percent to around 90 percent. The latter can fill the phone completely with enough left over for another half charge.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
