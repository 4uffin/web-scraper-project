The company says it can use "light from any light source to stay charged and ready to use" and that you can use it in complete darkness for up to four months once it's fully charged. As long as the light source reaches 200 lux in brightness, which is considered dim lighting during daytime, it can charge the keyboard. "Even the need to think about charging can be a distraction, so we designed Signature Slim Solar+ to take that off your plate completely," said Art O'Gnimh, the General Manager of Core Products Group at Logitech.You don't have to think about plugging the keyboard in or changing its battery: It's powered by a rechargeable battery that Logitech says can last up to 10 years. But if it does malfunction, the company told The Verge that you can replace it on your own, because it's encased in plastic and is sold by iFixit. The keyboard absorbs light through a strip above the keys themselves, which use a scissor-switch mechanism and are in a full-size layout with a separate number pad. It's compatible with multiple operating systems, and you can link it with up to three multi-OS devices and jump from one to the other with its Easy-Switch keys. If you use the Logi Options+ app, you can program its action key to automate simple tasks and to customize its AI launch key to instantly fire up the AI chatbot of your choice.The Signature Slim Solar+ K980 is now available for $100. Logitech is also selling a business variant with a USB-C receiver for $110 and a North America-exclusive model with a layout specifically for Mac for $110.If you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow UsÂ© 2025 Yahoo.
