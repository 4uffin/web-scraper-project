The best power banks and portable chargers for every device in 2025Never run out of juice again, no matter where you are with these best portable battery chargers.Amy SkorheimSenior Reporter, Buying AdviceAmy SkorheimSenior Reporter, Buying AdviceUpdated Wed, August 6, 2025 at 7:00 AM UTCAdd Engadget on GoogleEngadgetTo find the best power bank out there, I tested around 50 portable chargers and batteries from big brands — Anker, Belkin, UGreen, Mophie — as well as some smaller players like Lion Energy, Nimble and Satechi. I used them to recharge a number of devices including iPhones, Galaxy phones, an iPad, a MacBook and even my ereaders and PlayStation controller. If you just want a brick that can charge anything, go for Anker’s 25kmAh Laptop Power bank. It has two built-in USB-C cables, a massive capacity and super fast charging speeds. But if that’s not quite what you’re looking for, you can check out ten more of the best power banks below.Editor’s note: Anker recently issued two recalls, one for its PowerCore 10000 power bank (model A1263) and another for multiple power banks (model numbers A1647, A1652, A1257, A1681 and A1689). All recalls are due to a potential fire risk in the lithium-ion cells. If you have one of these batteries, visit Anker’s recall page for the next steps. None of the batteries we currently recommend are part of the recall, and we haven’t recommended these specific models in previous iterations of this guide.Quick OverviewBest power bank for iPhonesAnker MagGo Power Bank (10K)

Capacity: 10,000mAh | Maximum Output: 15W (wireless) | Ports: One USB-C in/out | Included cable: USB-C to USB-C | Number of charges iPhone 15: 1.64 | Charge time iPhone: 4 to 100% in 2h 26m and 0 to 70% in 1h 8m  Anker’s MagGo Power Bank was one of the first Qi2-certified products to come on the market, and the new standard has made the brand’s popular MagSafe/kickstand model much faster. It's easily the best MagSafe battery I've tested.  It brought an iPhone 15 from near-dead to half-full in about 45 minutes. For reference, it took our former top pick in this category an hour and a half to do the same. It’s similarly faster than Anker’s previous generation of this model, the 633, as well. After that initial refill, the MagGo 10K had enough left over to get the phone up to 70 percent on a subsequent charge. In addition to faster charging speeds, this Anker power bank adds a LCD display to indicate the battery percentage left in the bank, plus the approximate amount of time before it’s full (when it’s refilling) or empty (when it's doing the charging). A strong MagSafe connection makes it easy to use the phone while it charges and the small kickstand creates a surprisingly sturdy base for watching videos and the like. If you twist the phone to landscape, StandBy mode kicks in. The power bank did a fine job of charging our Galaxy S23 Ultra, but the lack of support for Qi2, even on the newest Galaxies and Pixels, means the most popular Android will simply charge at a slower rate — and won't benefit from the zero-effort magnetic alignment. There’s also a USB-C port for recharging, so if you need to fill up something without wireless capabilities, you can.

It’s the exact size and shape of the lipstick case my grandma used to carry and has a built-in USB-C connector that folds down when you’re not using it. That means that, in addition to being ultra-portable, you also don’t need to remember to grab a charging cable when you toss it in your bag. There’s also a built-in USB-C port that can refill the battery or be used to fill up a different device with an adapter cable. You also get four indicator lights that let you know how much charge remains in the battery. In my testing, the 5,000mAh battery provided enough charge to get a depleted Galaxy S23 Ultra back up to 65 percent in about an hour. That’s relatively quick, but the Nano is also small enough that, with an adequately sturdy connection, you can use your phone while it’s charging without feeling too awkward. The charger’s small size also makes it a good pick for recharging earbuds. For a little more juice and an equally clever design, Anker’s 30W Nano Power Bank is a good option for delivering a single charge. It’s bigger in size and capacity (10,000mAh) and includes a display indicating the remaining charge percentage. The built-in USB-C cable doubles as a carry handle, which is a nice touch. That cable is in/out and there’s another USB-C in-out port in addition to an out-only USB-A port. ProsVery portableAffordableConsSmall enough to get misplaced$24 at AmazonPhoto by Amy Skorheim / EngadgetBest low-capacity power bankAnker 10K Fusion Capacity: 10,000mAh | Maximum Output: 30W | Ports: One USB-C in/out port, one USB-C in/out cable, wall prongs | Cable: Built-in USB-C | Number of charges iPhone 15: 1.86 | Charge time iPhone: 5 to 100% 1h 53m and 5 to 91% 1h 5m | Number of charges Galaxy S23 Ultra: 1.45 | Charge time Galaxy: 5 to 100% 1h 2m, 5% to 50% 23m The toughest thing about using a power bank is remembering to bring it along. You also have to remember a cable and, if you want to refill the bank itself, a wall adapter. Anker’s 10K Fusion solves two of those problems with its attached USB-C cable for your device and foldable two-prong plug for charging the bank itself (yes, you still have to remember to bring the thing with you). Despite the attachments, it’s compact, just a smidge wider than a stick of butter, yet still packs a 10,000 mAh capacity. The 30 watts of power enabled the “Super Fast Charging” message on a Galaxy S23 android phone and got it from five percent to full in just over an hour. In just 20 minutes, the 10K Fusion bumped a near-dead iPhone 15 to 45 percent. Though it slowed down towards the end of the Apple handset's charge.  There’s an additional USB-C port for charging devices that may require a different cable and both it and the built-in connector can be used to refill the power bank. The cable makes a neat loop that looks a lot like a handle, though I’m not sure I’d recommend carrying around any bit of tech by its cord. The onboard display indicates the Fusion’s remaining charge in terms of a percentage and was one of the more accurate readouts I’ve tested. I also like the corduroy texture along the sides — very fidget-worthy. Our previous pick in this low-capacity category, the BioLite Charge 40 PD, is still an excellent choice — it’s durable, delivers a quick charge and looks cool. I use it often myself. Plus BioLite has an admirable mission of bringing energy to places where it’s otherwise scarce. But Anker’s new release, the 10K Fusion simply delivers a faster charge and more features at a lower price. ProsHas a built-in USB-C cableAlso has built-in wall prongsDisplay is fairly accurateAffordableConsiPhone charging is slower than other banks in its range$45 at AmazonAmy Skorheim for EngadgetBest medium capacity power bankBelkin BoostCharge 20K with Integrated CableCapacity: 20,000mAh | Maximum output: 30W | Ports: One built-in USB-C in/out cable, one USB-A port, one USB-C port | Cable: USB-C | Number of charges iPhone 15: 3 - 3.5 | Charge time iPhone: 5 to 100% in 2h 6m | Number of charges Galaxy S23 Ultra: 2.5 - 3 | Charge time S23 Ultra: 1h 15m An integrated cable seems to be the hot new feature in portable chargers — and I’m all for it. I can remember times when I’ve had a dead phone and power bank, and no way to connect the two. The Belkin Boost Charge 20K with Integrated Cable is the latest such bank I’ve tested and also one of the more affordable examples. It can output a maximum of 30 watts, which doesn’t make it the fastest charger around, but it wasn’t a slouch. It charged a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra from near-dead to full in an hour and 15 minutes and bumped an iPhone 15 from five to 87 percent in just over an hour. And the 20,000mAh capacity means it can achieve those numbers around three times over. In addition to the built-in (and conveniently magnetized) USB-C cable, there are two other ports: an out-only USB-A and an in/out Type C. That means you can technically charge three devices at the same time, but just note that the amount of charge and the time it takes for things to refill will both take a hit. There’s no digital screen to tell you how much charge remains in the battery, just four indicator LEDs. I’ve certainly found display readouts to be helpful in determining just how much more juice I can squeeze out of a battery, but the lighted pips here are accurate and still useful. While color options probably won’t make or break your battery pack purchase, I appreciate that the BoostCharge 20K comes in something other than standard black. You can of course get it in that shade, but also in blue, pink or white. The pink of my tester unit was pale and pretty and the matte finish does a good job of staying clean — some black smudges from who knows what in my bag came off easily with some rubbing alcohol.

That’s faster than every other battery I tested except for Anker’s 737, our high capacity pick — and that model costs $30 more. It lent nearly three full charges to both an iPhone and Galaxy device and has enough juice to refill an iPad more than once. The battery pack itself also re-ups from the wall noticeably faster than other models, so it’ll get you out the door quicker. The company, Nimble, is a certified B-Corp, meaning they aim for higher environmental and social standards and verify their efforts through independent testing. The Champ Pro uses 90 percent post-consumer plastic and comes in packaging made from paper scrap with a bag for shipping back your old battery (or other tech) for recycling. The unit itself feels sturdy and has a compact shape that’s a little narrower than a smartphone and about as long. The attached adjustable lanyard is cute, if a little superfluous, and the marbled effect from the recycled plastics give it a nice aesthetic. You can charge devices from both USB-C ports simultaneously, and both are input/output plugs. My only qualm was with the four indicator lights. On a second testing round, it dropped down to just one remaining pip, yet went on to deliver a full fill-up plus an additional top off after that. That said, I’m glad the indicator lights under-estimated the remaining charge rather than the other way around, and the accuracy seemed to improve after subsequent depletions and refills.

I recently put together a guide to those high-capacity portable chargers and Lion Energy’s Eclipse Mag made the cut as the best option for traveling with your laptop — but it’s also great for smaller devices. The selling point here is supposed to be the three wireless charging pads on its topside, but I found its wired performance to be even more impressive. The 27,000mAh battery translates to about 100 watt hours, aka the TSA’s largest approved capacity for travel. It’s more compact than other 27K batteries, though at two pounds and 8.5 inches long, it’s hardly small. The soft-touch plastic on the exterior is thicker at the angled-off corners, which makes it feel like it could handle a tumble — Lion Energy doesn’t list any sort of mil spec or other ratings for drop endurance so I didn’t subject the tester unit to any rough handling. Measuring the recharge time of the batteries from the wall isn’t one of the metrics I usually test, but Lion Energy claims a 90 minute refill and my experience lines up with that. It refilled our iPhone 15 five and a half times and the Galaxy S23 Ultra nearly five times. It revived a 16-inch MacBook Pro from 10 percent to 89 percent while it was in use. That works out to about 14 percentage points more than our current command center battery recommendation. The previous pick in this category, Anker’s 737, charged up a Galaxy S22 Ultra slightly faster than the Eclipse Mag refilled a Galaxy S23 Ultra (which have the same battery capacity) but the Eclipse had more charge to give every device. A double-press of the status button enables wireless charging and more than one device can be charged at once. It also supports pass-through charging, so you can have the battery charging from the wall as you charge your device.  Magnets align with an iPhone’s MagSafe circle to position the phone quickly. Finding the sweet spot for the Galaxy phone takes a little adjustment, but was easy enough. It took nearly three hours to fully charge the iPhone 15 from five to 100 percent, but getting it to 87 percent only took two hours. With any portable battery, the charge rate slows significantly as the device approaches 100 percent — and that’s even more noticeable with a wireless portable charger. Lion Energy told me the Eclipse Mag is designed for Apple Watches only. Not surprising given the Pixel Watch 2 doesn’t support wireless charging and Samsung recommends you only use its chargers to refill a Galaxy Watch. My Apple Watch snapped into place easily and started charging right away (after I remembered to double press the button to fire up the wireless pads). There's also a pad for wirelessly recharging your AirPods.  At $149, it’s relatively affordable for a lot of power, particularly given the wireless charging feature. I wish it had more than one USB-C port, but I suppose the wireless pads make up for the lack. Overall, it’s a solid choice for long trips or for working away from an outlet for a day or two.  ProsMassive 27,000mAh capacityQuick charge wired charging timesWireless charging works well for a portable batteryConsLarge and heavyJust one USB-C port$149 at Lion EnergyPhoto by Amy Skorheim / EngadgetBest laptop power bank for laptopsMophie Powerstation Pro AC (2023) 27,000mAh battery Capacity: 27,000mAh | Maximum Output: 140W | Ports: One USB-C in/out, one USB-C out, USB-A, 100W AC | Cable: USB-C to USB-C | Number of charges iPhone 11: 3.75 | Charge time iPhone: 0 to 100% in 1h 40m average and 75% in 46m | Number of charges iPad Air: 2.15 | Charge time iPad: 0 to 100% in 1h 56m and 15% in 19m | Number of charges 16” MacBook Pro: 0.65 | Charge time MBP: 10% to 75% in 1h 29m The TSA’s 100-watt-hour battery limit translates to around 27,000mAh for lithium batteries. Mophie’s Powerstation Pro AC is so massive it necessitates a grab handle and get close to the edge of that max carry-on size. You probably won’t find a larger, acceptable portable power bank — after all, an on-the-go charging brick is pointless if you can’t travel with it. I took this one through security at two airports and no one gave it a second glance. To power your laptop and the rest of your mobile work setup, the Powerstation has four ports. Three of them are the usual USBs, but there’s also a three-prong AC outlet. Most current devices charge via USB (and doing so is more efficient than using a power adapter between the cable and power bank), but older devices and certain mobile workstation accessories — speakers, lights and printers come to mind — might only power up through a basic wall plug. Just be sure to hold down the status button until the light turns red to turn on the AC port. The AC plug powered most small appliances I plugged into it, including a small speaker, an HP printer and various LED lights. The 100 available watts isn’t enough to continuously push a charge through the 140W power adapter that ships with the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but via the USB-C port, it was able to charge that laptop from 10 percent to 75 percent in under 90 minutes. The four lighted LED indicators will tell you when the battery is full. Unfortunately, it’s not the best indicator of when the bank will run out of juice. It charges for quite a while with four and three pips lit up, but then quickly cycles through the last two dots before it dies. So it might be better to just remember how much you’ve used the brick rather than relying too heavily on its indicators. Smaller devices like a smartphone will get numerous charges; I got nearly five refills on an iPhone 11, and two charges and some change on an iPad. The Powerstation Pro AC was even a little faster at both tasks than our previous pick for a mobile command center. That said, this bank is overkill for a simple mobile device fill-up. At 2.6 pounds, it makes the most sense as a power source when you’re working in the field with multiple components. The Lion Energy Trek power bank is pretty similar to the Powerstation Pro AC. It has the same 27,000mAh capacity and three USB ports plus an AC plug. The exterior has a more rugged feel and there’s an LED screen indicating outgoing wattage and remaining charge. Charging times and number of refills was on par with what the Powerstation delivered and the Trek is currently about $30 cheaper too. However, just one of the USB ports is Type-C and the display inaccurately indicated the power bank’s remaining charge, repeatedly saying it had 25 to 35 percent remaining just moments before dying completely. But if those two caveats don’t bother you, this could make a reliable travel companion.

The Anker laptop power bank with built-in cable forgoes any clever naming scheme, but makes sure you’re never left without a way to charge your stuff. It has two attached USB-C cables: one attached to the side of the battery that acts as a carrying cable and another retractable cord that extends up to two feet. Both handle in/out functions so you can use them to refill a device or reup the battery itself. The display tells you the amount of charge remaining in the battery pack as well as the output wattage that’s funnelling towards your devices from each port. When refilling the battery, you can see an estimate of how long it will be until the unit is full. Calculating and displaying info like that takes up a bit of power but, in my testing, the unit outputs the same or a higher amount of charge compared with other 25,000 mAh batteries. It’s an attractive bank, with matte silver exterior and a smaller display area than Anker’s Prime bank (our previous pick for this category). One of my concerns with that battery was the huge display area which was easily scratched. This newer unit feels more durable. This 25,000 mAh model is a great alternative to the 27.5K Prime model, delivering slightly less charge but selling for $80 less as well. It’s also a better deal than Anker's popular Powercore bank, which is the same price as the laptop bank but doesn’t have built-in cables.

It makes sense; water and electrical charges aren’t good companions. The Nestout Portable Charger battery has an IP67 rating, which means it can handle being submerged in water for a number of minutes, and Nestout claims a 30-minute dunk in a meter of water shouldn’t interfere with the battery’s operation. I couldn’t think of a likely scenario where a power bank would spend a half hour in three feet of water, but I could see a backpacker traversing a river and submerging their pack for a few minutes, or a sudden downpour drenching all of their gear. So I tested by dropping the battery in a five gallon bucket of water for five minutes. After drying it off, the unit performed as if it had never been wet. The water resistance comes courtesy of screw-on caps with silicone gaskets that physically keep the water out, so you’ll need to make sure you tighten (but don’t over tighten) the caps whenever you think wetness is in your future. The company also claims the battery lives up to a military-standard shock/drop specification which sounds impressive, but it’s hard to pin down what exactly that means. I figured it should at minimum survive repeated drops from chest height onto a hard surface, and it did. As for charging speeds, it wasn’t quite as quick as our recommendation for a mid-capacity bank. The Belkin charged an iPhone 15 to 80 percent in under an hour and the Nestout got the smaller iPhone 11 to 80 percent in a little more than that. Another thing to note is that the supplied cable is short, just seven inches total, so you’ll likely want to use your own cord. Nestout also makes accessories for its batteries, which I found delightful. A dimmable LED worklight snaps on to the top of the battery while a small tripod holds them both up. The portable solar panel reminded me of a baby version of Biolite’s camping panels. Nestout’s version refilled the 15,000mAh bank to 40 percent in under three hours, which sounds slow, but is actually fairly impressive considering the compact size of the panels. This is also a blazingly hot summer, so I’d expect better performance in more reasonable weather.

The Juice Pack from Mophie is the first one I’ve tested, so it’s hard to call it the best in its category, but I found a lot of reasons to recommend it. The case splits in two, making it easy to put on, but once installed, the phone feels secure in its protective sheath. I was surprised by how little bulk it adds; it’s a little longer at the bottom and a little thicker at the back, but I doubt anyone would even guess the case was also a battery. I tested the model that fits the iPhone 15, but the iPhone 16 version is now the most current and the design has actually been improved. The case now has magnets so you can use accessories (though not wireless charging).   When my tester iPhone 15 started to die, I long pressed the back button (a short press indicates battery level) and the charging bolt symbol immediately kicked on. It took about an hour and 45 minutes to get the phone from ten percent to 65 percent before the battery depleted. Compared to other batteries capable of delivering a partial charge, that’s not terribly fast. But it provides a few extra hours of life and it’s always there when you need it. The Juice Pack presents a couple drawbacks, though, with the biggest being that it prevents wireless charging. When it is time to recharge from the wall, a USB-C cable goes into the Juice Pack at the bottom edge, right where the phone’s port is. Power is directed first to the phone then switches to refilling the case battery. But, as I mentioned, the latest version of the case now allows for magnetic accessories.  The other downside is the fact that it’s a case. Depending on which you buy, a case will only work with an iPhone 16, 16 Pro or 16 Max, or one of the phones in the 15 series. It won't lend a charge to any other device that may need it. Also, like the Model T, the Juice Pack comes in any color you want, as long as that color is black. Some people won’t care, but others will probably lament the lack of personal expression. Still, if you often find yourself forgetting to charge your phone and you also forget to bring an extra battery, this is a good lifeline. $100 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$100 at Verizon$100 at Best BuyAmy Skorheim for EngadgetHonorable mention: Travel power bankInfinaCore P3 Pro Travelers — both international and domestic — will likely appreciate the clever design of the InfinaCore P3 Pro. It’s a compact square in the shape of a coaster and a little over an inch thick. There’s a Qi2 wireless charging pad on one side as well as a built-in, two-prong wall adapter at the edge. Those prongs fold down, not only to make it easier to pack the brick, but also to allow for three (included) international adapters to slide over the plug. That makes it ready for travel to countries with type G (UK, Saudi Arabia), type C (Europe) and type I (Australia, China) plugs. The built-in plug lets the P3 Pro act as both a portable charger and a wall adapter. Because the brick is rather large, I worried it would fall out of the wall, but the standard prongs stayed firmly attached to my outlets at home (I, sadly, haven’t gone on any international trips, so I couldn’t test the adapters.) There are also two USB-C ports on the side, one for fast charging from the battery and one for in/out power transfers. There’s also a USB-A slot and a (very) small carry strap. The display shows the remaining charge as well as the amount of charge currently being output. It has a 10,500mAh capacity, which filled an iPhone 15 once with about 25 percent left over. After filling a Galaxy S24 Ultra, the battery had about 33 percent remaining. That’s a little less charge than I would have expected for the listed capacity (most 10K banks I’ve tested deliver more). It’s also a touch slow in filling an iPhone, taking over three hours to fill one wirelessly, and nearly two hours to fill it with a cable. The speed on the Galaxy refill was better, clocking in at a little over an hour to go from four percent to full. At the list price of $200, the P3 Pro really only makes sense for an international traveler who wants a wall adapter, wireless charger and power bank in one. But if you can find it on sale, grab it. It’s a clever design that works decently and comes with a 99-year warranty. $70 at AmazonWhat to look for in a portable battery packBattery typeNearly every rechargeable power bank you can buy (and most portable devices) contain a lithium-ion battery. These beat other current battery types in terms of size-to-charge capacity, and have even increased in energy density by eight fold in the past 14 years. They also don’t suffer from a memory effect (where a battery's lifespan deteriorates due to partial charges).Flying with portable batteriesYou may have heard about lithium ion batteries overheating and catching fire — a recent Hong Kong flight was grounded after just such a thing happened in an overhead bin. Current restrictions implemented by the TSA still allow external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) to fly with you, but only in your carry-on luggage — they can’t be checked.AdvertisementAdvertisementRecently, Southwest Airlines was the first in the industry to take that rule one step further. Now, flyers on that airline must keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the portable charger isn’t actively in use, however, it can stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin.CapacityPower bank manufacturers almost always list a battery’s capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries with a 5,000mAh capacity make good phone chargers and can fill a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh and we have a separate guide that covers that entire category.Unsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as mAh capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick.You might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that’s not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That’s an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent.WirelessMore manufacturers are making power banks with wireless charging. Not hassling with cables is nice, but it’s important to note that wireless charging is less efficient than plugging in your phone. Outside of MagSafe options, wireless portable chargers historically didn’t make the cut for our top picks for this guide for that reason. The Qi2 wireless charging standard arrived in 2023 and improves performance for wireless charging, including for portable banks. Currently, iPhones are the only handsets that support the new tech, but as it’s an open standard, expect Google, Samsung and others to adopt it for future phones. In my testing, I’ve noticed an uptick in the performance of non-Qi2-enabled batteries as well, so you'll now see wireless options on this list.PortsSince Apple ditched the Lightning cable and adopted USB-C, we’re getting closer to a standard for charging connections — and all of our picks have at least one such port. But plenty of other devices use older interfaces, like USB-A and microUSB ports, plus Lightning for older iPhones. You can find cables with just about any combination of those connections, so when you’re picking out a battery, just check that one end of your preferred cord will fit.AdvertisementAdvertisementMost battery packs have more than one charging port, which gives you different charging options. You’ll typically see at least one port labeled “in/out,” which means you can use it to both charge the bank and charge your gadget. While USB-A output ports can power up cell phones and other small devices, they can’t charge larger devices. Plus, they aren’t as fast as USB-C ports overall. That’s something to keep in mind when you’re deciding which ports and charging cables to use to connect your phone to the pack.There’s even more variation among USB-C ports themselves, with different ports on the same device supporting different power transfer rates. What that means in practical terms is an iPhone will charge just fine plugged into a power bank’s 18W port. But to properly charge, say, a MacBook or similar laptop, it’ll need the extra juice supplied by a 100W port (which larger power banks can offer). Power banks with more than one port can also charge multiple devices at the same time, but speeds and the overall charge delivered will be lower.You’ll also want to consider your charging cable. For anything larger than a smartphone (and to access fast-charging capabilities) you’ll want to use USB-C ports and cables. But not all cables are created equal, even when they have the same USB-C plugs on the end. If you want power delivery from a 100W USB-C power bank port, you’ll need a 100W-rated USB-C cable. Luckily, power banks capable of delivering 100W tend to include a compatible cable. For any devices that don’t, we’ve tried and liked Anker’s 100W USB-C cable. For smaller devices, we used this 60W cable from Nimble and we don’t recommend bothering with cables under 60W. For around $20, higher-capacity charging cables will make sure you’re not wasting time with connections that limit your potential power transfer.DesignFor the most part, these rechargeable batteries have a squared-off, brick-like design, though many nod towards aesthetics with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn’t affect how they perform, it’s a consideration for something you’ll interact with regularly. Some portable power stations include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the newer banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating remaining battery percentage.How we test best power banksBefore I even put my hands on a battery pack, I did extensive research. I considered brands Engadget reviewers and staff have tried over the years and checked out customer ratings on retail sites like Amazon and Best Buy. Then, I acquire the most promising candidates and test them in my home office.Amy Skorheim for EngadgetHere’s the full list of power banks we've tested, which range from small wireless banks to large, multi-device batteries:MagSafe-compatibleApple MagSafe Battery Pack (5,000 mAh)Spigen ArcHybrid Mag (5,000mAh)Anker 521 Magnetic Battery (5,000 mAh)Mophie snap+ PowerstationMmini (5,000mAh)Baseus Magnetic (10,000mAh)Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) (6,600 mAh)Anker 633 Magnetic Battery (10,000mAh)Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K) (10,000 mAh)UGREEN 10,000mAh Magnetic (10,000mAh)EcoFlow Rapid Magnetic (5,000mAh)Low capacity (≤10,000mAh)Mophie Juice Pack (2,400mAh)Anker 511 Power Bank (5,000 mAh)Anker 313 Power Bank (10,000mAh)Nimble Champ (10,000mAh)Biolite Charge 40 PD (10,000mAh)Anker Nano (5,000mAh)Nimble Champ (10,000mAh)Satechi Quatro Wireless bank (10,000mAh)Anker 10K Fusion power bank (10,000mAh)Mid capacity (10,001 - 20,000mAh)Baseus Blade 2 (12,000 mAh)Otterbox Fast Charge (15,000mAh)Mophie Powerstation Pro (20,000mAh)Anker Prime (20,000mAh)Nestout Portable Charger (15,000mAh)Nimble Champ Pro (20,000mAh)InfinaCore P3 Pro (10,500mAh)High capacity (20,001mAh+)Mophie Powerstation Pro XL (25,000mAh)UGREEN Power Bank 25,000mAh 145W (25,000mAh)Anker 737 Power Bank (25,600 mAh)Zendure Supertank Pro (26,800mAh)Mophie Powerstation Pro AC (27,000mAh)Lion Energy Eclipse Mag (27,000mAh)Lion Energy Trek (27,000mAh)HyperJuice 245W (27,000mAh)Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (27,650mAh)Anker laptop power bank with built-in cable (25,000mAh)Belkin Boost Charge 20K with built-in cable (20,000mAh)AdvertisementAdvertisementWe're continuously updating this guide as companies release new products and we test them. We remove some products as we find picks that are more worthy of the best portable charger designation. We also add updated specs and prices where necessary.For testing, I used each battery with some combination of an iPhone 15, an iPhone 14 Plus, an iPhone 11, a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, a Galaxy S23 Ultra, a 5th-gen iPad Air and an M1 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro. I charged one phone battery at a time, even though some packs are capable of multiple-device charging. I charged the phones and tablets from between zero and five percent until they were 100 percent full (or until the power bank was dead), and didn’t use the phones or tablets while they charged other than to power them on and enter the unlock code. In the case of the MacBook, I used it while it was charging (it’s my work computer).I used the charging cable included with each power bank to charge the Galaxy S22 Ultra, MacBook Pro and the iPad Air. For the iPhones, I used the USB-C to Lighting cable that Apple provides. In the case of the lower-capacity power banks that didn’t include a cord or included one with USB-C to USB-A connectors, I used this 60W-rated USB-C to USB-C cable.For reference, here are the battery capacities of each device we used for testing:AdvertisementAdvertisementiPhone 11: 3,110 mAhiPhone 14 Plus: 4,325 mAhiPhone 15: 3,349 mAhGalaxy S22 Ultra: 4,855mAhiPad Air: 7,729mAh16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAhI noted the times for each charge and the number of charges each bank provided. I also paid attention to things like ease of use and overall design.Other power banks we testedHyperJuice 245WHyper’s massive-but-sleek brick is one nice looking power bank. The HyperJuice 245W packs a hefty 27,000mAh capacity, enough to refill my tester phone about four times and get a MacBook Pro from near-dead to 75 percent. It only has USB-C ports, but you at least get four of them. USB-C only is probably fine for most situations, but a USB-A port would be nice for charging the occasional older peripheral. The 245 wattage is pretty high for a power bank and it was indeed speedy. It filled a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in just over an hour. But it’s the same price and capacity as our Mophie Powerstation pick for laptop banks, and that one has a better variety of ports. Hyper’s battery is also comparable to Anker’s laptop battery, which is cheaper, has built-in cables and has nearly the same capacity. Plus, that bank is just as swanky looking.Anker Prime 20,000 mAh power bankAnker’s Prime bank was our previous pick for the best premium power bank, but I thought it worked best with the expensive (yet very convenient) base. Considering it also doesn’t have any built-in cables, we decided to bump the Prime battery from its position and replace it with the Anker Retractable Cable Laptop Bank. There’s still plenty to like about the Prime battery: it’s solid, attractive and tells you just how much charge it has left with its onboard display. When you add the optional base, you not only get a convenient drop-and-go way to recharge, it also acts as a charging hub with three additional USB ports.EcoFlow Rapid magnetic power bankI was curious to try out the first power bank from EcoFlow, a company that primarily makes larger power stations and whole-home backup batteries. The first offering in the brand’s Rapid series is a Qi2-enabled magnetic charger with a 5,000mAh capacity. It looks quite nice with shiny silver accents and soft-touch grey plastic on the MagSafe-compatible front. There’s a little pull-out leg that sturdily displays your phone as it charges and the attached USB-C cable lets you refill devices directly, then tucks out of the way when it’s not in use. But it didn’t outperform our top pick in the MagSafe category, in terms of both charging speeds and the amount of charge delivered.Baseus Blade 2The Blade 2 from Baseus has a unique, flat shape that’s just a little wider than an ereader — which may make it easier to slip into a low profile laptop bag. It charged a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra considerably faster than any other battery bank we tried, getting it from four percent to full in just over an hour. It then filled the phone back to 62 percent from dead on a second charge in about a half an hour. But $100 is a lot for a standard power bank that holds fewer than two full charges. But if you can find the Blade 2 on sale, snap it up.Anker MagGo (6.6K)Anker’s 6.6k MagGo is pretty similar to our top pick for a MagSafe-compatible battery pack. It supports the Qi2 charging standard and props up your iPhone so you can use it or enable StandBy mode while powering up. This one even lets you set the viewing angle from 30 to 65 degrees. It was speedy in getting an iPhone 15 up to 50 percent in about 40 minutes. But for the added bulk, it doesn’t have as much capacity as the 10K MagGo, holding just enough juice for a single full charge plus about 5 percent. But it is $20 cheaper, which may be key for some.Mophie Snap+ Powerstation MiniThe Mophie snap+ Powerstation Mini is terribly well-built. It feels premium with a rubberized contact point for the MagSafe charging pad and a stand that runs the entire width of the bank itself, making it extra sturdy. It’s compact, too, but only carries a 5,000mAh capacity, which gets you a partial charge on most newer or larger phones. Our current MagSafe/iPhone pick has double the capacity, a stand and a digital display — for just $20 more than the Powerstation Mini.Power bank FAQsWhat's the difference between a portable power bank and a portable charger?A slew of terms are used to describe power banks, including portable batteries, portable chargers, external battery packs and even, somewhat confusingly, USB chargers, which is what wall chargers are often called. They all mean the same thing: a lithium ion battery that stores a charge so you can refill a smartphone, tablet, earbuds, console controller, ereader, laptop, or just about any other device with its own built-in, rechargeable battery.AdvertisementAdvertisementThere’s little difference between the terms, so the specs you’ll want to pay attention to are capacity (expressed in mAh), size and weight so you can find the right balance between recharging what you need and portability.Power stations, on the other hand, are distinct. These are bigger units (often around the size of a car battery) that can be used to charge multiple devices multiple times, but notably, they can’t be taken on airplanes.Does fast charging actually ruin your battery?Not exactly. The real enemy of a battery’s longevity is heat. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat is generated. Modern phones have features that keep the battery cool while charging, like physical heat shields and heat sinks, as well as software features that slow down processes that generate too much heat. Phone manufacturers are keen to promote a phone’s fast-charging abilities, so they had to figure out ways to make faster charging work.While there aren’t long-term studies on what fast charging does to a phone, a study on EV batteries (which use the same general concept of charged lithium ions flowing from one side of the battery to the other, absorbing or releasing a usable charge) showed a very slight decrease in capacity over time with only fast charging — though what actually made a larger difference was how hot the battery itself was, due to ambient temperatures, when it was charged.AdvertisementAdvertisementIn short, fast charging could be slightly harder on your battery than normal charging. But the safeguards most smartphones have make that difference fairly negligible. To really ensure you’re taking the best care of your battery, limiting heat exposure overall is one of the best things you can do.Can you use a power bank for all your devices?That depends on the size of the bank and the size of your device’s battery. A small 5,000mAh battery isn’t strong enough to charge laptops, but a portable charger with a 20,000mAh capacity will give your computer a partial refill. You also have to consider port compatibility. If your device has a USB port, you’ll be able to easily find a cable to connect it to a battery. If your device has a more unique port, such as a DC port, you won’t be able to use a battery. Devices with an AC cable and plug can be charged, and sometimes powered (such as in the case of a printer or speaker), by larger laptop batteries with AC ports.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
