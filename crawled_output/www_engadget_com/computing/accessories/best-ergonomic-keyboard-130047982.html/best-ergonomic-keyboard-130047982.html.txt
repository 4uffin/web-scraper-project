The best ergonomic keyboards for 2025Fully split, Alice, mechanical, ortholinear keyboards — we tested them all.Amy SkorheimSenior Reporter, Buying AdviceAmy SkorheimSenior Reporter, Buying AdviceUpdated Thu, September 18, 2025 at 9:01 AM UTCAdd Engadget on GoogleEngadgetA simple experiment can tell you whether an ergonomic keyboard could be more comfortable for you: With your elbows hugged into your sides, bring your thumbs to touch in front of you. Now angle your elbows slightly outward and separate your hands. If the latter position feels better, you may appreciate the design of an ergonomic keyboard. These boards split, tilt and/or angle the keys in so your shoulders and chest feel more open and your forearms and wrists stay aligned.Some ergonomic keyboards are fully split, some are unibody split (Alice designs). Some use a columnar orientation, have thumb clusters and take advantage of programmable keys. I tried more than 15 with a mix of all these features and included info about the benefits of various designs so you can pick the best ergonomic keyboard for you (because it won’t be the same for everyone).Quick OverviewBest wireless ergonomic keyboardLogitech Ergo K860 Wireless SplitMore options$148 at AmazonBest wireless ergonomic mechanical keyboardKinesis mWave Mechanical KeyboardMore options$134 at AmazonBest split ergonomic keyboardKeychron Q11$237 at AmazonBest budget ergonomic keyboardKensington Pro Fit Ergo Wireless Keyboard KB675$63 at AmazonBest split ergonomic keyboard with thumb clustersZSA Voyager$365 at ZSASee 2 moreTable of contentsBest ergonomic keyboards for 2025What to look for in an ergonomic keyboardHow we tested ergonomic keyboardsOther ergonomic keyboards we testedErgonomic keyboard FAQBest ergonomic keyboards for 2025Photo by Amy Skorheim / EngadgetBest wireless ergonomic keyboardLogitech Ergo K860 Wireless SplitErgonomic features: Alice split, center tenting, optional negative tilt, wrist rest | Host connection: Bluetooth or USB receiver | Switch type: Scissor | Hotkey compatibility: Mac and Windows | Ten key: Yes | RGB lighting: No | Programing interface: Logi Options+ (app) | Language/Layout: QWERTY The Ergo K860 from Logitech closely resembles standard, full-size keyboard designs, so there’s not much of a learning curve. But subtle changes like the Alice layout, tented middle and optional negative tilt make typing noticeably more comfortable. I could keep my elbows comfortably away from my ribs, my wrists were straight and my palms could rotate naturally inward. The board connects quickly and reliably via Bluetooth, the build is solid and the price of $150 isn’t outrageous. It’s Mac, Windows, Chrome and Linux compatible (though you’ll need software for non-basic key functions for the latter two). Buttons allow you to swap between three previously connected devices, which worked great for me, even between a MacBook and a PC. Function keys like volume and brightness and the Option/Start and Command/Alt combo keys worked correctly on each machine. My only qualms are that the palm rest is not removable (though it’s springy and firm). The arrow keys and a numeric keypad on the right side adds length to that side of the board, which forces your mouse farther out. The scissor switch keys can feel mushy if you’re coming from a mechanical board, but they’re responsive enough to make this one of the best wireless ergonomic keyboards.

A unibody, tented, Alice-split design that makes typing more comfortable while not being difficult to learn. But this adds mechanical keys, a tenkeyless design and programmable layers — plus it’s about $30 cheaper. You also get three magnetic feet to create an optional negative tilt. The missing number pad lets right handed folk put their mouse closer but you can still use tenkey input using the layers function. In fact, all keys are programmable using Kenisis’ browser-based Clique software. It’s not the simplest programming software and there aren’t a ton of extra or blank keys for you to mod, so if you want a lot of programmability, you’ll likely rely on layers. The mWave should also appeal to people who just want a plug-and-play option. It comes in two models, a white board with macOS function keys and a black PC version. One drawback is the sound from low-profile mechanical switches. They're springy and responsive but produce a loud, hollow clunk as you type. It also comes with an USB-C to A cable, which is a little dated for Mac users. The Kinesis rep confirmed the mWave was designed as a replacement for the now-discontinued Microsoft Sculpt — but with a few upgrades like mechanical keys, no dongle, and programmability.

You can even push the two halves back together to make it look like a standard, 75 percent mechanical board. Keychron dominates our mechanical keyboard guide because the company makes such great boards. I tested a model with Gateron G Pro Red linear mechanical switches which were smooth and not too clacky. The PBT keycaps are luxurious and the machined aluminum body feels substantial. It’s honestly dreamy to type on. A switch at the top of the board toggles between Mac and Windows, and there are two customizable knobs at the top corners as well as five macro keys to the left of the board. Those and the rest of the board can be programmed with open source keyboard firmware QMK and VIA, which may take a little effort for someone new to keyboard programming — but once you get the hang of it, it’s powerful and effective software. The fully split board lets me sit nice and upright, without hunching, though I wish the provided cable that links the halves were a touch longer. I’d also like the option of getting some center tenting to keep my palms from having to rotate downwards. But if those things aren’t dealbreakers for you, this is a lovely ergonomic keyboard. ProsHigh quality buildSmooth and buttery mechanical keysFully split keys keep your hands at a comfortable distance apartEasily toggle between Mac and Windows systemsConsNo center tentingShort bridge cable included$237 at AmazonKensingtonBest budget ergonomic keyboardKensington Pro Fit Ergo Wireless Keyboard KB675Ergonomic features: Alice split, center tenting, optional negative tilt, wrist rest | Host connection: Bluetooth or USB receiver | Switch type: Membrane | Hotkey compatibility: Windows | Ten key: No | RGB lighting: No | Programing interface: Kensington Konnect | Language/layout: QWERTY The compact Kensington Pro Fit Ergo sells for $65 at full price, but is often on sale for around $55. That makes it a good budget board, but it feels much more premium than the price tag suggests. The membrane keys are surprisingly springy and the low profile keycaps make typing easy. The wrist rest, especially when combined with the negative tilt, hits my palms at just the right spot, not putting pressure on my tendons while keeping the backs of my wrists straight. Of course, different hand sizes will have different experiences, but my men’s medium/women’s large mitts were comfortable. It connected easily via Bluetooth or radio dongle to both the Mac and PC I tried and the battery stayed full for a month. Recharging is simple via the USB port. You can switch to a Mac or Windows layout and Kensington’s software allows you to program function and specialty keys. But I had trouble getting it to work with my Mac. But if you want minutely programmable keys, this isn’t the one you should get anyway. But it’s an inexpensive keyboard that’s far more comfortable to type on than most, making it one of the best ergonomic keyboards under $100.  $63 at AmazonPhoto by Amy Skorheim / EngadgetBest split ergonomic keyboard with thumb clustersZSA VoyagerErgonomic features: Fully split, center tenting, thumb cluster | Host connection: USB-C port | Switch type: Mechanical (tactile, clicky, linear) | Hotkey compatibility: Mac and Windows | Ten key: No | RGB lighting: Yes | Programing interface: Oryx (browser) | Language/Layout: QWERTY (programmable) A rep I spoke with at ZSA warned me about the Voyager, saying the board has an effect “like a brain injury: A moment ago you knew how to type, and now you don't.” That’s exactly how I felt after plugging in the impossibly compact accessory. For one, the columnar layout puts keys (particularly those on the bottom row) in spots you don’t intuitively reach for. Then there’s a thumb cluster where you’ll find not just the space bar, but other important keys like return. Finally, the board uses layers, giving each key up to three functions. I actually had to interrupt testing at one point and plug in another keyboard because I felt I was trying to type with oven mitts on. But now it’s my daily driver and I get bummed when I have to go back to normal boards. Those thumb clusters and layers save serious accumulated time, putting keys like return, control, space and delete under your very dextrous thumbs and turning letter keys into arrows and number pads. You will very likely want to program the board away from the defaults and you can do so with the browser-based Oryx configurator or Zsa's Keymapp app. It’s pretty intuitive to program the board, but it did take me about a week of use before I got every key to my liking. The low profile keys are easy to type on and the switches are responsive with a quick springback. The split allows for a wide, open posture and the optional magnetic legs give it a subtle but effective center tenting. The time it takes to get used to the board is the only real drawback. It takes a few weeks of practice and extra time to program. But in the end, this really does maximize your output while minimizing your movements.

But this adds full sized keycaps, built-in (detachable) wrist rests and twenty more keys, including eight keys in each thumb cluster. (Zsa has a similar model, the Moonlander.) The Bazecor programming software is one of the simplest to figure out. The keys are a delight to type on with springy and responsive mechanical switches. The board itself is well-made and deluxe, especially with the add-ons. You can add an LED underglow, extreme tenting mechanisms and wireless capabilities (Bluetooth and RF) but each add-on increases the price by $70, $80 and $90, respectively. That brought the fully kitted-out version I tested to $609. Without those, it’ll run you $369.  I prefer the minimalism of the Voyager, but this one is likely the best ergonomic keyboard for programmers and for those who prefer a more maximalist work setup.

But I have a decent understanding of what gamers might like. PC gamers who rely on the WASD keys may appreciate not having to contend with the right side of a keyboard at all, and instead use that space for their mouse. The Kinesis Freestyle Edge is a gaming variation on the brand's original Freestyle 2 is a fully split model with Cherry MX mechanical switches. The tactile Brown ones in my tester unit had a satisfying click and a not overly loud clacky noise. The wrist rests are removable and clever folding legs give you three height options for tenting and can also be removed completely. It is backlit, with per-key RGB lights and nine macros buttons that can be programmed with the configuration app or without it using keyboard commands. All of this may appeal if you're looking for a programmable keyboard that's best for gaming while still employing a few ergonomic tricks.  ProsFully split means you can just use the left halfHigh degree of optional tentingAdditional programmable shortcut keysConsSomewhat bulkyBuilt-in cables are not customizable$149 at AmazonWhat to look for in an ergonomic keyboardYou might be looking into ergonomic accessories to help with a specific problem, such as carpal tunnel or tendonitis. Or maybe you’re simply looking for a way to make long hours at your desk more comfortable. It can help to know some of the terminology and reasons behind various features, which we explain below. Just keep in mind that new equipment alone won’t solve the problem. Changing positions, doing regular stretches and taking walk breaks will all go a long way towards making you feel better while you work.Alice vs splitMost ergonomic keyboard layouts fall into two categories: unibody (or Alice) and split. The former is a single board with the two halves of the keys rotated about 30 degrees apart at the bottom. The separation forms an A-shaped space between the keys — which has nothing to do with why it’s called an Alice layout, it’s just a happy coincidence. This subtle tweak pushes your elbows away from your ribs while keeping a straight line from your forearm to your middle knuckle. Using one, I pretty instantly felt more open along the front side of my body. This layout more closely resembles a traditional keyboard, so it should be easier for most folks to get used to than a fully split option.AdvertisementAdvertisementSpeaking of, split boards break the keys into two separate parts you can position individually. You can put them shoulder distance apart, bring them closer together or angle them as much as feels comfortable. You can also put your mouse between the halves, which may feel like an easier trip for your cursor hand and could potentially help with conditions like repetitive strain injuries (RSI). Personally, I like being able to put my current snack between the two parts. I've also found that pairing a split keyboard with a good ergonomic mouse has helped me even more, particularly a vertical mouse.TenkeylessYou can find ergonomic keyboards with and without number pads. Not having those number keys on the right hand side lets you keep your mouse closer in, minimizing overall reach. But if you work with numbers a lot, you’ll likely want that pad included. Some programmable boards allow for the use of layers, which temporarily repurpose keys and can provide you with a ten-key option through clever remapping of letter keys.Tenting and negative tiltTenting raises the middle of the keyboard up, so your hands move closer to a “handshake” position. Alice keyboards usually angle up towards the middle and always to a fixed degree, since the two sides are connected. Split boards often let you adjust the degree of tenting, going from flat to subtle to extreme lift.You may have encountered keyboards with an optional lift at the back of the board, raising the top keys higher than the space bar. Every set of hands is different, but for most people, pulling the backs of the hands towards the forearms increases strain. Negative tilt has the opposite effect by sloping in the other direction, lowering the top number keys while raising the edge with the spacebar. Many Alice and some split keyboards offer an optional negative tilt. I found it was more comfortable to enable that feature when I’m standing, and I preferred to have the keys flat when sat at my desk.A standard keyboard keeps your arms tight to your body and makes you splay your hands outward at the wrists.
An Alice keyboard rotates the keys outward so you can move your elbows out and keep a straight line from your forearm to middle knuckle.
A split keyboard allows you to move your hands apart which can help keep you more open through the chest.
A slight tenting raises the inner edges and puts your hands closer to a "handshake" position.
You can also place your mouse between the split halves to minimize travel.

Staggered vs columnarThis decision seems to be one of the more hotly-contested among ergo enthusiasts. A conventional keyboard has staggered keys, with each row slightly offset to the rows above and below it — so the A key is about halfway between the Q and W above it. This is a holdover from vintage mechanical typewriters, in which each press activated a hammer that smashed ink onto paper in the shape of a letter. To fit the hammers as close together as possible, while still allowing for finger pads, the keys were staggered.AdvertisementAdvertisementColumnar or ortholinear keyboards stack the keys in orderly columns, often with rows that are not linear. Proponents claim this makes the keys easier to reach. Whether that’s true will be up to your fingers to decide, but I can say for certain that if you learned to type on a staggered keyboard, switching to a columnar layout is tough. It will take days, possibly weeks before you instinctively hit the C key. The N, M and B keys don’t fare much better.Programmable keysWith a few exceptions, most ergonomic keyboards will work with PCs or Macs as a standard typing input, but the use of function and hot keys may require some remapping. It can be as easy as an onboard switch to toggle between Mac and PC layouts, or as involved as downloading software to change up the keys. Some boards even include (or let you buy) extra keycaps to change, say, the Mac’s Command and Option keys to PC’s Start and Alt buttons. Those are what's called hot-swappable keys, meaning you just pull the old key off (usually with a provided key puller) and stick the new one on, no soldering required.For some boards, remapping or programming keys using software is a crucial feature. Gaming peripherals have extra keys that you can set to execute a series of keystrokes with the push of a single button, and we cover the best gaming keyboards in a separate guide. Keyboards that work with layers, in which a single button can perform several functions, typically allow you to change what those are. Some ergo keyboards have non-standard layouts, like thumb clusters with multiple keys near the space bar that you operate with your thumb. You’ll also be able to program those.Other considerationsErgonomic keyboards come in mechanical, membrane, and scissor switch versions. Which works best for you is, again, up to your preference. I won’t get too deep into the particulars here, as we have an entire guide devoted to the best mechanical boards, but the short of it is that membrane and scissor switches are less customizable than mechanical and typically cheaper. Typing on them tends to be quieter and softer. Mechanical switches are more customizable, offer a more responsive typing experience and are usually pricier.AdvertisementAdvertisementYou’ll also have the option of wired or wireless ergonomic boards. All other things being equal, wired models are less expensive. Competitive gamers who rely on split-second responses may prefer the zero-lag of wired keyboards. Wired models also never run out of battery life and have fewer connectivity issues. But wireless keyboards keep your desk less cluttered.Some ergonomic keyboards come with permanent or removable wrist or palm rests, which can be cushioned or hard. This is another area where opinions diverge: proponents claim they help you maintain a neutral hand position, while detractors say they put pressure on the tendons and can cause wrist pain or even exacerbate conditions like carpal tunnel. Ideally, your palms should be resting, not your wrists, and you might find you like having that support or you may find the pressure uncomfortable.Photo by Amy Skorheim / EngadgetHow we tested ergonomic keyboardsAll our guides begin with extensive research to figure out what’s out there and what’s worth testing. We consider brands with good reputations that we’ve heard good things about from colleagues and look at keyboard reviews in forums and other trusted publications. For this guide, I looked for keyboards with ergonomic features like tenting, split keys, palm support and so on. I also zeroed in on boards that didn’t require a deep amount of familiarity with the vast and exhaustive world of custom keyboards.Once I settled on ten boards, I acquired them and used each one for anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. I tried out the remapping and macros software and considered the comfort, design, price and durability of each model before arriving at picks I think will work best for the most people out there. For subsequent updates to this guide, I have continued to acquire and test out new keyboards as they come on the market, adding and replacing the top picks as warranted. If and when Microsoft ergonomic keyboards, like the Sculpt, come back on the market, as a collaboration with Incase has promised, I'll try those models, too.Other ergonomic keyboards we testedNaya CreateI didn’t get to fully test the Naya Create keyboard, but I was able to try one out for a few minutes during CES this year. It’s one of the more customizable keyboards you’ll find. Not only is it a fully split, mechanical board with programmable keys, the thumb clusters sit just below two modular platforms that each accept a touchpad, trackball, dial or a 3D joystick. These are meant to replace your mouse and other input devices, eliminating travel for your cursor hand. Each half of the keyboard body bends in two places to allow for precise tenting and, from my short time with the Naya, the hinges and the entire board felt solidly built. The Naya Create starts at $500 before you add on any of the mouse modules, but that’s not stopping people from ordering. According to Naya’s website, the first three batches of pre-orders sold out and the fourth batch will ship in July 2025.Kinesis Advantage 360If you want something fully split with thumb clusters and a columnar layout but that’s a little less minimal than the Zsa Voyager— and wireless to boot — the Advantage 360 from Kinesis, makers of the popular Advantage 2 is a good one to check out. It looks like it comes from an ‘80s-era IBM office, but is somehow also from the future. The tenting goes from low to intense and the key well curves concavely to meet your fingers where they naturally land. The 360 is per-key programmable, works with layers and has four macros keys.Periboard 835For a mechanical Alice keyboard with both wireless and wired capabilities, the Periboard 835 is a good pick. The Mac and Windows-compatible board has a solid build, low profile switches, RGB lighting, comfortable tenting and a few extra programmable keys.Goldtouch Elite AdjustableI remember wondering if something like the Goldtouch Elite Adjustable existed when I first started testing ergonomic keyboards. It didn’t at the time, as far as I could tell, but now a connected yet adjustable split board is indeed a product you can buy. It’s a solidly-built board and the ball joint connecting the two halves feels like it will put up with a lot of use. A squeeze of the lever at the top of the keys lets you set the board just how you like, adjusting both the vertical tenting and the angle between the two halves. There’s no programming to speak of, just the ability to swap a few function keys like print screen and home.AdvertisementAdvertisementUnfortunately, the tenting doesn’t work for me. Because of the extra keys at the outer edges, raising the middle edges upwards lifts the center keys considerably, which brings my wrists and forearms off the desk instead of letting them rest. Holding them like that created extra neck and shoulder strain on my part, which is sort of the opposite of the goal. But if you’re not into tenting anyway and want a flat, Alice-split board with an adjustable splay, this works quite well.Kinesis Form Split Touchpad KeyboardThe idea behind the Kinesis Form Split Touchpad Keyboard is pretty ergonomic: put the trackpad between the two halves and minimize travel for your mouse hand. The distance between the two puts your elbows at a comfortable distance and keeps your wrist nearly in-line with your forearms. The build is excellent, with low profile mechanical switches that feel smooth and just the right amount of clacky. The trackpad is responsive, but gestures only work with Windows computers. Even dragging and dropping doesn’t work on a Mac here, so I don’t see Apple users getting much use out of the board. I also found myself wishing for the slightest rotation of the keys — though they’re a good distance apart, a slight angle would keep my wrists fully unbent. There’s no tenting or negative tilt either, both of which could help a bit more, ergonomically speaking.Logitech Wave KeysWhile it's a perfectly fine and affordable Bluetooth keyboard, the Logitech Wave has minimal ergonomics. The keys rise up slightly in the middle and there's a comfortable wrist rest attached, but the layout is the same as any other keyboard, with no splitting of the keys to open up your arms or keep your wrists straight.Ergonomic keyboard FAQsWhat kinds of ergonomic keyboard styles are there?Most ergonomic keyboards fall into two categories: fully split which separates the board into two pieces, and unibody split, also known as an Alice design, which angles the keys outward at the bottom. When the keys are rotated outward or split into two halves, it allows for a wider spread between your elbows for a more relaxed typing position. Other ergonomic features, such as thumb clusters, center tenting and negative tilting are sometimes added to either type of board.Which keyboard layout is the most ergonomic?Since every person is different, there’s no one best ergonomic keyboard layout. The standard QWERTY layout is what most people are used to. The Dvorak, Colemak and Workman layouts rearrange the board to put the more commonly used letters closer to the home-key position. All three are intended to minimize your finger movements. That may indeed feel more comfortable and less fatiguing, but people used to the QWERTY layout will likely need to relearn how to type.When do I need a split keyboard?You might feel some relief with a fully split keyboard if you find yourself tensing up at the shoulders as you type on a standard board. Putting some distance between your hands may allow your chest to stay more open, which for some is an easier position to maintain. You may also appreciate being able to place your mouse or trackpad between the two halves of the board to minimize the distance your cursor hand needs to travel.How long does it take to adjust to an ergonomic keyboard?That depends on the type of keyboard. Since the Alice-split design simply rotates the keys apart, typing on it feels fairly similar to the regular keyboards you’re already used to. A fully split board will take a little more adjustment, particularly if it uses thumb clusters. The enter, shift and control buttons may now be operated by your thumbs instead of your other fingers and that can be tough to get used to. It took me a full month to get completely comfortable with a fully split keyboard with thumb clusters. But now, I prefer it to typing on regular boards.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
