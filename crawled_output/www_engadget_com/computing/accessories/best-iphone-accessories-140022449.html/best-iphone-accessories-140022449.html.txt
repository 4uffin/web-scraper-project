The best iPhone accessories for 2025Including the MagSafe accessories worth your money.Valentina PalladinoDeputy Editor, Buying AdviceValentina PalladinoDeputy Editor, Buying AdviceUpdated Mon, September 22, 2025 at 9:01 AM UTCAdd Engadget on GoogleSam Rutherford for EngadgetThe right add-on can make a good iPhone experience even better. Whether you're looking to boost your battery life, level up your mobile photography or just keep your device safe from daily wear and tear, the best iPhone accessories are the ones that add real value without getting in your way. From MagSafe chargers and wireless earbuds to stands, mounts and portable power banks, there’s no shortage of ways to customize how you use your phone.We've tested a wide range of products to help you narrow it down. Whether you're using the latest iPhone or holding onto an older model, the best iPhone accessories can enhance your day-to-day in meaningful ways — whether that’s making your morning commute smoother, improving your FaceTime setup or just keeping your screen crack-free.Quick OverviewApple AirTagMore options$37 at AmazonPopSockets PopGrip Compatible with MagSafeMore options$19 at AmazonApple MagSafe ChargerMore options$28 at AmazonZAGG Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhoneMore options$35 at AmazonApple AirPods Pro 3$249 at AmazonSee 10 moreBest iPhone accessoriesPhoto by Valentina Palladino / EngadgetApple AirTagApple’s AirTags make it easy for iPhone users to locate things they might misplace. There are even AirTag cases and keyrings you can buy for added convenience that act as a holder for the device. Just attach one of the tiny Bluetooth trackers to your keys, backpack or wallet and then use the Find My app to keep track of them. If you know your stuff is within reach, you can force the AirTag to play a tune to lead you to it. And when you truly don’t know where something is, you can enable Lost Mode to be automatically notified when the Find My network locates the item. AirTags only have compatibility with iPhones, but iPhone users have other Bluetooth tracker options. But Apple’s gadgets have a convenience level that’s similar to AirPods — your iPhone will automatically identify a new Apple AirTag nearby and immediately pair with it, and, base on our testing experience, it’s quite simple to manage multiple AirTags in the Find My app. ProsEasy to slip into bags and walletsUses the Find My network to keep track of belongingsConsNo built-in keyring hole$37 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$26 at Adorama$46 at Best BuyPopSocketsPopSockets PopGrip Compatible with MagSafePopSockets have been a great solution for the problem of slippery iPhones for a long time, but the new MagSafe PopGrips make them an even more versatile option. Instead of adhering to the back of your handset or phone's case, they magnetically (and pretty securely) attach using MagSafe. That means you can use it when you need it — to prop up your iPhone to watch a video or take a selfie — and then swiftly remove it when you don't need it or want to power up using a wireless charger. Each of these PopGrips comes with a MagSafe-compatible ring as well, which means you can turn non-iPhone gadgets like an Android phone, an ereader and others into MagSafe-compatible ones, too. And if you prefer a different style grip or a wallet accessory, PopSocket has a number of items to choose from in its MagSafe range. ProsStrong magnetic hold on iPhonesComes with a MagSafe ring so you can use it with other devicesConsNo adhesive, so magnets are the only way to attach it to a device$19 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$30 at Target$30 at VerizonAppleApple MagSafe ChargerThere are often better and cheaper alternatives to Apple’s first-party accessories, but the company’s MagSafe wireless charger is worth considering if you have a new iPhone. Like all other MagSafe accessories, this charging pad uses magnets to attach to the back of the latest iPhones and it’s surprisingly strong. Not only can you safely pick up your handset and use it with the disk still attached, but the iPhone can dangle by the charger’s cord without falling off. (You still probably shouldn’t do this.) The charging plate itself is about a quarter-inch thick so it barely adds any heft to the iPhone. The magnets only attach to the latest iPhones, but it will still charge older models wirelessly, going back to the iPhone 8. You have the option of one-meter and two-meter cable lengths, and this latest model is Qi2-certified, supporting wireless charging up to 25W when paired with a 30W adapter and a compatible iPhone.

The last thing you want is to accidentally drop your very expensive new piece of tech and come out of it with a shattered screen. Zagg makes screen protectors for a number of different iPhone models and they’re quite easy to precisely stick onto your handset’s screen. Made with tempered glass, these thin sheets protect your iPhone display from scratches, bumps and drops, and they are fingerprint- and oil-proof as well. You can also get Zagg screen protectors with extra benefits: anti-glare coatings make it easier to see your screen in bright lighting, vision guard provides extra blue-light filtration and privacy filters prevent those around you from seeing what's on your screen.

Live Translation and hear-rate sensing get top billing, but improvements to ANC and sound quality are significant as well. Plus, Apple’s existing hearing health and other advanced earbuds features are available here as well. And the company managed to do all of this without raising the price. — Billy Steele, Senior Reporter ProsImpressive ANC updatesImproved sound qualityLive Translation finally arrivesExtended battery life on a single chargeConsNew fit takes some getting used toTotal battery life is actually less than beforeLive Translation languages are limited at launch$249 at AmazonSmartishSmartish Side Hustle MagSafe WalletFor the times when you're quickly running out and only need your phone, wallet and keys, you can combine the first two of those things by using a MagSafe wallet. Smartish's Side Hustle is a good option among many, thanks to its extra-strong magnets, space for up to three cards plus some cash and the thumb slot that makes it easy to access your stuff when you need it. The exterior is made of vegan leather so it looks pretty luxe as well. ProsStrong magnetsHas space for three cards and cashConsNo adhesive, so magnets are the only way to attach it to a device$28 at AmazonAnkerAnker Nano 30W USB-C ChargerWhile Apple’s 20W charger works just fine, you can opt for a more versatile adapter in Anker’s 30W Nano 3 charger. This USB-C power adapter is 70 percent smaller than Apple's, and it uses GaN technology to prevent overheating while fast charging. We also appreciate that its connector prongs flip down to make the adapter even more compact when you need to travel with it. ProsCompact designFast chargers iPhonesConsCable not included$17 at AmazonCherlynn Low for EngadgetApple Watch Series 11Read our full Apple Watch Series 11 review Apple didn’t add too many new features to the Watch Series 11 that would drastically change your daily experience with it, but it did make one crucial improvement: battery life. The Series 11 lasts longer than its predecessor, meaning you can not only get about one and a half days depending on your use, but also squeeze out more juice in low power mode or for your outdoor runs with GPS enabled. The Series 11 has basically the same thin and light design as the Series 10, which is comfortable enough to wear out on the streets and between the sheets. Its Sleep Score makes it easier to understand how to improve your rest, while background tools like high blood pressure alerts or blood oxygen measurements help keep tabs on your wellbeing and alert you to anomalies. Ultimately, for those using an iPhone, there is no better smartwatch. And even without Apple’s walled garden giving it an edge, the Series 11 is still one of the best smartwatches around thanks to its overall package of communications, health and wellness tools. — Cherlynn Low, Managing Editor ProsLonger battery life than last modelThin and light designComprehensive health monitoringNifty new wrist flick gestureThe best smartwatch for iPhone usersConsRelatively priceyThe Watch SE 3 is better for most people$399 at AmazonAnkerAnker Bio-Braided USB C to USB C Cable (240W,10ft)We’ve been fans of Anker’s charging cables for a long time and its Bio-Braided USB-C to C cable is no exception. This model supports a max output of 240W so you can use it with your new iPhone or a MacBook, an iPad and most other mobile devices that don’t work with a Lightning cable. It's also 10 feet long, giving you much more flexibility to use it even if you have to park yourself further away from your power source. Plus, it's made from a plant-based nylon that shouldn't crack under pressure — Anker boasts a 10,000-bend lifespan on this cable, so you can use it and abuse it without it failing on you for a long time. ProsSupport 240W of powerMade of plant-based nylonAvailable in 3-, 6-, and 10-feet lengthsConsDue to 240W support, one cable is a little pricey$17 at AmazonUGREENUGREEN MagFlow Qi2 3-in-1 Charger StationUGreen’s MagFlow Qi2 3-in-1 charger station offers a ton of value for $100. The company managed to build a trio charger that works well as a permanent fixture on your bedside table or desk, as well as a compact portable charging station. As the former, it takes up very little space when fully setup, and the magnetic phone charger can be tilt-adjusted up to 70 degrees so you can get the right viewing angle if you’re watching videos on your iPhone while charging. The Apple Watch charging pad is similarly adjustable, and the space that wirelessly powers up AirPods or other earbuds sits right in front of that. Since this is a Qi2 charger, it can power up an iPhone 16 from zero to 40 percent in roughly 30 minutes, so you won’t have to wait long before you can grab your phone and get going. The magnets are strong and allow you to use the phone in either portrait or landscape mode while it’s powering up, and when you’re done, you can fold the entire charging station flat and easily toss it in a bag to take with you. UGreen includes a USB-C to C cable and a 30W adapter in the box, so you’re given everything the station needs to power up all your devices as quickly as possible. Overall, this 3-in-1 charger station essentially gives you a unit you can easily take with you as much as you want, using it at work, at home and everywhere in between. ProsCompact, travel-friendly designQi2 compliantIncludes USB-C cable and 30W adapter in the boxConsIncluded USB-C cable is a tad short$100 at AmazonAnkerAnker MagGo Power Bank, Qi2 Certified 15WAnker's new MagSafe battery pack powered up a dead iPhone 15 to half full in about 45 minutes in our testing. Its 10,000mAh capacity means you'll get a couple of recharges out of it before it needs more juice itself, and we appreciate the strong MagSafe connection, too. Not only does this model provide a faster charge than our previous top pick, but it also has a handy kickstand that you can pop open to prop up your phone to watch views. The small digital display on the side of the battery pack conveniently tells you how much power is left in the bank, too. Admittedly, this portable charger is on the pricey side, but it's well worth it if you want a no-fuss, no-wires-necessary battery pack that can partially charge up your phone. Plus, you won’t need to fork out more money for additional cables as the power bank comes with an included USB-C cable, which you can plug into the USB-C port on the device and your iPhone 15. For something similar and more affordable, consider Anker's magnetic 5,000mAh battery pack instead. ProsQi2 tech enables extra fast wireless chargingSturdy kickstand props up iPhones as it chargesLED display for battery percentageConsMore expensive than other MagSafe packs$70 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$90 at Best BuySpigenSpigen Ultra Hybrid MagFitThere are many more MagSafe cases available now than there were just a year ago, and they run the gamut from affordable to quite expensive. You could always go with one of Apple’s first-party options, but just know that even if you like the style of the company’s silicone cover or its hard-shell clear cases, you can probably find a decent dupe for much less money. We’ve got a whole list of the best iPhone cases we’ve tried, and a good all-purpose option is Spigen’s Ultra Hybrid MagFit case. It’s a clear cover that has anti-yellowing properties, which should keep your iPhone looking clean and new for longer than other cases, and it'll work well with any screen protector you might already have on your phone. Raised edges help protect the screen and camera array from making too much contact with other surfaces, and you’ll be able to use it with any magnetic accessories you want. ProsEasy to installRaised edges to protect against contact with other surfacesAir Cushion Technology for shock absorptionConsOn the pricey side$13 at AmazonTwelve SouthTwelve South PowerBug Magnetic Qi2 Wireless Wall Mount ChargerThe PowerBug could be the best iPhone accessory you get if you're constantly fumbling with your phone while trying to watch YouTube or listen to a podcast when you're cooking in the kitchen or getting ready in the bathroom. It's a relatively compact puck that plugs into a wall outlet that you can than magnetically attach your phone to via MagSafe to charge it and see the screen more clearly. It's a Qi2 15W accessory, so it'll power up your phone quickly, and it puts your phone at a decent angle to watch videos and take FaceTime calls while you're doing other things. It's become something I use regularly in my kitchen so I can see my phone better while I'm cooking, and I anticipate using it a lot while traveling. On top of all that, it has a built-in 35W USB-C port, which allows you to connect and charge a second device, and it supports Standby Mode, too. ProsStrong magnets with 15W wireless chargingBuilt-in USB-C port to charge a second deviceCompact designConsA little pricey$50 at AmazonSpeckSpeck Car Mount with MagSafe and ClickLockThose of us with older vehicles don’t have the luxury of built-in CarPlay, but your iPhone can still help you navigate if you use a car mount like Speck’s MagSafe accessory. The MagSafe Car Vent Mount with ClickLock attaches to one of your car vents and can be positioned so you can easily see the directions on your iPhone’s screen while you’re driving. When we tested it, we noticed the magnets are quite strong, helping to prevent your handset from sliding off when you brake too hard or take a turn too quickly (and if you have a Speck ClickLock MagSafe charging case, you’ll fare even better). Once you have it installed in the right position for your car, an accessory like this should just blend in with the other tools on your dash and Speck’s mount does exactly that. It’s easy to readjust the viewing angle of your iPhone if needed, and there’s built-in cord management on the backside of the mount as well. ProsStrong magnetic hold on iPhonesSturdy hold on car ventsConsBest used with Speck ClickLock phone cases$20 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$20 at Target$20 at Best BuyPeak DesignPeak Design Mobile TripodPeak Design’s iPhone tripod is a solid, well-designed aluminum frame that folds into a credit card-sized shape. You’re paying a premium for the build design and quality, with a tiny hex key even built into the tripod legs for tightening them, if needed. With a solid micro-ball head, you can adjust the angle of your iPhone while it’s in tripod mode. Better still, it can firmly attach, magnetically, to the phone in both vertical and horizontal orientations. This makes it an excellent stand for your phone even when you’re not trying to shoot video or photos. You also don’t need to shell out for a Peak Design case to ensure it works, although it does feel more solidly connected if you do. Any MagSafe iPhone locks onto the peripheral, maintaining a solid hold on this mobile tripod whether in use or folded away. There are plenty of more affordable MagSafe phone stands, such as Moft’s Snap-On Stand and Wallet, which props up your iPhone while holding a few credit cards, Anker’s MagGo phone grip, and the now-ubiquitous PopSockets. While MagSafe accessories like these are convenient, they won’t be as sturdy as something securely snapped onto your smartphone or a smartphone case. All of the MagSafe stands, wallets, chargers, and other accessories I’ve tried eventually fell off if I applied enough force. However, there’s no sticky residue or the need to use a specific case with Peak Design’s tripod. — Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief ProsWell built with a compact designStrong magnetic hold on iPhonesConsExpensive$80 at Peak DesignAdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
