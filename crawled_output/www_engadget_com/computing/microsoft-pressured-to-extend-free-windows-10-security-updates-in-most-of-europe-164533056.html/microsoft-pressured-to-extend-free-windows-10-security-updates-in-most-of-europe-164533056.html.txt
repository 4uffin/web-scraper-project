On Wednesday, Microsoft backtracked on the strings it had attached to Windows 10's Extended Security Updates (ESU) program. However, it only did so in the European Economic Area (EEA) following complaints from an advocacy group. The elephant in the room? The EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) safeguards against unlawful bundling and restricting consumer choice. Had the company not relented, those regulations could have spawned investigations and hefty fines."In the European Economic Area, we’re making updates to the enrollment process to ensure it meets local expectations and delivers a secure, streamlined experience," a Microsoft spokesperson told Windows Central. "Our goal is to support customers and provide them with options as they transition to Windows 11, with uninterrupted access to critical security updates."The move stems from Microsoft's decisions regarding the future of Windows 10. In early 2023, the company said it would only support crucial security updates for the operating system until October 2025.MicrosoftSince then, the company launched the ESU program. It allows consumers to pay $30 to add a one-year extension on security updates. The Windows maker also added a couple of "free" options. The first one is to enable Windows cloud backup using a Microsoft account. However, that uses OneDrive. And once you surpass 5GB of free storage, you'll need to pay for more. (If you have a lot of big files to back up, that would likely apply.) The other option is to spend 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points, which not everyone has lying around.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementThe advocacy org Euroconsumers called out Microsoft in June. "Limiting security means limiting product life," the nonprofit wrote. It described Microsoft's Windows 10 requirements as "planned obsolescence." That's the practice of deliberately designing products with limited lifespans. Conveniently for Big Tech, that tends to boost sales. Inconveniently for consumers, it's an added cost.Planned obsolescence is also a term that could have drawn the ire of EU regulators. Tech titans like Microsoft found to violate the DMA can be forced to pay up to 10 percent of their global annual turnover.Euroconsumers said Microsoft was steering consumers toward two options. "Buy a new device before you're ready or stick with your current one and face increased security risks," it wrote. The group noted that 22 percent of EU PC owners still run a Windows device from 2017 or earlier. 2018 is often considered a rough baseline for Windows 11 eligibility, given the software's technical requirements.While PC users in the EEA now have an extra year, the rest of the world isn't so lucky. If you're still running Windows 10, you only have until October 14 to do one of three things: upgrade to Windows 11 (Microsoft's preferred choice), pay $30, turn on Windows backup, or fork over reward points. Choose wisely.AdvertisementAbout our adsAdvertisementAdvertisementSubscribe to our newsletter:The Morning After - A twice-weekly dose of the news you needBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.SubscribeBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Engadget's Terms andPrivacy Policy.AboutEngadget mastheadAbout our adsAdvertiseLicensingFAQRSS feedSectionsReviewsGearGamingEntertainmentTomorrowBuying guidesVideoPodcastsDealsContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds ContributeComment guidelinesSupportBuying GuidesBest laptopThe best iPadBest Bluetooth speakerBest E Ink tabletsBest wireless earbudsBest power banksBest gaming handhelds Follow Us© 2025 Yahoo.
