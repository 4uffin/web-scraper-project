The essential skill set for new front-end developers
Welcome to MDN Learning Web Development (also known as Learn). This resource provides a structured set of tutorials teaching the essential skills and practices for being a successful front-end developer, along with challenges and further recommended resources.

About Learn web development
Teaches the essential skills and knowledge every front-end developer needs for career success and industry relevance, as defined in the MDN Curriculum.
Created by the MDN community and refined with insights from students, educators, and developers from the broader web community.
Designed to take you from "beginner" to "comfortable" (not "beginner" to "expert"), giving you enough knowledge to use more advanced resources (such as the rest of MDN).
Note:
Last updated: August 2025 (see changelog).
Don't know where to get started?
Never coded before?
Our Getting started modules provide setup tutorials and essential concepts and background information for complete beginners. You should start here if you are a complete beginner (i.e., you've not installed a code editor or written any code yet).
Want to master the essentials?
Our Core modules provide a structured set of tutorials teaching the essential skills and practices for being a successful front-end developer.
Beyond the basics?
Our Extension modules cover useful additional skills to learn as you start to expand your knowledge and develop specialisms. Go onto these after you finish our Core.
Working at a school?
Use our modules to guide your teaching, check out our Educators page for more ideas, or enroll your students in Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career PathMDN learning partner.
Test your skills
Throughout the course, you'll find several articles designed to help you assess whether you have understood what we are teaching you in the course. There are two types:
"Test your skills" articles occur more frequently, and test your knowledge of a single isolated feature such as HTML links, the CSS box model, or JavaScript functions.
"Challenges" occur less frequently, and test your ability to use several features together to create a complete website or program of some kind.
Most of the questions feature HTML/CSS/JavaScript code blocks that show the starting code for each task. The recommended way to complete each one is to press the "Play" button in one of the code blocks to open the example in the MDN Playground and then edit the code according to the question instructions.
If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the Reset button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can (usually) view the solution at the bottom of each question section, or reach out for help.
Note:
If you'd prefer to work in your own editor or in an online editor (such as CodePen or JSFiddle), you can copy the code from the MDN Playground into your chosen environment.
Some questions don't include code blocks to start from, and instead ask you to download starter files to work on your local machine with. Sometimes this is due to the complex nature of the question, and sometimes we just wanted to change things up a bit.
Getting our code examples
The code examples you'll encounter in the Learning Area are all available on GitHub:
The easiest way to get them is to download a ZIP of the latest main code branch.
If you are familiar with Git and GitHub, you could also choose to clone the repository.
Contact us
If you want to get in touch with us about anything, use the communication channels. We'd love to hear from you about anything you think is wrong or missing on the site, requests for new learning topics, requests for help with items you don't understand, or any other questions or concerns.
