There’s something extra special about fall at Aldi. While many retailers sprinkle seasonal products throughout the store, Aldi places them together, creating an autumn wonderland with all of our favorite returning treats. In addition, the store cleverly pairs the goodies with the "aisle of shame," a section currently overflowing with fall-inspired kitchenware.
Recently, we came across a Reddit thread where fans shared their favorite fall products. Here’s a look at seven of the best Aldi finds shoppers can't wait to stock up on.
Top Groceries at Aldi To Celebrate Fall, According to Shoppers
Emporium Selection Goat Brie Cheese Log
Allrecipes / Aldi
Whether you’re serving it alongside a charcuterie board or spreading it on a slice of artisan bread, this cheese is sure to level up your snack time. This creamy log features Canadian goat’s milk and has a slight tang that makes it perfect for pairing with cured meats, herb crackers, and fresh fruit. Shoppers say they are also looking forward to snagging the Emporium Selection Truffle Goat Cheese Log, which is made with imported Italian truffles. In the Reddit discussion, one person asked how others eat the cheese, and one user offered up their favorite ways to serve it. "Crackers or baguette with prosciutto and sour cherry spread. I’ve also mixed it with mashed sweet potatoes and it makes an amazing savory cheesy mash!" they wrote.
Specially Selected Pumpkin Chipotle Pasta Sauce
Allrecipes / Aldi
This pasta sauce is a favorite among shoppers and it’s not hard to see why. The creamy sauce includes a blend of pumpkin, tomato paste, butter, and chipotle peppers, along with cozy seasonings like sage and nutmeg. "Pumpkin chipotle sauce is so good, we always stock up!" said one fan. Another replied to say that it’s a great choice for lasagna. We can see this being an excellent addition to a batch of pumpkin ravioli or a ground turkey skillet meal.
Berryhill Salted Caramel Apple Spread
Allrecipes / Aldi
If you like apple butter, you’ll love this extra-sweet twist. This caramel apple-inspired spread contains apple purée and apple juice concentrate for a true-to-name taste. When it was on shelves last year, one shopper gave the spread a glowing review. "I just tried the salted caramel apple and it’s the most delicious thing I have tasted this whole year." If salted caramel isn’t your favorite, you can try Berryhill Pumpkin Maple Spread instead. Fans have suggested using the spreads for toast, grilled cheese sandwiches, pastries, and on top of pumpkin spice waffles.
Deutsche Küche Cherry Frangipane Tart
Allrecipes / Aldi
Cherry isn’t technically a fall flavor, but shoppers are already setting their sights on Aldi’s Cherry Frangipane Tart. Almond lovers will appreciate the sweet yet subtle almond flavor, which is complemented by tart Morello cherries. "They [the tarts] are honestly my favorite thing from Aldi," wrote one Redditor. Some have already spotted these back on shelves, but if you would like a more traditional fall flavor, Aldi also stocks 14-ounce Deutsche Küche Apple Frangipane Tarts. One user chimed in to say that the apple one is "really good for not sharing and with two scoops of ice cream."
Barissimo Pumpkin Spice Barista Cold Foam
Allrecipes / Aldi
Pumpkin cold foam is a popular coffee shop option, but hitting the drive-thru every day can really add up. This cold foam lets you enjoy the trendy item for a fraction of the price. Aldi’s pumpkin cold foam starts with skim milk, cane sugar, and heavy cream, which gives it a rich, sweet taste. Add it to Stok Pumpkin Cold Brew for double the spiced flavor, or fill a glass with white chocolate and Barissimo Caramel Macchiato Iced Coffee for a drink that tastes like it came straight from your favorite shop.
Clancy's Pumpkin Spice Pretzels
Allrecipes / Aldi
These covered pretzels are the ultimate movie snack. Each crunchy pretzel is draped in an orange pumpkin spice yogurt-flavored confectionery coating that you can smell as soon as you open the bag. If you’re having a gathering, these make an ideal snack mix addition alongside pumpkin pie-flavored M&Ms and white chocolate muddy buddies. You can also snag Clancy’s Cinnamon Apple Pretzels, which are often located right next to the pumpkin variety.
Baker's Corner Fried Apples with Cinnamon
Allrecipes / Aldi
The next time you’re in the mood to bake something cozy, look no further than Baker’s Corner Fried Apples with Cinnamon. The options are endless with this budget-friendly can, which can be used as a fruit topping or a delightful side dish with pork chops. On Reddit, one user even had the idea to make mini pies using crescent dough. And if your fall days still feel like summer, Aldi’s canned fried apples can be used to make a refreshing ice cream sundae. Garnish with stovetop granola or a baked crumb topping for a pie-inspired treat that takes just minutes to prepare.
