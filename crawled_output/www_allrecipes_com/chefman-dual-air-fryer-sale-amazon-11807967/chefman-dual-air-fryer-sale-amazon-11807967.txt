Amazon Has a Ninja Lookalike Air Fryer That’s Over $100 Less
A "massive upgrade" at an affordable price.

I’d be lost without my trusty air fryer. It cuts down on my cooking time significantly since I don’t have to deal with my finicky oven, which is especially useful when I don’t want to heat my kitchen up in the summer. Whenever I reheat pizza or garlic bread, the crust remains pleasantly crispy instead of becoming a limp, soggy mess in the microwave.
However, my air fryer is on the smaller side, and I can only cook one thing at a time. When I interviewed Allrecipes Allstar Nicole Russell about her four air fryers, she mentioned that Ninja’s 8-quart Foodi Dual Zone was her favorite. Having two baskets means she can cook separate sides at different temperatures in one machine.
While Allstar Nicole highly recommends the Ninja Foodi, savvy Amazon shoppers found a similar dual air fryer at a more budget-friendly price.
Chefman 6-Quart Dual Basket Air Fryer

$100 at Amazon
Each basket of the Chefman's dual-basket air fryer holds up to 3 quarts, a decent size for cooking a side of fries, onion rings, roasted veggies, or seasoned potatoes. You could cook a salmon fillet in one basket and some lemony asparagus in the other for a full single-serve meal.
Unlike the Ninja Foodi, the Chefman has glass windows on the baskets so you can see inside. “The 'Easy View Windows' are perfect because, well, who doesn’t like to watch their food turn crispy golden without risking third-degree burns by opening the basket every two minutes, am I right?” said one enthusiastic five-star reviewer. Personally, I wish my air fryer had windows because opening it to check on the crispiness of my cheesy bread only adds to the cook time.
That same happy reviewer feels like a “culinary genius” and gushed about the Chefman’s Sync Finish feature, which helps when the foods in either basket have differing cook times or temperatures, and ensures it all gets on your table at the same time (while it’s still hot).“[It’s] like having an air fryer personal assistant,” they said. “Everything finishes cooking at the same time, so my meals are finally looking like a Pinterest board, not a buffet gone wrong.”
Many of the 5,000+ reviews mention that the air fryer is easy to use and clean. The nonstick plates don’t require much elbow grease for scrubbing, which is a huge win in my book since I hate cleaning. (On that note, I highly recommend getting some silicone air fryer liners. They’re dishwasher-safe and cut down on messes.)
One delighted customer described the Chefman dual air fryer as an “amazing addition” to their kitchen. They went so far as to say, “It's a massive upgrade from my previous air fryer, a Ninja-branded one, and I'm loving it.”
Chefman’s 6-quart air fryer is available for $100.
