Whenever there is a special occasion, my go-to breakfast is cinnamon rolls. Relatives in town? Cinnamon rolls. First day of school? Cinnamon rolls. Christmas morning? You guessed it–quiche. Just kidding. It’s cinnamon rolls.
And while I love the entire process of making them from scratch, it's an hours-long commitment. Premade cinnamon rolls, however, require less planning, and they make a great base for fall-flavored desserts, monkey bread, and even French toast casserole.
Recently, a new store-bought cinnamon roll caught my eye. It's not canned and is ready in less than 30 minutes. Even better, it comes from one of the most trusted brands in baking.
Pillsbury Launches Grands Frozen Cinnamon Rolls
Pillsbury is expanding its lineup with a new product, but you won't find it in either the refrigerated dough section or the baking aisle. On its way to shelves is Pillsbury Grands Frozen Cinnamon Rolls. Now, you can enjoy the soft, gooey flavor of a freshly baked pastry with less effort than ever before.
Each 30.5-ounce pouch has eight servings and includes your choice of Original Icing or Cream Cheese Icing for drizzling.
To prepare Pillsbury's frozen cinnamon rolls, all you have to do is place the rolls on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for around 30 minutes until golden brown—no fussing with cardboard tubes required. And you won't have to figure out how to properly store unused dough as you would with a tube of cinnamon rolls. You can simply take out the amount you wish to bake and place the extra dough back in the freezer.
On Instagram, food insider @markie_devo shared a photo of the new product, and the comment section quickly filled with excitement. "Exactly what we needed," noted one excited fan. "Now this is innovation," added another.

"They need to come out with an extra icing package!" chimed in another person, whose comment received over 50 likes on the social media platform.
If you find yourself in need of extra icing, you can whip up a homemade batch of classic vanilla icing in just minutes. Plus, with just a few extra ingredients, you can customize it to make it orange glaze, chocolate-flavored, or stick with the tried-and-true cream cheese cinnamon roll icing. It might not be as convenient as the store-bought version, but when you're drizzling the extra on top of your cinnamon roll, you'll be glad you made the effort.
Pillsbury's Grands Frozen Cinnamon Rolls are available now at select retailers nationwide. Be sure to make some extra space in your freezer and stock up because this shortcut is sure to come in clutch when you need it most.
