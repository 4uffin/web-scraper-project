Attention all snackers, you’ll want to get your Costco membership card out immediately. The club store is constantly stocking its shelves with bulk-sized versions of our favorite sweet and savory snacks, from the Kirkland Signature Cashew Clusters to the Korean Sweet & Spicy Puffs.
Now, some Costco shoppers have spotted a new addition to the pretzel aisle—and it’s making frequent flyers extremely happy.
Costco now carries a 32-ounce bag of Stellar Pretzel Braids, according to a Reddit post. If the brand name isn’t ringing a bell, the packaging might, especially for those who fly Southwest Airlines.
Costco Now Sells Stellar Snacks Maui Monk Pretzel Braids
The seasoned pretzel twists have been offered on board Southwest flights for more than a year. Stellar Snacks’ pretzels are similar to the fan-favorite Dot’s Pretzels in that they’re coated in a buttery, flavored seasoning. However, Stellar Pretzel Braids are vegan and Non-GMO certified—and offered in different flavors than Dot’s.
Stellar's Pretzel Braids come in five flavors—but the most popular (thanks to the plane snack) is the Maui Monk variety. Stellar’s Maui Monk Pretzel Braids are made with vegan butter and seasoned with Maui Onion Style Seasoning and monk fruit. Monk fruit is a zero-calorie sweetener option that you’ll find in many "better-for-you" snacks and drinks.
Fans say they’ve "always dreamed" the pretzels would show up at Costco, and now they have. Costco is selling the pretzels for $9.99 per bag, and everyone (including us) is stocking up.

"Oh no, these are dangerous if I see them at Costco. They are delicious," one Reddit user wrote.
"Do not buy these…You will not be able to stop eating them," posted another.
"Seriously! There are 33 servings per bag, but I definitely did not open that bag more than ten times before it was gone," another fan added.
Allrecipes News Editor Andrea Lobas says she can finish an entire bag herself—and I tend to agree. As a longtime Dot’s and seasoned pretzel fan, when I get these on a Southwest flight, I savor every second of the tiny package before it’s gone. Now, I won’t even need to book a flight to eat as many Stellar Maui Monk Pretzel Braids as my heart desires.
