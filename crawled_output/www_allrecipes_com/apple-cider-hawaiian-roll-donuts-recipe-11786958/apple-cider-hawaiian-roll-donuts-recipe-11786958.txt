Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 12 servings
1 (12-count) package) Hawaiian rolls
1 cup apple pie filling
2 (0.74 ounce) pouches apple cider powdered drink mix (such as Alpine Spiced Apple Cider®)
5 tablespoons butter, divided
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Separate Hawaiian rolls and cut a 1/2-inch slit in the side of each one. Use a finger or the end of a spoon to create a larger opening and a space large enough to fill each roll with about 1 tablespoon filling.
Roughly chop apple pie filling and add to a bowl. Stir in 1 packet apple cider mix. Spoon filling into the prepared rolls.
Melt 4 tablespoons butter and brush each roll on all sides with melted butter. Place rolls on a lined baking sheet.
Bake rolls in the preheated oven until lightly toasted and golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes.
Meanwhile, stir together remaining apple cider packet, sugar, and cinnamon in a shallow dish and melt remaining butter.
Brush tops of rolls evenly with melted butter and coat each roll in sugar mixture.
