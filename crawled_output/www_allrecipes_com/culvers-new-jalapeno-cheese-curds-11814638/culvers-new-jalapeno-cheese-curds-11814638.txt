Key Takeaways
Culver's is bringing back a fan-favorite burger, but only for a limited time.The chain is also celebrating National Cheese Curd Day on Oct. 15 by introducing a spicy new flavor of its beloved cheese curds.
It’s hard to say which menu item at Culver’s is the best. Is it the chain’s creamy custard used for scoops, shakes, and Concrete Mixers? Or is it the ButterBurger, a 100 percent beef patty piled high with fresh toppings? For many, it’s the cheese curds. All it takes is a single bite into one of Culver's real Wisconsin Cheddar cheese curds to understand why fans can't get enough.
In fact, the fried curds are so loved, that Culver’s created National Cheese Curd Day in 2015 to honor the iconic side dish. But one day just isn’t enough to celebrate. So this year, Culver’s is kicking off its first-ever Curdtoberfest, a month-long celebration filled with prizes, Curdtoberfest-themed decor, and two limited-time menu items you won’t want to miss.
Culver’s Brings Back the CurderBurger and Launches New Jalapeño Cheese Curds
Starting Sept. 29, guests can once again order Culver’s CurderBurger. The burger got its start as an April Fool’s Day prank in 2021, but received such a positive response from fans that the chain added it to the menu—and now it’s back for the fifth year in a row.
Culver's
The unique, ultra-cheesy sandwich features lettuce, tomato, pickle, red onion, mayo, and a fresh beef patty topped with a massive golden fried cheese curd patty. Culver’s CurderBurger will be available for just over two weeks, concluding its annual run on Oct. 14.
If you can’t make it to the drive-thru in time, don’t worry, because the Wisconsin-based chain has another cheesy surprise in store. Starting Oct. 15, guests can order Jalapeño Cheese Curds. The new spicy curds combine bits of jalapeño with real Cheddar cheese curds for a poppable side dish that hits all the right notes. Culver’s Jalapeño Cheese Curds will only be available while supplies last, and will make their official exit on Oct. 31.

"It's a month packed with cheesy goodness, Midwest pride and a lot of fun."
Be sure to snag these deep-fried favorites while you can, and keep an eye out for Culver’s upcoming sweepstakes where you can enter to win a year’s supply of Wisconsin Cheese curds.
