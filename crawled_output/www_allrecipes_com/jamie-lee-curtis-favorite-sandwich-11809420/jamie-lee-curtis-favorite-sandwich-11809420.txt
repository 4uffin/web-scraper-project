Jamie Lee Curtis Calls This 3-Ingredient Sandwich Her 'Love Language'
The way to her heart is through her stomach.

Jamie Lee Curtis is renowned for her ability to flip roles, as exhibited by her work in films like "Trading Places," "Freaky Friday," and "Freakier Friday." But come lunchtime, there's no one else she'd rather be than herself alongside her husband, Christopher Guest, who whips up her favorite sandwich.
Tackling the iconic first question of "The Colbert Questionert" during a recent episode of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," Curtis was quick to answer when Colbert asked, "What is the best sandwich?"
"Peanut butter and jelly," she responds with authority. "PB&J. It is the only thing Christopher Guest knows how to make, and it is our love language."
Jamie Lee Curtis' Love Story With PB&J—and Her Husband
Curtis and her husband, Guest—who have been married for almost 41 years—bonded over food since they first met. Curtis initially spotted a photo of Guest in Rolling Stone magazine in 1984. This is right around the time of the debut of "This Is Spinal Tap," a movie in which Guest acted in and co-wrote.
At the time, Curtis told a friend, "I'm going to marry that guy," and proceeded to pass along her number to Guest's agent. But, he didn't call. Then, one night, they both happened to be at the same restaurant. After an awkward run-in, in which Curtis mentioned leaving her number with no sign of a call back—only to receive silence in return—Guest called the next day, and they had their first date soon after.
"That was June 28, 1984, and I married him four months later, on Dec. 18," Curtis recalls in a 2015 Interview magazine feature. Many meals, memories, and two kids later (they share daughters Annie and Ruby), their sweet bond continues.

On the couple's 40th anniversary, Curtis shared a touching tribute on Instagram, explaining that when they wed, "we loved each other but barely knew each other. Today, we know each other really well and still love each other...We held hands that day as we walked back down the aisle, and we're still holding hands today."
That is, unless Guest is assembling her favorite sandwich, which is made simply with bread, peanut butter, and jelly.

Curtis also likes to keep the PB handy for another one of her favorite snacks. Later on in the 15-question quiz, Colbert inquires, "apples or oranges." Curtis reveals that she's a superfan of crunchy—not mealy—apples, like Galas. Bonus points if it's paired with peanut butter.
To book-end the menu for Curtis' perfect PB&J-filled day, she starts with the option of a fresh and light yogurt with granola breakfast. Then, for dinner, Guest might join her at one of her favorite restaurants in the Los Angeles area, Dear John's, so the couple can share Caesar salad, shrimp cocktail, and steak. And for dessert? Perhaps it's time for a slice of Curtis' three-ingredient boxed cake mix creation.
Jamie is a cook and eater after our own hearts. And with that tempting culinary lineup as part of the script, we'd be happy to trade places with her any time. Until then, we'll continue making our own peanut butter and jelly sandwiches at home.
