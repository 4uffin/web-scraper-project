It's hard to name a better deal out there than the Costco rotisserie chicken. Priced at just $5, the chicken is reason enough to maintain a Costco membership (though the bakery section proves its worth weekly, too). And while we all know it's delicious as-is, there are so many ways to get creative with a rotisserie chicken at dinnertime.
We challenged Nicole McLaughlin to take the beloved Costco chicken to new heights, and she delivered. From a viral creamy casserole to comforting soup and even a food court copycat, these quick and easy dinners all start with the same $5 chicken, but transform it into so much more.
All five of these easy chicken dinners start with shredded rotisserie chicken, so go ahead and shred it (using a Costco employee-approved hack!), then let's get to cooking.

Million Dollar Chicken Casserole
Peyton Beckwith
As soon as Nicole dubbed this recipe "the ultimate dump-and-go dinner," we were sold. And it's gone viral several times over for a reason; it comes together in no time, can be made ahead of time, and is a bona fide crowd-pleaser.
This "million dollar-worthy" recipe pairs convenience staples—Costco's rotisserie chicken and canned cream of chicken soup—with comforting casserole standards like cream cheese and sour cream. Buttery Ritz crackers provide the ultimate crunchy contrast for all that creamy goodness. And it's earned nearly 150 five-star reviews to back up the hype.

Crabless Chicken Cakes
Peyton Beckwith
Don't let these crabless "crab" cakes fool you—or maybe do. While they may look just like crab cakes, they're even more family-friendly and easy to make. Tartar sauce, cracker crumbs, parsley, and hot sauce give these chicken cakes a seafood vibe, all without the seafood price tag.
McLaughlin swaps tartar sauce for more mayo mixed with a tablespoon of relish, fresh parsley for dried, and adds a dash of lemon pepper seasoning to amp up that crab cake flavor.
"While it's not a crab cake, it definitely satisfies that crab cake craving," according to McLaughlin, especially when paired with a side salad and squeeze of fresh lemon.

Creamy Green Curry Chicken Ramen
Peyton Beckwith
It might sound fancy, but this dish relies on pantry staples with a few flavor boosters to create a restaurant-quality meal. Green curry paste can typically be found in the grocery store in the international aisle and contains all the aromatics and flavorings to create a Thai-inspired curry dish in minutes.
Coconut milk and chicken stock form the base of this soup, which gets filled with rotisserie chicken, ramen noodles (minus the seasoning packet), and veggies—in this case, snow peas and red peppers. The whole thing comes together in just 30 minutes—less time than it takes to get takeout.

Copycat Costco Chicken Bake
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
What better way is there to use a Costco rotisserie chicken than by emulating what Costco does with its leftover chickens? While it's not confirmed, many suspect Costco repurposes its leftover rotisserie chicken and pizza dough into the food court favorite, the Chicken Bake. That's just called being resourceful.
Nicole takes the same approach, using canned pizza dough, shredded Costco chicken, cooked bacon, and Caesar dressing to create copycat chicken bakes that might just beat the real thing.

Marry Me Chicken Soup
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Tired of the same chicken and rice dinner? Why not turn that a rotisserie chicken into something totally different? Inspired by the ever-popular Marry Me Chicken, this creamy chicken noodle soup features the same flavor profile with sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, basil, and Parmesan cheese.
"This is one of those soups that's so special, you can entertain with it. It tastes like it cooked all day, but it didn't," according to McLaughlin. And if you had any doubt, she confirms: "It is indeed a 10 out of 10."
