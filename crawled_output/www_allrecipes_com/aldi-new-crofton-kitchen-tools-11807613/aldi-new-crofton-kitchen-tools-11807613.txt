Week after week, Aldi provides quality foods and reliable products with prices that can't be beat. It’s a great place to stock up on staples as well as the occasional fun find. But Aldi doesn’t just save us money on groceries. We can snag plenty of home goods, appliances, and cookware for less, too.
Aldi’s Crofton brand has provided us with some of the best copycats of all time. Crofton’s beautiful Dutch ovens allow us to cook big batches of chili or bake loaves of artisanal sourdough bread. TheCrofton Acacia Utensils give us Crate & Barrel vibes for less. And Crofton’s cast-iron Lodge copycats can perfectly cook up juicy steaks and go from stove top to oven in a flash.
For this week’s Aldi Finds, Crofton is rolling out some must-have kitchen tools. They look very similar to popular Oxo products, but save us some serious cash—up to 75 percent off the brand-name price.
Aldi’s New Crofton Kitchen Tools Under $5
Allrecipes / Aldi
Garlic presses, peelers, and can openers are kitchen MVPs. They are products we use every day. Therefore, we try to find the best possible versions of these tools so we can use them comfortably for years to come. And this week, Aldi has all three. The Crofton Garlic Press, Large Peeler, and Can Opener look very similar to Oxo's version of these tools. And, like Oxo, shoppers say Aldi's offering has great function and comfort (Hello, soft grip handles.) at a significantly lower price.
The Crofton Large Peeler features a "wide blade for peeling large vegetables with tough skin," according to Aldi. The wide blade is great for shredding cabbage or peeling potatoes, but it’s still easy enough to wield for carrots, apples, or other smaller fruits and vegetables. It features a soft-grip handle and is top-rack dishwasher safe.
"I bought this veggie peeler and am very impressed with it," shared a fan on Facebook, who reviewed an earlier version of this product. "The handle has a nice weight and peels carrots easily." The new peeler is priced at $4.99 and is available in both black and jade colors. A similar Oxo version sells for $13.99—nearly three times the price.
The Crofton Garlic Press can "easily crush garlic cloves for minced garlic," according to Aldi. It also features a soft-grip handle and is top-rack dishwasher safe. Like the peeler, it's available in black and jade and is priced at $4.99. Its Oxo counterpart sells for $20.99.
The Crofton Can Opener not only opens steel or tin cans, but it "includes a convenient bottle opener on the head of the can opener," according to Aldi. The Crofton version sells for $4.99, while the similar Oxo can opener sells for $19.99. Like the other Crofton kitchen tools, it's available in both black and jade, features a soft-grip handle, and is safe to wash in the top rack of the dishwasher.

"I wish I’d bought at least two, just in case," shared one Facebook fan, who reviewed an earlier version of this product. "I bought one and it’s the best ever," added another shopper.
But these products won’t last long. As it goes with all Aldi Finds, these items are only available for one week, from Sept. 17-23. So make sure to browse the Aldi Finds aisle now for these great copycats.
