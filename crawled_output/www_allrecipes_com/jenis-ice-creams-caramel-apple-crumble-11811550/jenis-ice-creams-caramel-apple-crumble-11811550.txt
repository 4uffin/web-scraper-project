A little healthy competition between brands isn't always a bad thing. Dunkin' comes for Starbucks, Sonic dupes McDonald's, McDonald's releases a popular Chick-fil-A copycat, and the cycle continues. For consumers, this competition often means more options at more places, so we won't complain. And it's not only fast food—Grocery brands often release similar items to entice new customers with a familiar product.
When I saw this new ice cream flavor, I instantly thought of a popular Tillamook flavor that captures the essence of apple season in a tub of creamy ice cream. This latest release from Jeni's Ice Creams has a similar flavor profile to the Tillamook version, but with one important (and delicious) addition.
Introducing Jeni's Ice Creams Caramel Apple Crumble
Allrecipes / Jeni's
Caramel Apple Crumble is the latest autumnal inclusion in the brand's fall lineup. It features an apple ice cream base, apple puree, apple juice concentrate, streaks of dark caramel sauce, and bunches of brown sugar-oat crumble throughout. The Jeni's Ice Creams dessert reminds us of the beloved Tillamook Apple Crisp ice cream, which has a vanilla base, apple pieces, and oat crumbles.
According to Jeni’s Ice Creams, the new flavor marries "red and green apples with apple essence and creates an ice cream that captures the refreshing brightness of an orchard-fresh fruit." The addition of the caramel streaks evokes hints of caramel apple, and the oat crumble makes the ice cream taste more like a full and delicious Apple Crumble dessert.
The Caramel Apple Crumble is a new product, and it joins Miso Butterscotch Brownie, Darkest Chocolate, Brown Butter Almond Brittle, and Skillet Cinnamon Roll in the Jeni's Ice Creams Fall Collection for 2025.
"Thank you for the new fall flavor," said one reviewer. "I love the [Caramel] Apple Crumble with its caramel twist. It was great." Other Reddit reviewers note that the ice cream tastes "too tart," and lacks that classic autumnal flavor we associate with traditional apple crumbles, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. "The apple flavor was very well done and crisp indeed, but overall it was a tad boring and lacking warm spices," admits one Redditor.

But for those who love the crispy apple taste, this ice cream will likely be a hit. "The fresh apple taste is so good," gushes one Redditor. "I'm also dealing with the sadness of Starbucks discontinuing the Apple Crisp Macchiato, so this is a good replacement to fill that void right now."
If you love the bright tartness of a fresh apple, then we recommend that you try the ice cream before the season is over. It's sold in individual pints for $12 online, and can be found at Jeni's locations across the country.
