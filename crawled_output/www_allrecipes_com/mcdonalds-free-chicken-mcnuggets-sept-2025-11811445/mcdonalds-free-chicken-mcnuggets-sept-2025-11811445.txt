Key Takeaways
McDonald’s is offering a free Chicken McNuggets Meal every day from select locations from Sept. 16 through Oct. 5.However, the deal comes with some conditions.
When it comes to fast food, I’ll never say no to a classic cheeseburger. Obviously, I have my opinions about which chain has the best burgers (and fries to match), but I’m really not picky when hitting the drive-thru. Whether it’s Wendy’s or Taco Bell, I’m almost always down—but my soft spot when it comes to fast food is, without a doubt, McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets.
As a kid, my go-to Happy Meal included the 4-piece McNuggets. Now, as an adult, I’m always itching for the perfect excuse to indulge in pure nostalgia and swing through McD’s for some nuggets, from a new sauce to a meal deal. And now that we’re halfway through September, McDonald’s is giving fans the ideal reason to get chicken nuggets—and, spoiler alert, they’re free.
How To Get Free McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets
Allrecipes / McDonald's
The only thing better than a McDonald’s 10-Piece Chicken McNuggets Meal? When the whole meal is free. But forget one free meal—what about 21 days' worth of Chicken McNuggets meals, at no cost? The Golden Arches are teaming up with Amazon ahead of Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days and offering fans exactly that from Sept. 16 through Oct. 5.
That's right, every day for the next three weeks, you'll be able to get a free 10-piece Chicken McNuggets Meal, which includes medium fries and a medium drink, at participating restaurants. This totals approximately 200 discounted Chicken McNuggets, which is an absolute steal.
No promo code is required to score the deal, but there is one catch: This offer is available exclusively to Amazon Prime Members. If that's you, you can take advantage of the deal by using your free Grubhub+ membership, which comes with your Prime account, to cash in on this promotion.

Why Does McDonald's Ketchup Taste Better Than Others?
To redeem your free McDonald's, just add the 10-piece Chicken McNuggets Meal to your cart on Amazon.com, the Amazon Shopping app, or the Grubhub app, and the cost will be automatically removed and applied as a reward credit. Additionally, there is a $20 minimum and a limit of one free McNuggets meal per day.
To maximize your savings, be sure to order via Amazon and GrubHub ahead of Prime’s Big Deal Days. And though it will come at a cost, I highly recommend ordering the secret menu affogato while you’re relishing in your free nuggets.
Whether you’re cozying up for fall, locking in for game day, or preparing for Halloween activities, nothing hits the spot like having McNuggets delivered straight to your door.
