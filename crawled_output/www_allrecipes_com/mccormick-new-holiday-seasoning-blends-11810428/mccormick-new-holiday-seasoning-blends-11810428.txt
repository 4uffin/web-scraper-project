Meet your new seasonal shortcuts.

We’re nearing that time of year when, for better or worse, cooking skills really take center stage. Maybe you’ve got the basics down, but you haven’t landed on that secret ingredient that makes your dishes stand out. Let’s just say, in holidays past, no one’s been lining up to ask for your recipe.
Don’t worry—you’re not alone. Holiday dishes take years to perfect, and most of us don’t have time to fine-tune turkey gravy or green bean casserole before the big day.

That’s where McCormick comes in. This year, the brand is offering home cooks a holiday cheat code: five new, first-of-its-kind spice blends that add instant flavor (without much room for error).
McCormick Launches New Holiday Seasoning Blends
Unlike last year’s limited-edition blends (which were all about holiday baking), McCormick’s latest collection is focused on the savory side of the table, with five new seasonings designed to elevate your holiday dinners.
Whether you’re looking to give your go-to recipes a little boost or totally reinvent them, McCormick’s new flavors are ready to help with options for everything, from snacks to sides to the star of the table. There’s a seasoning blend for every dish the season throws at you:
Brown Butter Gravy: A rich, savory blend that makes the perfect base for turkey gravy, mushroom sauces, or a drizzle over warm biscuits.
Pumpkin Chili: A cozy blend of sweet, spicy, and savory notes that tastes like it simmered all day—even when it didn’t.
Green Bean Casserole: Ensures the classic casserole tastes as good as mom used to make it—if not better.
Sweet & Spicy Holiday Party Mix: A just-right balance of sweet and heat for an addictive snack mix.
Brown Sugar Ham Glaze: Adds a festive sweetness to ham, roasted carrots, or even warm dinner rolls.
Each mix comes in a 1.25-ounce packet, with a suggested retail price of $1.99. Some flavors have already been spotted in stores, although according to McCormick, the seasoning packets don’t officially roll out for another couple of weeks. The Brown Butter Gravy, Pumpkin Chili, and Green Bean Casserole will be widely available by Oct. 15, while the winter flavors—Sweet & Spicy Holiday Party Mix and Brown Sugar Ham Glaze—will follow in mid-November.
So if this is the year you want to step up your holiday game—whether it’s with a snack mix that becomes your signature gift or a pumpkin chili your family requests again and again—these McCormick blends might just become your new pantry staples.
