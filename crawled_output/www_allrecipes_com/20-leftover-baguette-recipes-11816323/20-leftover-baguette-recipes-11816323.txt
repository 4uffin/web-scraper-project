Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside—sometimes it doesn't get better than a classic French-style baguette. Not only are they delightful with butter and sliced lengthwise to make a sandwich, but they're endlessly versatile. Leftover and stale baguette bread can make perfect bread pudding, breakfast casserole, or on its own and toasted up for soups, crostini, and more.

"Excellent recipe! I’ve used it now for a couple of years, only I just use sea salt rather than garlic," says Allrecipes member Heart of Old. "I found that slicing and freezing the baguette one day, then preparing on a different day, spreads the work time."

Baguette Pizza
TheDailyGourmet
"Used Italian bread because that’s what I had on hand. Omitted sausage, used pepperoni, green onions and scattered fresh chopped rosemary on top. Was really good. Reminded me of Stouffer’s French bread pizza from way back when, only this tastes better. This is worth making for lunch, snacks or quick meal." —TraciAnn And BB
