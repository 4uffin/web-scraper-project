Key Takeaways
Taco John's is joining one of fast food’s hottest battles and introducing a crispy new handheld that gives McDonald's Snack Wrap some serious competition.The chain is also rolling out more ways to save by introducing three of its digital-exclusive value meals to in-store locations.
One of the great things about fast food chains competing with each other is that the customer always wins. The chicken sandwich wars resulted in a plethora of delicious new sandwich options. Then, when sauce-covered chicken nuggets became the center of attention, we got two tailgate-friendly snack options from KFC and Wendy’s.
More recently, the snack wrap war reignited after Popeyes, McDonald’s, and Sonic all launched versions of the handheld—and the competition shows no signs of slowing down.
Now, a Midwest favorite taco shop is entering the ring with its own crispy wrap, and it’s cheaper than any we’ve seen yet.
Taco John’s Introduces New Jr. Crispy Chicken Wraps
Jr. Crispy Chicken Wraps just hit menus at Taco John’s. The warm chicken wraps are available in two flavors, Ranch and Spicy. Each contains all-white-meat chicken fried to golden perfection. The crispy tender is nestled into a warm flour tortilla and topped with lettuce, shredded cheese, and ranch. The main difference between the two wraps is that the spicy version includes sliced jalapeño peppers.
Taco John's
Taco John’s Jr. Crispy Chicken Chicken Wraps are just $1.79 each, but become even cheaper when you buy two. For a limited time, the wraps are available as a 2-for-$3 Mix & Match Deal, which brings the cost down to just $1.50 each.
And if you’re hungrier for more than just a snack wrap, you can snag Taco John’s new meal deal, which features two Jr. Crispy Chicken Wraps and Jr. Potato Olés for just $5. Considering how good the Potato Olés are, you will definitely want to upgrade to a meal.

More Deals at Taco John’s
Fans will be happy to know that the chain has also taken three budget-friendly meals off the digital exclusive menu and made them available for in-person ordering. Taco John’s $5, $7, and $9 Meal Steals include a variety of popular menu items, plus your choice of a drink.
Here’s what’s included in each:
$5 Meal Steal: Crispy Beef Taco, Bean Burrito, Jr. Potato Olés, and a small fountain drink$7 Meal Steal: Two Crispy Beef Tacos, Nacho Crunch Beef Burrito, Jr. Potato Olés, and a small fountain drink$9 Meal Steal: Super Crispy Beef Taco, Chicken Stuffed Grilled Taco, Jr. Potato Olés, Churro, and a small fountain drink
So, if you don’t already have dinner plans, be sure to head to Taco John’s to snag one of these unbeatable deals, and see how the new Jr. Crispy Chicken Wrap stacks up against your other fast food favorites. And while you’re there, grab a taco too. After all, Taco John’s Crispy Taco was the winner of our fast food tacos taste test.
