Marry Me Chicken Pasta Bake
Allrecipes
"Easy and delicious...I also didn't have jarred sun dried tomatoes, only the dry kind—I rehydrated them by adding a bit of boiling water to the pan with the white wine and letting it boil off, then soaking the ones for the top of the casserole in boiling water for about 15 minutes before draining and topping. My husband is obsessed." –Grocery Addict

Chicken Noodle Casserole
Allrecipes / Abbey Littlejohn
"This is honestly one of my absolute favorite casseroles ever!! I've been making it for years. The only change I have to make is make is that my husband doesn't like mushrooms (they don't like him either), so I just use two cans of Cream of Chicken soup. I absolutely love it!!" —vickyshea

Creamy Chicken Piccata Pasta Bake
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Made with bright lemon and briny capers, this piccata pasta bake is creamy and cheesy, too. Alfredo pasta sauce, ricotta, and parmesan make for a winning combo—and chicken breasts offer some heartiness and protein.

Easy Creamy Chicken Casserole
Danielle K
"I have made this forever- it was our family’s chicken casserole. We use 1 can cream of chicken, one can of cream of celery or mushroom, 8oz of sour cream. 2 large chicken breasts shredded. Sounds too simple to be good but always a favorite. Some of the family serves over rice, some of us egg noodles!" —GlitzyFork2134

Mamaw’s Chicken and Rice Casserole

Over the several times I've made this, I've enjoyed toying with additions - green onions, crumbled bacon, mixed veggies, etc.Give it a shot and make it your own!" —LimeJelly3197

Salsa Chicken
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
"This recipe was so easy and delicious! First, I soaked the chicken in buttermilk for a couple hours and cut the breasts in half. Also added some chopped onion on top of salsa before baking. Unfortunately I can’t recommend a store-bought salsa as I used homemade salsa I bought from a single mom who lost her government job recently. Saved to my favorites! Served with charro beans, calabacitas, chips, & guacamole" —Roz
