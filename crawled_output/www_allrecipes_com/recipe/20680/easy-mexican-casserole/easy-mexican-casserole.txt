This taco casserole with ground beef and tortilla chips is easy to make and very tasty. I often substitute with ground turkey and low-fat dairy products, and it's still delicious! Serve this casserole with chips, salsa, and green salad.

Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise
“This is absolutely delicious,” raves one Allrecipes community member. “I made it once exactly as is and the kids wanted it again the next day, so I had to substitute corn instead of chili beans. That was also delicious.”
“Very tasty and flavorful,” according to another reviewer. “We added taco seasoning and a 6-ounce can of chopped green chiles to the meat/bean mixture.”
“I’ve made it twice,” says Dean Gapp. “Once with ground beef and the other with shredded chicken. Great easy dish! Endless possibilities for modifications.”

Needs more flavor
Might try again
OK with tweaks
Use some flavor and consider giving little bit less of tomato salsa and sour cream

I added a few squirts of lime juice to my serving and I am going to top with avocado next time I make it.

Great flavors
Taco and nacho marriage! Tasty and easy to alter for each diner/mini casserole dish. I may add some seasoning to the meat next time as I, personally, didn't think the salsa was quite enough, but the rest of the family was quite pleased. Will definitely be making it again.

Just made it for the first time. Very tasty although I think the next time I make it I think I'm going to add more tomatoes and green onions. I'm not a big fan of black olives so I think I'll omit them next time

A keeper!
I didn’t have chili beans so I drained a can of pinto beans. My husband does not care for sour cream so I put it on the side. So delicious.

Great flavors
Easy to follow
This was a great recipe if you're in the mood for Mexican flavors. I used plant meat instead of beef, I used 1/2 the sour cream and 1/2 the cheese. I added a taco seasoning packet, green chiles, 1/2 onion. And as another reviewer suggested I layered the tortillas just below the cheese so they wouldn't get soggy.
