Festival-Style Grilled Italian Sausage Sandwiches

These delicious grilled sausage sandwiches are my attempt to duplicate the ones I ate when I was growing up and attended Italian street festivals in the North End of Boston. They come together really quickly, and make a great summer lunch. Choose hot or mild sausages as you prefer.

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 4 servings
4 (4 ounce) links hot Italian sausage
1
red bell pepper, halved and seeded
1 small onion, peeled and cut in half crosswise
2 teaspoons olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
4 (6 inch) sandwich rolls, split and toasted
Directions
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Lightly oil grate, and set 4 inches from the heat.
Pierce the sausages in a few places with a fork, and set aside. Slice off the bottoms of the onion halves so they will sit flat on the grill. Brush the bell pepper and onion halves with 2 teaspoons of olive oil.
Place the sausages, onions, and peppers on the preheated grill. Cook and turn the sausages until well browned and juices run clear. Cook vegetables until tender and peppers are slightly charred. Remove vegetables and sausages from the grill.
Place the peppers in a paper bag, close, and cool slightly. Remove and discard the charred skin from the peppers; slice peppers into strips. Slice the onion halves. Place salt and pepper to taste, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a bowl. Add the peppers and onions, and toss until evenly coated. To serve, place sausages in sandwich rolls, and top with the pepper and onion mixture.

Delicious! I didn’t bother with the paper bag for the peppers, just put everything on a plate, covered with foil for a few minutes and the charred skins slid right off. I also didn’t pierce the sausages, they popped open on their own. Topped with some brown mustard and banana peppers, just like the fair!

Really yummy and just like at the fair.
I doubled the sausages and used 2 whole onions and 4 bell peppers - red, green, orange, and yellow. So good!

This was very good. I think I might have cooked the onions too much but it tasted very Google

Other than maybe Bobby Flay, I can think of no better grill master than hubby - and he says, "Don't poke the sausages!" Grill them over medium coals, till browned on all sides, about 12 minutes. They will be perfectly juicy and have that delightful "snap" when you bite into them. This sandwich is nothing new for us, but grilling the peppers and onions made all the difference in the world. Until now I had always cooked them in a skillet and while that's delicious too, it is no substitute for what the submitter intended in this recipe. I was really amazed at the difference the roasted, charred peppers and onions made, in color as well as taste. Out of this world good!
