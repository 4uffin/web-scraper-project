My variation of an old Southern Living recipe - a double recipe will fill a Dutch oven and make plenty for an extended family dinner.

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 6 servings
1 pound lean ground beef
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce
1 (14 ounce) can petite diced tomatoes
2 cups water
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
7 ounces whole wheat spaghetti
¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste (Optional)
Directions
Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard excess grease.
Stir in tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, water, chili powder, oregano, and black pepper. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and let simmer, stirring often, for about 30 minutes.
Break spaghetti into thirds and add to the pot; cover and simmer, stirring often, until pasta is tender, about 20 minutes. Serve topped with Parmesan cheese.

First; ignore the nasty reviews for a recipe they didn’t make or upset about pasta etiquette. Second; put aside your preconceived ideas of what spaghetti should taste like. I also initially thought “chili powder?!?” But rolled with it and glad I did!! We thought this was excellent! Followed ingredients EXACTLY except I always season my ground beef with S&P - regardless if stated in the recipe. I also made an oops. 😬 I misread step two about letting the sauce simmer first for 20 min before adding the pasta and simmering some more. I (mis)read it to bring to simmer, added the spaghetti and cover and simmer for 20; basically eliminating step 2. My bad but turned out great! I did have to stir frequently to make sure spaghetti didn’t stick together. Delicious! While next time, I think I will add some mushrooms and red pepper flakes, I would absolutely make this version of spaghetti again!! Thank you MTNorman!!!

8.10.22 I made the sauce exactly as written, tasted, and was looking for a little more seasoning. I added some basil, fennel seeds, red pepper flakes, and salt (personal taste). I’d recommend you really start checking and stirring after you add the pasta to the sauce, as it’s easy to have the spaghetti clump together. I really like this “one-pot” concept, and although it does need to cook for a while, it’s so very simple to make and tastes pretty good. I’d make this again.
