These Italian-style stewed pork chops include lots of onion, garlic, tomatoes, and savory herbs. This quick and easy recipe is a great topping for pasta or smashed potatoes.

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 4 servings
4
large pork chops
salt and ground black pepper to taste
1 large onions, halved and sliced
8 large garlic, minced
2 (14.5 ounce) cans whole tomatoes
3 tablespoons capers, with liquid
1 tablespoon dried rosemary
2 teaspoons red pepper flakes
½ tablespoon dried oregano
½ tablespoon dried basil
Directions
Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Season pork chops with salt and pepper on both sides and add to the hot skillet. Cook pork chops until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and cover with aluminum foil.
Add onions and garlic to the hot skillet. Cook and stir until softened but still crisp, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, capers and liquid, rosemary, red pepper flakes, oregano, and basil. Bring sauce to a simmer and cook until flavors meld, about 5 minutes.
Pour any accumulated pork juices from the plate into the skillet and stir. Add cooked pork chops and cover with sauce. Simmer until warmed through, about 5 minutes.

This was very easy to make. I made with bone in thick chops and they turned out very tender. I made the recipe as stated and will probably decrease the Rosemary next time, it’s not one of my favorite spices. I did let the pork chops simmer a bit longer in the end to soak up some flavor and ensure they were fully cooked. All in all, would make again.

We reduced the red pepper to one teaspoon, which was still plenty spicy. If you are feeding someone who doesn't love spice, I recommend going down to only half a teaspoon.
