This homemade monkey bread is gooey, caramelized, and pulls apart effortlessly when you grab a piece! Store in an airtight container in the fridge.

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 10 servings
1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed
Dough:
¼ cup warm water
2 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
1 teaspoon white sugar
3 ½ cups all-purpose flour
¾ cup milk, warmed
1 large egg
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons melted butter
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon vanilla extract
Coating:
1 ½ cups brown sugar
1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
½ cup butter, melted
Directions
Lightly grease a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt) with vegetable oil; set aside.
Make dough: Combine warm water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until bubbly and foamy, about 5 minutes.
Stir in 1 cup flour, warm milk, egg, 3 tablespoons sugar, butter, salt, and vanilla extract until combined. Add remaining 2 1/2 cups flour. Mix and knead until dough comes together in a ball. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 30 minutes.
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and punch down gently to deflate. Divide dough into small or medium balls.
Make coating: Mix together brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Dip each dough ball in melted butter, remove with a fork, then roll in cinnamon sugar mixture until well coated.
Arrange coated dough balls in the prepared pan. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Invert onto a large plate; cool for 10 minutes before serving.

A keeper!
Great flavors
Worth the effort
Wow! The bread came out soooo soft and tastes amazing. It’s definitely a dryer monkey bread recipe but because of how soft the bread was and with the way the butter and cinnamon sugar glazed at the ends of the pieces I didn’t mind it. Definitely saving this recipe!

I forgot the 2nd dough raising, but it still came out good. I agree with other reviewers about pouring the mixture on top before baking. I also added a few raisins. Will definitely make again!

I made it and loved ALL of it! I do wish that I made the balls smaller because I enjoyed those the most and I did lightly boil the remaining brown sugar and butter together and poured it over the bread before baking. Next time I am going to use my sourdough starter and hope it improves the flavor even more! Thanks!

Little more vanilla extract but overall amazing dish. One thing I would change is a little more sugar coating

Great recipe, although I didn't have real butter so I used margarine. I imagine it would taste more heavenly with real butter. One tip, I would make the individual balls smaller so each bite gets more of the sweet, sticky syrup.

I couldn't find my Bundt pan so I had to use a square casserole dish, it worked.I did as another reviewer recommended and mixed the melted butter and sugar/cinnamon together and heated it up into a syrup. I added some pecans as well. I threw a handful of dough balls at a time in the syrup. Then added them to a sprayed casserole dish. When it came out of the oven I mixed up a glaze of 1 C icing sugar, 1Tbs vanilla and 2 Tbsp milk and poured that over the bread after it was flipped out of the casserole. Kids and husband loved it and said they prefer it to cinnamon buns.

This was fantastic. I did however add my own personal touches as people often do to a recipe on here. First I reduced the brown sugar to only 1 cup. I added a 3.5oz pack of cook and serve butterscotch putting (not instant). I also added about a 1/2 cup of pecans to the bottom of the bunt pan. I followed the directions the rest of the way, except I mixed the remaining butter and sugar mixture together and poured over the top of the pan. I have to say, the dough turned out great and I think the pudding mix gave it that extra oomph without making it too sweet. I've made this in the past before, without the pudding and it wasn't as good to us. I'd give it 5 stars with the added alterations, but only 4 stars with the recipe as is. It's a great base recipe!
