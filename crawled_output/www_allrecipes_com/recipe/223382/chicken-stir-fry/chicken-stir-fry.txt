How to Make Chicken Stir Fry
You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make chicken stir fry at home:
1. Stir the soy sauce, sugar, cornstarch, and spices together.2. Add the chicken and toss. Cover and marinate.3. Cook the vegetables and water chestnuts in sesame oil.4. Cook the marinated chicken, then stir in the veggies and reserved marinade.5. Boil until the chicken is fully cooked. Serve over rice.
Best Chicken for Chicken Stir Fry
Chicken breasts and chicken thighs both work well for stir fries. Just make sure the pieces are relatively small and thin. Plus, they should be about the same size so the chicken cooks evenly.
What to Serve With Chicken Stir Fry
This easy dinner is complete with protein, veggies, and rice — so there's really no need to pair it with any side dishes. However, if you want to add something else, try one of these top-rated recipes:
· Pork Dumplings· Fresh Spring Rolls· Hot and Sour Soup
How to Store Chicken Stir Fry
Store your leftovers in a shallow, airtight container for up to five days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove until piping hot. If you're worried about the rice drying out, add a splash of water before reheating.
Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise
"This is a quick, easy, and delicious way to use any leftover vegetables you may have in your fridge," according to Jen. "I added mushrooms and it just makes it that much better!"
"The sauce is delicious, sweet, and just a bit spicy," raves Rita. "My family loved this dish."
"I'm sure to make it again," says Lauretta Jean Campbell. "The only change that I made was adding asparagus instead of broccoli because it's what I had on hand. No chance to photograph because we ate it immediately."

Very bland and too little sauce. It was a huge let down. Followed the recipe exactly.

Worth the effort
Crowd-pleaser
I loved the recipe…I swapped the broccoli for french beans. Also it wasn’t specific with what soy sauce to use so i went with the light soy sauce. I used 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of 3 and I did not use the entire soy-sugar mix. I added as needed. I also marinated the chicken with some chicken curry powder.

I love all the veggies; added mushrooms, cauliflower & garlic scapes. I didn’t have water chestnuts or fresh ginger tho I did add some powdered ginger from my spice rack. I’ll get my missing items for the next round-soon!

I made this as a meal prep and added cauliflower rice instead. It’s really yummy! Next time I might add mushrooms.

I added teriyaki sauce cause I didn’t have enough soy sauce. No ginger either. Used 5 heads baby bok choy instead of broccoli. Chicken thighs instead of breasts. Def the best stir fry I ever made. My picky family says so, too!
