What a delicious yet simple recipe and my husband loved it! I do think the marinera sauce makes or breaks the dish so do choose a high quality sauce. I added a kale salad to the mix and it was the perfect weeknight dish, so easy to put together! Adding it to the rotation ü§§

I‚Äôm not the best cook. This was very easy and tasted pretty good. I used baked chicken breast instead of canned. I also added extra sauce and cheese. It was still missing something, needed a little more flavor.
