This butternut squash made with chicken broth is slightly sweet. It's one of the best soups I've had in a while!

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 4 servings
1 ¬Ω tablespoons butter
¬Ω
onion, sliced
2 cloves garlic
2 sprigs fresh thyme
¬Ω
butternut squash - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes
4 cups chicken broth
¬Ω cube chicken bouillon
1 pinch ground cumin
1 pinch ground allspice
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Directions
Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and thyme and saut√© until onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Add squash and chicken broth; bring to a simmer, then cook until squash is tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Crumble bouillon into the soup. Season with cumin, allspice, salt, and pepper, then remove from heat.
Working in batches, pour soup into a blender, filling no more than halfway. Hold the lid in place with a kitchen towel, then carefully start the blender using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to pur√©e. Pour soup into a serving bowl. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and pur√©e the soup in the pot.

A keeper!
Easy to follow
Great flavors
Worth the effort
I, too, roasted the butternut squash and used the WHOLE squash. I also used five spice since I didn't have allspice and used 6 cups of chicken broth. Mine came out thick. Added a little heavy cream to each serving and voila - Family favorite!!

Has a nice flavor, and I like the way this breaks down nutritionally, but I didn‚Äôt care for the consistency of the soup. Its texture is as thin as the broth that went in. This recipe has had many good reviews, and I‚Äôm thinking maybe my squash was just on the smaller side, and that‚Äôs why it didn‚Äôt add much substance. I‚Äôm used to butternut squash soup being thicker, and I would have been happier with one less cup of chicken broth. In the future, I‚Äôll start with 3 cups, and if too thick, I can always add more. Butternut squash comes in all sizes, and it probably would have been better if the amount of squash was quantified (i.e., 3 cups, 4 cups, or even weight). Not to worry, it‚Äôll be eaten‚Ä¶soup, salad, and half sandwich for dinner tonight.

It was amazing. I used vegetable broth in place of chicken. The pinch of cumin totally makes this soup.

Pretty good! I used home canned squash and had to estimate the herbs as I don't have any fresh this time of year. Hope my guys like it as I may have to make this more often! Good cold weather soup!

Delicious !! Will be making again. I too roasted the squash 3lbs. Already peeled and cut on 400 degree oven for about 30 min until just cooked. Used lemon thyme,pinch of curry, turmeric, ground ginger and allspice. Immersion blender to finish. Will top with either plain yogurt or sour cream (low fat) and pumpkin seeds!

This soup is delicious! I prefer my soup a little more thicker and creamier so I made a few changes. I added the whole squash, 1 apple and approx. 2/3 cup of cream.
