Start this sauce on Sunday morning and fill your kitchen with amazing aromas that will have your family asking when dinner's going to be ready! It's full of rich, sweet tomato flavor, subtle herbs, and savory, tender meat that's cooked right in the sauce. Ladle it over your favorite pasta and serve with buttery garlic bread.

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 12 servings
2 pounds pork neck bones
2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 ¼ pounds Italian sausage links
1 ½ cups finely chopped white onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 (12 ounce) cans tomato paste
1 (28 ounce) can tomato puree
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
7 cups water
1 tablespoon white sugar, or more to taste
1
bay leaf
1 tablespoon dried basil
½ teaspoon dried oregano
12 large cooked meatballs
Directions
Sprinkle neck bones on all sides with salt and pepper.
Heat 4 teaspoons oil in a large, heavy-bottomed stockpot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Place neck bones in the pot and cook for 6 minutes, flipping halfway through. Transfer to a plate.
Add sausage links to the drippings and brown for 3 minutes on each side, adding remaining oil as needed. Set aside with the pork.
Add onion to the drippings and season with salt. Cook, stirring often, until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.
Add tomato puree and crushed tomatoes, than add water and sugar; cook, stirring constantly, until smooth. Add bay leaf. Rub basil and oregano between your fingers to release the aroma and add to the sauce.
Slice sausages into large chunks and return to the pot with the neck bones; bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Add meatballs, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 6 hours.
Remove neck bones and bay leaf. Remove any meat remaining on the bones, shred, and return to the sauce.

Cook’s Note
For homemade meatballs, try my Best Easy Meatballs!
Neck bones are available at many grocery stores. If you can't find them, country-style ribs would be a good substitute.

I’ve made this several times! We love it!! It makes a big batch so freeze quie a bit in meal sized containers. The only change I made was 6 C water 1 cup red wine! The BEST!!

Was looking for a way to use up a bunch of lamb chops and lamb neck chops that were starting to get freezer burned and this was it. Browned the meat in a cast iron pan and started the sauce in there as well so I didn’t miss any of the fond.Then transferred to a crock pot for the long simmer (including stealing the sauce with break chunks for my lunch….)Turned out amazing and was a real crowd pleaser. Enjoyed a glass of wine (or two…) while making this and the only change other than using lamb as the meat was that I splashed some red wine in to the sauce as it simmered.Total crowd pleaser for the whole family. 100% will make this again. Home run recipe!!! (And I loved the video of her telling her story as she made this.)

It was very tasty. Great with bread dipped into it, as well as base for meatball sandwiches
