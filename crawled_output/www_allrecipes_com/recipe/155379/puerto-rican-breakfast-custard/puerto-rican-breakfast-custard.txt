Puerto Rican Breakfast Custard

This Puerto Rican breakfast custard recipe yields a unique Spanish breakfast custard. My Puerto Rican father loved it as a child, and my mother made it for us as we grew up. Whisking the custard for 25 minutes takes patience, but the results are delicious and warm on a cold winter morning.

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 2 servings
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons cornstarch
⅛ teaspoon salt
⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 cups whole milk
Directions
Whisk sugar, cornstarch, salt, and cinnamon together in a large saucepan; stir in milk until evenly blended. Heat over medium-high heat; cook and whisk until reaches a thick consistency, 25 to 30 minutes, making sure to continually whisk while custard cooks to avoid burning or clumping. The custard will thicken as it cools. Divide between bowls.

A keeper!
Great flavors
Easy to follow
Since I am lactose intolerance, I made it with almond milk and it was just as good.

This recipe was great but it doesn't take very long for the maizena to thicken, so I'll say stir it for around 15 minutes instead of 25 to 30.. that's too long

This recipe was so simple and easy to follow. I grew up on this and haven't had it in such a long time. Was happy to find it here n for it to turn out just like mom's was even better!
