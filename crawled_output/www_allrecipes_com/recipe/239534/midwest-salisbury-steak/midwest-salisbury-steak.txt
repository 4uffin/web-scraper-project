This recipe for Salisbury steak uses good quality ground sirloin and tastes wonderful. You won't have to drain any grease from the patties once they've browned. Serve over mashed potatoes, egg noodles, or rice. Simply delightful!

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 5 servings
Patties:
1 pound ground sirloin
¬Ω cup panko bread crumbs
1
egg, beaten
2 tablespoons milk
¬Ω (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
¬º teaspoon ground black pepper
Gravy:
3 tablespoons butter
2 cups fresh mushrooms, sliced
1
sweet onion, sliced
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
¬Ω (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix
1 ¬Ω cups beef stock
1 cup water
salt and ground black pepper to taste
Directions
Gather the ingredients.
Make the patties: Mix ground sirloin, panko bread crumbs, egg, milk, 1/2 packet onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper together in a large bowl; shape into 5 patties.
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in the hot skillet until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
Make the gravy: Melt butter in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Saut√© mushrooms and onion in melted butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir flour and remaining 1/2 packet onion soup mix into mushroom mixture until combined.
Gradually add beef stock and water, stirring continually, until simmering. Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring frequently, until gravy has thickened, about 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Place browned patties into gravy; simmer until very tender, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).

This was fine. I cut it in half but left the gravy at the full amount, so there would be plenty for the rice too. I didn't have mushrooms, and the onion in the soup mix was enough for me, so I didn't add the fresh onion. The portion size was just right too. The onions in the soup mix didn't soften and dissolve the way fresh onions can, but there weren't too many, so I dealt with it. This was fine, and I enjoyed trying out a new recipe. It's a bit oniony in flavor overall for my tastes, but I am the pickiest diner at the table, and my husband liked it fine.

A keeper!
I made this last night. It brought back many childhood memories. Comfort food at its finest. Add hot sauce to make it spicier.

A keeper!
I have made this numerous times but never left a review. Made it again tonight. I was out of mushrooms and didn‚Äôt feel like peeling and cutting onions, so I omitted those. Made the rest per recipe instructions. This is not usually a pretty plate of food, especially without the mushrooms and onions lol, but we loved it all the same. My husband has requested that I make this meal often and he is a very picky eater! I have served this meal to friends as well and always get compliments! Thanks for sharing this recipe üòä

I have never liked any Salisbury Steak I have ever sampled - consider it a waste of good sirloinüôÉMy son does not care for mashed potatoes, which are a must - in my mind - to accompany Salisbury Steak...However, my husband particularly relishes the dish - so I felt compelled to give this one a whirl - and, contrary to my poor expectations, we all enjoyed every bite of our mealüòã

I skipped the package of onion soup mix and used onion and garlic seasoning instead. Also used unsalted butter and some Georgia wine in the gravy. This was absolutely delicious. I am 74 and made this for my wife and I. The extra gravy will go well with the leftover patties on toast tomorrow.

It was ok. Needed more flavor. It could have been that I used 73/27 ground hamburger too.
