This apple crisp showcases apples at their best! The combination of warm, tender apples and the crunchy oat topping is one of my favorite desserts. Delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Does Apple Crisp Need to Be Refrigerated?
Yes. Allow the crisp to cool completely, then transfer the leftovers to an airtight container or cover the dish tightly with foil. Store in the refrigerator for about three days.
Can You Freeze Apple Crisp?
Yes! You can freeze apple crisp. If you plan to freeze it, it's best to go ahead and bake it in a foil pan. Wrap the whole thing tightly in a layer of storage wrap, then a layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to three months.

"So delicious and easy to make," according to Dana Ward-Haven. "We topped it off with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and caramel sauce."
"The crisp topping was yummy!" raves one Allrecipes community member. "I loved the large quantity of apples! My family loved it and had seconds right away!"
"It was a breeze to make," says Brian Lunsford. "Everything turned out perfect. I didn't have a glass dish so I used a non-stick 13√ó9 and added about 5 minutes."

Great Apple crisp recipe..... I changed by omitting the water, used more cinnamon, more topping ingredients. I only had 6 Fuji Apples but Baked for 58 min. Delicious. Will be making it again.

My husband and I love Apple Pie. We decided to make a home made one and oh my goodness. This was delicious. It was crunchy and sweet. We added some vanilla ice cream. The recipe was easy to follow and the ingredients were not expensive. I also love that I can click add ingredients to my walmart shopping cart instead of having to go back and forth.

This recipe is perfect as is, but I had to improvise because of the ingredients I had on hand. Golden delicious apples are sweet, not tart, so I subbed fresh lemon juice for water to get the tartness. Also, I used ‚ÄúApple Pie Spice‚Äù (McCormick) instead of plain cinnamon. It contains cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Lastly, I added 1/4 tsp of the same spice to the topping as well. My picky-eater family loved it so much. My husband and kids all asked me to add this to my regular dessert rotation, and I gladly obliged!! :)

I added some steel cut oats for texture in with the rolled oats. Also more cinnamon on the apples and in the mix. I also broil the apple crisp for the last 2 mins to make it nice and crispy and carmelized on the top. It‚Äôs super easy and delicious. Big hit here! Mmmmmm serve warm with vanilla ice cream and a little sprinkle of cinnamon sugar!
