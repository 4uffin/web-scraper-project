This lemonade recipe is for real, authentic, vintage lemonade —the kind you might enjoy on a hot summer day at one of those stands at the state fair. Most of us make lemonade just out of lemon juice, but as you may know, the oils in the lemon peel contain a tremendous amount of flavor, and once you drink this, you won't want to go back to drinking it how you used to.

Allrecipes/Julia Hartbeck
Wash lemons and peel off all the zest using a vegetable peeler; set peeled lemons aside. Add lemon zest to a bowl and cover with sugar; toss to combine. Cover and let sit for a minimum of 2 hours, or up to overnight.
Allrecipes/Julia Hartbeck
Bring water to a boil in a pot over high heat; turn off heat and pour in lemon-sugar mixture. Stir and let sit until sugar is completely dissolved, about 5 minutes.
Allrecipes/Julia Hartbeck
Pour through a mesh strainer back into the same bowl and discard the zest. Let cool to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes.
Allrecipes/Julia Hartbeck
Cut lemons in half and squeeze juice into the bowl. Pour lemonade into a serving pitcher; cover and chill thoroughly before serving over ice, at least 2 hours.

Enjoy!

Great flavors
A keeper!

This is the most delicious lemonade I've ever had! It is sweet and refreshing. Will never go back to buying store-bought again. Think it definitely helps to use a sharp peeler and try and make sure you get as little of the white pith on your lemon peels as possible, so that there is no bitterness.

A-MA-ZING. THIS RECIPE IS SO GOOD. if yours turned out bitter then you didn’t wash your lemons well enough, or cut to much of the white when peeling, or didn’t leave the sugar mixture long enough. Because this recipe is simply the best!!! My kiddos love it, my husband loves it. I double the recipe to fit my big container and it’s worth it!

I'd only ever had lemonade with just the juice, sugar, and water, and was never too huge on it. The oleo saccharum really does make all the difference. I had a few limes, so I used their peels in this, too, and it came out great. So much flavor.

This is a fantastic recipe. I have made it twice. The first time used Meyer Lemons and only one cup of sugar. It was a little to sweet for my liking. Second time I use 8 regular lemons and one cup of sugar resulting in the perfect balance of sweet and sour

This was indeed the best lemonade that I've ever had. That oleo saccharum in tandem with the fresh fruit flavor really makes for a heck of a summer beverage.
I've since made a double batch, which was also amazing, and tried it with limes as well. You just can't go wrong with this recipe.
Protip: be careful to not get much of the pith into the bowl when skinning the fruit. If you do and find the results to be bitter, let it sit in the fridge for a day or two; this will mellow out these notes significantly.
Finally, Chef John, you've inspired a recipe of my own. I call it Italian Lemonade.

I just finished making it today. It's so good! I reduced the sugar by a little.
There are some people who say it's too sour or bitter. Just make sure you follow the directions. I think people mess up where they don't let the oleo saccharum (lemon peels & sugar mixture) marinate for 12 hours.
They also might mess up when they toss oleo saccharum into the boiling water. You should turn off the heat when the water boils. Then toss the peel sugar mixture. Quickly stir and strain immediately.
Good luck on making this refreshing lemonade! :D
