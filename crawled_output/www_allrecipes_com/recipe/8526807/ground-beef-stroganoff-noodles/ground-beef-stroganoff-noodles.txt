One-Pan Ground Beef Stroganoff Noodles – Helping Hamburger Help Itself
Like most people who grew up during the Golden Age of processed food, my mom bought a fair amount of pre-packaged, pre-mixed, just-add-water type meals, but when it came to pasta or noodles in a ground meat sauce, her hamburger did not need any help. We did enjoy the occasional box of mac and cheese, or package of pop-tarts, but virtually all dishes like this ground beef stroganoff noodles were made from scratch.
Hamburger Helper was something other moms who didn't know how to cook served their kids, and while that might have been a touch hypocritical, since she may have been making pancakes from a box while saying it, we were grateful. Having said all that, I've had Hamburger Helper, and didn't hate it, and the idea of a quick, easy, one-pan meal involving meaty sauce coved noodles was a great one. So, I decided to share this homage.
There are many different shapes and sizes of egg noodles, so the one and only challenge with this recipe is their cooking time. Please just use my times as a guide, and keeping cooking, stirring occasionally, adding liquid as needed, until the noodles are perfect. Once they are, stir in the sour cream, and you're eating. If you add that before everything is done, it may split as it simmers. Other than that, not much can go wrong, and I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!

Crowd-pleaser
Easy enough when u really do not want to cook but need a simple dinner to please the family. The taste is much better than box. I did not have any mushrooms but all other ingredients and it’s a great dinner, with a side of veggies. Thank you for the recipe. I don’t think anyone could go wrong with this recipe.

This is a great recipe. I increased the recipe to accommodate 2.75 lbs of chopper. I omitted the actual mushrooms (not a fan), but did use a can of cream of mushroom soup. Also used 2 small cans of beef broth (will use the 48 oz can next time), 2 beef bouillon cubes, a good sprinke of Umami Mushroom seasoning I found at the local ShopRite, and enough water to cook 2 bags of egg noodles and have a good amount of sauce going. Will DEFINITELY be making this again.

Very simple recipe and common ingredients. It took me almost an hour to make it mosty because I used regular dry pasta. Had to add about 1 cup of water more. But it came out perfect.I was very surprised how smooth, creamy the sauce was, ideal.When it comes to the taste, fond is the key. Not the booze, just the fond. I think it can be awesome even without the broth, just with water.But the fond has to be perfect.I added vodka but maybe my taste sense isn't sophisticated enough to feel it in the dish ;) Forgot to add sour cream on top :P

Fantastic flavors! I followed the recipe as written, except used only beef broth, and no water. I found the sauce to be a little on the runny side, but the flavor was so good. I had to give it five stars! Chef John's recipes are just so good!!

I made this for Southern Sunday Supper and it was perfect for this fall Sunday with the rich sauce, tender noodles, earthy mushrooms, and that twang from the sour cream. What a nice meal this was! I scaled this down for fewer servings, and it was simple to do. I used dried minced onion, and added a splash of Worcestershire sauce. I really liked the addition of the cayenne as it gave that tiny bit of warmth, and instead of taking over, it played nice and remained in the background. This was a fantastic meal and I will definitely be repeating this one. It was fast and easy to pull this together, and made a great comfort meal for a nice fall evening. It was a definite 5 stars with that splash of worcestershire added.

4 stars for the recipe as printed with following changes 5 stars would be in order (I made both ways). 1) vodka is a pointless addition, if you want to use some form of hard liquor use rum or better yet brandy, still better cognac, although really none of these are key enhancements. 2) this is very bland, the addition of smoked paprika, chili powder (with flour addition) and, as many others pointed out, Worcestershire near the end add some flavors that are on point. Also, adding a tablespoon of Dijon mustard at the end is a classic element to Beef Stroganoff. 3) Take the cup of water and discard it. Prior to adding the BEEF BROTH (which is beef stock with added flavor of mirepoix) deglaze the pan with a cup of dry white wine (Kendall Jackson is a solid go to for this). 4) Skip the sour cream and use creme fraiche, not only does it mix in better but adds more depth with out overpowering the sauce like the sour cream tends to do.--easy changes but well worth it, definitely will make this again.

Very good. Used cognac instead of vodka and it was a wonderful change.
