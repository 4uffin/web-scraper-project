This satisfying spicy chili recipe is made in the slow cooker. Start it before you head off to work, and return to a comforting homemade meal ready to eat! I like to top each bowl with some sour cream and shredded cheese.

A keeper!
Crowd-pleaser
Great flavors
Family favorite
Easy to follow
Worth the effort
I really enjoyed making this recipe. I did make some modifications. First, I added ground pork with the ground beef. I didn't have any tomato puree so, I used two cans or diced tomatoes with basil, two cans of tomato sauce, and added beef broth. I also added cumin, smoked paprika, and increased all of the other seasonings to add a bit more flavor. I also make a side of minute rice and cornbread. My family loved it and went back for seconds. üòäüëç

The recipe was easy. I added 1 pound of Hot Italian Sausage and 2 cans of Pinto Beans to the chili; only used half an onion.

Make it vegan: I used 1 pack Quorn Meatless ground and 1 pack Garden beefless ground (just throw in still frozen) to mimic the varying textures in chili, and it is AMAZING! It still cold and I can‚Äôt stop eating. Tastes like I remember chili tasting as a kid which is the key to any classic recipe, isn‚Äôt it? I won a chili cookoff with this recipe when I ate meat and now I think its even better!
