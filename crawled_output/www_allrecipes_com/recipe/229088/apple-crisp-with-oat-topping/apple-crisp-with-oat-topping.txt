Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise
“I love this recipe,” raves one Allrecipes community member. “I like cinnamon so I added more to the recipe. I added some lemon juice and water to the apples. Instead of topping with ice cream I drizzled sugar free maple syrup over it.”
“This was wonderful,” according to Dominiqueuebel. “I used Granny Smith and Gala apples. Everyone loved it.”
“No two ways about it - this was beyond excellent for a simple apple crisp,” says naples34102. “Perfectly spiced and sweetened, an ideal ratio of topping to apples, and a topping so crunchy the person next to you can hear it when you chew! This was quite a treat.”

Cook’s Note
If you prefer a sweet-tart filling, use a combination of apple varieties, such as Granny Smith and Gala. Use the best-quality cinnamon you can find and get it from a spice merchant or even a store where you can buy it in bulk; it does make a difference.

My family loved this recipe! We have a lot of allergies and this recipe was easy to adjust to fit us. I used fresh apples from our backyard tree, dairy free butter, almond flour, and Splenda in place of the sugar. I would have used Splenda brown sugar if I had had enough, but I just used regular there. I also added all spice just because I love it. I read from other reviewers that it was dry and because almond flour is dryer than regular flour, I added about 2 tablespoons of pure fresh maple syrup to each the topping batter and the apples/sugar mixture. It was so perfect for our sour apples that are coming off the tree last and this week. My kids were fighting over getting more and my husband who doesn’t like oatmeal had seconds. Wonderful recipe for a family that has a lot of allergy needs! Thank you!
