Celebrate summer with this homemade tomato pie. It’s the perfect way to use up fresh seasonal produce!
If you're not familiar with tomatoes in pie, you've been missing out. Imagine in your head a savory tomato tart. Tomato pie come to us from the south, and just like the many different parts of this region, there are many different ways to prepare a tomato pie. This recipe is a crowd-pleaser though, and it will cause your friends and family to ask for your secret.

What’s In Tomato Pie?
These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this homemade tomato pie:
Pie crust: Use a store-bought pastry crust or make your own at home.
Tomatoes: You’ll need four large (peeled and sliced) tomatoes.
Bacon: Cooked, drained, and chopped bacon lends meaty flavor.
Green onions: Green onions add a bright pop of flavor and color.
Seasonings: Season the tomato pie with fresh basil, dried oregano, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper.
Cheese: Shredded Cheddar cheese makes the tomato pie extra indulgent.
Mayonnaise: Mayonnaise gives the tomato pie creaminess and adds tangy flavor.
What Kind of Tomatoes Are Best for Tomato Pie?
You can use any tomatoes you have on hand! This recipe is a great way to use up excess garden tomatoes. If you have your pick of the produce aisle, though, opt for Roma tomatoes — they tend to be firmer and less liquidy than other varieties.
How to Make Tomato Pie
You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make tomato pie:
Add all the ingredients (besides the cheese and mayo) to the pie crust. Mix the cheese and mayo together and spread the mixture over the filling. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes, uncover, and bake for 30 more minutes.

Test Kitchen Tips
“Nothing screams ‘summer’ in the South like a delicious tomato pie,” according to culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). Here are a few of her favorite tomato pie tips and tricks:
While you can technically enjoy this dish year-round with homegrown tomatoes, Nicole says it’s best with fresh, seasonal, homegrown tomatoes.Nicole likes to blind bake the pie crust before layering the filling ingredients inside. This will prevent a soggy crust. She also salts, then pats dry the tomato slices before adding them to the filling to draw out excess moisture.
What to Serve with Tomato Pie
Think southern foods. While you can serve anything you want with tomato pie, a good helping of southern sides will go a long way to round out your meal. Here are some options:
Kickin' collard greens
Southern butter beans
Southern coleslaw
Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread
How to Store Tomato Pie
Cover the tomato pie or place it in an airtight container. Store it in the refrigerator for up to two days.
Can You Freeze Tomato Pie?
We recommend enjoying the tomato pie within two days, as it will likely become watery during the freezing and thawing process. If you’d like to freeze it, though, it will last for about six months.
When you cook a pie, the ingredients release their flavor, and the longer you keep the pie stored, whether in the fridge or freezer, it will slowly lose its luster. However, preparing the pie but freezing it until you need to bake it is a great solution. Just make sure the pie is covered and wrapped tightly.
Allrecipes Community Tips and Community
“I made a few of these for a party,” says Kerri. “Delicious and beautiful! Very impressive and I got to use mostly homegrown ingredients!”
“This was so easy and tasted incredible,” raves Bailey. “I used fresh basil which smelled and tasted amazing with our fresh grown tomatoes.”
“Love this recipe,” according to Allison. “I bake the empty pie shell for 10 minutes and squeeze the juice out of the tomato slices to keep the crust from getting soggy. Use fresh basil if at all possible … it makes all the difference.”

OK with tweaks
Might try again
Good tip to prebake the crust, and to blot the tomatoes . I used a 9” deep dish crust and could fit in only 2 tomatoes. Kept the original amount of bacon and fresh basil. Used 1/2 the cheese. Tasty pie! I’d take 5 minutes off the cook time and add salt next time.

Wish I had read the other reviews that said to pre-bake the crust so it's not soggy. May try it again tho!

Great recipe! Used Romas and a few grape tomatoes from my garden. Only change was to bake the crust 10 min without anything in it. Would make again next summer! Thanks Donnak!

Great pie! I had lots of leftover tomatoes from my garden haul, and wanted to make a tomato pie. Tried this recipe and it came out great!I did blind bake the crust and layer some mozzarella cheese to seal the bottom first before starting with the tomato. I salted and let the tomatoes rest for a couple of hours (one hour each side) and that really helped.I added lots of basil from my garden, as well as diced black garlic layered between the tomatoes and bacon. I also added some Greek yogurt with the mayo and cheddar cheese, along with herbs de province, garlic powder, minced onions. I mixed that cheesy goodness up and put it in layers after the bacon, then sprinkled cheddar cheese, bacon, green onions, and diced peppers from my garden (peppers only on half, for the cry babies) LOLAll in all, this pie was delish! Thanks!

Wow! SO delicious that I've made it two weekends in a row. There's something about the combination of the sharp cheddar cheese and mayonnaise that creates this wonderfully tangy glue that holds the whole thing together. I highly recommend this recipe!

OMG! This is life changingly good! I think I’d either let the tomatoes rest longer after salting or even put them in a dehydrator for a hour or so, but I could eat the entire thing myself!!

This is what my pie looked like before baking.I used all the ingredients but I used 1 teaspoon of sweet dry basil because there wasn't any fresh available locally. I did pre-bake the crust with some mozzarella on the bottom. I made the cheese mixture but instead of putting all of it on top, I put part of it on each layer of tomatoes. I read the comments and took everyone's advice on draining the tomatoes on a paper towel with salt on top. I let the tomatoes drain for about 1/2 hour. That worked really well. I didn't have any issue with a runny pie. If you make your pie like this be careful you don't let the bacon on top get too brown. I did put most of the bacon in the pie as the recipe suggests. This was wonderful!

OMG!! New favorite for sure. Didn’t pre-cook the crust quite enough, but other than that this was amazing. So glad I found this recipe
