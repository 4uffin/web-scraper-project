Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 6 servings
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste
½ pound fresh green beans, trimmed
1 small red potato, diced
1
sweet bell pepper, chopped
1 cup broccoli florets, chopped
1 tablespoon minced garlic
3 tablespoons olive oil
⅓ cup all-purpose flour
4 tablespoons butter, melted
1 cup panko bread crumbs
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided
1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, pounded flat and excess fat removed
Dipping Sauce (Optional):
1/2 cup mayonnaise (Optional)
1/4 cup ketchup (Optional)
1/2 tsp garlic powder (Optional)
1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce (Optional)
Directions
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
Combine oregano, parsley, paprika, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper in a small bowl.

Place green beans, potato, bell pepper, broccoli, and garlic onto the prepared sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with 1/2 of the seasoning mix; toss to coat.

Place flour into a bowl. Place melted butter into a second bowl. Mix panko, 2/3 cup Parmesan cheese, and the remaining seasoning mix together in a third bowl.
Slice chicken into 1 1/4-inch strips, then coat in flour. Dredge floured strips in melted butter, dripping excess butter back into the bowl. Press into Parmesan-panko mixture until heavily coated on both sides.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Push veggies to one half of the sheet pan. Place coated chicken strips onto the other side. Sprinkle any remaining Parmesan-panko mixture over chicken, pressing to adhere.
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken strips and stir veggies, then continue to bake until chicken juices run clear and veggies are crisp-tender, 10 to 15 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce: Whisk mayonnaise, ketchup, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl.

Remove chicken and veggies from the oven. Toss veggies with remaining 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. Serve with dipping sauce.
Recipe Tips
You can use mini sweet peppers in place of the regular bell pepper.To save time, use chicken tenders instead of boneless chicken breasts.

I added 9 stems of asparagus instead of the green beans and 2 small red potatoes instead of 1. We all was drooling over dinner! I think we all was wishing there was more. I’m sure this will be come a recipe we use regular. ♥️

This chicken is delicious. Instead of flour and butter I subbed mayonnaise. Great weeknight dinner.

Made this dish for dinner tonight. It was delicious. The chicken was very tender. The only thing I did differently is that I tossed the vegetables in a bowl before I put them on the baking pan. I will definitely make this again.
