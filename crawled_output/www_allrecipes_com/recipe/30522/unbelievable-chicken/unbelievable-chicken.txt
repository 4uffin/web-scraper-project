A keeper!
Easy to follow
Great flavors
Used chicken thighs instead of breasts, and this turned out so well. The marinade has ingredients I always have on hand, and this grilled up so juicy and tender. A definite keeper.

Super delicious! I don't have a grill so I baked the chicken breasts then super heated a pan until smoking and blackened the chicken 1 minute on each side. I reduced the left over marinade and chicken juices (from baking) into a glaze which was an ultra flavourful and a delicious addition! I chose to stuff my chicken with jalapeno Monterey Jack cheese which was ok but I'm thinking next time I'd like to go with a sharp aged cheese if I stuff again.

Love that I had everything on hand! Quick and easy marinade recipe. Basted while it was on the grill. Loved the light hint of brown sugar to the flavor!

Wow!!! My husband loved it and he is usually a salt and pepper only kind of guy!! I used thighs, and didn't have cider vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead. Juicy, sweet, tangy, the charred pieces were heaven. Going in the use this frequently recipe bin!
