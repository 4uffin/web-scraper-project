The recipe was easy to follow and easy to adjust to make it my own. I added Italian dry herbs to the dry mix. I substituted the brown sugar with my favorite barbecue sauce. It was delicious!

I haven’t made meatloaf in years and I lost my favorite recipe. When I made the sauce, I didn’t have brown sugar so I substituted it with honey and it made the sauce amazing!

I made this meatloaf on my Traeger grill and it came out great. I deviated a bit by dropping to 325 and letting it go an hour and a half and it came out fantastic. I also added in some chopped bell pepper but otherwise kept to the ingredient list as shown. The brown sugar was a nice touch and drew compliments. I would recommend this recipe and will do again in the future.

OK with tweaks
This recipe was easy, and I really like the sauce on top. However, it would be easier to make with more specific quantities of onion, salt, and pepper. This is not a recipe in which one can sample to test for the amount of salt. Onions come in different sizes, and I ended up using 1/2 of a large onion, which was plenty. Also, some pieces of the onion did not get completely softened. If I make this recipe again, I think I’ll sauté the onions a bit prior to adding them to the mixture.

I always tweak recipes. For this one, I added about 1 cup total of diced carrots & zucchini, reducing the milk by about 1/8 cup. We like lots of flavor, so I also added Dan O's, Worcestershire sauce, Tapatio sauce and chili powder to the meat mixture. I poked finger size holes in the top after forming the loaf and dropped topping in. I also used dark brown sugar in the topping. So so so good!

I didn't have the bread crumbsSo had jalapeno pretzels I crushed up and made the one meatloafNext one used Cool ranch DoritosNext used regular DoritosNext used brown sugar oatmealLast one I had a bag of honey barbecue potato chips I crushed up and put in it.The glaze is different on each one also but basically ketchup honey mustard Worcestershire sauce Parmesan cheese. Last I glazed one with a very spicy halabanero based honey mustard.You may ask why I made five meatloafs found out my half a beef is coming sooner than I anticipated so had to come up with a creative use for all the ground beef I left over from the last beef.
