Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 6 servings
6
skinless, boneless chicken thighs
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons olive oil
6 strips bacon
1
onion, sliced
2 cups chicken broth, divided
2 cups apple cider, divided
2 apples, peeled, cored, and sliced
4
sage leaves
2 sprigs fresh thyme
4 tablespoons unsalted butter
Directions
Season chicken thighs with salt; set aside.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add thighs; cook until browned on both sides, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate; set aside.
Cook bacon in the skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on paper towels; drain excess grease from the skillet.
Cook onion in the skillet over medium heat until soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup apple cider; cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add cooked bacon, apples, sage, and thyme; simmer for 2 minutes. Add remaining 1 cup each chicken broth and apple cider.
Return chicken thighs to the skillet; reduce heat to medium-low. Cook and stir until thighs are no longer pink in the centers, about 15 minutes.
Transfer thighs to a serving platter. Remove skillet from heat; add butter, swirl to combine with sauce. Pour sauce over thighs.

Took some time to make with all the prep but I ended up using boneless breast instead of the bone-in to cut down on the cooking time.
