The Best Caramel Apples

This amazing caramel apple recipe was given to me by a close friend when I was searching for a recipe to make homemade caramel apples for the very first time. My family and friends loved these delicious treats! Sprinkle with nuts, crushed cookies, or whatever you desire while the caramel is still warm, but work quickly as the caramel sets very fast.

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 8 servings
8 large tart apples
8
wooden chopsticks for handles
2 cups packed brown sugar
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
1 cup light corn syrup
1 cup butter
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Directions
Gather all ingredients.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Remove any wax from apples to help caramel stick better: Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Dip apples in boiling water for a few seconds, using a slotted spoon, then dry with paper towels to remove any wax from the peels. Set apples aside to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Insert sticks into the bottom of each cooled apple through the core for a handle.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir brown sugar, sweetened condensed milk, corn syrup, and butter together in a saucepan over medium-high heat.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then reduce heat to medium. Cook until a candy thermometer reads 248 degrees F (120 degrees C), stirring constantly to prevent burning, about 25 to 30 minutes. A teaspoon of caramel dropped in a glass of cold water, should form a firm ball.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Remove caramel from heat and stir in vanilla extract.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Working quickly, dip each apple into the hot caramel to completely coat the apple and about 1/2 inch of the wooden handle.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Sprinkle apples with any desired toppings while still hot.
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Let caramel apples cool on the prepared baking sheet, about 1 hour. Use caution, caramel is very hot.

Cook’s Note
Each stove differs as far as temperature and how long you will need to cook the caramel. It only took 21 minutes for me, but it took my friend 39 minutes — so it can vary greatly.Because the caramel requires constant attention when cooking, and you will be in a hurry when coating the apples, prep everything beforehand. Have your parchment paper laid out, your toppings ready in bowls, etc.

Did not work
So I’m super disappointed in this. I followed this recipe to the letter and all I have is a huge mess. The caramel did not stick at all. Just rolled off the apples. The toppings that I crushed and rolled them in rolled off with it. This was the one recipe I was really excited to make so I could have caramel apples for my grandbabies on Halloween.

Great flavors
A keeper!
Easy to follow
Worth the effort
Crowd-pleaser
Family favorite
So maybe I went a little overboard, making caramel apples for the first time. These are sure gonna be a crowd pleaser. It took me a very, very long 3 hours to make these apples. It was still worth it.

With the adjustment of light corn syrup to 3/4c, this recipe is spot on. Haven’t had it with the apple yet but the caramel is delicious!!!!We made “disks” with the leftover since we only dipped four apples.I will use this again when my hand recovers from stirring.A candy thermometer is a MUST!!!

This was the first time making caramel apples. My wife and I gave it a shot and we got pretty good results. The caramel was a bit runny. So we believe we heated the ingredients too long. We didn’t have a candy thermometer and was just doing a practice run. Learning from our mistakes. We believe this is the recipe for us. The taste and color was excellent. We just have to make a few adjustments. I would advise getting all your toppings ready and easy to access. Be sure to clean your apples good and cool for 30 minutes beforehand. Get everything in to position because this process goes fast. Very good recipe! 5-Stars!@FrostieFrogWest Virginia
