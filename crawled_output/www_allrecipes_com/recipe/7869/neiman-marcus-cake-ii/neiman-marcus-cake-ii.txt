Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 14 servings
1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix
4 large eggs, divided
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 ½ cups confectioners' sugar
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 13x9-inch baking pan.
Combine yellow cake mix, 2 eggs, butter, and vanilla in a large bowl; mix well. The batter will be stiff. Add cake batter to the prepared pan and spread evenly.
Recipe Tip
Spray the back of your spatula with cooking spray to spread batter easily.
Combine confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, and the remaining 2 eggs in a separate bowl; mix well and pour over the top of the cake batter.
Bake the cake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes.
Let cake cool completely before you cut it to achieve those delicious layers.

Easy to follow
This was so easy and so good! I did a double batch so it took a bit longer to bake (about 42 minutes). My son said “this is actually good!” LOL! You can see and taste both layers.

They’ve reduced the size of cake mixes to 13.25 oz so I was a little short on the cake part. I was in process of making when I realized it so buy 2 cake mixes if you can’t find a 15.25 oz box. Other than that it was great!

Decadent for sure, but oh so good. Texture is soft and gooey-chewy unlike a normal cake texture, and it’s very rich, so I cut into smaller pieces. This comes together quickly, and do let it cool completely before cutting.

Tastes good! I made it with 350 grams of powdered sugar and used a 9 in round pan. Made two minis too.Cooked 45 mins and next time maybe add almond extract to cake. Cake part was kinda dry.
