I really like this recipe. It's a lot easier and fewer calories than traditional fried eggplant Parmesan.

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 6 servings
2 large eggplants
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 pinch salt, or as needed
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cloves garlic, sliced
½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
3 cups prepared marinara sauce
½ cup water, plus more as needed
¾ cup ricotta cheese
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
¼ cup shredded pepperjack cheese
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
¾ cup dry bread crumbs
½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons olive oil
Directions
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Cut 5 crosswise slices from center area of each eggplant, about 1/2-inch thick, to total 10 slices. Peel and dice remaining pieces of eggplant.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until oil is very hot. Sprinkle eggplant slices lightly with a pinch of salt and cook in hot skillet in batches until slightly softened, about 3 minutes per side. Set eggplant slices aside on paper towels.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in skillet and cook garlic for about 10 seconds; add diced eggplant and season with a pinch of salt and red pepper flakes. Saute until eggplant is softened, about 5 minutes. Pour in marinara sauce and water. Turn heat to medium-low and cook until eggplant is tender, about 15 minutes; stir occasionally. If sauce gets too thick, add a little more water.
Combine ricotta cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, pepperjack cheese, a pinch of salt, and a pinch black pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Spread about 2 tablespoons cheese mixture over each eggplant slice. Fold eggplant slices in half to enclose the cheese mixture.
Spread about half the sauce into an 8x8-inch baking dish. Lay folded eggplant slices in a single layer into the dish. Spread remaining sauce over eggplant slices.
Combine bread crumbs, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a bowl; mix thoroughly. Spread crumb mixture over eggplant casserole.
Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and crumbs are browned, 35 to 40 minutes.
Editor's Note:
Please note omission of the breaded topping when using the magazine version of this recipe.

This recipe is amazing exactly as written, given you are using your own home made Marinara sauce or a good quality brand. The first time trying a new recipe I always follow directions before giving it my own twist. My family devoured this, my Meat and Potatoes husband and my vegetarian father alike, so now now I use 3 eggplants- 5 cups of Marina sauce- I double the cheese filling but still use the same amount of Bread crumbs for the topping to might it a little lighter ( I use 4-C Gluten free plain variety). Now that this has become one of my staples I decided to grill the eggplant tonight ( instead of frying, since eggplant does soak up so much oil- I seasoned with a dash of oregano, basil and garlic . My family didn't notice a the difference and it was easier too! By the way, I buy Aged Parmesan- and grate it fresh. Less preservatives- and this dish tastes very Farm to Table!
