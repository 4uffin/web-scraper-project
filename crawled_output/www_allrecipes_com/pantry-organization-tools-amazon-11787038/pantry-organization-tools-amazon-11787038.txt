A few years ago, when house organization shows were all the rage, my mom transformed her kitchen pantry into a tidy paradise. Instead of sticking cans, boxes, and packets wherever they’d fit, she sorted everything and put them in containers that left the pantry neat as an alphabetized bookshelf.
Now whenever we cook together, I can step into the pantry and immediately find whatever ingredient we need. It’s an effective system that not only makes cooking easier, but also saves my mom money, since she never tosses out expired chips or cereal that got lost in the back of the shelves.
I browsed Amazon for the best pantry organization tools and divided them into three categories: food storage containers, pantry organization bins, and helpful labels. Many of these pantry organization tools come from trusted kitchen brands, including Rubbermaid, OXO, YouCopia, and more. Between airtight canisters that keep dry goods fresh and shelf bins that display seasoning packets, you’ll have your pantry organized in no time.

Best Pantry Storage Containers
Let’s start with some reliable dry food storage containers. My personal favorites are the Pop containers from OXO. I use them to store sugar and flour, so I don’t have to wrestle with messy bags—plus, it’s easy to see how much I have left. The Allrecipes crew tested the Vtopmart airtight storage containers and loved how well they stack together.
Rubbermaid Brilliance Pantry Food Storage Container Set, 4-Pack, $40 (was $50)
OXO Good Grips 4.4-Quart Pop Container, $22
Vtopmart 24-Piece Airtight Food Storage Containers, $31 (was $37)

No food container list is complete without including Rubbermaid’s Brilliance collection. The snap-top lids create an airtight seal, keeping contents fresh and secure. They’re available in a variety of shapes and sizes, too. This particular 4-pack set includes a nice assortment, ranging from 3.2 cups all the way up to 20 cups.

Prefer glass to plastic? Check out these classic canisters. Each of the three jars has a 78-ounce capacity, an airtight, leakproof lid, and a steel fastener for extra security. Since the jars have a squarish shape, they maximize shelf space when stored side by side. The set even comes with labels and a chalk marker.
Amazon
Best Pantry Organization Bins
My mom is a big champion of organization bins. She uses them for makeup in the bathroom, office supplies in the den, and, of course, pantry items. These practical wire baskets keep cans, jars, and boxes organized—they’re only $6 apiece right now thanks to a sale. If you want an aesthetically pleasing option, consider these handwoven wicker baskets, which offer easy access to whatever you store inside.
ClearSpace Plastic Pantry Organization and Food Storage Bin, 8-Pack, $40
StorageWorks Wicker Pantry Baskets, 2-Pack, $39
Vitever Wire Baskets for Pantry Organization, 6-Pack, $34 (was $46)
Simple Houseware Expandable Kitchen Counter Shelf, $18
Deco Brothers Stackable Can Rack Organizer, $22 (was $33)
YouCopia ShelfBin Packet Organizer, $20
Aozita Stackable Wire Basket with Bamboo Top, Set of 2, $34 (was $38)

A can rack is a simple tool, but this particular model has a lot of perks. The 3-tiered shelf offers extra storage space and holds up to 36 cans. You can easily read the can labels thanks to the minimalist frame design. And since the shelves are built at a slight angle, cans always roll forward, so you don’t have to stand on your tippy-toes to reach them. (This would be a big win for me since I often have to climb onto the counter or drag over a chair to reach the top shelf).

A tiny organizer is more useful than you might imagine. My mom got a few small bins for taco seasoning packets and sachets of red pepper that my dad steals from restaurants. Once easily missed, the packets are now on display. YouCopia’s aptly named ShelfBin has raised dividers inside, propping up the packets for easy identification.
Amazon
Best Pantry Labels
Labels might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think about pantry organization, but they’re incredibly helpful. You can prevent mix-ups between flour and powdered sugar containers, or label dates to maintain freshness. These chalkboard labels come in a variety of snazzy designs, or you can grab a pack of pre-written labels covering the most common pantry ingredients.
Savvy & Sorted 200 Chalkboard Labels with Marker, $12 with promo code (was $15)
Vitever 308 Kitchen Pantry Labels for Food Containers, $12 (was $14)
Talented Kitchen Pantry Labels for Food Containers, 157 Pieces, $10 (was $15)
Chubbiee Removable Waterproof Food Labels, Pack of 64, $9
Mantah Assorted Chalkboard Label Stickers, 96 Pieces, $9
Savvy & Sorted 200 Chalkboard Labels with Marker
Amazon
$15
$12 at Amazon
With a name like Savvy & Sorted, you know you’re in for an organizational treat. This label set comes with a roll of 200 black stickers and a white chalkboard marker. Simple yet effective, the $12 collection has nearly 19,000 five-star ratings on Amazon.

If you have terrible handwriting like me, maybe you’d prefer pre-written labels. This beautifully organized set comes with 279 pre-printed labels (with plenty of duplicates in case you like to bulk buy), 29 blank labels, and pages of alphabetized ingredients so you can quickly find the sticker you need. The stickers themselves are waterproof, gorgeous, and reusable.
