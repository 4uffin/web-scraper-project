The weather is cooling, the leaves are changing, and the smell of autumn is in the air. With the changing of the seasons comes the changing of our meals. Tomato, sweet pea, and cucumber plants are concluding their growing season, while hearty veggies, such as parsnips, leeks, and thick-skinned squash are starting to line the grocery store shelves. The start of a new season is a great time to play with new flavors, products, fruits, and vegetables—and the start of fall may be the best of all.
I'd argue that fall food is the best out of the entire year. We get lots of tailgating dips and snacks, hearty casseroles, and warming soups that make the most of the season's flavors. But with back-to-school in full swing—and the holidays right around the corner—this season is also one of the busiest. That's why we turn to our favorite grocery stores, such as Aldi, to help us save money and make our lives a little bit easier during dinnertime.
Aldi recently brought back an entire line of fall products, including two soups that are some of the season's best. These fan-favorite jars are packed with flavor and make a quick and easy fall dinner.
Aldi's Pumpkin Maple Bisque and Butternut Squash Soup Return to Shelves
It's officially soup season, y'all! As a part of Aldi's fall release, the delicious jarred Pumpkin Maple Bisque and Butternut Squash Soup have officially returned to shelves.

These soups make for quick and hearty dinners, and can also be used as a base for different pastas, casseroles, pizzas, or you can even zhuzh them up to make loaded soups. And Aldi shoppers love them.
"I'm thinking of mixing it with coconut milk and some red curry paste to make a Thai pumpkin curry sauce," said one fan on Reddit about the Pumpkin Maple Bisque.
The Butternut Squash Soup has squash purée, cream, milk, garlic, onions, and other spices. It's a savory spin on the typically sweet soup. (Other versions of butternut squash soup can be made sweeter with the addition of nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon.) Aldi shoppers love this soup, and, in years past, this item sold out. "I got [the] Butternut Squash Soup in a jar from Aldi last year, and it was so good," said one Redditor. "And when I went back for more a few days later, it was gone."
The Pumpkin Maple Bisque is sweeter than the Butternut Squash Soup, thanks to the addition of maple syrup. But the added onion, carrot, garlic, and spices keep things both savory and sweet. "I tried it and was impressed," said one Redditor. "Well-balanced and not overly sweet."

"The Pumpkin Maple Bisque was amazing," shared an Aldi shopper on Facebook. "I topped it with bacon, green onion, toasted pumpkin seeds, and fresh grated Asiago!"
The jarred soups are available now at Aldi, and are priced at $3.89. Unlike the famous Aldi Finds, these soups will be around for more than a week, but they're not permanent. So, stock up on a few jars of these soups because you might miss them when winter comes around.
