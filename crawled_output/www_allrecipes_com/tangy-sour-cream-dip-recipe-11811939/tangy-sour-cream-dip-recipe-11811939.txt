I’ve always admired my mother-in-law’s fascination with yard and estate sales. A quick look around her home reveals some of the most timeless finds. A few months ago, while we were enjoying her buttery, crispy potatoes and steak, she handed me a gift: a pre-loved copy of The New York Times Cookbook, published in 1968. I lit up at the sight of it, but the real surprise came when we opened it together and discovered dozens of vintage magazine and newspaper clippings tucked between the pages, each filled with recipes from decades past.
I flipped through that book for weeks, gathering a long list of nostalgic recipes to try—but one appetizer caught my attention. Tucked inside the pages of the cookbook, I found a clipping for a “tangy sour cream dip,” described at the time as a “refreshing new idea.” Of course, sour cream dip is everywhere now. But that’s exactly why I wanted to try this version, to return to the roots of a classic and see what made it so special to readers back then.
So on an afternoon when I had guests coming over, I gave it a go.
How To Make Tangy Sour Cream Dip
I can’t find a date on the clipping for this tangy sour cream dip, but the font, paper color, and imagery suggest it’s several decades old. It appeared alongside a few other cutouts that trace back to the late 1960s, which gives a good sense of the era.
The recipe keeps things simple: Combine 1 cup of sour cream with 2 to 3 tablespoons of horseradish, 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 teaspoon of celery seed, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of paprika, and 2 teaspoons of finely chopped pimento olives. Mix everything together and let it chill in the fridge for “several hours.”
The recipe recommends serving the dip with “garden vegetables,” so I made a quick trip to the farmers’ market and picked up carrots and cucumbers. Once everything was plated and served, my guests kept commenting on how refreshing it tasted. I appreciated the subtle smokiness from the paprika, the gentle kick from the horseradish, and the briny bites from the pimento olives.
Creamy and quick to prepare, this dip came together in less than five minutes, and I can see why it was such a hit back then.

How to Upgrade Tangy Sour Cream Dip
I don’t live near my mother-in-law anymore, but as her DIL, it only feels right to make this tangy sour cream dip for her the next time we’re together. In the meantime, I’ve been thinking about how to spruce up this recipe and give it a little twist of my own.
I’d begin with the spices. The original relies on paprika for a bit of smokiness, but I’d love to experiment with a few pinches of Za’atar or herbes de Provence to introduce more aromatic depth. For brightness, a few dashes of fresh lemon or orange zest would add a fragrant, citrusy lift.
Personally, I like dips with some texture. The chopped pimiento olives already add a bite, but I’d take it further by sprinkling up some crispy bacon or fried onions on top. I could also see this dip working well with a garnish of crushed jalapeño or black pepper potato chips.
A few thoughtful tweaks transform this nostalgic dip into a timeless favorite. It’s proof that even decades-old recipes still deserve a place at the table today. And if nothing else, it’s a good reminder to flip through old cookbooks because you never know what hidden gems you’ll find.
