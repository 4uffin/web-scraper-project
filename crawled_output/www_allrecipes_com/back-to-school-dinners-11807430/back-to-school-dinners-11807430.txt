Allrecipes' editorial guidelines

We asked our editors with kids to share their favorite, go-to dinners for busy school nights. Their answers didn't disappoint, and they showcase a range of tastes, flavors, and techniques. We learned that taco night is a total crowd-pleaser, and pasta recipes like lasagna, carbonara, and bolognese will always reign supreme—especially for leftovers. Sometimes, nothing beats a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich. In some cases, our editors' kids take up the fork as chefs themselves, and most of these recipes accommodate little hands, have just a few steps, and sometimes even fewer ingredients. Going back to school never looked so tasty!

Spaghetti Carbonara
DOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS
"My daughter opts for a pasta, like Spaghetti Carbonara," says Editor Andrea Lobas, "which is great because it has extra protein from eggs." As for busy nights, Lobas and her family stick with fun and easy staples like hot dogs with pretzel buns and rotisserie chicken with rice and peas.

"You can prep everything ahead of time, and then everyone can assemble when they're ready to eat," says Features Editor Bridget Olson. "It's a lifesaver on days when everyone is coming and going at different times."

The Best Ground Beef Taco Meat
Peyton Beckwith
With just five ingredients, ground beef taco meat is an easy protein base for taco night. "I started putting my two kids in charge of one meal a week each," says Lobas. "My son loves to prep tacos, which are easy enough for him to make on his own."

Taco Seasoning
Allrecipes/Lindsey Hayes
"Best advice I ever got from a friend is to 'decide once', so that means Mondays are pasta, Tuesdays are tacos, Wednesdays are chicken, Thursdays are take-out, and Fridays are generally leftovers [for] movie night," says Associate General Manager Ashley Kappel. "In our quest to eat things we know, we're trying to make more from scratch, so [taco seasoning] helps with Tuesdays."

World's Best Lasagna
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
On nights when there's a little extra time, lasagna is a go-to for Kappel's family. The process is predictable, steady, and rewarding. Plus, she says, there's "lots of hands-on time to chat and catch up."

Crispy and Tender Baked Chicken Thighs
DOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS
For chicken-lovers, these crispy baked chicken thighs are an easy-to-prepare option that always turn out moist and juicy. "I've recently gotten back on the thigh train," says Kappel," so [I] make a version of this but add butter while they cook."

Slow Cooker Beef Barbacoa
Rock_lobster
"The shredded beef is a great alternative to ground beef for us, and I love that it's slow cooker friendly," says News Update Editor Samantha Dillard. "I used half of the meat to make baked tacos last night and tonight I'm repurposing the leftovers for burrito filling with rice and fajita veggies. Tasty and time saving."

Sausage and Vegetable Sheet Pan Dinner
"Sheet pan dinners are such a lifesaver for busy nights! I turn to this sausage sheet pan dinner so often and switch up the veg depending on what's in season," says Senior Editorial Director Diana Moutsopoulos. "Delicata squash or sweet potato are favorites, too, and work so well with the sausage."

Ragù Bolognese (North Italian Meat Sauce)
I make my kids' favorite dinner as a way of making back-to-school time special," says Senior Content Manager Frances Crouter. "I triple it and freeze the rest for later, since if you're going to all that trouble, why not stock up?"

To Die For Blueberry Muffins
Allrecipes / Diana Chistruga
Associate Editor Patricia Kaowthumrong's son has been loving muffins of all types. "I've been making a different kind every week," says Kaowthumrong. "Mini versions are great for a pre-breakfast snack when he wakes up! These are a favorite."
