Key Takeaways
Mixue Bingcheng recently dethroned McDonald’s as the world’s largest fast food chain by number of locations.The Chinese bubble tea and ice cream shop is opening its first-ever U.S. store.The chain offers budget-friendly items, with prices starting at just 15 cents.
McDonald’s has officially been dethroned—but not for nuggets or fries.
For decades, the Golden Arches stood tall as the world’s largest fast food chain. But earlier this year, a Chinese bubble tea and ice cream shop called Mixue Bingcheng knocked the burger giant down and took the No. 1 spot for the sheer number of locations around the world. And it just keeps growing.
While many Americans haven’t heard of the chain, it's been slowly taking over the Asian fast food market, opening an impressive 45,000 stores across China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, and other countries, according to AP News. This officially beats McDonald’s more than 44,000 global locations, as well as Starbucks’ more than 40,000 global stores.
Now, Mixue Bingcheng—which translates to "Honey Snow Ice City"—is opening its first-ever U.S. location near Manhattan’s Chinatown.

So what has driven this chain to such popularity? Pricing. The chain offers ultra-affordable boba, coffee, and tea drinks, as well as a selection of soft-serve ice cream and sundaes. Menu items include drinks such as Kiwi Jasmine Tea, Peach Mi-Shakes, Mango Sundaes, Brown Sugar Bubble Teas, Ice Cream Toffee Hazelnut Lattes, and more.
Exact U.S. pricing is not yet available. However, around the world, as AP News reported, many of Mixue Bingcheng's menu items are less than $1. Delish reported that the soft-serve ice cream costs the equivalent of 15 American cents, with "beverages that range in price from 30 cents to $1.20."
It sounds too good to be true, but fans on social media say it's the real deal. "Aside from the budget-friendly price, the quality is not compromised," shared one fan on Reddit. "Even the plastic feels soft matte and the print is polished, and in the serving of drinks/ice cream you can clearly see how it's done."
"Their mango sundae is to die for," added another Redditor.

According to Time Out, Mixue Bingcheng’s first U.S. location will be at 266 Canal Street, where the Chinese franchise signed a 10-year lease. As for footprint, the new Mixue Bingcheng location boasts more than 2,000 square feet.
New York City ranks as the seventh most expensive place to live globally, according to Numbeo's 2025 Mid-Year Cost of Living Index. So for New Yorkers used to paying double digits for their daily cup of joe, a visit to Mixue Bingcheng may offer a bit of financial reprieve—and a delicious sip.
