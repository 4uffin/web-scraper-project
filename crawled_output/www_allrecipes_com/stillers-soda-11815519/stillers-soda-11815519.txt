The soda industry is a hard one to break into. You have major players like Coca-Cola and Pepsi, which have been household staples for generations. Then, a few years ago, better-for-you sodas, such as Poppi and Olipop, emerged on the scene with a splash. As the popularity of soda alternatives continues to rise, it's no surprise that more and more people are thinking about all the ways they can change up a soda recipe.
Now, an unexpected celebrity has entered the beverage industry with an all-new soda brand, and it's already generated quite a buzz on social media.
Ben Stiller Launches Stiller’s Soda
Stiller's
While Ben Stiller may be most famous for his roles in the “Zoolander” franchise or as director and producer of the series “Severance,” he is now venturing into the world of soda. That's right, Stiller just launched a new soda brand with his namesake: Stiller's Soda.
Boasting low sugar and natural ingredients, Stiller’s Soda has hit the market strong by introducing three iconic flavors we all know and love: Root Beer, Lemon Lime, and Shirley Temple. The reimagined sodas contain only 30 calories and are packed with essential vitamins, including B12, C, and D, as well as plenty of carbonation for a sparkly, refreshing beverage.
"So excited to try this," commented a fan on the brand's new Instagram page.
"Is this liquid severance? I’m so in," joked another fan.
According to a press release, the idea behind the new beverage is to "reimagine the classic soda experience in a way that’s cleaner and lighter, without losing what makes it so special. At its core, the brand holds onto what makes soda fun, while giving people something they can feel good about drinking.”

The mission of Stiller’s Soda is to bring joy and real flavor back to the soda aisle. The three flavors also evoke a sense of nostalgia, especially the Shirley Temple option, which Allrecipes Editor Courtney Kassel had the opportunity to try out.
“It has a good balance of sugar and other sweeteners that isn’t as overwhelming as some other better-for-you sodas,” she said. “The flavor was lightly reminiscent of a Shirley Temple with notes of cherry and lime without being too syrupy sweet. I finished the whole can without even noticing, and I’d happily sip on it again. It won’t replace my beloved Poppi Doc Pop, but it’s a fun new soda that I imagine will strike a nostalgic chord for many shoppers.”
Currently, Stiller’s Soda will be sold exclusively in New York City and on Amazon. In the coming months, shoppers will be able to purchase the soda online at Walmart.com, with availability in retail locations nationwide starting at the beginning of 2026.
Whether you’re looking for a healthy alternative to your favorite soda or want something new to sip on, it might be worth keeping an eye on Stiller’s Soda.
