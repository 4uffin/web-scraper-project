Slow Cooker Cowboy Casserole
Jason Donnelly / Food Stylist: Holly Dressman / Prop Stylist: Natalie Ghazali
"This is an ideal meal that can be prepped the night before and then kept on the countertop for cooking throughout the day. My crock pot has a timer switch that turns to 'warm' when the cooking time is up. So I set it on low for six hours, and it was perfect for dinner after being on warm for 2-3 hours." —Nicole

Slow Cooker Stuffing
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
"OMG !!!! This recipe was DELICIOUS and has FINALLY freed up my stove burners for Thanksgiving dinner, as well as makes the stuffing in advance so that I can enjoy the Holidays socializing with my guests drinking a glass of wine before dinner (rather than making last-minute stuffing)!" —Sonja

Slow Cooker Chicken Enchilada Casserole
Jason Donnelly / Food Styling: Holly Dreesman / Prop Styling: Natalie Ghazali
"Just love this. I have not cooked the tortillas, but used them as a wrap for the chicken mixture with all the toppings. We shall have this often. (I’ve taught myself to make our own corn tortillas, which then becomes a family event!)" —Pam

Slow Cooker Sweet Potato Casseroles
Rita
"Ummm... delicious! My mother has made the same sweet potato casserole for decades, but we had several things on the menu for Christmas and I couldn't fit another thing in the oven. I was somewhat worried about a crockpot casserole, but this was amazing! ... Everyone raved and many went back for thirds! Can't say enough good about it!" —girliegirl575

Slow Cooker Cauliflower Casserole
"We love cauliflower, eat it raw as a snack, roast or steam it, mash it for a potato replacement, add it to a salad, but enjoying it as a creamy casserole with layers of interesting flavor is a great way to brighten up the dinner table." —lutzflcat

Slow Cooker Beef Enchilada Casserole
Peyton Beckwith
"Excellent recipe! All the flavor of chicken enchiladas without all the work! I followed the recipe exactly. Since I got a late start, I cooked it on High for 2 hours, then turned it to Low for 2 1/2 hours. The chicken was moist and fell apart when shredding. Absolutely delicious!" —JeanneD

Ultimate Crockpot Cowboy Casserole
Peyton Beckwith
"Delicious! As I was making this, I started questioning the ingredients - baked beans with kidney beans and potatoes. Sounded different if not bizarre but it lead to a very pleasing combination of flavors. Just the right amount of heat. I used fire roasted tomatoes with green chilies. I’ll definitely make again." —JLS

Slow Cooker Green Bean Casserole
Allrecipes / Renee Pajestka
"Great way to save oven space. This dish is a family tradition, and this version got great reviews. for Thanksgiving. I used 32 oz. frozen cut beans as called for but used 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, plus 7 or 8 fresh mushrooms, sliced and half a fresh onion, chopped. Cooked on low for about 6 hours and left the lid off after adding the French's onion rings, as suggested by some readers. I won't bother using oven again as this was just as good!" —Therese Peters Johnson
