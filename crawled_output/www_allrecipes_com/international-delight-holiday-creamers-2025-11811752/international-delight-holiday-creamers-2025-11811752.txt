Merry Christmas (in September), you filthy animal! If you ignore the fact that the weather hasn't broken yet in most parts of the country, you might just be able to put yourself in the holiday spirit thanks to coffee sidekick brand International Delight. Think cooling thoughts of snowmen, snowball fights, and Jack Frost nipping at your nose.
We know you’re probably still planning for your Halloween party, but in the consumer world, brands are already thinking about the upcoming winter holiday season.
If you walk into Walmart to grab some pumpkins to carve and Halloween candy, you’ll see holiday treats on shelves. If you head to Home Depot for supplies to spookify your home, you’ll find dozens of Christmas trees lining the store. And now, if you are shopping for your International Delight pumpkin spice-flavored creamers, you’ll be greeted by the brand’s line-up of holiday creamers.
More specifically, you’ll be greeted by Kevin McCallister screaming at you from the "Home Alone"-inspired packaging.
International Delight Brings Back Its Popular 'Home Alone' Holiday Line
International Delight/Allrecipes
This year, International Delight is bringing back its popular "Home Alone" creamers for sequel season (there are quite a few "Home Alone" movies, after all). The partnership with 20th Century Studios means an illustration of Kevin—modeled after the iconic after-shave scene—will grace each bottle, along with different scenes from "Home Alone" one and two.
Fans loved the holiday creamers so much last year, calling them "one of the best flavored creamers [I've] tasted," that International Delight even released its Frosted Sugar Cookie creamer in the spring. So, the brand isn't changing a thing this year. The lineup will remain the same with a Hot Chocolate Marshmallow, Frosted Sugar Cookie, and Peppermint Mocha flavors. Additionally, the fan-favorite Peppermint Mocha creamer will be sold in a Zero Sugar variety.
While the Hot Chocolate Marshmallow, Frosted Sugar Cookie, and Peppermint Mocha creamers can all be enjoyed in both hot and cold coffee, International Delight knows that some fans like to drink iced coffee all year long (yes!). So, it’s bringing back its Peppermint Mocha Iced Coffee made with real milk and cream, too.

The four creamers are hitting retailer shelves nationwide now and will be sold through the December holiday season—alongside the brand's all-new Peppermint Mocha and Frosted Sugar Cookie Cold Foams.
Sorry to Freeform's 31 Nights of Halloween, but we might be choosing a cup of Joe with "Home Alone" creamer and queuing up a Christmas movie, instead.
