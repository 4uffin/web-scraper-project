Pumpkin French Toast Bake
Alberta Rose
"Thanks so much for the great recipe! Love that you used pumpkin puree as many recipes for pumpkin french toast did not use pumpkin! I substituted a great whole grain bakery loaf and did not do the topping to make things a bit healthier and it was FANTASTIC. Also added milk to make cubes easier to coat." —ArtsySpice1590

Apple Raisin French Toast Strata
YelenaH
"I've been making this for several years, and realized I never submitted a review. It is a family favorite; I also make for a bakery and the customers RAVE about it. I make my own raisin bread, and I believe the trick is having a really good bread, cube it, and let it sit out a day. You want the egg mixture to really soak into the bread, and fresh bread will just get kind of mushy. EXCELLENT recipe as written. The only thing I add is a 1 TBSP of homemade vanilla. Makes you want to resort to being a kid and licking the plate!" —Anna

Apple-Cinnamon French Toast Bake
lutzflcat
"This is the best French toast bake that I have made! The addition of chopped apples over the bread, and the butter, pecans, sugar and spice mix poured over the top are so good! I dipped my bread slices in the batter before putting them in the baking pan rather than pouring it over the top, and used Macintosh apples because that is what I had on hand. Thank you for this recipe!" —Cheryl

"My Mom made this for us over the summer while on vacation. It was so good! I decided to make it for Thanksgiving breakfast and it did not disappoint. I left the pralines off because I have two picky eaters. Will definitely be a breakfast special in our house." —Lexi Brewer-Ballew
