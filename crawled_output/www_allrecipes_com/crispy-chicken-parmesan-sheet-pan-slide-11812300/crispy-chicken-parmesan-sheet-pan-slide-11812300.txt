There’s nothing like biting into a tender, cheesy piece of Chicken Parmesan. The crowd-pleasing dish comes together with a handful of simple ingredients that are manageable enough for weeknights but can impress on special occasions, too.
But no matter how much love you put into making the sauce and breading the chicken, all your hard work goes to waste if it turns into a soggy mess. Some have remedied the issue by adding grated Parmesan to the dry ingredients, and others swear by serving the sauce on the side.
Recently, we came across a unique method for preparing Chicken Parmesan, and not only does it save the golden crust on your perfectly pan-fried chicken, but it also doubles as an impressive party trick.
What Is the Chicken Parmesan Sheet Pan Slide Hack?
Allrecipes
What if we told you that to make the crispiest Chicken Parmesan you wouldn’t have to change the recipe you already love? All you need is a sheet pan to transform it into a version that doesn’t lose its texture before serving.
Rather than topping the chicken with spoonfuls of marinara or nestling it into a sauce-filled baking dish, you can simply cook the wet ingredients separately. Begin by pan-frying or baking the breaded chicken as you normally would until it’s fully cooked. Meanwhile, fill a quarter sheet pan with spoonfuls of sauce. You can use your desired amount, just be sure not to overfill because that will make it difficult to carry.
Next, top the tomato sauce with a generous layer of shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, salt, and pepper. Then, bake at 400 degrees F or broil it until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese is browned. Once warmed, you can garnish with any fresh herbs you wish to include.
Now, the magical part: the slide. Place the chicken on a large serving platter. Carefully pick up the warm sauce-filled pan using pot holders. Starting at the side of the serving plate farthest away from you, tilt the pan so that the sauce and cheese slide out on top of the cooked chicken. Slowly move the pan toward you, allowing the cheese and sauce to coat each portion.

So, is this trick worth the hype? Allrecipes producer and recipe developer Natalie Gravois tried out this technique in the test kitchen and found that it worked like a charm. "It’s nice and cheesy," she said after taking a bite. "The chicken is still very crispy. Can’t ask for a better Chicken Parmesan."
And that’s not the only recipe you can use with this technique; it also makes perfectly covered nachos. Rather than using tomato sauce and cheese, you can fill a sheet pan with queso and add grilled steak, sliced jalapeños, and fajita-style veggies. After baking, you can slowly pour over a second sheet pan filled with tortilla chips for a game-day-worthy meal.
