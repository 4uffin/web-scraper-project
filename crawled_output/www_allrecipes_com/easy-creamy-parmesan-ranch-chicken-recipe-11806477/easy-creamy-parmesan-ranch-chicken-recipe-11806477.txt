Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 4 servings
6 skinless, boneless chicken cutlets
1/2 cup mayonnaise
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
2 tablespoons ranch seasoning mix
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 green onions, thinly sliced
Directions
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). If using whole chicken breasts, cut them in half lengthwise to form 6 chicken cutlets. Arrange chicken in a single layer in the bottom of a lightly greased  baking dish.
In a medium bowl, stir together mayonnaise, yogurt, Parmesan, ranch seasoning, salt, and pepper until well combined.  Spread mayonnaise mixture over in a thick layer evenly over the chicken and bake about 17 minutes or until chicken is cooked through.
Without removing the chicken from the oven, turn the oven temperature to Broil and cook until browned and bubbly on top, another 1 to 2 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes; sprinkle with green onions before serving.

The prep for this could hardly be any easier, and the chicken came out so moist and flavorful. I made it exactly as written and it worked out very well! We served it over rice and it was great!
