Ten years ago, I would have never guessed that water bottles would become a full-on phenomenon. These days, water bottle styles and brands are cycled through almost as quickly as clothing trends. And while we'd love to keep up with the Joneses, it's not always realistic to drop $40+ dollars on a water bottle that may quickly become passé. That's where Aldi copycat products come in.
Our team (and readers) consistently turn to Aldi for its look-alike products. Whether it's a copycat of a Le Creuset Dutch Oven that saves us hundreds of dollars at the checkout, some beautiful dishware that looks like it belongs on the shelves of Anthropologie, or go-to kitchen tools that we use every day—Aldi is the place to invest in new kitchen pieces without the name-brand price tag.
This latest Aldi Find is a copycat of the beloved Hydro Flask water bottle that has been on the scene for years. And if you're not up for shelling out $39.95 for the Hydro Flask version, you're not going to want to miss this limited-time offering.

Aldi Has a New Hydro Flask Look-Alike for a Limited Time
From Sept. 24-30, Aldi's "Aisle of Shame" will have four versions of the Crofton 24-Ounce Stainless Steel Water Bottle With Straw Lid. This water bottle is strikingly similar to the Hydro Flask 24-Ounce Wide Mouth with Flex Straw Cap that retails for $39.95. The Aldi version, on the other hand, is just $6.99.

Beyond the lower price point, Aldi's water bottle has a few features that the name brand does not. In the product details, Aldi's website states that the "double wall stainless steel [is] great for hot and cold beverages." Hydro Flask's product description only mentions cold liquids, and states that its straw cap is "not intended for use with hot liquids." While the Aldi website does not specify about hot liquids in the cap, you should use caution while drinking through the straw just in case.
The other difference is that the Aldi version has a silicone ring on the bottom that prevents the water bottle from slipping and sliding on the desk, table, or cup holder. Each Aldi water bottle comes with a moveable handle on the cap for easy transportation, as well as a flippable straw that can be positioned open or closed when in use or not in use.
While the Hydro Flask brand offers a wider range of colors, the Aldi version does have multiple colorways available including blue with teal accents, gray with black accents, plum with white accents, and red with black accents.
The bittersweet news is that this product is an Aldi Find, which means it's only available for one week, or while supplies last. So if you're in need of a new water bottle at a fraction of the cost of the name brands, head over to Aldi ASAP.
