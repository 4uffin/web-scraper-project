Rotel Dip with Sausage
Nicole Russell
"This Rotel dip with sausage is an amped-up version of the familiar Rotel and Velveeta dip, and only takes a couple of extra steps to make. Not only does adding sausage stretch the dip, but it also takes it to another level of flavor." —Nicole Russell

Hot Maryland Crab Dip
"I live in Maryland and crab dip is ever present...this is a classic. I prepared exactly as written with the exception of adding more Old Bay and it needed to stay in the oven a bit longer than 20 minutes to warm completely through. Served it with hot pretzel sticks we picked up from the local hot pretzel bakery." —nocandew

Vidalia Sweet Onion Dip
lutzflcat
Jenn offers this prep tip: "Use a potato peeler to get the onion very thin." And yet Karen Spoerndle says, "I have made this dip many times and it is always a winner. I chop the onions instead of slicing and they cook just fine. No crunchies." If you can't find sweet onions, you can take a tip from other users and sauté regular yellow onions for a few minutes to soften their sharp bite.

Chef John's Queso Dip
Chef John
"I used to make something very similar to this queso dip at the Mexican restaurant I worked at in college, where we called it 'chili con queso.' At first I thought it could be thicker, but later I realized the saucy texture was the key to its irresistibility. Instead of too much cheese piled up on your chip, we just get a beautiful, silky coating, and as soon as you finish one, you can't wait to dip another, and another, and another, until there are no chips left." —Chef John

Jeff's Chili Con Queso
You can dial up the heat on this recipe by choosing a hot salsa and going all in on the hot pepper sauce. Or you can make it as written for a milder chile con queso experience.

Chorizo Fundido

"This is an amazing recipe and so easy to make! Made it for two parties in the last few weeks and first appetizer to completely disappear with everyone loving it. Pretty much followed recipe couldn't find poblano and just use different one jalapeño which made it spicy enough for a mixed crowd." — loretta
