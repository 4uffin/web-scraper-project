My Italian mom has been thriving in her hosting era long before the "eras" trend hit social media. My childhood home has always been the gathering place for cozy holiday meals, Greek yogurt pancake weekends, pasta and gravy Sundays, and elegant garden dinner parties. What really makes each event warm and inviting? My mom’s presence.
Naturally, she’s the queen of perfecting an aesthetically pleasing tablescape, complete with fairy lights, freshly picked bouquets, charger plates, on-theme candles, and all the fix-ins you could possibly dream of. Growing up, I hoped to master the hosting skills that came so naturally to her—she’s my role model.
I’ve learned many of my mom’s most cherished recipes over the years, including her famous pasta sauce (“gravy”) and meatballs. But one she makes year-round is undeniably simple: a four-ingredient salad. The kicker? You can snag everything you need to prepare it from Trader Joe’s without breaking the bank.
My Mom's 4-Ingredient Burrata Salad
Picture a bed of arugula with creamy burrata, fresh cherry tomatoes perched atop, and a drizzle of pesto to tie everything together. My mom’s salad looks gourmet, but it’s foolproof to prepare. The addition of a burrata ball on top makes the dish extra special.
Sometimes the salad will be served family-style on a platter that coordinates perfectly with the table, while others, my mom will prepare individualized servings where each guest gets their very own ball of burrata—decadence at its finest.
Whenever my mom serves this salad, dinner guests are instantly hooked and end up requesting it time and time again.
My mom also loves to get creative with her salad, depending on what she’s hosting. She may feel inclined to include fresh slices of prosciutto from her local Italian market to accompany the burrata, add sliced peaches or red onion from the farmer’s market during the summer, or swap out the arugula for chopped lettuce grown fresh in my dad’s vegetable garden. She also loves to garnish each picture-perfect plate with basil, when available.
That’s what’s especially great about this salad—it’s easily customizable to match the vibe you’re going for. So grab your canvas Trader Joe’s tote, and get ready to shop!
