When I asked the Allrecipes Allstars which kitchen tool was most important to them, they answered unanimously: a good kitchen knife. A dependable blade slices, dices, cuts, and chops through all kinds of ingredients and helps you make memorable meals.
To get the most out of your kitchen knives, they need a bit of TLC. Allstar Lindsey Close, a professionally trained chef, takes great care of her knives. She recommends honing blades weekly to keep them from growing dull too fast. (She also says you should get them professionally sharpened up to four times a year).
Honing a kitchen knife is all about maintaining a sharp edge. Running a knife along a honing rod keeps the blade edge smooth and aligned so it can properly cut through ingredients. Regular honing prolongs the lifespan of your kitchen knives and makes cooking prep so much easier. Ready to take your knife care to the next level? Check out this honing rod that’s half off for a limited time.
Hoshanho 10-Inch Kitchen Knife Honing Rod
Amazon
$65
$33 at Amazon
This 10-inch honing rod normally costs $65, but you can grab it at a 50 percent discount while it’s on sale. Made of Japanese high-carbon steel, the rod is incredibly durable and made to withstand everyday use. Fine mesh grooves along the rod restore and straighten the blade without causing unsightly scratches.
Use the honing rod to maintain any kind of straight-edged knife, including chef knives, paring knives, santoku knives, and more. It’s not recommended for serrated blades, like bread knives, however.
The handle has an S-shaped curve that fits right into the palm of your hand, reducing hand pain or fatigue if you’re honing a bunch of blades at once. Made of pakkawood, the handle features eye-catching swirls. Who says a functional tool can’t also be fashionable?
Now you can keep your kitchen knives in tip-top shape, just like our Allrecipes Allstars. Since the honing rod comes in a gorgeous storage box, it also makes for a great gift to any kitchen knife enthusiast in your life. Grab it while it’s 50 percent off.
