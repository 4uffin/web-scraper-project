I Asked the Allrecipes Allstars for the Chef Knives They Can’t Cook Without

Here at Allrecipes, we’re lucky enough to collaborate with expert home cooks from all across the country. We call them the Allstars. I recently had the opportunity to sit down one-on-one with many of our Allstars to chat with them about their favorite kitchen products. When I asked them to name the one kitchen tool every home cook should have, their answers were unanimous: a good chef knife.
Even though their answer was the same, their preferences for chef knives were not. Some Allstars preferred lightweight knives, others wanted more heft to the blade. Some prioritized affordability while other Allstars focused on comfort. Each home cook is different, and what worked for one Allstar might not work for another. That’s why I followed up with our Allstars and asked them which specific chef knives they preferred—and, most importantly, why.
Allstar-Loved Chef Knives
Wüsthof Classic 6-Inch Chef’s Knife, $100 (was $135)
Cuisinart 12-Piece Black Knife Set with Blade Guards, $40
Mercer Culinary Genesis 8-Inch Chef's Knife, $39
Paudin 9-Inch Chef Knife, $27 with coupon (was $53)

Allstar Jessica Lawson is a life coach and food blogger who believes that “taking a seat at someone's table and sharing a meal is the best way to learn about others.” Her recommendation comes from a beloved knife brand: Wüsthof.
“I have the Wüsthof knife set and I absolutely love it,” she says. “I have a large 8-inch chef's knife and the smaller 6-inch one. I tend to use the smaller one a lot; it's so versatile.” Both the 8-inch and 6-inch blades are full tang with triple-riveted handles for sturdy construction. They can withstand all of the slicing, dicing, chopping, and mincing of food prep for years to come.

If Wüsthof’s higher price tag is intimidating, don’t worry—Allstar Janelle Johnson has a budget-friendly pick. A self-taught baker and the founder of non-profit bakery Bites by Belle, her favorite Cuisinart set includes six knives with matching covers and costs only $7 per blade. “They're affordable, sharp, and can still be sharpened if they get dull,” she says. In addition to the classic 8-inch set knife, there’s a slicing knife, serrated bread knife, santoku knife, utility knife, and paring knife. “With this set I get all of the chopping and cutting done that I need. These do the job for an everyday cook.”
Her pick is remarkably similar to my favorite knife set—Cuisinart’s multicolor Advantage Cutlery collection.

While Allstar Lindsey Close also highly recommends the Wüsthof Classic, she thoroughly recommends Mercer knives as well, especially for budget-conscious home cooks. This 8-inch chef knife from Mercer is made of high-carbon German steel, has a non-slip ergonomic handle, and looks absolutely gorgeous.
As a professionally trained chef, Allstar Lindsey is serious about her knife sharpening routine. She uses a honing rod once a week to keep her knives in tip-top shape, and gets them professionally sharpened four times a year.

When I asked Kelsey Riley which kitchen tool every home cook should own, her answer was similar to her fellow Allstars: “A good knife. A chef’s knife.” Though Kelsey didn’t mention any brands by name, she does prefer longer 9-inch knives over the more common 7- or 8-inch blades. “You can use it for a watermelon or anything small. It has a nice oomph behind it.” Allstar Kelsey uses that oomph to prepare lots of fruits and vegetables in plant-based recipes she shares with her 3 million followers.
This 9-inch chef knife has a razor-sharp edge designed for precision. It also has a beautiful pakkawood handle and a convenient safety sheath for storage. While it’s normally $53, you can now grab the chef knife for only $27, thanks to a sale and coupon combo.
