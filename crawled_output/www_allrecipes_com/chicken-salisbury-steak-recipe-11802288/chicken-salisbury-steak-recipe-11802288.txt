This chicken Salisbury steak recipe is Chef John's award-winning Salisbury steak recipe, but with chicken, and is it ever good! The moist chicken patties with their mushroom pan sauce are absolutely delicious on their own, and even more so over mashed potatoes.

Original recipe (1X) yields 4 servings
Chicken Salisbury Steak
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast or thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces
1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1 large egg, beaten
2 tablespoons ketchup
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Sauce
8 ounces brown mushrooms, sliced
salt to taste
1/4 cup sliced green onion
2 tablespoons all purpose flour
2 cups high-quality chicken broth
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1/2 lemon, juiced
Directions
Add chicken, breadcrumbs, dry mustard, black pepper, cayenne, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, egg, and ketchup to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse on and off until the ingredients are coarsely but evenly ground. Transfer into a bowl, and pack down tightly with the back of a spatula. Cover and refrigerate for 20 to 30 minutes.
Using dampened hands, form chicken mixture into 4 oval patties about 1/2-inch thick. Season generously on both sides with salt.
Melt butter with oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. When butter stops foaming, place the patties in and brown on both sides for about 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat, then remove the patties to a plate and set aside.
For sauce, turn heat back on to medium-high, and transfer in mushrooms with a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring until the mushrooms are nicely browned. Add green onions, and sauté until they just start to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in flour and cook for 2 minutes.
Stir in broth, and wait for the sauce to come to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Stir in ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and lemon juice. Cook sauce until it is reduced and thickened as much as you like, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and add chicken patties back in.
Cook, basting often, until chicken is heated through, about 4 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted near the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
