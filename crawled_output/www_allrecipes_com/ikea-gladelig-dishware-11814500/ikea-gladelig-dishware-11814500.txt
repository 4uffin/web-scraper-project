Ikea’s New $5 Dishware Is Just as Striking as This $129 Pottery Barn Set
It's equal parts pretty and practical.

Ikea has always been a go-to for getting our kitchens in shape, whether we need a simple tool or a complete cabinet overhaul. The brand carries everything you need to fully stock a kitchen—at a price that won’t put you out.
But what we love even more than the variety and value is when the Swedish retailer takes inspiration from our favorite high-end stores like Williams Sonoma and Pottery Barn, giving us kitchen staples that are not only practical but also trendy and stylish.
Now, Ikea is expanding one of its most popular dishware collections with new pieces and colorways, making it an even closer match to the higher-priced originals.
Ikea Launches New Gladelig Dishware
Allrecipes / IKEA
Ikea’s Gladelig dishware line looks strikingly similar to Pottery Barn’s $129 Nico Stoneware collection—but at just a fraction of the cost. With the same artisanal look and feel, this line makes it easy to achieve a high-end aesthetic without the high-end price tag.
The pieces we’re most excited about are the plates, deep bowls, side plates, and regular bowls. Together, they can create a sophisticated table setting, but they also shine as standout pieces individually. Each item is coated with a reactive glaze that gives it a handmade look while also making it durable and easy to clean.
“This line of dishes is just stunning,” one reviewer shared. “I had a bowl slip out of my hand in the sink, and it was ok; so, they aren't super delicate. Very happy with this line.”
This collection has a timeless look that brings elegance to any dining table, but at a steal of a price, it can be used every day without the worry of chipping your best dinnerware. And did we mention it's all microwave-safe?

The 10-inch dinner plates and 8.5-inch deep plates (or shallow bowls) are both priced at $5.99, while the 8-inch side plates and 5.5-inch bowls are both available for $4.99 a piece.
And the collection doesn’t stop there. Ikea also has serving platters, mugs, and even a teapot in the Gladelig lineup. There’s also a best-selling baking dish that can go straight from oven to table, which customers rave is “so useful” and “so pretty.”
We don’t mind splurging on a standout kitchen piece or two when we know it’ll earn its keep, but when we can find beautiful additions that hold up just as well as their high-end counterparts, we’ll always take the latter.
