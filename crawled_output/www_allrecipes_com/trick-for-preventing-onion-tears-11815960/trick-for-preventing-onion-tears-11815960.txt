When it comes to slicing onions, there is no middle ground for me when it comes to onion tears. For some reason, I always get an extreme case. This has been the case my entire life, with any type of onion, and it happens every single time. It makes for some awkward moments in the kitchen. My eyes completely well up at a rapid pace, and I truly can’t see a thing. I need to pause everything, give my eyes a serious pat down with cold paper towels, and then grab tissues for my runny nose.
I’m not sure if this condition is genetic, scientific, or if onions just know I’m already a big cry baby by nature. But when I know I’m going to have to slice an onion, I can feel it staring at me from my produce bowl, like it’s waiting to attack. I'd be lying if I said there haven’t been moments where mascara is involved, where I’ll ditch the onion all together and find a replacement in order to avoid the drama. This is why I was so incredibly relieved when I finally discovered a trick to prevent onion tears that actually works. The curse has been broken, and now it’s my duty as a cook and writer to spread the word!

The Best Hack For Ditching Onion Tears
I’ve tried every myth and method in the book to prevent onion tears. Whether it’s slicing the onion near or under cold running water, lighting a candle, chewing gum, using a damp paper towel, recruiting a sharper knife, or even wearing sunglasses and onion goggles, nothing ever seems to work—until now! All you have to do is place the whole, peeled onion in the freezer in an airtight bag for 10 to 15 minutes before chopping, slicing, or dicing. Set a timer, and don’t freeze it for much longer because then you run the risk of working with a soggy onion.
The Science Behind This Trick
Allrecipes/Julia Hartbeck
You’re probably wondering why this method seems to work so much better than all the others. Placing an onion in the freezer before slicing is effective because the slight freeze slows down the enzymatic reaction that releases the compounds responsible for irritating your eyes. So yes, you’re still on the clock before the onion comes back to room temperature and resumes business as usual, but when the gases release more slowly, you’ve got ample time to slice in peace, sans tears.
As always, I’m fascinated by the science behind food, but most of all, I feel immense relief that I no longer have to dread working with one of the most versatile, flavorful ingredients in the kitchen!
