People who say chicken tenders aren't worthy of an "entrée" title, in my opinion, have never had a truly good batch. Sure, they're great side snacks on game day or a popular appetizer at a potluck. Chicken tenders are also very approachable, which makes sense as to why many parents pass them off to their children as kids’ meals. But beyond that, a good chicken finger can easily serve as the star of a meal.
If you make them at home, you can experiment endlessly—mix coconut flakes into the coating or give them a spicy buffalo twist. If you grab the right frozen brand from the grocery store, you can pop them into the air fryer, then stuff them into a sandwich or wrap for a quick, hearty lunch.
What I love most about chicken tenders, though, is how easy it is to grab them from fast-food drive-thrus, especially when I'm in a pinch.
Though some folks may not be completely sold on chicken tenders as an all-star meal, I'm convinced that's because they haven't tried the right kind. So, to sift out the good ones, I visited several popular fast food spots to see who's frying up the best chicken tenders. After hitting up seven drive-thrus, I found a clear winner. Read on to find out which one will make you a chicken-finger believer.
How I Tested the Fast Food Chicken Tenders
I spent a few weeks testing chicken tenders to space out my judging and, honestly, to avoid eating too many in one day. I hit up popular fast food spots like McDonald's, Sonic, Raising Cane's, and others in my quest to secure the best chicken fingers. For every contender, I made sure to taste them fresh to give them a fair chance at judging.
As for my all-star criteria, I started with the basics: a crunchy, well-seasoned exterior. I also looked for chicken that delivered tender, juicy bites. And I paid close attention to portion size, because nothing's more disappointing than opening a box of chicken tenders to find a handful of flimsy, dainty strips.
Chains earned bonus points for tasty sauces and delicious, already-included-in-the-meal sides. On that note, read on to discover which chicken tenders are worth going out of your way for the next time a drive-thru craving hits.
The Best Fast Food Chicken Tenders, Ranked
7th Place: McDonald's Chicken Tenders
Ashia Aubourg
After sampling several chicken tenders, I quickly picked up on even the smallest differences. When it came to McDonald's, texture played a major role in my judgment. The tenders offered decent seasoning on the first bite, but the texture didn't hold up. They leaned dry and rubbery, with a freezer-like taste that was hard to ignore even after dunking them in the chain's sweet and sour sauce.
6th Place: Burger King's Chicken Fries
Ashia Aubourg
Burger King fills its Royal Crispy Wrap with meaty chicken tenders, but those aren't available for order, so the closest alternative is its chicken fries. I appreciated the crunchy, savory, and slightly spicy bites from these strips. Still, compared to tenders from other fast food chains, they don't hold up. The texture is slightly dense, and the strips run thin, boasting an interior that comes off more like chicken nuggets than freshly fried chicken fingers.
5th Place: KFC's Chicken Tenders
Ashia Aubourg
Biting into one of KFC's tenders revealed a nostalgic, well-rounded flavor, thanks to the chain's secret blend of spices and herbs. I also appreciated the generous size and meatiness of each piece. But the tenders ultimately fell short in the final fry. That batch I received came out soggy and lacked the satisfying crunch expected from quality chicken fingers.

4th Place: Arby's Chicken Tenders
Ashia Aubourg
I appreciated how Arby's chicken tenders arrived piping hot and crispy, but the texture threw me off after the first bite. The chicken turned out rubbery and tough, with a faint freezer-burn aftertaste that none of the chain's sauces could mask. In the end, I preferred the brand's barbecue chicken sandwiches and would recommend ordering one of those over the fingers.
3rd Place: Sonic's Chicken Tenders
Ashia Aubourg
Sonic's chicken tenders deliver a nostalgic flavor, reminiscent of the kind you'd snag at an amusement park or carnival. The coating offers bold seasoning and crunch, while the chicken stays juicy and flavorful. I usually hit up this chain for mozzarella sticks, chili cheese dogs, and slushies, but from now on, I'll be adding a three-piece tender order to round out the meal. Pro tip: Grab a mix of dipping sauces like the brand's Honey Mustard, BBQ, or Groovy Sauce to kick the flavor of these tenders up even more.
2nd Place: Popeyes Chicken Tenders
Ashia Aubourg
Popeyes came close to taking the top spot in this taste test. I appreciated the variety of breading flavors, such as classic, spicy, and blackened. The chain hand-breads its chicken tenders, and the first bite of the classic flavor delivers a crunchy coating wrapped around juicy, tender white meat chicken.
The tenders strike a satisfying balance in size, too. They're not so small that they resemble popcorn chicken or nuggets (even though Popeyes recently started selling a BK Chicken Fries dupe). Instead, they're meaty enough that three tenders, paired with sides like red beans and rice or mac and cheese, feels like a home-cooked Southern meal.
1st Place Winner: Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers
Ashia Aubourg
These ultra-crispy, hand-battered chicken tenders grabbed my attention with the first bite, delivering a crunchy exterior and juicy interior. Each strip packed bold seasoning without tipping into saltiness. Their generous size made them feel more like a full entrée than a kids' meal of nuggets. A typical order rounds out with a buttery slice of Texas toast, crunchy crinkle-cut fries, the brand's special sauce, and creamy coleslaw, turning it into an even more satisfying meal.
