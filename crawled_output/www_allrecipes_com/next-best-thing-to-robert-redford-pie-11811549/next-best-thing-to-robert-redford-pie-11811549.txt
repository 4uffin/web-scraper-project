The first time I saw Robert Redford on the big screen was in the movie The Way We Were. While too young to fully understand the storyline, I cried like a baby at the ending. (I still can’t watch it without sobbing). Spoiler alert: I’m a sucker for fairy tale endings and that one surely isn’t. Regardless, from that day forward I was smitten with the actor with the classic good looks.
Fast forward a few decades to when I heard about a dessert known as the ‘Next-Best-Thing-to-Robert-Redford Pie.’ With such a bold claim, I knew I had to try it. It did not disappoint.
What Is ‘Next-Best-Thing-to-Robert-Redford Pie’?
Rich and creamy, the pudding-like pie has four layers: a nutty shortbread crust, luscious cream cheese filling, chocolate pudding, and a whipped cream topping. This quick and easy 9x13-inch dessert can be made ahead so it’s perfect for entertaining. It’s served chilled and eaten with a spoon to ensure you get every crumb.

Why Is It Called ‘Next-Best-Thing-to-Robert-Redford Pie’?
Aside from the obvious nod to the desirability of Robert Redford, there’s not much written about the origin of the name. I did learn that the recipe gained popularity in the 1970s, which makes sense because that’s when Redford began his ascension to movie star status. Family Circle magazine referenced the dessert in the late 70s. Then, in a 1981 meeting of newspaper food writers from around the country, one of the attendees shared the recipe. Naturally, those writers passed it along to their respective readers, and word of mouth took over from there.
Through the years, the creamy layered dessert has been known by many other names. In fact, Southern Living says it has more than 100 monikers, from Possum Pie to Four-Layer Delight, Mississippi Mud Pie to Better-Than-Sex Dessert. I’ve even heard it referred to as Jimmy Carter Cake. It seems like people can’t even decide if it’s a pie, a pudding, or a cake—but, whatever you call it, you’ll fall in love at first spoonful.

How To Make ‘Next-Best-Thing-to-Robert-Redford Pie’
This luscious treat not only looks and tastes divine, but also is quite easy to make. Like all layered desserts, it’s a matter of stacking various textures.
For the bottom crust layer, combine flour, butter, and chopped walnuts, and press into the bottom of a pan. Bake until golden brown. Mix together cream cheese, sugar, and whipped topping and spread over the cooled crust. Combine one package of chocolate instant pudding and one package of vanilla instant pudding with milk until mixture is thick. Spread pudding over the cream cheese layer, and then top that with the remaining whipped topping. Refrigerate before serving.

What the Allrecipes Community Has To Say
My grandmother Made this when I was little, and I have never met anyone who ever called it by the same name. I grew up thinking Robert Redford was just the name of a great dessert!! Thank you for all of the memories that came flooding back when I bit into this fabulous pie! I am forever grateful….” —JAGinCOS“Delicious dessert. My kids don't know who Robert Redford is, but after one bite of this pie, they didn't care. I sprinkled crushed Oreos on the top rather than grated chocolate. Wonderful!” —designer24“Robert was truly one hot number in his prime, but now that we’re both older, I think I’ll take the pie. Decided to go with a graham cracker crust, which worked beautifully with this incredibly delicious pie. So good and really pretty too with the chocolate shavings. Kids and hubby went wild over it.” —LINDA MCLEAN“This recipe is a family favorite! We make it every holiday- Thanksgiving, Easter, Christmas, birthdays... Everyone loves it! I've never changed anything and it's always amazing, though I'd recommend freezing it instead of just refrigerating. The layers don't blend together so much. Wonderful recipe!!!” — tenmouthstofeed“Very easy to make and incredibly yummy. You can interchange the pudding types for different tastes. Great dessert!” —Danielle Mills Brenner
