I love baking bread—and not just because I enjoy snacking on my homemade loaves. As many enthusiasts agree, the best part is the process itself. I love working with my hands, and filling my home with the sweet, tangy aroma of sourdough bread is an added bonus. It’s a peaceful experience, until my bread is in the oven and it’s time to face the mountain of dishes I’ve amassed in the sink.
This year, I’ve resolved to do things differently by grabbing this mixing bowl with a built-in scale. Whether you’re in your sourdough era or getting an early start on baking fall desserts, this clever tool promises to make the process more efficient while reducing dirty dishes. It can replace your mixing bowl, individual liquid and solid measuring cups, and food scale.

"What really sets this scale apart is the mixing bowl that’s integrated into the design,” wrote one reviewer. “It’s a genius touch because it saves time and reduces mess in the kitchen." The built-in scale features a tare function, which resets the scale to zero. Instead of dirtying measuring cups for each ingredient I’m measuring, this allows me to measure everything in the same bowl.
The Fradel Digital Kitchen Food Scale Bowl has a generous capacity, holding up to 11 pounds or 1500 milliliters of ingredients. Shoppers like that it’s large enough for big batches. “It fits all of my ingredients easily,” said a second shopper who uses it for making bread. The control panel is located on the handle, so the buttons are right at your fingertips (literally!). It has an ergonomic shape for a comfortable, nonslip grip.
Another customer liked that "the bowl is detachable and easy to clean." The stainless steel inner bowl releases at the touch of a button and is dishwasher-safe for the ultimate easy cleanup. It’s designed to prevent stains, dents, and other damage. Shoppers agree that the gadget is built to last. It “can take a beating,” noted a fourth reviewer.
No matter what you’re baking, this gadget can take on the task. It can measure in weight or volume, in several units: grams, pounds, ounces, milliliters, cups, and fluid ounces. Most unique of all is the scale’s built-in settings for flour, water, milk, and oil.
Ready to bake smarter, not harder? Head to Amazon to snag the Fradel Digital Kitchen Food Scale Bowl for $40.
