Fall is one of my favorite times of the year to see new products hitting shelves. With school back in session and the NFL season well underway, having a new snack to bring to the table (or tailgate) is always exciting.
One snack that will truly never disappoint is Dot’s Pretzels. Bring a Sam’s Club-sized bag of those buttery, seasoned pretzels to any get-together, and you’ll see the bag empty quicker than anything else.
The Hershey Company-owned snack brand may be best known for its classic, homestyle original seasoned pretzel, but its flavors deserve some time in the spotlight, too. Dot’s Pretzels’ Parmesan Garlic quickly became a fan favorite after it was released last summer, and its newest BBQ pretzels have already seen a few barbecues of their own this year.
Now, Dot’s Pretzels is releasing a new flavor of its pretzel twists—and I’ve already eaten an entire bag.
Dot's Pretzels Has a New Buffalo Flavor
Allrecipes / Dot's Pretzels
Dot’s Pretzels recently released its first-ever spicy flavor with its new Buffalo Seasoned Pretzel Twists. The bold new flavor has the same buttery seasoning you expect from Dot’s, with a zip of Buffalo heat.
The new pretzels offer the perfect balance of spicy, tangy, and buttery flavor—just like a classic Buffalo chicken wing sauce should.
Dot’s Pretzels' new Buffalo pretzels are hitting shelves in a 5-ounce, 9.5-ounce, 16-ounce, and 35-ounce bags. And, even though they joined the portfolio over the summer, they’re officially in retailers nationwide now. Better yet, the snack is sticking around, you can have Buffalo-flavored pretzels from tailgating season to Super Bowl Sunday and beyond.

Cheez-It Is Launching Its Biggest Innovation in 3 Years, and We Tried It First
I tried the new Buffalo-flavored Dot’s Pretzels at the 2025 Sweets & Snacks Expo and can say these pretzels quickly became a family favorite. In fact, we were practically fighting over who would get the final few pretzels once we reached the bottom of the bag.
Dot’s Pretzels’ Buffalo flavor does pack a spicy punch, but the extra-buttery, savory seasoning and pretzel itself even out the spice.
With one bag devoured in less than a weekend, it’s safe to say I’ll be springing for the 35-ounce bag to save my family from another fight. Our football season snacking just got so much better.
