Key Takeaways
After a two-year hiatus, a beloved spooky menu item is returning to Burger King.The $2 item will only be available for a limited time.
Halloween is still weeks away, but some of our favorite fast food restaurants are already getting in the haunting holiday spirit. Last month, fans raced to get Wendy’s Meal of Misfortune, a mysterious and spooky menu item inspired by the hit Netflix series "Wednesday." More recently, Wendy's brought back the Frosty Frights Kids' Meal with 12 new toys that collectors couldn’t wait to get their hands on.
Speaking of collectibles, Burger King recently released a nostalgic Scooby-Doo King Jr. Meal, which features mini versions of the Mystery Inc. gang with removable Halloween masks.
And that’s not the only item you’ll need to make space on the shelf for. This year, Burger King is bringing back its Boo Bucket rival after a two-year hiatus.
Burger King's Halloween Buckets Are Back
Starting Oct. 10, Burger King's Halloween Buckets are back on the menu. You can snag this limited-edition pail for just $2 at participating Burger King locations, but only while supplies last.
Burger King
Burger King’s new Halloween Bucket features a spooky scene with illustrations of popular menu items dressed in festive costumes. The characters include a box of chicken fries dressed like a mummy, a beef patty donning a football helmet, and a chicken nugget wearing a purple witch hat.
Burger King first launched its Halloween Bucket in 2023, but fans haven’t had the chance to snag one since then. On Instagram, many were thrilled to see the buckets return with a fresh design. "Burger King getting in on the bucket bonanza!" exclaimed one excited fan.

Some Instagrammers are already planning to add the orange-handled pail to their collection. "So many buckets, so little display area. Will definitely grab one of these," wrote one user. "We’re living in a time where Dunkin' and Burger King do better Halloween buckets than McDonald’s," added another.
And while BK’s new bucket doesn’t come with any food, you can still snag some of your favorite menu items such as the fan-inspired Crispy Onion Whopper, the returning Cini Minis, and the Frozen Cotton Candy Cloud Drink. But don't delay, because just like Burger King's Halloween Bucket, these menu items won't last long.
