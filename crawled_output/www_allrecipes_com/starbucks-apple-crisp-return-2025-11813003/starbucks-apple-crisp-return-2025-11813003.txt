Key Takeaways
Following customer pleas, Starbucks is bringing back a fall flavor that was thought to be discontinued. The flavor is returning in its signature beverages, plus an all-new way to order it.
It seems like the pumpkin spice latte has been back at Starbucks so long that we should be getting the holiday drinks soon—and yet, the first day of fall isn’t even officially here. If you haven’t pumpkin’ed yourself out just yet (or, actually, it might be better if you have), Starbucks is making an update to its fall menu, and we’re certain many of you are going to be ecstatic.
Every year, there seems to be one seasonal beverage item that takes a hit. My Starbucks heart-breaker will forever be the Toasted White Chocolate Mocha, which was released as part of the holiday menu for six years, only to be unceremoniously discontinued in 2023. This year, the beverage that fell on the sword for the new Pecan Oatmilk Cortado was actually a whole line of drinks: the Apple Crisp-flavored ones.
In 2024, Starbucks introduced an all-new Iced Apple Crisp Nondairy Cream Chai, which starred alongside the Apple Crisp Oatmilk Macchiato and Iced Apple Crisp Oatmilk Shaken Espresso. Despite the new offering and entire lineup, the Apple Crisp beverages must not have been as highly sought after as the PSL because Starbucks decided not to bring them back this year.
The chain may have thought the Apple Crisp fandom was small, but they are mighty as they flocked to the Instagram comments to share just how "devastated" they were that the Apple Crisp didn’t make the 2025 cut.
So, just as KFC said, "Here, damn," to its returning potato wedges, Starbucks has given in. The coffee chain is bringing back its Apple Crisp drinks in October—and it will have a brand new one.

Following customer pleas, the Iced Apple Crisp Oatmilk Shaken Espresso and Apple Crisp Cream Cold Foam (which was used to make last year’s chai) are officially headed back to menus. And, you’ll be able to try the apple drinks in a whole new way, thanks to the new Apple Crisp Protein Cold Foam with 15 additional grams of protein per grande drink.
Starbucks’ new Protein Lattes and Protein Cold Foams are hitting menus on Sept. 29, however, you’ll have to wait a bit longer for the Apple Crisp version and the rest of the returning Apple Crisp drinks. The chain is bringing back its Apple Crisp offerings beginning Oct. 14, and they’ll only be available while supplies last.
So, if you were one of those people who pleaded with Starbucks by saying you "would swim across the Atlantic Ocean and back for [the brand] to keep the Apple Crisp flavors," the bad news is that you’d better get swimming. But the good news is that you’re only a few weeks away from apple-flavored goodness again.
