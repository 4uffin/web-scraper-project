There’s only one thing we love more than a new M&M’s flavor hitting shelves and that’s multiple new M&M’s flavors hitting shelves. We’ve been pretty lucky this year with the White Chocolate Marshmallow Crispy M&M’s returning after a two-year hiatus, along with the introduction of a new Cookies & Creme and Honey Roasted Peanut flavor.
And while there’s still plenty of time for M&M’s to announce a new candy for the holiday season—or at least bring back last year’s Toasted Holiday Peanut M&M—the Mars Wrigley brand is already thinking about next year. The candy company announced plans to release 11 new candy innovations in the next year, from Snickers Xtreme to Sour Starbursts.
As part of those innovative plans, Mars Wrigley is debuting three new M&M’s flavors. But, that’s not all—it’s also bringing back its popular Flavor Vote for the first time in six years.
M&M's Set To Release 3 New Candies in 2026
Over the years, M&M’s has held three sets of fan votes to give its customers a say in what candy flavors come to shelves. The campaign was launched in 2016 with Honey Nut, Coffee Nut, and Chili Nut flavors, and Coffee Nut came out on top—though we might have just finally gotten the Honey Nut fans wanted in the new Honey Roasted Peanut flavor.
Then, in 2018, M&M’s asked fans to decide between Crunchy Raspberry, Crunchy Espresso, and Crunchy Mint, with Crunchy Mint taking home the win. The last time M&M’s held its Flavor Vote was in 2019, when it introduced English Toffee Peanut, Mexican Jalapeño Peanut, and Thai Coconut Peanut flavors, with English Toffee Peanut winning the vote.
Now, the brand is asking fans to choose 2026’s fan-voted flavor with a new Bakery Collection. The three new flavors include Peanut Butter Cinnamon Roll, Cherry Chocolate Cupcake, and Lemon Meringue Pie.
Allrecipes / M&M's
M&M’s new Flavor Vote offerings will start hitting shelves in January 2026, where they’ll be sold in three different sizes. Customers can try the new flavors and then vote for their favorite using the QR code located on the packaging.
The winning flavor will see an extended run, while the two losers will join the Flavor Vote graveyard alongside Honey Nut, Chili Nut, Crunchy Raspberry, Crunchy Espresso, Mexican Jalapeño Peanut, and Thai Coconut Peanut.
M&M’s fans are already stoked to get their hands on the new products, with Instagram users commenting they’re "going to need several hundred bags." While I didn’t get that many, I did try the three new M&M’s flavors early, and here is my honest review.

My Honest Review of M&M's New Flavor Vote Flavors
Going into the taste test, I thought my ranking would be Cherry Chocolate Cupcake in first, Peanut Butter Cinnamon Roll in second, and Lemon Meringue Pie in third. After trying them, Lemon Meringue took home my first place medal, followed by Cherry Chocolate Cupcake, and with Peanut Butter Cinnamon Roll in last.
While the Peanut Butter Cinnamon Roll has a strong Peanut Butter M&M flavor, I found the hint of cinnamon at the end to be overly sweet and slightly artificial-tasting. The Cherry Chocolate Cupcake flavor tastes essentially like a chocolate-covered cherry, with extra rich, dark chocolate indulgence—which, I guess, is the "cupcake" part.
The M&M that surprised me the most was the Lemon Meringue Pie one—in both flavor and texture. This M&M has a crunchy interior—almost like a cookie—with deep citrusy flavors and white chocolate. I’m not usually a white chocolate lover, but coupled with the bright lemon, it really works.
I’d be happy to see both Lemon Meringue Pie or Chocolate Cherry Cupcake M&M’s on shelves, but my vote might lean more toward the lemony, crunchy candy.
