Bulgogi Ground Beef Stir Fry
Be the first to rate & review!

This bulgogi ground beef stir fry is a new spin on stir-fry, using ground beef. Some of the prep is eased because it is seasoned with purchased bulgogi sauce, so all you need to do is chop the vegetables.

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 4 servings
1 pound lean ground beef
1/2 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce
1 tablespoon beef tallow or avocado oil
1 white onion, cut in half and sliced
1 red bell pepper, cut into small pieces
1 head baby bok choy, stalk and leaves chopped separately, divided
2 cups snow peas, stringed and corners trimmed
3 cloves garlic, minced
5 ounces bulgogi marinade (see Cook's Note)
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 cups hot cooked white rice, for serving
cilantro leaves (optional)
Directions
Gather all ingredients. Preheat a cast iron skillet and a large wok-style pan to medium-high heat.
Allrecipes / Diana Chistruga
Lightly season the beef with salt and pepper. Add beef to the cast iron skillet, and allow to lightly sear before gently breaking it up into small chunks, but not too fine.
Allrecipes / Diana Chistruga
Add in soy sauce. Cook until beef is no longer pink, then set aside.
Allrecipes / Diana Chistruga
Add beef tallow to the wok. Add onions and saute just to get some color on them. Add bell pepper and chopped bok choy stalks; stir fry for 1 to 2 minutes. Add in snow peas, then garlic. Cook, stirring regularly to ensure everything softens but also stays crisp.
Allrecipes / Diana Chistruga
Add in bok choy leaves last. Give all the vegetables 1 full stir, then add bulgogi marinade. Stir, then stir beef into the mix.
Allrecipes / Diana Chistruga
Serve over hot white rice; garnish with cilantro leaves.

Cook’s Note
The order of the vegetables is key as you want the firmer ones to cook longer so they do soften but also stay somewhat crisp. Bulgogi marinade is sold commercially, but you can also use a homemade version. Feel free to add a dash of low-sodium soy sauce or some chili garlic sauce to the final dish.
