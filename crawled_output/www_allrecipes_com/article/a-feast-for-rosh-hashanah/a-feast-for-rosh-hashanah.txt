The Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, is a time to reflect upon the past year, reunite with family members and friends, and celebrate the happy year to come. It's a time both for joy and for self-reflection. The foods served at a traditional Rosh Hashanah meal have special meanings, and we've highlighted a few that are must-haves for your festivities.
Traditional Rosh Hashanah Foods
Brisket
This deliciously tender, kosher cut of meat is perfect for feeding a crowd. Cook brisket low and slow for unforgettably rich results.

Carrots
Carrots represent the promise of surplus blessings in the new year. Try them in a spicy Caribbean soup or a classic Rosh Hashanah dish like sweet, wholesome tzimmes, a root vegetable stew that is a must-try.

Challah
On this special day, there are many symbolic foods: the challah is round, signifying the cycle of the year, while raisins in the bread symbolize joy.

Dates
Dates are served to symbolize ending feuds with friends and neighbors. Make a date cake, crumble, or cookie to keep your sweet tooth satisfied (and the bad vibes away).

Fish
Long a symbol of prosperity and abundance, fish for Rosh Hashanah is often prepared with a sweet sauce or stuffed with nuts and fruits. Fish heads specifically represent knowledge, because their eyes are always open and so see everything.

Leeks
Leeks, along with chard and spinach, are eaten to symbolically cut off the negative intentions of others. Indulge in the sweet, sharp flavor of this versatile veggie for a well-rounded Rosh Hashanah meal.

Apples and Honey
Apples and honey take starring roles as the families dip the fruits of their labor in the sweetness of the upcoming year. Honey cakes and apple cakes with assorted ingredients, filling, and toppings will take center stage on your holiday table.
