In an ideal world, you'd have time in the morning to cook your kids a nutritious meal before sending them off to school. In the real world, you're doing great if you can get them to eat something on the run. Smart solution: Make a week's worth of good-for-you portable breakfast bites they can take and eat on the go. Give the following kid-friendly recipes a try (plus, glean some wisdom from Allrecipes community members who have made them!), and don't be surprised if they get the whole family to start eating healthier in the morning, too.
1. Oat and Blueberry Muffins

Whole oats, blueberries, and yogurt take these muffins into the zone where delicious meets nutritious. Melanie2461 says she followed the recipe exactly and even her picky daughter loved them.

2. Bird's Nest Breakfast Cups

Bake these versatile egg cups in cupcake liners to make them even easier to grab and go. Feel free to change up the ingredients or add more vegetables.

3. Playgroup Granola Bars

When Hannah Ulrich makes these, she wraps them individually so her family can grab them as they run off to school or work. She says they're even much heartier, filling, and delicious than any other granola bar out there, and she's saving money by making them instead of buying them.

4. Blueberry Banana Breakfast Bars

Kelly Fay likes that there's no added sugar aside from honey in the mix. She's a big fan of the flax and sunflower seeds, too. The bananas and peanut butter tend to make the bars soft and moist, so you might want to wrap them in parchment or waxed paper to make them easier to grab and go.

5. No-Bake Energy Balls

Christina Skywatcher uses a cookie scoop to streamline production. If you make a big batch you can store a week's worth in the fridge and freeze the rest for the following week. So smart.

6. Clean Breakfast Cookies

If you're looking to cut out preservatives and additives, then these are for you. Packed full of oats and flax seeds, they're sweetened with honey and enriched with almond butter.

7. Emmi's Banana Wraps

Didn't get around to making breakfast cookies/bars or muffins? No worries. Keep the fixings for these super-quick wraps on hand so you can pull them together on the fly. You can change them up by using whole wheat tortillas, alternative nut butters, and the fruit of your choice.
