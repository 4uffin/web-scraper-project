Move over, game day dips and back-to-school casseroles. This autumn, I'll be focusing on desserts. Apple, pumpkin, pecan, cranberry, cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar. These fall flavors are made to be baked up in some delicious treat. But sometimes whipping up a whole pecan pie or an apple coffee cake is a bit too time-consuming. So, what do I do when I’m craving something sweet but don’t want to spend hours in the kitchen? Pick up a cake mix.
Cake mixes are great because you can make the cake as semi-homemade as you’d like. Throw in some fruit, chocolate chips, or sprinkles for a little DIY touch. Homemade frosting on a cake mix cupcake gives you the best of both worlds. Cake mixes are accessible, less expensive than buying the ingredients individually, can be baked quickly, and, most importantly, are so darn delicious.
So when Dolly Parton launched her own line of baking mixes, Baking with Dolly, in collaboration with Duncan Hines, I knew it would be something special. I already love using cake mixes as a quick way to get dessert on the table. Add the convenience of a box of cake mix with some southern-inspired flavors from Dolly Parton herself? Now that’s a recipe for a delicious dessert.
Dolly and Duncan’s latest release is a classic that pairs well with so many other fall flavors. I cannot wait to try. And, frankly, if it comes from Dolly, I just know I’m going to love it.
Duncan Hines and Dolly Parton Release New Caramel Sheet Cake Mix
Allrecipes / Duncan Hines
Duncan Hines and Dolly Parton’s newest mix is the Caramel Sheet Cake. According to the Baking with Dolly website, the mix makes a "moist caramel cake bursting with buttery sweetness and topped with a delightful caramel sauce glaze." The cake itself can be topped with the caramel sauce directly, or you can make a poke cake, fill the holes with the caramel sauce, and then lather the whole thing in a delicious caramel frosting.
This Caramel Sheet Cake is just the latest addition to the Dolly Parton and Duncan Hines portfolio. The "9-5" singer has two brownie mixes, three cookie mixes, four frostings, and six other cake mixes, including Coconut, Banana, and Strawberry.
The collection also includes breakfast treats, from a pancake mix to different muffin mixes to biscuit mixes and more. As of now, this cake mix is only being sold at Walmart, both online and in stores. It’s priced at just under $4, though prices may vary regionally.

One reviewer on Dolly's website said the new caramel flavor is "absolutely delicious" and that they "definitely recommend it."
If we can’t convince Dolly to visit all of our kitchens and whip up a delicious dessert, this Duncan Hines cake mix is the next best thing. Pick it up for your next special gathering, or any old day you’re craving something sweet.
