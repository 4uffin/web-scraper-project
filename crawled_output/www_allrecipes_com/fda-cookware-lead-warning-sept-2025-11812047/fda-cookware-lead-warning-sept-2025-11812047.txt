The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning for certain imported cookware that may leach a "significant amount" of lead into your food. The FDA tested cookware made from aluminum, brass, and aluminum alloys known as Hindalium/Hindolium or Indalium/Indolium and found that the following items are not safe to use, as they can impart lead into your food and make it unsafe to consume.
How To Identify The Unsafe Cookware
As of Sept. 12, 2025, the FDA is advising customers to stop using the following cookware products:
Kadai/Karahi Tiger White with the label "Pure Alluminium Utensils Tm Tiger White Rtm No: 2608606 An Iso 9001:2015 Certified Co. Saraswati Strips Pvt. Ltd. India" sold at Mannan Supermarket in Jamaica, New York Silver Horse with the label "7 6554273084 5 Aluminium Mathar Kadai 26" sold at Patel Brothers in Schaumburg, IllinoisSilver Horse with the label "7 6554272863 7 Aluminium Milk Pan 4" sold at Patel Brothers in Schaumburg, IllinoisJK Vallabhdas with the label "Aluminium Kadai India Bazaar #3 2000000772" sold at Indiaco in Hoffman Estates, Illinois
You can find product photos on the FDA’s site to help identify the cookware.
The FDA is working to alert distributors of the problem with the cookware. At this time, the FDA couldn’t contact the distributor for the Kadai/Karahi Tiger White coowkare to issue a recall, which may mean the product is still available on shelves.
Additionally, as the FDA is notifying the distributors, the cookware may still be available for purchase. If you are looking for new cookware, be sure to check that the cookware isn’t on this list of products that can leach lead into your food.
What To Do if You Have Cookware That May Leach Lead
If you have any of the cookware that the FDA has deemed unsafe, you should stop using it immediately. Throw away any cookware that may contaminate your food with lead—do not repurpose or donate the unsafe cookware.
Because there are no safe levels of lead consumption, the FDA is concerned about any exposure to lead in your food. Consuming lead is toxic to everybody, regardless of age or health status. However, children, people of childbearing age, and those who are breastfeeding are at a higher risk of adverse effects.
When exposed to high levels, symptoms of lead poisoning can include fatigue, headache, stomach pain, vomiting, and neurologic changes. If you have any concerns about lead exposure or poisoning, you should contact your healthcare provider.
