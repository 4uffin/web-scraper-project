Chewy Brown Butter Banana Bread Cookies

These chewy brown butter banana cookies have a flavor reminiscent of banana bread. The cookies will soften as they sit at room temp‚Äîso, to help them maintain their chewy texture, keep the extras stored in an airtight container in the fridge.

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 30 servings
1 cup unsalted butter
1 cup chopped walnuts
1 3/4 cups roughly chopped bananas, divided
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
1/4 cup white sugar
1 large egg yolk
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon cornstarch
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
Directions
Melt butter in a light-colored saucepan over medium-low heat. Add in chopped walnuts and 1 cup bananas. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until bananas disintegrate, and little browned bits of butter begin to form and stick to the bottom of the pan, 15 to 20 minutes. Pour mixture into a large bowl and allow to cool for 15 minutes.
Stir cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg into butter mixture. Stir in brown sugar and white sugar until thoroughly combined. Mix in egg yolk and vanilla. Add in flour, remaining 3/4 cup sliced bananas, cornstarch, and baking soda and stir until incorporated. Cover dough and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.
Scoop out 1 1/2 tablespoon-sized balls of dough; space balls about 1 1/2-inches apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake cookies in the preheated oven until edges are browned, 12 to 17 minutes (try not to under bake, or the cookies will be too soft). Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

OK with tweaks
Might try again
Sept 4, 2025I failed to follow the sequence of combining ingredients because I was baking for pleasure. Still, my cookies turned out beautifully. I added chocolate chips. Next time, I'll pay attention to the details.ü©∑ the cookie priestü•Ç.
