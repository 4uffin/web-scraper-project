Great flavors

Easy to follow
A keeper!
I used two 10oz fillets. I didn't have any sweet chili sauce so I substituted Sambal Oelek with a little sugar. In addition I reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon but will reduce to 1/2 teaspoon in the future for the salad. I used 2 avocados, added 1/3 red onion, peeled the cucumbers, and some corn. The meal was light and flavorful.

I think the recipe was really great, but I only broiled for five minutes and I did not add the extra sauce. But the taste is great avocado cucumber salad was delicious. I’ll do this again.

This is a great recipe. It's easy to follow and comes together quickly. The flavors are well balanced, with a nice subtle mix of sweet and heat. The salad is a nice fresh addition. We'll definitely be making this again! The only note I have is that it says 4 servings, but I think it should be 2-3.
