The season to enjoy pumpkin-flavored coffee is in full swing; however, brands are already announcing winter lineups—and I couldn’t be more thrilled. While I enjoy an autumnal spiced coffee creamer every now and then, what I really look forward to as the weather gets chillier is all the winter-inspired flavors to add to my daily cold brew.
One brand that can do no wrong in my eyes is International Delight. It seems to produce the perfect flavors to enjoy year-round, including seasonal options many of us stock up on. And with the holiday season in the near future, the brand has announced the return of a fan-favorite flavor in a brand-new type of creamer.
International Delight Introduces New Frosted Sugar Cookie Cold Foam Creamer
Allrecipes / International Delight
International Delight has added a new Frosted Sugar Cookie Cold Foam Creamer to its holiday lineup. The seasonal flavor was a fan favorite when previously offered as a creamer, and now it’s back and available as a cold foam topper.
When food fan @markie_devo posted about the new product on Instagram, the comments were flooded with people more than ready to enjoy the cold foam creamer with their holiday coffees.
"I already stockpile the creamer, so I have it all year," said one person. "Now, with this, I’m going to need a mini fridge just for creamers and cold foams."
"What a time to be alive," another fan said.
One shopper is even looking forward to using the new cold foam to make a holiday-inspired dirty soda. "Perfect for Dr Pepper," they wrote.

In addition to the new cold foam flavor, International Delight is bringing back another beloved seasonal flavor: Peppermint Mocha. The returning cold foam creamer features a rich, mint-chocolate taste that you’ll want to sip every morning this holiday season.
Shoppers have already spotted the new cold foam at Meijer and the can has popped up online at Target. Whether you’re eager for the return of winter vibes or just want to try out a new cold foam product, you can’t go wrong with these iconic holiday flavors.
