New England Clam Chowder
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
"Have made this over and over and it is delicious! I use the clam juice from the clams and extra in in lieu of water. I always add more clams and have even included some shrimp at the end. My guests always rave about it. Very easy to make as well." —HardySake5573

Boston Baked Beans
DOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS
"This reminded me of my mom's baked beans. DELICIOUS! It was my first attempt at making baked beans from scratch, but certainly not the last! I used Canadian maple syrup instead of molasses, and onion powder instead of onion (I ran out of real onion). I also saved a couple slices of bacon, fried it until crisp, and crumbled it for garnish - very yummy." —Ruth

A friend had been suggesting allrecipes.com for years for receipes in general and I took a chance on the oysters this year...WOW! We are blown away! This is now "THE RECIPE" we will use...the search is over." —Rhonda

Baked Lobster Tails
ALLRECIPES / DIANA CHISTRUGA
"This was a quick but delicious way to prepare lobster tails. I used Tony Chachere's seasoning and lemon pepper instead of lemon juice. What I loved about the recipe was that the butter collected in the pan, became just short of being browned, and was an excellent "sauce" for dipping." —Ava J

Lobster Rolls
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
"I used lemon instead of lime juice, like a traditional New England Lobster Roll. This recipe really let the flavor of the lobster shine through. Also, buttered the buns and grilled them on the stovetop till golden brown. Even though we had a couple left over after New Year's Eve, they were not soggy the next day." —Kar

Boston Creme Pie
Meredith Food Studios
"Most amazing Boston Cream pie I've [made]. My aunt and my mom both said it reminded them of when they were children and their mother used to work at the university bakery. They said that she use to bring it home ever once and a while as a treat for them. Thank you for the recipe." —Randy

Anadama Bread
TTV78
"This is great with a soup or stew (we had boiled cabbage with potatoes and sausage) - a perfect combo! It's also nice & quick, as homemade bread goes. We really enjoy it hot from the oven, but I seriously doubt we'll have any left over to try it toasted... We'll be making this often in our house." —Lia Provost
