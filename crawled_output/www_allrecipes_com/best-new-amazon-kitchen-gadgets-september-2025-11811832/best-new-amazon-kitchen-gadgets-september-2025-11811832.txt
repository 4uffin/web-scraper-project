Clever kitchen gadgets don’t have to cost an arm and a leg. In fact, many of Amazon’s newly released kitchen tools are incredibly affordable. While browsing the New Releases page, I found 11 kitchen organizers, food containers, baking tools, and handy utensils that cost $10 or less.
Best Amazon Kitchen Gadgets $10 and Under
SmartTrends Reusable Grocery Bags, 4-Pack, $9 with coupon and Prime (was $16)
Spring Chef XL Stainless Steel Pastry Cutter Tool, $7

SmartTrends Reusable Grocery Bags, 4-Pack
Amazon
$16

If you do big Costco runs and grocery hauls, reusable bags are incredibly useful. These bags from SmartTrends have reinforced handles, water-resistant fabric, and see-through siding for easy identification, and they hold up to 50 pounds each. The set includes four grocery bags that cost $2.25 apiece.
Spring Chef XL Stainless Steel Pastry Cutter Tool
Amazon
$7 at Amazon
We’re only a few days away from fall, and I’m excited for all the pumpkin spice- and apple cider-flavored baked goods in my future. This stainless steel pastry tool has multiple uses. It can crush nuts, mash potatoes, blend butter into flour, or cut pastry dough. The soft non-slip handle is easy on your hands for marathon baking sessions.
Dehov Butter Dish with Cover And Knife
Amazon
$10
$7 at Amazon
Frustrated with spreading rock hard butter on your toast? Keep butter soft and spreadable with this new butter keeper. The simple dish has a sleek and classic design that you can keep out on your kitchen counter. It even comes with a silver butter knife.
Liemand Grid Wire Baking Rack, Set of 2
Amazon
$10
$7 at Amazon
Wire baking racks allow batches of cookies and buttery baked goods to cool quickly while keeping your countertop clean. Measuring 10 x 15 inches, this 2-pack is both dishwasher- and oven-safe for your convenience.
Bovvsky 12-Piece Easy Tab Opener and Drink Protector Set
Amazon
$10 at Amazon
Many people struggle opening soda cans. Whether you’ve got chronic carpal tunnel (like me), osteoporosis (like my mom), long nails, or mobility issues, these clever gadgets make it so much easier. Slip the colorful tab over the metal clip for extra leverage. You can even rotate the tab to cover the can’s mouth to prevent dust from getting into your drink. The set comes with 12 tabs in a suite of colors.
Hotor Insulated Lunch Bag
Amazon
$20
$8 at Amazon
An insulted lunch bag will keep your hot foods hot or your cool foods cool until it’s time to eat. This new bag comes with eight layers of insulated protection, a leakproof interior lining, and several pockets to store things in. Normally $20, it’s just $8 for a limited time.
Ukeetap Extra Large Expandable Silverware Organizer
Amazon
$20
$10 at Amazon
Nobody likes a haphazard silverware drawer where you have to hunt down a fork. This half-off utensil organizer expands to fit the size of your kitchen drawer. It has nine compartments to store your daily cutlery and several other kitchen utensils as well.
YomiFamily 10-Piece Halloween Cookie Cutter Set
Amazon
$8 at Amazon
Halloween is lurking around the corner, so grab your thematic cookie cutters now. This 10-piece stainless steel collection includes black cat, pumpkin, spiderweb, tombstone, bat, ghost, witch hat, skull, spider, and coffin shapes.
Liemand Reusable Stainless Steel Sauce Containers, Set of 6
Amazon
$10
$8 at Amazon
Tiny containers can really come in handy. Maybe you only need a bit of salad dressing, some honey for your tea, or a small handful of homemade granola to top your yogurt.  Check out this 6-pack of small stainless steel containers. They come with colorful silicone lids with easy-open tabs for around $1.30 apiece.
Enesnes Large Acrylic Straw Holder and Organizer
Amazon
$14
$9 at Amazon
Straws deserve their own organizer. Whether you have reusable metal straws, multiple Stanley tumblers, love festive paper straws for parties, or have a bunch of silly straws, this acrylic organizer will keep them tidy. It can sit on the counter or be mounted inside a cabinet door.
Pafcgi Electric Salt and Pepper Grinder Set
Amazon
$30
$10 at Amazon
Love fresh ground spices but hate the effort of grinding by hand? Try an electric salt and pepper set. This sleek set is triggered by gravity and uses USB-rechargeable batteries. There are six levels of coarseness, which you can adjust with a simple twist.
