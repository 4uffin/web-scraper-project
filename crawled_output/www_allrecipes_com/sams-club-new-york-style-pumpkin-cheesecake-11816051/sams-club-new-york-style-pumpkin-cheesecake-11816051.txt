The Sam's Club Dessert That Sells Out Every Year Is Finally Back
It gives The Cheesecake Factory a "run for its money."

It’s officially fall, which means it’s time for pumpkin-flavored everything. At Sam’s Club, that means the return of the Member's Mark New York Style Pumpkin Cheesecake. The fan-favorite goodie was spotted at certain Sam’s Club locations earlier this week—and it’s officially available nationwide.
Sam's Club Brings Back Pumpkin Cheesecake
This limited-time-only cheesecake is a New York-style cheesecake (characterized by its smooth, creamy texture and density) that’s made with real cream cheese and "swirled with pumpkin and fall spices." Naturally, it’s got a graham cracker crust, and it even comes topped with a whipped cream border.
One of the biggest pros of this dessert is that it’s ready to serve a crowd with no prep. The pumpkin cheesecake is sold frozen, so all you have to do is let it thaw in the refrigerator before serving. It comes pre-sliced into 14 individual servings, so it’s perfect for a dinner party or celebration.

Sam’s Club claims that the cheesecake will keep in your freezer for up to a year. If you’re already planning your Thanksgiving menu (or other holiday gatherings), that means you can grab one (or two!) of this member favorite now for less dessert-induced stress later. It does need a full 24 hours to thaw, but it’ll still be the easiest Thanksgiving prep you’ll do.
The cake costs $18.84, breaking down to $1.35 per serving, and it’s well worth the cost. After one commenter on Instagram asked other users to rate the dessert on a scale of one to 10, the user @samsclubmembers, a Sam’s Club fan account that shares new items and reviews, called it an 11—and said that the dessert "tends to sell quickly." Another Instagrammer said, "These are really good! If you know what The Cheesecake Factory is, it gives it a run for its money!"
