Ground beef is such a versatile ingredient—and most of us always have a pound of it stashed in the freezer. But, the only thing we love more than finding new, tasty ways to use ground beef, is finding new ways to make an entire meal in just one pot. These recipes all create flavorful dishes in one skillet or pot, making them a breeze to cook and clean up.

One-Pot Ground Beef Stroganoff
Leslie
"This was a big hit! The only things I did differently were I cooked the beef in sautéed onion then added mushrooms. I also added an extra half cup of milk (because that’s what I had left and didn’t want to waste it). Oh, and I added pepper. It fed 4 of us, including two teenage boys and there were no left overs! Simple and tasty, my kind of meal!" —DfromATX

Ground Beef and Cabbage
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
"This is pretty darn good... And easy. It reminds me of cabbage rolls. Sometimes I replace the Italian seasoning with an envelope of onion soup mix. I normally serve it with fresh baked bread and a green salad. My family lives this and let's face it -- it's a lot less work than cabbage rolls." —Monica

Easy Skillet Spaghetti
"This does take an hour to cook, but you have only one pan to clean, it just couldn’t be simpler to make, and all ingredients are ones that I always have on hand. Nothing fancy here, but this is a solid weeknight meal that really does taste good. Simply served with salad and some garlic bread which I made from a ciabatta roll." —lutzflcat
