Cheesy Hamburger Rice Casserole
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
"Very tasty. I needed something quick and easy and this fit the bill," says reviewer jeannie p. "It was good and provided a little bit of leftovers for the next day, too. I followed the recipe, and then [threw] in some onion that I needed to use up. This definitely is on my go-to list."

Viral TikTok Chicken Cobbler
Allrecipes/Ramona Cruz-Peters
"Ever since I made this the first time, a few years ago, I crave it!" says reviewer JollyChai3806. "The recipe has been around for years. I prefer it made with Bisquick (or another baking mix). The oldest version I have found was made with pancake mix. I live alone but, I make the full recipe and eat the leftovers until it's all gone."

Best Home-Style Beef Stroganoff

"Tender strips of sirloin in a savory sauce served over buttery egg noodles—this beef stroganoff is comfort food at its best, plus it's easy on the wallet!" says Senior Producer Nicole McLaughlin. "It's simple enough for a weeknight family meal, but elegant enough for company. Serve with a salad and crusty bread."
