Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 4 servings
2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
1 1/2 pounds baby Yukon gold potatoes
2 large leeks
1/4 cup olive oil
2 lemons (1 zested, 2 juiced)
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Directions
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Slice baby potatoes in half. If they are a bit large, cut into quarters. Slice white and light green parts of leeks into 1/2-inch thick rounds and rinse thoroughly. Pat chicken thighs dry.
Pour 2 tablespoons olive oil onto a large sheet pan and place in the oven to preheat for 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully remove the pan from the oven and add baby potatoes, cut side down.
Bake potatoes in the preheated oven to start cooking while you prepare the chicken, about 15 minutes
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine remaining olive oil, zest of 1 lemon, juice of 2 lemons, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper. Place chicken thighs and leeks in marinade and toss to coat; marinate for 10 to 15 minutes while potatoes cook.
Remove sheet pan from oven, toss potatoes on the pan and move them to the sides to create room for the chicken thighs.
Using tongs, place chicken thighs, skin side up, on the sheet pan. Arrange leeks around the pan and pour remaining marinade in the bowl all over potatoes and leeks.
Roast until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, 35 to 40 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted near the center should reach 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Cook’s Note
Potatoes should be in about 2 inch chunks. You can use large potatoes and cut them to size. No need to peel yukon gold potatoes. You can also use red potatoes, fingerling, or purple potatoes. If using russet potatoes, it would be best to peel them.
