Key Takeaways
Jollibee is introducing two new limited-time menu items.The launch is part of a collaboration with global music group KATSEYE.Both offerings feature Jollibee’s signature crispy, juicy Chickenjoy base with a bold new twist.
If you consider yourself a true fast food connoisseur, you’ve probably noticed the rankings shifting—especially in the fried chicken category. Some longtime favorites are slipping, while newer names are taking the spotlight.
Right now, it seems like no drive-thru is hotter than Jollibee. Born in the Philippines and now winning fans around the world, Jollibee has built its reputation on juicy, ultra-crispy fried chicken. In fact, in 2024 USA Today crowned it the "Best Fast Food Fried Chicken," beating out big names such as Chick-fil-A, Popeyes, and Bojangles.

Of course, Jollibee’s rise hasn’t been overnight. For nearly 50 years, it’s been building its reputation on Chickenjoy, the chain’s signature bone-in, fried chicken that’s equal parts crispy and flavorful. It’s only recently that the rest of the world has started to catch up.
And now, Jollibee is giving fans two brand-new reasons to stop by.
Jollibee Launches New Korean BBQ Chicken Items
This month, Jollibee is partnering with global music group KATSEYE to debut two limited-time fried chicken creations. The collab mixes bold Korean-inspired flavors with KATSEYE’s fun, expressive energy, making it as much of a cultural crossover as a menu update.
Jollibee
Both new dishes start with Jollibee’s signature Chickenjoy crunch, then get coated in a sticky-sweet soy glaze that features a kick of Korean chili:
KATSEYE Special Korean BBQ Chicken Sandwich: A hand-breaded chicken breast fillet glazed in sweet-and-savory Korean BBQ sauce, topped with cucumber, red onion, and cilantro on a brioche bun.
KATSEYE Special Korean BBQ Fried Chicken: Classic Chickenjoy fried chicken, hand-dipped in the same sticky, flavorful glaze.
The KATSEYE-inspired items will be available at all North American Jollibee locations starting Wednesday, Sept. 17, but only for a limited time.
So, if you’re serious about staying on top of the fried chicken game, make your way to Jollibee sooner rather than later. Try out the new Korean BBQ Chicken while it lasts, then stick around for the classic Chickenjoy—and maybe even a side of Jolly Spaghetti.
