It just isn't fall if you don't sip on at least one cup of hot apple cider. The warm beverage is more than delicious on its own, but using apple cider as an ingredient in baked goods, meaty main dishes, and even soups adds a spiced sweetness that you just can't find elsewhere. In other words, there's no reason you should only be drinking your apple cider, especially if you want to bask in one of fall's best flavors. Add a little mulling spice to your life and try one of these recipes made with apple cider.

Baked Apple Cider Donuts
View Recipe

Chef John
Not all donuts have to be fried to turn out delicious — these apple cider donuts, for example, come together right in the oven. The cooking process is much easier, and since you don't have to use a deep fryer or a ton of oil, there's hardly any cleanup involved.

Apple Cider Stew

Boston Joy
This autumnal twist on a comfort food favorite gets a nice bit of sweetness from apple cider and chopped Fuji apples. It tastes even better the next day, so make a large batch to dine on all week.

Glazed Apple Cider Cake

Molly
This Bundt cake tastes like a giant apple cider doughnut and may become your new favorite fall dessert. To add a bit more sweetness, sprinkle with powdered sugar just before serving.

Apple Cider Pancakes

Chef Mo
Adding apple cider and mulling spices is an easy way to transform plain old pancake mix. These apple cider pancakes have a pronounced flavor and lots of moisture, which makes for one special stack of flapjacks.

Apple Cider Sauce and Pork Loin Chops
View Recipe

Carol
"WOW...this recipe is fantastic!! My significant other loves pork and I'm always looking for different ways to prepare it so that it does not become dry," says community member CKCSMOM. "The pork loin chops were tender and juicy and the sauce and seasonings only enhanced the flavor. When I first found this recipe I was afraid that 25 minutes in a 375 degree oven would dry the pork loin chops out but the apple cider helps to keep them moist."

Spiked Caramel Apple Cider
View Recipe

Allrecipes Magazine
Caramel apple ice cream topping gets a grown-up twist when it's combined with apple cider, rum, and warming spices. This drink comes together in the slow cooker, making it perfect for a get-together on a chilly night.

Slow cooking pork shoulder in apple cider lends the meat a slightly sweet flavor and makes it so tender it falls apart on the plate. You can also make this recipe using thick pork chops for a delicious weeknight dinner.

Ashley's Apple Cider Doughnuts
View Recipe

House of Aqua
These flavorful cake doughnuts get so much moisture from apple cider that they're just as delicious and tender a few days later. For the best possible flavor, be sure to reduce the cider to ¼ cup and don't substitute in apple juice or cider concentrate.

Butternut Squash and Apple Cider Soup
View Recipe
Save
Diana Mc
Sweet butternut squash gets a touch of tartness when it's simmered with apple cider, while various vegetables provide thickness and complexity. If you don't have half-and-half on hand, you can use cream cheese instead.

Apple Cider Pulled Pork with Caramelized Onion and Apples
View Recipe
Save
Linda T
This pulled pork is a little sweet, a little tangy, and all-around hearty. The mixture of caramelized onions and apple slices gives the meat a fall twist that works with tailgate-friendly sliders but is also right at home on the dinner table.

Pumpkin Waffles with Apple Cider Syrup
View Recipe
Save
abbaplez
You don't have to pick between pumpkin and apple cider in order to celebrate fall's best flavors — try combining them for a double dose of autumnal goodness. The sweet pumpkin waffles get a nice bit of contrast when they're drizzled with tart apple cider syrup.

Like the perfect fresh apple, this homemade applesauce hits the perfect balance between sweet and tart. For a smoother, thinner consistency, give it a quick blitz in your blender.

Turkey is notorious for its dryness and somewhat bland flavor, but marinating it overnight in an apple cider brine solves both of those problems. The end result is so juicy and flavorful you just might never want to use another turkey brine again.

Apple Cider Floats
View Recipe
Save
SunnyByrd
We've got nothing against hot apple cider, but the seasonal drink is also pretty good cold, especially when it's paired with ice cream. Repurposing your apple cider into a float is a fun way to enjoy it, especially if you live somewhere that doesn't get very cold during fall.

Apple Cider Crisp
View Recipe
Save
Three beloved iterations of apple — apple crisp, apple cider, and caramel apples — unite in this simple dessert. You can use 1/2 of caramel sauce instead if you don't care much for the individually wrapped candies.

Apple Cider Beef Stew

Apples (and apple cider, at that) may not be the first thing you'd pair with cubed beef, but once you try this apple cider beef stew you'll understand why it works. The mellow sweetness gives the stew a welcome change, and the thick, juicy apple slices make this classic meal even heartier.

Apple cider and pork chops make a great team, and this simple recipe by Chef John is no exception. Be sure to give the cider enough time to reduce so the glaze will have the right texture.
