Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Bread
Allrecipes
Love chocolate? Give this one a try. Top tip: To keep the chips from sinking to the bottom, dust them with flour before mixing them into the dough. TheBritishBaker drizzled her loaves with white and orange icing to give her loaves colorful autumn flair.

Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread
My Hot Southern Mess
This top-rated pumpkin bread recipe has earned 7,900+ 5-star reviews. Yes, it's that good. You can bake it into a large loaf, mini loaves, or muffins just adjust the total baking time. It also freezes beautifully, if you want to make and freeze a few for quick snacks or give-aways later.

Orange Pumpkin Loaf
Cheryl C
An entire orange, peel and all, is pureed into this citrus-y pumpkin loaf. Erin says, "This is an extraordinary bread. The first time I made it I grated the outer orange peel and then put in the orange sections thinking if I used the whole orange it would be too bitter. The next time I followed the directions using the whole orange and the difference was remarkable. So follow the directions!"

The addition of coconut flakes gives this pumpkin bread a tropical twist and fluffy texture. If you want to keep things light, several reviewers had success substituting applesauce for half of the oil.
