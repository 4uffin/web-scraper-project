When it's time to tailgate, what could be better than perfectly portable, bite-sized football party snacks. I've gathered up some of our favorite tailgate appetizers and desserts that have been shrunk down to make it easier for grab-and-go grazing. These recipes are so good, it (almost) won't even matter what your team does on the field because you'll already feel like a winner. From savory apps, like sliders and meatballs, to sweet treats, like mini cheesecakes and brownie bites, these top-rated recipes are perfect for your next football party buffet. Scroll through to check out the mouthwatering options!

Mini Philly Cheesesteaks on a white plate.
Chef John
Everyone at your tailgate is sure to love Chef John's Mini Philly Cheesesteaks. They are made with skirt steak and peppers and topped with a provolone cheese sauce — and even though they're miniature, they don't skimp on the flavor. Reviewers recommend cooking the steak first and letting it cool before adding anything else. "Great food for football games," says home cook Amanda.

Mini Ham and Cheese Rolls

These mini ham and cheese sandwiches are perfected with a mustard, minced onion, butter, and poppyseed mixture drizzled on top. This recipe uses dinner rolls, but these sandwiches are great on any other bread — like potato rolls, Hawaiian rolls, and bakery buns. You can also switch up the deli meat for different options to please your fellow tailgaters.

Football Spread

Buckwheat Queen
Serve this five-ingredient chicken spread hot or cold on saltine crackers or toasted bread. The ingredients may seem like a strange combination, but reviewers say it's worth a try. If don't want to use canned chicken breast, you can use rotisserie chicken instead. "This unusual concoction is a hit while entertaining friends during games or even parties," says Allrecipes Allstar bd.weld.

Real Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds

Bite-sized fried cheese curds are the perfect party snack served with ranch dressing or marinara sauce. Reviewers recommend adding extra seasonings to the batter, like cayenne pepper, garlic powder, or paprika. And you don't have to be a Green Bay fan to enjoy these!

Tot Sliders

These tiny tot sliders are just as delicious as they are adorable. Skewer potato rounds and ground beef patties onto a toothpick with your favorite hamburger toppings. Pro tip: bring the toppings on the side and let everyone build their own burgers.

Grilled Bacon Jalapeno Wraps

These three-ingredient stuffed jalapeños are perfect for outdoor tailgate parties since they're made on the grill. The jalapeños are easy to prep ahead of time and frozen to grill later. "Great, easy, fun recipe for the grill and great for tailgating. I froze mine the night before and they go great with a few beers," says home cook kawelch.

Prepare this three-ingredient buffalo ranch chicken ahead of time in the slow cooker, then bring the whole pot and some Hawaiian buns to your tailgate. Reviewers like to serve these sliders with blue cheese and pickles and slaw.

Mini Vanilla Cupcakes
View Recipe

Sweeten up the snack table with these Mini Vanilla Cupcakes. These cupcakes are filled with vanilla, from the batter to the frosting. And Allrecipes Allstar Yoly says you must use pure vanilla extract, not imitation vanilla. You could go the extra yard and tint the frosting in team colors.

Chef Mo
There is no grill needed for these mini burger sliders, just five simple ingredients. "Excellent little burgers great taste and quick and easy to make with ingredients I usually have on hand. Husband loved them. Great for a football afternoon," says reviewer Brenda.

Cookin'Fotog
These jalapeño popper cups are the perfect appetizer for spicy-food fans at your next tailgate. With just six ingredients and 30 minutes, you'll have savory, spicy jalapeño tarts. If you don't want to use ready-made phyllo tarts, reviewers like to use Tostitos Scoops chips instead. "Great recipe. I took it to a Super Bowl party and everyone loved it. Much easier, faster, and so much less of a mess than making regular poppers," says home cook Elizabeth Wood.

These mini brownies look elegant and taste just as good thanks to the chocolate ganache and fresh raspberry topping. Or, to get in the football spirit, you can top your brownies with sprinkles that sport your favorite team's color.

Chef John
Chef John created this recipe with the tailgating buffet in mind, so it doesn't matter who wins the game, you'll win the best appetizer.

Mini Southwestern Corn Pup Muffins with Fiesta Dipping Sauce

Trusted Brands
These corn muffins are a simple way to make grab-and-go corndogs without the frying, and can be made ahead of time so no one has to man the grill all day. Serve alongside the recipe's dipping sauce, or with your favorite hot dog condiments. "This is absolutely very easy to make and my daughter loves it!!! This is also good for serving at a football party for all the older and bigger kids," says home cook Venus.

Playoff Meatballs

These homemade meatballs are slathered in barbeque sauce to add a special kick to your tailgate spread. "The unexpected star of our NFL Playoffs 'show.' I'm convinced a good barbeque sauce and some finely chopped green pepper had everything to do with that. Make life easier and bake them at 400 degrees about 12 minutes instead of frying them, then finish the recipe as directed," says reviewer naples34102.

Delicious cheesecake ready in 45 minutes? Sign us up! These mini cheesecakes only require six ingredients, and you can change up the filling flavors to please everyone at your tailgate. "Delicious! Topped some with blueberry filling, some with cherry pie filling, and some with melted semi-sweet chocolate that I swirled on top. I brought them to a Super Bowl party and they were well received. Per other reviews make sure cream cheese is room temp and when mixing be sure to add each ingredient one at a time whipping well in between," says Allrecipes Allstar Lindsay.
