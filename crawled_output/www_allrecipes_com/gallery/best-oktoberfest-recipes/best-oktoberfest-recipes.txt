In Germany, Oktoberfest kicks off on the second-to-last Saturday in September and ends on the first Sunday in October. It began as a multi-day celebration in the early 19th century when Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria married Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen. Today, Oktoberfest is one of the world's largest—and certainly most beer-soaked—festivals of food and drink. These top-rated recipes go great with German beer, of course, or a tasty Riesling any ol' time of year. But especially for Oktoberfest.

Beer Glazed Brats and Sauerkraut

"I came up with this recipe, because I was looking for a more intense beer flavor with a little bite, and this is it," says JTk364. "A very satisfying dish if you crave German flavor that's Americanized. We love this dish served on potato rolls with spicy hot German mustard, Swiss cheese, and ice-cold beer on the side."
