German Potato Dumplings (Kartoffelkloesse).
Credit: Chef John
German cooks know what to do with a potato. They turn them into warm salads, tender dumplings, savory pancakes, and more. But fun fact, Germans didn't always have a taste for the tuber. In the mid-1700s, Frederick the Great of Prussia, looking for cheap, nutritious food for his subjects, demanded that dubious peasants plant the lowly regarded kartoffel. They reluctantly obliged. Real fondness followed, of course, but gradually. And that's good news for us. Because today we can all enjoy some of the world's best potato recipes, mastered over the centuries in German kitchens. Here are some of our very favorite German-inspired potato recipes.

Hot German Potato Salad III.
This traditional German potato salad with bacon is mayo-free and served warm in a tangy vinegar dressing with a touch of sugar, which creates the classic sweet and sour flavor profile. "Great recipe!" raves MunichMrs. "Since moving to Munich from the States, I eat potato salad every time we go out trying to find my favorite recipe. I've tried a number of recipes for potato salad in the past few months; this takes the cake!"

These German potato dumplings are filled with a surprise in the center — fresh croutons. "Soft, comforting potato dumplings drizzled in browned butter and topped with, sorry, not bacon, but something even better!" says Chef John. "For best results, roast, don't boil, the potatoes so they're nice and dry. Yes, you can top these dumplings with bacon anyway, and/or sautéed onions and mushroom sauce. I served mine with sausage and red cabbage."

This recipe is extremely basic, just boiled potatoes topped with parsley. But you won't find a better partner for bratwurst with a little mustard on the side or schnitzel. For a special treat, serve them with Uli's Onion Bacon Sauce and Apple Red Cabbage.

Kartoffelsuppe nach Bayrischer Art (Bavarian Potato Soup)
View Recipe

Loaded with vegetables and sausages, this classic Bavarian-style potato soup is a complete meal. "In Germany the sausage of choice would be Regensburg sausage, a short and stubby parboiled pork sausage," says Marianne. "It can be substituted with other boiling sausages made of pork."

Badische Schupfnudeln (Potato Noodles)
View Recipe
Save
Schupfnudeln is a kind of spaeztle (homemade pasta) typical of Baden-Baden and the Baden-Wurttemberg in southwestern Germany. "It gets its name from the word Schupfen, meaning 'to shove, push, throw or chuck,'" explains Seb. "They are traditionally handmade by rolling out potato dough on a board and cutting the dough into noodles. Simple and easy to make, they are delicious and go well with almost anything: roast pork, racks of lamb, bits of bacon, sauerkraut, and any cabbage dishes."

Knoephla, Potatoes and Sauerkraut
View Recipe
Save
German dumplings (Knoephla) are quickly cooked in boiling salted water, fried to golden brown, and then combined with fried potatoes and sauerkraut. "Absolutely DEEElicious," raves DEED330. "Very German flavor. I decided not to drain the sauerkraut in order to maintain moisture. The family loved it! It was an easy clean up too. Goes good with Bierocks."

Let's finish up with something from the German dessert cart! "Sweet dark plums are wrapped in a potato dough, and boiled before rolling in sweetened toasted bread crumbs," says LINDA MCLEAN. "My Austrian grandmother made these delicious dessert dumplings for us every fall. These take some time to make, but to me, they're well worth the effort."
