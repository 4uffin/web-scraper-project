Butter Schnitzel | Photo by naples34102.
Traditional Wiener Schnitzel is pounded, breaded, and pan-fried veal cutlets. But if veal is the traditional cut of choice for schnitzel in the classic style of Vienna, the truth is you can "schnitzel" all types of cutlets of pork, chicken, and beef (typically cheaper cuts like round steak, chuck, or cube steaks). Around here, we take a pretty liberal interpretation of schnitzel. That way, we can expand our definition to include the Italian-inspired cotoletta alla Milanese, Japanese katsu and tonkatsu, and the Southern classic chicken-fried steak, a.k.a. country-fried steak. And enjoy them all! Here are some of our very favorite schnitzel recipes.

Best of Oktoberfest | Photo by islandartist.
Let's start with the original! This one calls for veal. "PERFECT German schnitzel," raves KMBEHREND. "It is just as good as any schnitzel I have had in Germany — if not better." RouxGirl recommends trying it with turkey breast! "Hubby and I went to Munich during Oktoberfest, and I ordered Wiener Schnitzel made with turkey. It was awesome. Just buy thinly sliced raw turkey breast meat and follow this recipe. Wonderful!"

These pounded pork cutlets are breaded, pan-fried, and served with a mushroom, butter, and wine sauce. "I loved this," says hillary. "It turned out great. I made extra sauce and put the pork over mashed potatoes."

Milanese is the Italian version of schnitzel. This recipe features chicken breasts and Italian-seasoned bread crumbs. "LOVED IT," raves Cynthia. "Plated it on a bed of mashed potatoes and topped it with a homemade artichoke sauce -- artichokes sauteed in olive oil, garlic, and butter."

Here is the veal version of Milanese, flavored with savory Romano cheese and topped with arugula, golden raisins, and a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. This recipe is baked instead of pan-fried. "Excellent, excellent flavor," says Buckwheat Queen. "Each ingredient just jumps up and down in every bite. The sweet raisins, tangy balsamic vinegar, and peppery arugula blend naturally with the savory breaded cutlet."

The Best Chicken Fried Steak
View Recipe

SunnyDaysNora
Legend has it that chicken-fried steak was the invention of German and Austrian immigrants, who were looking to recreate Wiener Schnitzel using ingredients available in the New World. And on the plains of Texas, that meant beef steak. Here's some Texas-style schnitzel, featuring beef cube steaks. Tabasco Sauce and garlic spice up the batter. "This is by far the best chicken fried steak I've ever had," says Norah. "I've made it numerous times for my Southern-raised better half. I get nothing but rave reviews."

Chicken Katsu
View Recipe

"This is my family recipe for Chicken Katsu," says sakuraiiko. This Japanese chicken dish starts with chicken breast meat, pounded thin, and then coated in flour, egg, and Panko, the Japanese bread crumbs with the tremendously flaky texture. You'll quickly pan fry the cutlets until golden brown and crispy. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.

A classic veal schnitzel, only this method brings traditional schnitzelling technology into the 21st century by pairing it with the air fryer. "Rich, tender, and juicy," says Soup Loving Nicole. "The veal is so tender you can cut it with a fork."

Here's a great baked schnitzel recipe featuring chicken breasts. "Growing up, chicken schnitzel was a classic," says Chef V. "I decided to make it oven-friendly using less oil, and an easier cleanup. This dish tastes great with potato salad, or mashed potatoes and a nice crisp salad."

The "hunter" version of pork schnitzel features sauteed mushrooms and gravy. "This is simple German home cooking," says Mama Bear. "The recipe is easy to play with (veal, pork, beef). We never make it the same way twice. Always comforting and delicious." To complete the meal, enjoy with spaetzle, potatoes, or noodles and braised red cabbage.

When a recipe is this delicious, we'll allow a little redundancy in the name. Anyway, the name simply means that you're getting chicken, not steak, fried in the style of chicken-fried steak cutlets. Saltine crackers and potato flakes take care of the light breading here.

Boneless pork chops are battered and breaded with light, airy Panko. "These breaded and fried pork cutlets make a traditional Japanese dish which is very simple and easy to make," says AMYSMEANS. "Serve with sticky rice and tonkatsu sauce and enjoy!"

"Not only is it delicious, it is also cooked in the air fryer, making it lower in calories, oil free, and grease free," says Yoly. "I find chicken thighs to be more flavorful than chicken breasts, and this schnitzel is a perfect example."
