Carnival and fair food busts all the boundaries—and the more outrageous the better—making it as much of an attraction as the rides and the games. I mean, you've stood in line both for deep-fried funnel cakes and the Ferris wheel, right? To bring that memorable fair food experience home, minus the lines, I've gathered a dozen iconic carnival treats you can make in your own kitchen. Scroll through and you'll find recipes for indulgent funnel cakes, deep-fried Oreos, crispy elephant ears, gooey caramel apples, and more. Go on and treat yourself! What happens at the fair stays at the fair. Unless you bring it home. Which we've done right here. You're welcome.

Deep-Fried Oreos
Allrecipes Magazine
If a food item can dipped in batter and deep-fried, you'll likely find it at the fair. Using pancake mix shortcuts the batter for this version, and if you want to make them a tad "healthier" (who are we trying to kid?) give this air-fryer option a try. Reviewers say you should eat them while they're still warm.

Monkey Tails
Alberta Rose
These easy-to-make chocolate-covered frozen bananas can be rolled in shredded coconut, chopped nuts, or candy sprinkles. "I cut the bananas in approximately 2" pieces and inserted popsicle sticks. This made them more manageable for small children." —Budds

Beignets
catherine.drew
Strolling down the midway, dipping into a bag of fresh, hot beignets. You know what I'm talking about. This top-rated recipe brings it all home for you. Need an air-fryer version? We can do that, too.

Fried Ice Cream
Rainbows-and-clouds
But, but, but...how do you fry ice cream??? Well, you scoop it into balls, freeze them, roll them in egg whites and crushed cornflakes, freeze them again, then deep-fry them very quickly. Serve them right away with a drizzle of chocolate syrup, because they won't stay frozen for long!

State Fair Crepes
lutzflcat
This French bistro staple has hit the state fair circuit, and we're not complaining. You can make the crepes themselves ahead of time, freeze them, and fill the thawed crepes when you're good and ready.

Churros
Laura Y
Think of these as long, slender Mexican-style deep-fried fritters coated with cinnamon sugar and eaten while they're still fresh and warm. Is there an air-fried version? Why yes, there is.

Funnel Cakes IV
LivelyCow1858
Reviewers give a solid 5-star rating to this homemade version of classic funnel cakes. Home cook April says to use a squeeze bottle to drizzle the batter into the oil to create a continuous ribbon of dough all intertwined and fried to golden brown perfection. Top with confectioners' sugar or go a little fancier with fruit, jam, whipped cream, chocolate...you get the picture.

"Great recipe, added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp apple pie spice to the dough, cut the apples into tiny pieces. Glazed with 1 cup icing sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon. Delicious, everyone from the grandkids to the adults LOVED them, this is a keeper recipe." —C.Lynn

Gourmet Caramel Apples
Alberta Rose
They're apples so they're good for you, right? Sure. Let's stick with that story. These beauties are dipped in melted caramels, then dipped again in your choice of dark or white chocolate and embellished with crushed nuts, candy sprinkles, or whatever else you fancy.

Cream Puffs
Dwitya Rulhadi
You can fill these with pudding or pastry cream, ice cream—or stuffed with whipped cream, like at the Wisconsin State Fair.

Chocolate-Covered Caramel Corn
Christina
Popcorn usually falls into the savory snack column, but drizzle it with chocolate and caramel, and it transforms into a crunchable, munchable sweet n' salty treat. Microwave popcorn provides a convenient shortcut, or you can pop your own the old-fashioned way. You remember how to do that, don't you? Just be sure to remove all the unpopped kernels before proceeding with the recipe so no one bites down on an unwelcome surprise.
