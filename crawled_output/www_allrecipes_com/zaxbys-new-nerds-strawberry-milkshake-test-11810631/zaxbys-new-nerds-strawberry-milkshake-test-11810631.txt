Key Takeaways
Zaxbys is releasing a new milkshake made with a fan-favorite candy. The shake will be tested at 55 locations for a limited time.
If you’ve never been to Zaxbys, you’re missing out on a delicious fast food experience. The Southern-based chain has garnered quite a reputation, whether it's for the new late-night appetizer deal or zesty lemon-pepper wings.
Aside from tasty food, Zaxbys also has a slew of refreshing drinks and, earlier this summer, the chain celebrated its 70th birthday by adding milkshakes to its permanent menu.
Now, the fast food spot is upgrading its shakes with a limited-edition flavor inspired by a popular candy.
Zaxbys Is Testing New Nerds Strawberry Milkshake
Allrecipes / Zaxbys
Nerds Gummy Clusters, the chewy gummies speckled with Nerds candy pieces, have earned the unofficial title of "best candy, hands down" (at least, according to the Kelce brothers). Now the bite-sized treats are getting milkshake treatment, thanks to Zaxbys new Nerds Strawberry Milkshake.
The new drink has a base of Zaxbys’ decadent strawberry milkshake, blended with crunchy pieces of Nerds candy. The vibrant pink shake is topped with a swirl of whipped cream and Nerds Gummy Clusters. The finishing touch? Maraschino cherries and a generous sprinkle of even more Nerds candies.

The shake comes on the heels of similar drops from fast food spots earlier this year. In April, Burger King launched a frozen slushy featuring a blend of Strawberry Fanta soda and Nerds candy. And Sonic has had Nerds as a drink mix-in for years, including in a limited edition beverage collaboration with Paris Hilton last winter.
Nerds fans will be pleased to hear that the candy-inspired shake is officially available to order—but there’s a catch. The Nerds Strawberry Milkshake will only be available at 55 locations across Florida until Nov. 2, as part of a market test. If you’re based in the Sunshine State (or willing to travel), check out the full list of participating locations here. As for the rest of us, we'll just have to wait to see if the Floridians like Zaxbys new Nerds Strawberry Milkshake enough for it to come to menus nationwide.
