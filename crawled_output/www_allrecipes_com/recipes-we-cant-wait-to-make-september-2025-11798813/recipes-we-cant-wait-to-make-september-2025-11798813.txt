September brings with it a crispness in the air and new possibilities around every corner—plus, of course, all things pumpkin and apple. It's also the perfect time to dust off the stockpot. Labor Day has come and gone, which means we're more than ready to get stewing and baking. From hearty soups and delicious casseroles to autumn-spiced treats that warm you from the inside out, let's embrace all that September has to offer. Here are the recipes we can't wait to make this month.

of 18
Easy Plum Cake
We're still seeing plums at the market, so editor Courtney Kassel's grandpa's torte is on the menu in all its annual glory. This recipe is superb with the Italian plums she waits all year for, but works with whatever you can get your hands on. Our easy version is made with a buttery sponge cake topped with sliced plums, cinnamon, and sugar, then baked to perfection. Courtney adds, "It's a recipe that tastes like love."

Apple Rose Muffins
Photographer: Brie Goldman / Food Styling: Annie Probst / Prop Styling: Breanna Ghazali
These muffins are almost too charming to eat...Almost. But with applesauce and buttermilk in the batter, they're even tastier than they are pretty to look at. Senior Content Manager Frances Crouter is looking forward to testing out this new recipe that arrived just in time for fall baking.

Copycat Starbucks Bacon & Gruyere Egg Bites
Sara Haas
Whether you're new to meal prepping or an old pro, making quick breakfast bites ahead of time is a no-brainer—and the best way to get everyone excited to get out of bed on those brisk fall mornings. Follow the recipe as is, with eggs, Gruyère, and cottage cheese, or customize it to your liking.

Buffalo Chicken Dip
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Editor Bailey Fink is welcoming a new season with this all-time favorite. "Football is back, so of course, this dip MVP will be in rotation. I always get so many compliments when I make it, which is amusing since it's so stinkin' easy."
Senior Editor Corey Williams is on the opposing team. "On the same topic, this Rotel Dip With Sausage recipe screams 'football season' to me."

Fig and Arugula Salad
France C
Editor Annie Campbell can't wait to enjoy figs. And this simple salad with arugula, Parmesan, pine nuts, honey, and balsamic vinegar is top of mind. Reviewer Cindy says this recipe is "Absolutely delicious. I've made it several times because figs are in season. This is one of my favorite salads." Sherrie English agrees, saying it's "fantastic and pretty!"

Crispy Lemon Feta Potato Salad
Photographer: Jacob Fox / Food Styling: Sammy Mila / Prop Styling: Natalie Ghazali
A newcomer to the site this summer, this crispy lemon feta potato salad is "a hybrid between smashed potatoes and a vinegary warm potato salad—absolutely delicious," according to the recipe page. We say, it's the perfect in-between-seasons side to serve from Labor Day through October, and beyond.

Hatch Chile Salsa
Allrecipes Member
If you're a lucky shopper who is seeing Hatch chiles around, snag a bagful to upgrade anything from eggs (as writer Emily Lichty suggests) to stews to this salsa that goes hand in hand with football season. "I will definitely be making this again as it was so flavorful, and I just love Hatch peppers. This was a BIG hit with everyone!" exclaims reviewer Tom Grabowski.

Zucchini Boats
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Still finding zucchini at the back of the refrigerator? Use it in a different way with this fun presentation that takes the summer veg and stuffs it with sausage, tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, and more, then tops it with cheese before baking it all together for an easy and fresh-tasting dinner.
If you want to double the squash fun, try this caramelized zucchini pasta recipe we're all making on repeat.

Taquito Casserole
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Writer Keaton Larson loves to bring fun twists on classic casseroles to football watch parties, and this one fits the bill. Packed with flavor from enchilada sauce, beans, rice, cheese, frozen taquitos, and zesty toppings, it will have everyone going back for seconds. Reviewers are calling this "easy" and "a keeper."

Scotch Bonnet Hot Sauce

If you're collecting hot peppers from your garden or the farmers' market, take a page from our editors' book and turn them into hot sauce you can use the rest of the year. (It also makes for great gifting!)

Asian Lettuce Wraps
Chef'd
Take a restaurant favorite and make it at home any night of the week for a fun meal the whole crew will devour. Allrecipes community member Sammy marked this a keeper and added, "This is easy to make. It is one of our go-to summer recipes. I’ve made it with ground beef but we prefer ground chicken...I usually double the sauce for leftovers with rice."

Air Fryer Honey Sriracha Salmon Bites
France Cevallos
According to recipe creator France Cevallos, "These air fryer honey Sriracha salmon bites are cubes of salmon, lightly seasoned with salt, pepper, olive oil, and a touch of Sriracha, then air fried to crispy perfection and drizzled with a bold, sticky honey-Sriracha sauce. These bites are perfect as an appetizer, rice bowl topping, or paired with a side of roasted vegetables."

Cowboy Butter Spaghetti
Allrecipes / Sonia Bozzo
LaDonna Langwell has us "turn humble buttered noodles into cowboy butter spaghetti" with this comforting yet zesty dish with spicy compound butter and cream that makes a delicious sauce. It's fabulous as is, but you can also add veggies or a protein to make it more hearty.

Creamy Pasta Bake with Cherry Tomatoes and Basil
AllRecipes / Diana Chistruga
We can't let September pass without packing in more tomatoes whenever and wherever we can. And who can resist a steaming scoop of gooey, cheesy pasta loaded with that bright, acidic tomato goodness? Reviewers suggest bulking this baked masterpiece up with chicken, ground meat, or spinach for a little something extra.

Corey Williams adds, "I will be making this ASAP."

Maple Leaf Cocktail
If the name alone doesn't convince you to cheers to fall with this cocktail, the ingredients will. Muddle together blueberries, maple syrup, and a squeeze of lime, shake it in a shaker with whiskey and ice, then share with your friends. We'll be doing the same.
