If leisurely scrolling through foodie TikToks is your favorite way to enjoy some downtime, then you may have come across the viral account that makes affordable meals with only Dollar Tree ingredients. Sure, Dollar Tree's latest price changes may not reflect its namesake anymore (and considering inflation, who can blame 'em?), but it remains a budget-friendly spot to stock up on many staple household goods—groceries among them.
From its sub-$3 candy and soda selections to its stock of fan-favorite frozen fries, Dollar Tree has become an inarguably good place to pick up groceries, especially when you need your wallet to stretch a little further. What's more, it has great deals on irresistible, one-of-a-kind snacks, and is a no-brainer one-stop shop when you need to restock the pantry or the freezer. While not all of the following items boast dollar prices, they're likely way cheaper at Dollar Tree than at another go-to grocer, such as Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. Here's what you won't catch us leaving the store without.
Groceries That Are Cheaper at Dollar Tree
Candy
Candy isn't only cheaper at Dollar Tree—it's a downright steal of a deal, especially if you're looking for some hot, best-sellers. Brain Freeze freeze-dried candy made headlines for having a stunningly inexpensive price tag at Dollar Tree. The candy sold for far more at other retailers..
Reddit users rave about Dollar Tree's candy for its price and unique selections. In fact, one user was stunned at another's candy haul, exclaiming, "Sour blue raspberry Mike and Ikes! How have I not heard of these?" in response. Another loyal customer in the thread reveals that Dollar Tree has better prices compared to other "Dollar"-moniker chains: "Dollar Tree is actually the GOAT for candies in general. You can get a pack of Trolli neon worms for $1.25 from the Tree versus $2.80+++ at Dollar General, etc."
Cookies
Whether you prefer fancy tinned cookies or rip-it-open snack pack cookies, your go-to fave sweet to munch on is likely a better price at Dollar Tree. Danish butter cookies have been spotted at Dollar Tree for less than half the price per ounce of every other major retailer we consulted. Need a dupe to satisfy your Thin Mints craving? Dollar Tree carries Fudge Mint Cookies at $1.25 for a 9-ounce box, which is over 75 percent cheaper than the ones you'd shell out cash for at the green-decked table stands.
Reddit reports finding stellar deals on lesser-known packaged cookies that still taste outrageously good. The Minees brand in particular, which reportedly sells at $1.25 for a 12-pack, is universally swooned over. One enthusiastic consumer mentions they "use[d] to get them quite often since they're incredibly cheap and delicious for how many packs of cookies you get." Dollar Tree's Lil' Dutch Maid creme-filled cookies see similar acclaim from beloved consumers on the platform. One user attests they're so good that they "try to forget they exist," and another agrees, gushing, "I freely admit they are delicious for being dollar store cookies. And a damn good deal when they have the big packs."
Spices
Need to restock your spice cabinet? Unsurprisingly, you'll find stellar deals at Dollar Tree. Although some other budget-friendly stores occasionally offer $1 spices, you can count on the pantry staple to always be an inviting price at Dollar Tree. Our comparison found that garlic powder, cayenne pepper, paprika, and chili powder are at least 10 cents per ounce cheaper than every other chain (though Aldi will occasionally come close).
Reddit endorses Dollar Tree's spices for when you're on a particularly tight budget or just starting to experiment with new, unique recipes. Sure, their quality isn't quite on par with higher-end brands like Simply Organic or McCormick, but they'll get the job done if you're after a quick hit of flavor. One user echoes this sentiment, noting of the store's spices, "For someone just getting into cooking and needing to put together a spice collection at a low cost, it's a great way to get started."

Frozen Meals
You can find both name-brand and off-brand frozen meals for particularly impressive prices at Dollar Tree. Marie Callender "duo" meals can be found for $5 at the chain, while the other grocers we looked at sell the same meals for 10 to 15 cents more per ounce.
Reddit users also report several lesser-known frozen meal brands being particularly good at Dollar Tree, including frozen pizzas, some pot pies, and chicken and dumplings. Now, we know that off-brand prices can't be fairly compared to name-brand, but there is one huge pro to shopping for frozen meals at Dollar Tree: Store managers suggest on Reddit that all frozen selections are $5 or less. To us, the assurance that everything is under a certain price point is worth trying a few new products.
Beans
Whether you're after canned beans or dry beans, you can likely find some pretty good deals at Dollar Tree. Goya canned beans sell for $1.25 at the store—that's 25 to 75 cents cheaper than other shops we checked. Now, if you're willing to go with store-brand alternatives, you might find the best prices at Aldi; nevertheless, for name-brand canned beans, Dollar Tree is a great choice.
Dry beans are an even better deal, with one Reddit user reporting sub-dollar prices on bags of beans, lentils, and chickpeas. Another user who inquired where to find rice, beans, and lentils for cheap saw many responders recommending Dollar Tree.
Bumble Bee Tuna Products
Constantly downing Bumble Bee tuna snacks? You should start buying them at Dollar Tree, stat. The savings are so stellar you'll probably find yourself buying them in bulk. The popular brand-name tuna snack pouches are a stunning $1.25 at the budget grocer (or 50 cents per ounce). Other retailers sell the tuna pouches for just under a dollar per ounce, making them half the price at Dollar Tree.
In a Reddit thread asking for celiac-safe Dollar Tree snacks, one user responded, "Dollar Tree foods that never got me sick: The Bumble Bee Tuna cans and packets." The packets also get a shoutout in another Reddit thread for being a yummy Dollar Tree find that's cheap to boot.
