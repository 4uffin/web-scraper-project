Dad's Creamy Cucumber Salad
07/28/2022
This is soooo good! My boss’s wife sent him to work with this cucumber salad for me to try since I love to cook. It’s amazing after it’s had time for the flavors to blend. This is not a recipe for impatient people! Let the cucumbers and onions sit for the stated time, then pour them in a colander to drain about 30 minutes(or longer). It’s perfect to use up the cucumbers in my garden!

Banana Banana Bread
07/28/2022
You really can’t go wrong with this banana bread! I’ve made it several times, and this last time added some flax seed meal. It’s wonderful sliced, toasted, and buttered with coffee.

Fluffy Chocolate Buttercream Frosting
03/17/2022
This is great, just be sure the butter is softened but still cool-not melted. I use vanilla bean paste instead of extract, but this makes a great frosting!
