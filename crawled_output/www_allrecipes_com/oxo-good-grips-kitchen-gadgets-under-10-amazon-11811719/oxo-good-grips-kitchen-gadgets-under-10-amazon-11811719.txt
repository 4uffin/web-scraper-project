Odds are, you have an OXO tool in your kitchen. The versatile brand has just about every gadget you can think of, including airtight containers, herb keepers, and can openers. I’ve got quite a few OXO tools myself. Honestly, I couldn’t imagine cooking without my OXO potato peeler, and neither could over 44,200 other shoppers on Amazon, who gave the tool a perfect rating.
While browsing through OXO’s most popular Good Grips kitchen gadgets, I noticed that many of them were quite affordable. Here are OXO’s bestselling kitchen tools, all for $10 or less.
Best OXO Good Grips Kitchen Tools for $10 or Less at Amazon
Soap Dispensing Palm Brush, $9
Y-Peeler, $10 (was $14)
Wooden Spoon, $10
Silicone Cookie Spatula, $10 (was $12)
7-Inch Mini Tongs, $9 (was $10)
3-in-1 Avocado Slicer, $10 (was $12)
Corn Prep Peeler, $10 (was $12)
Soap Dispensing Palm Brush
Amazon
$9 at Amazon
Let’s start with an editor-loved OXO tool that revolutionized our cleaning routines. This soap dispensing brush features soft nylon bristles that are gentle enough to clean nonstick cookware and cast iron pans. The palm-sized scrubber is easy to refill when the soap runs out, so you can focus on scrubbing. “After six months of heavy use, the bristles are still in good condition,” says Allrecipes senior editor Siobhan Wallace.
Y-Peeler
Amazon
$14
$10 at Amazon
Well over 30,000 shoppers gave this OXO Y-peeler five-star ratings. Many reviewers praised the comfortable silicone handle, with one customer adding that it gave them “great control” during longer prep sessions. “The blade is extremely sharp, making quick work of peeling fruits and vegetables without requiring much effort. It performs perfectly every time,” they continued.
Wooden Spoon
Amazon
$10 at Amazon
After writing several stories about the dangers of toxic black plastic cooking utensils, I made the switch to wooden tools. OXO’s classic wooden spoon is a worthy replacement. It’s made of solid beechwood, giving it a clean aesthetic and a sturdy build. Interested in more wooden utensils? OXO also has slotted spoons, salad servers, and spatula sets.
Silicone Cookie Spatula
Amazon
$12
$10 at Amazon
If wooden utensils aren’t your thing, try non-toxic silicone tools instead. This cookie spatula combines the convenience of silicone’s flexibility with the dependability of a stainless steel core. It can handle scorching heat, up to 600 degrees Fahrenheit. One eager reviewer said they use the spatula for frying eggs, flipping burgers, sautéing veggies, pancakes, cookies, and more. “It's so flexible [that] it maneuvers easily around the curves of the pans. It won't scar or scratch your cookware. Think it's the favorite utensil in my kitchen,” they added.
7-Inch Mini Tongs
Amazon
$10
$9 at Amazon
Not all kitchen tongs need to be massive. In fact, nearly 12,000 shoppers prefer this mini version. Reviewers mention using the 7-inch tongs in air fryers, on the grill, and for serving small appetizers at dinner parties. They won’t take up much space in your kitchen drawer, either.
3-in-1 Avocado Slicer
Amazon
$12
$10 at Amazon
Did you know that avocados send so many cooks to the ER each year that doctors named an injury (“avocado hand”) after the fruit? Fortunately, there are avocado slicer tools available to protect your hands. OXO’s 3-in-1 slicer is one of the most popular options at Amazon, with over 27,000 perfect ratings. Slice, pit, score, and scoop an avocado with this one clever tool.
Corn Prep Peeler
Amazon
$12
$10 at Amazon
You may be surprised at the number of kitchen tools dedicated to sweet corn. If you prefer eating your corn off the cob, check out OXO’s peeler. The sharp stainless steel blade swivels to stay flush against the cob, yielding full, juicy kernels for your corn salsa or creamed corn.
