When it comes to kitchenware, Dutch ovens, stand mixers, and air fryers get most of the praise. After all, they do the heavy lifting when it comes to preparation and baking. But sometimes it’s the small kitchen tools that can make all the difference. For example, a bread knife that easily slices through your favorite loaf of sourdough, or a vegetable peeler that’s not only effective but comfortable to hold. These small but impactful tools can improve your entire cooking experience.
Recently, we noticed that home cooks on social media were raving over a durable, budget-friendly Ikea find. And now, we’re convinced that we need one, too.
Ikea's Koncis Garlic Press
In case you didn’t know, there’s an entire r/BuyItForLife subreddit dedicated to long-lasting product recommendations. While the discussions cover just about anything you can imagine, we’re particularly drawn to those related to the kitchen. In a recent thread, someone asked for garlic press recommendations, and one caught our attention: the Ikea Koncis Garlic Press.
Allrecipes / IKEA
"Definitely recommend the Ikea Koncis Garlic Press, though it's not quite BIFL [buy it for life]. We broke one after about eight years or so of regular use [due to] metal fatigue. But I was quite happy to buy another," said one Redditor. A second Redditor agreed, writing, "I’ll back this up. Have had our Ikea garlic press for like 12-plus years. Use it weekly and it’s solid."
One more chimed in to share their own experience with the brand. "Had an Oxo Good Grips and was cooking at my friend's house, and used their Ikea one. It's 1,000 times better. Immediately went to Ikea on my way home to get my own," they wrote.
And you can't beat the price. The Ikea garlic press is $8, while an Oxo Good Grips Garlic Press is priced around $20.
Ikea’s Koncis Garlic Press is made with stainless steel and aluminum, so it’s no surprise it seems to last. In addition, its smart design solves one of the biggest problems garlic press users face: cleaning. Ikea’s version has a removable metal insert that makes cleanup a breeze. You can simply fill the insert with peeled or unpeeled cloves of garlic and squeeze to create a finely minced paste that can be used in sauce, stir fry, and garlic soup. When you're done, you can take the pieces apart and hand-wash them separately.
In a separate Reddit thread, fans praised Ikea’s press for its efficiency. One user even conducted a test with Oxo’s garlic press and Ikea's version to see which extracted more garlic—and Ikea’s was the clear winner. It yielded 75 percent of the garlic's weight, compared to Oxo's, which produced 42 percent.

"I have the Oxo garlic press, but I always find that it leaves more garlic behind than it yields," the reviewer wrote. "Then I saw in a Reddit comment thread a lot of people were vouching for the Ikea’s Koncis Garlic Press, so I gave it a try. It leaves so much less garlic behind!"
And the positive reviews didn’t stop there. "The Ikea press is also a lot easier to clean. If you don't need an ergonomic handle the Ikea press is superior," said one Redditor. "This Ikea garlic press is hands down the best utensil in my kitchen," added another.
You can find the Ikea Koncis Garlic Press in stores or reserve yours online for pickup. Don’t live near an Ikea? You can also order this highly recommended kitchen find online for delivery. If you need us, we’ll be on our way to Ikea to buy one for everyone we know.
