Her work has appeared in Cooking Light, MyRecipes, Southern Living, Real Simple, Fine Cooking, and other publications and websites.Julia is a recipe tester and developer who has been working in the People Inc. Food Studios since 2015. She received her associate degree in culinary arts from the Culinary Institute of America in 2011 and her bachelor's in nutrition from Johnson & Wales University in 2013. From there, Julia worked in several clean-eating kitchens, including Food Matters NYC and Hilton Head Health.After deciding that test kitchens were where her heart belonged, Julia worked as a test kitchen assistant for Fine Cooking magazine in Connecticut before moving to Alabama.
