I've made my fair share of dips and spreads for parties and get-togethers, but many (if not all) of them require multiple ingredients and plenty of prep work. I must confess: Sometimes I don't want to put that much effort into it, especially if I'm feeding a crew of hungry football enthusiasts who appreciate a more one-handed approach when it comes to eating. So when I saw Jennifer Aniston's Enchilada Bites, I knew I'd found the best lazy football recipe to serve up on game day this season. They're easy to make, don't require a bunch of ingredients, and can be eaten with one hand—plate or napkin optional.
What Are Jennifer Aniston's Enchilada Bites?
Sara Haas
Jennifer Aniston's Enchilada Bites recipe can be found in her new children's cookbook, "Cook with Clydeo." It calls for cutting large flour tortillas into 3-inch rounds. To do this, I used my 3.25-inch round cutter, but a large jar or lid can also get the job done. From there, the rounds get brushed with oil, then are stuffed inside the cups of a 12-cup muffin tin. Each cup should be filled with a bit of enchilada sauce, followed by diced onion, and finally shredded cheese. Then, it's off to a 350-degree Fahrenheit oven to bake until the cheese is melted and the tortillas look nice and crispy. This took about 25 minutes in my oven. After popping them out of the tray, I did as instructed and topped each enchilada bite with crumbled Cotija cheese and guacamole.
Here's Why I Like Jennifer Aniston's Enchiliada Bites
As I mentioned above, these bites are easy to make. I love that I don't have to do much prep aside from cutting tortillas into rounds and chopping a bit of onion—the rest of the work is simply a matter of assembly. I also like that I can use store-bought enchilada sauce and even prepared guacamole if time is tight. I also appreciate how the recipe can be customized easily. In fact, I'd say this is where the recipe really shines. For example, you can add black beans or ground beef for extra protein, or toss in a few extra spices, like cumin or cayenne, for additional flavor. There are plenty of great vegetable additions as well, from chopped jalepeño to bell peppers.

Tips for Making Aniston's Enchilada Bites
Aniston's recipe is easy to follow, but here are a few things that are helpful to know before you get started:
Use room temperature tortillas: You'll want flexible tortillas for stuffing into the cups of your muffin pan, so make sure yours are room temperature. If you're starting with cold tortillas, I recommend you remove them from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before you're ready to prepare the recipe.
Oil both sides of the tortillas: The recipe says to coat only one side of the tortillas, but I think it's worth the tiny bit of effort and time to coat both sides. This extra step will help to prevent sticking. Not to mention, it will also create a satisfying golden-brown crust.
Make two batches: These are easy to eat and enjoy, so I strongly suggest making at least two batches to feed your hungry crew.
Have fun with the toppings: Since you have a pretty clean flavor slate, you can treat these little cups like tacos and add a variety of toppings. I served mine with sour cream, diced tomatoes, and fresh, chopped cilantro. But I also love the idea of topping them with pickled jalapeño or pickled onions and a bit of cabbage slaw.
