Bubble tea has solidified itself as a cultural staple, with over 6,600 shops in the U.S.—a number expected to double by 2028—and a global market valued at $2.75 billion. Americans witnessed the first wave of boba in the 1990s, when Taiwanese immigrants brought the sweet, chewy pearls to California. Since then, Asian chains like Gong Cha have expanded internationally to the United States. Meanwhile, American chain Kung Fu Tea was founded in New York City in 2010, and national fast food giants like Starbucks, Dunkin', and Sonic have also started to offer boba. Often paired with tea or slushy beverages, the chewy tapioca pearls are made from cassava, a root vegetable that can sometimes contain high levels of lead—and, unfortunately, Trader Joe’s Instant Boba Kits contain just that.
Trader Joe’s Instant Boba Kits Have Lead Levels 'Above a Level of Concern'
Lead can be found in a variety of ingredients in bubble tea, including the tea, sweeteners, and even the boba pearls themselves. Lead is a heavy metal that is naturally found in the Earth’s crust, and industrial pollution, combined with the use of leaded gasoline and lead-based pesticides, has contaminated the world’s soil in certain areas. Tapioca, which gives boba its chewy texture, is made from cassava root, which is especially susceptible to absorbing lead and other heavy metals from surrounding soil. And while some lead is removed during the washing, pulping, and production of tapioca, a significant amount of lead can still be present in the final product—and your boba.
In a recent study, Consumer Reports (CR) discovered that Trader Joe’s Instant Boba Kits—which contain pouches of brown-sugar flavored tapioca pearls—contain lead above "a level of concern," which is based on the California Proposition 65 maximum allowable dose level for lead and comes out to roughly 0.5 micrograms per day. In addition to Trader Joe’s boba, CR also tested WuFuYuan’s packaged tapioca pearls and both the boba and tea liquid from two chain stores: Gong Cha and Kung Fu Tea.
According to CR, trace amounts of lead were detected in every product tested, including Trader Joe’s. Three out of the four samples tested contained more than 50 percent of Consumer Reports’ "level of concern," while one pouch of Trader Joe’s Instant Boba Kit clocks in at 83 percent, or 0.415 micrograms—the highest lead content among the products tested.
Lead is a toxic heavy metal that can cause serious, permanent damage to nearly every organ in the body if overconsumed. Children are especially vulnerable to lead exposure because their bodies absorb more lead, and their nervous systems are highly susceptible to its damaging and potentially irreversible effects.  Adults are also at risk, with lead exposure potentially causing high blood pressure, kidney damage, and other health issues. Beyond immediate lead poisoning, the heavy metal can also be stored in bones and teeth for years, potentially posing a long-term threat if accumulated.
What To Do if You Have Contaminated Trader Joe's Instant Boba Kits
The product is still listed on the store’s website, but fans on Reddit reported that the Instant Boba Kit has been discontinued, which a representative for Trader Joe's confirmed to Consumer Reports. If you’re concerned about the product, though, Trader Joe’s has a generous return policy with no time limit on the return window. Even if that Instant Boba Kit has been in the back of your pantry since its genesis in 2022, you can still bring it to your local TJ’s and ask for a full refund.

Sorry, But Your Go-To Dark Chocolate Probably Contains Lead
Even if you have consumed boba from TJ’s recently, you don’t need to panic—one daily serving of tapioca pearls wouldn't exceed CR's lead level of concern. However, it’s important to note that lead can be in a variety of foods—such as dark chocolate, cinnamon, or even leaching from your cookware—and daily exposure can add up. While you can’t completely avoid lead, experts noted that the "level of concern" indicates that bubble tea should be a treat enjoyed in moderation, not a daily staple.
And if you (understandably) don’t want to quit boba cold turkey, eating a variety of healthy foods and specific nutrients (including calcium, iron, vitamin C, and zinc) can help minimize the absorption of heavy metals while offsetting some potential harm. So, if you’re heading to your local bubble tea café or cleaning out that last Trader Joe’s packet in your pantry, consider pairing your beverage with leafy greens or even a fortified breakfast cereal to maximize nutrients.
