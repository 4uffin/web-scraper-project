Krusteaz Just Launched a First-Of-Its-Kind Batter Fans Are Calling 'Genius'
This is a game-changer.

Krusteaz has a reputation for baking mixes we can always rely on, whether it’s a cozy fall loaf from the Pumpkin Spice Baking Mix or quick muffins from the chef-approved Sweet Corn Muffin Mix. Heck, the Buttermilk Pancake Mix has become such a staple in our pantries, we can stock up on the ten-pound bag at Costco with full confidence it’ll be used up in no time.
But Krusteaz also has a way of surprising us with some not-so-traditional creations, too, from Cinnamon Churro Waffles to, most recently, a Cheesecake Muffin Mix filled with a rich cream cheese center. Now it’s taking one of its most popular mixes and giving it a new spin that makes it easier than ever to love.
Krusteaz Launches New Honey Cornbread Batter
This fall, Krusteaz is taking its signature cornbread one step further with a complete, ready-to-bake batter.
The new batter builds on the success of its fan-favorite Honey Cornbread and Muffin Mix (which notably earned second place in our cornbread mix taste test). But unlike the boxed version—which calls for the addition of milk, vegetable oil, and an egg—this batter is fully prepped for you. All you have to do is open the bag, pour, and bake.
By the way, you won’t find it in the baking aisle—instead, it’ll be chilling in the refrigerated section.
We’re hoping the batter builds on everything we love about the original mix: the buttery-golden top, light and fluffy interior, slight grittiness, and the just-right balance of salty and sweet. Whether a pre-made batter can really rival a hand-mixed batch remains to be seen, but Krusteaz is calling this "a breakthrough baking innovation" that promises a "springy soft, completely irresistible batch every time." So, consider us intrigued.
This isn’t the brand’s first try at bagged batter, either. Krusteaz has already rolled out refrigerated Chocolate Brownie and Vanilla Cupcake batters, both of which proved successful enough to warrant a cozy, cornbread-inspired addition. Like the others, the new batter is free of artificial preservatives, customizable, and portioned for an 8x8 pan or eight muffins.

Shoppers already seem sold, calling the product "genius" and a "game-changer" on the Krusteaz Instagram account. "Yes, please! We'll be making this ASAP!" added another.
The new batter is now available in select Kroger and Walmart locations, can be found in the refrigerated dough section, and has a suggested retail price of $6.99.
We’ll always love a homemade cornbread, but when a brand promises scratch-made flavor without the extra mess, it’s hard not to be tempted. Could this new batter outperform the cornbread competition—and even outshine Krusteaz’s own mix? Looks like it might be time for another taste test.
