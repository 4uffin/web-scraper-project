The Allrecipes Allstars
By
Liza Schattenkerk
Liza Schattenkerk
Liza is the Director of Engagement and Audience Development for Allrecipes, the world's largest community-driven food site. A self-proclaimed food-and-word nerd, Liza joined Allrecipes in 2022 and oversees our Allrecipes Allstars (Brand Ambassadors), social media channels, and on-site programming and user experience. Liza has an extensive food and editorial background, including 10 years at Food.com, where she launched their social-first video strategy and helped drive exponential traffic growth. Growing up in her dad’s kitchen, Liza learned at a young age that food and cooking can and should be a celebratory act, even when it’s a simple meal on an otherwise mundane Tuesday night. Nothing gives her more joy than helping teach busy people how to get dinner on the table. Liza has both a BA in Speech Communications and a BA in French Studies from the University of San Diego.

Allstar Ramona Cruz-Peters
"I was a side hustle blogger and a home cook with dreams of something bigger. I'm now a full-time content creator, recipe developer, and two-time published cookbook author. I wouldn't be where I am today without the experience I have gained creating recipes for Allrecipes and being part of the Allstar program."
— Allstar Ramona Cruz-Peters
