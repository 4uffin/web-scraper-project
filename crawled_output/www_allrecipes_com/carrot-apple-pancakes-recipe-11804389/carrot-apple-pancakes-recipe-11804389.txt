These carrot apple pancakes, inspired by a carrot apple salad, are more like carrot cake meets apple fritter meets pancakes. If you'd like a perfect bite of a perfect pancake, here it is.

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 2 servings
1 cup grated carrot
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
1/8 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon grated ginger root
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon white sugar
1 large egg
1/2 lemon, juiced
1 apple, unpeeled
1/3 cup chopped walnuts (optional)
1/2 cup self-rising flour
Directions
Peel and grate enough carrot to fill a 1-cup measuring cup, unpacked. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add grated carrots and salt, and cook, stirring, until carrot begins to lose its raw character and softens only slightly, about 2 minutes.
Transfer carrots into a bowl, and add ginger, cinnamon, white sugar, egg, and lemon juice.  Stir well to combine. Grate apple into the bowl, and stir to combine.
Add self-rising flour, and stir until it disappears. Let batter rest about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the same skillet used for carrots over medium heat.
Once the butter melts, transfer in about 1/4 cup batter per pancake, and flatten slightly with the back of the spoon. Cook pancakes until browned and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.
Serve topped with an optional spoon of yogurt, maple syrup, and chopped walnuts if desired.
