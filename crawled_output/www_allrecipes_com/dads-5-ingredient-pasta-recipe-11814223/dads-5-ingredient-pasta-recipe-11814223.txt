When my Italian dad isn’t tending to his garden heirloom tomatoes or sipping his homemade wine on the patio as if he’s in Tuscany, you’ll find him in the kitchen. There, he whips up cherished family recipes, passed down through generations. Most are either scribbled on the worn, sauced-stained pages of his cookbook or recited by memory.
My dad has won over many taste buds time and time again with his tender holiday pork roast, fresh-from-the-garden eggplant Parmesan, perfectly moist-yet-crunchy Dutch oven rosemary olive oil bread, zesty Angeletti cookies, and vanilla yogurt pancakes.
But there’s one dish in particular that’s requested on repeat: Dad’s Spaghetti Aglio e Olio, a foolproof recipe he created.
What Makes Dad’s Spaghetti Aglio e Olio Special?
The creamy, light pasta dish requires just five ingredients—spaghetti, garlic, extra-virgin olive oil, parsley, and reserved pasta water—most of which you likely already have at home. Spaghetti aglio e olio, which translates to “garlic and oil” in Italian, is a classic dish with roots in Naples.
Growing up, my house was always the go-to spot for friends and family to gather for Sunday sauce or a classic three-course Italian meal. They’d leave with full, incredibly content bellies. I’m happy to say that tradition remains alive and well in my 30s.
Whether it’s a quick weeknight dinner or a weekend treat enjoyed on the quaint wrought-iron table in the vegetable garden, my loved ones can attest to the fact that Dad’s Spaghetti Aglio e Olio never disappoints.
One surprising ingredient Dad stresses is absolutely “essential”? Pasta water. It  adds to the creamy, crave-worthy texture. And a finishing touch of parsley snipped fresh from his garden to bring the dish full circle and add extra flair.
Another chef’s tip: For an extra kick, Dad suggests adding red pepper flakes, depending on your personal preference.

How to Make My Dad’s 5-Ingredient Spaghetti Aglio e Olio
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Ingredients
1 pound spaghetti2–3 large cloves fresh garlic, chopped1 ½ cups extra-virgin olive oil4 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped (2 for sauce; 2 for garnish)2–3 ladles reserved pasta water1 teaspoon hot pepper flakes (optional)
Instructions
Fill a pot large enough to cook a pound of spaghetti with water—my dad uses a 3-quart pan/pot. Add 1 tablespoon of salt. Bring to a boil, cooking the spaghetti according to the package instructions.
Heat the olive oil in a medium-sized pan over medium heat.
Add the chopped garlic, finely chopped parsley and sprig, and optional red pepper flakes. Allow the mixture to simmer. Keep a close eye on the ingredients, making sure they do not burn.
Stir in a ladle full of pasta water to the sauce pan, allowing it to cook down before adding another. Repeat this as desired until the sauce has a slightly creamy consistency and not watery.
Once the pasta is cooked, remove the parsley sprig from the sauce and add the spaghetti directly to the pan. Mix it thoroughly until pasta and sauce are completely combined (use a set of spaghetti tongs or similar for this process).
While stirring, let cook under low-to-medium heat for another 3 to 4 minutes, adding a little more pasta water, if necessary.
Transfer to a plate and garnish with the remaining chopped parsley. Top with high-quality Parmesan cheese.
