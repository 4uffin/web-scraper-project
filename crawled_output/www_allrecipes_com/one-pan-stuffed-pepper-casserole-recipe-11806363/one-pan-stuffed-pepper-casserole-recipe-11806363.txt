One-Pan Stuffed Pepper Casserole

Chef John's one-pan stuffed pepper casserole has all the same taste and texture of beef and rice stuffed bell peppers—maybe even more flavor—with no stuffing involved. With one stovetop-to-oven-to-table pan, there's almost no cleanup.

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.
This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note that not all recipes scale perfectly.
Original recipe (1X) yields 8 servings
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound ground beef
1 onion, diced
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 pinch cayenne
2 green bell peppers, seeded, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 red bell peppers, seeded, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 orange bell pepper, seeded, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 cup raw basmati or other long grain white rice
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
2 cups tomato sauce or tomato puree
1 1/2 cups beef broth
6 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded, divided
Directions
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Place an ovenproof pan over high heat, add olive oil, then the beef, and a big pinch of salt, and cook for about 1 minute, breaking the meat into smaller pieces. Add onions, and continue cooking, crumbling the meat, until it starts to brown and onions turn translucent. about 5 minutes. Brown the meat deeply for the best flavor.
Reduce heat to medium-high, or to medium if the pan seems very hot, and add butter and garlic. Cook, stirring, until butter melts, about 1 minute. Add black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne. Cook and stir for about 1 minute. Add bell peppers, and cook and stir until just heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
Add rice and stir until it is coated with the fats from the pan, about 1 minute. Add remaining salt, Worcestershire sauce, tomato sauce, and beef broth, and raise the heat to high. Stir together and wait for the mixture to simmer. Turn off heat, and sprinkle with some of the cheese, saving about 1/2 cup for the top. Use a spoon to poke and stir the cheese in evenly. Cover the pan tightly.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove from the oven, uncover, and check rice for tenderness in a few spots. If rice is not tender, cover and continue to bake. Once rice is tender, remove the casserole, uncover, sprinkle over the rest of the cheese, and turn on the oven’s broiler.
Broil casserole until cheese is melted, and starting to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Let rest at least 10 minutes before serving.
John Mitzewich
Chef's Note
The casserole can also be finished in a 450 degreed F ( 235 degrees C) oven until cheese is browned, about 10 minutes.

I made this recipe because I was craving my mom's stuffed peppers. This was a one pot, easier version that I could quickly make for a weeknight dinner. It turned out soooo food! Give it a try for sure.

This recipe is so delicious. I love stuffed peppers but the pepper itself is never cooked evenly. This recipe solves that problem. My family loved it. Even my picky 12 year old. Her friend had seconds.Literally the only thing I did differently was when it was time to put in the oven I transferred everything into a casserole dish and put that into the oven. Next time I’ll use 1.5 lbs of beef but this really was absolutely delicious.

Stuffed Peppers cook unevenly and just need to be cut apart later anyways. This is a better and easier recipe. Kid approved.
