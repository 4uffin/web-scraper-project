I won’t sit here and pretend that I only show up on game day for the snacks. Sure, growing up, I loved Sundays solely because it meant my mom would make her signature microwave nachos in between the 1 p.m. and 4:25 p.m. games, but I’ve evolved into a person whose Thursdays, Sundays, Mondays, and any other day the NFL deems football-worthy are consumed by touchdowns, sacks, and field goals.
But, let’s be honest, half the fun of game day is the food and beverage. So, before the game, at halftime, and during those commercial breaks, I’m looking for the best of the best tailgate food.
Typically, my game day plate looks like something Martin Short’s character Oliver Putnam from "Only Murders in the Building" would make: Dips, dips, and more dips. Buffalo chicken dip? Check. My mom’s pizza dip? Check. My aunt’s homemade sour cream and onion dip? Check. I even have a taco dip recipe from my high school teacher that I love to make.
However, along with all the dips, I have a few non-negotiable foods on football day—and one of those is a hot dog.
I’ve always said nothing beats a stadium dog. There’s just something about those roller hot dogs while you’re watching your favorite team that makes them taste better. However, Camilo Baquero, the executive chef at Delaware North Sportservice, who’s behind the creations at the New York Jets’ MetLife Stadium, has taken the stadium dog to the next level. At a recent game, Baquero introduced me to a hot dog that hails from his home country, Colombia.
Baquero put the Colombian Hot Dog on the menu at one of MetLife Stadium’s vendors, Garden State Rippers, and he said it surprises everyone. It certainly surprised me—one bite and I was hooked.
What Are Colombian Hot Dogs?
The hot dog is an American classic, and plenty of regions have their own way to serve it—from topping it with cream cheese to smothering it in chili. Colombia loads its hot dogs up a little differently.
The Colombian hot dog is a mix of sweet and savory flavors, plus it’s all about the texture. The hot dogs are topped with pineapple sauce, a mixture of ketchup, mayo, and sometimes lime juice (known as salsa rosada), cheese, and crushed potato chips. Some people may add additional ingredients, like hard-boiled eggs, tomatoes, onions, coleslaw, and avocado—but the sauce, cheese, and chips are the mainstays.
What Do Colombian Hot Dogs Taste Like?
Many people might not be used to adding sweet ingredients beyond sweet pickle relish or a creamy slaw to a hot dog. However, the Colombian hot dogs are unexpectedly delicious—and it’s all thanks to the balance of sweet, salty, tangy, and savory flavors.
The ketchup and mayo sauce is tangy, yet mild, while the hot dog itself adds a salty punch. What keeps you coming back for more and more bites, however, is the pineapple sauce. The sweet, caramelized flavors are almost indescribable—and paired with the gooey cheese, pink sauce, and crunchy, salty chips, it’s shockingly delicious.

How To Make Colombian Hot Dogs
Make a pineapple sauce. Now that the Colombian hot dog has had quite a few viral moments on TikTok, there isn’t just one recipe to follow—especially when it comes to the pineapple sauce. Chef Baquero opted for a charred pineapple salsa on the hot dog he served me, but a lot of TikTokers make the sauce with canned pineapple simmered with sugar and blended into a sauce. However, others simply use crushed pineapple straight from the can.
Prepare the 'pink' sauce. After you decide on your pineapple sauce route, you’ll want to make the ketchup-mayo mixture. The pink sauce is made with equal parts ketchup and mayo, with a splash of lime juice, if you wish.
Prepare hot dogs and buns. After you cook your hot dog to your liking and add it to your favorite bun, you’ll top the dog with cheese. Choose a meltable white cheese, like mozzarella, white Cheddar, or queso blanco. Some home cooks choose to melt the cheese onto the hot dogs, but that’s up to personal preference.
Assemble. Finish assembling your hot dog by adding the pineapple sauce, crushed potato chips, and salsa rosada.
One taste and you’ll never go back to ketchup and mustard-topped hot dogs again. But, be warned, these tasty Colombian hot dogs disappear quickly, so, you’d better have an extra batch of pineapple sauce ready—especially if I’m coming over to watch the game.
