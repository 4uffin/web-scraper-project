Pillsbury's baking mixes are so convenient and delicious. Whether you're making a box of brownies to enjoy with ice cream or Flaky Caramel Rolls to enjoy with a cup of coffee in the morning, you truly cannot go wrong with its variety of products—especially the Funfetti items.
The Funfetti spin on classic cake mix or cream cheese frosting adds a festive flair to any sweet treat, making it perfect for birthday celebrations or simply satisfying a craving. Now, the brand is adding a colorful twist to a popular bread mix...and we can't wait to make it ourselves.
Pillsbury Is Releasing a Limited-Edition Funfetti Sourdough Bread Mix
Pillsbury / Allrecipes
Pillsbury is launching a limited-edition sourdough bread mix with one exciting feature: sprinkles. It adds a perfect twist to the traditional loaf of bread many of us have been baking since the pandemic. The unexpected baking item boasts the artisan texture we all know and love when it comes to sourdough, and it's studded with bursts of Funfetti sprinkles.
The new Pillsbury Funfetti Sourdough Bread Mix offering comes with everything you need to make a delicious and colorful loaf of sourdough in the comfort of your own kitchen, including sourdough bread mix, a packet of sprinkles, and yeast—all for $9.99.
"Funfetti has always been about making celebrations more colorful," says Dan Anglemyer, Chief Operating Officer at Hometown Food Company, in a press release. "With this launch, we're giving fans a new way to bake joy into life's moments—whether it's a weekend bake, an album-listening party, or just an everyday moment made brighter with sprinkles."

Pillsbury Is Launching 3 New Doughs That Will Make Your Recipes Better
Ever since Taylor Swift shared that she's made Funfetti sourdough on the "New Heights" podcast, Funfetti has been teasing the launch of the new product. "Should we make Funfetti Sourdough?" The brand asked in an Instagram post.
Fans instantly responded that they should indeed make a Funfetti Sourdough. One wrote, "Of course!" Another commented, "Yes, please!"
In another Instagram post, Funfetti demonstrated how to make the sweet and tangy bread mix topped off with a little bit of frosting and additional sprinkles. "This is magic," a user commented.
Shortly after, Funfetti posted that Pillsbury Funfetti Sourdough was indeed coming. "It's been a long time coming...Can you guess what we're about to drop?" the caption read.
"So ready! Love this," one user wrote. Someone else replied, "I'm bread-y."
The best part? You don't even have to leave your house to taste the colorful bread for yourself. The mix will be available online only at Funfetti.com. But don't wait too long to order it. Pre-orders begin on Sept. 24 at 12:00 p.m. ET, and once they're sold out, they won't be coming back.
