If I’m in a hurry but need a quick meal, I’ll make a gooey grilled cheese sandwich. Unfortunately, hurrying means I don’t have the forethought to take butter out of the fridge and let it warm up. I’ve torn through countless pieces of bread with stubborn pats of cold butter. Nothing frustrates me quite like food waste (and having to wait longer for my grilled cheese).
I’d accepted the impossibility of spreading cold butter as just “one of those things” until I stumbled on an unexpected solution—a butter knife. Wait, hear me out, this isn’t your average butter knife. This cleverly designed tool is “a game changer” when it comes to spreading butter smoothly without tearing your bread, according to one five-star Amazon reviewer. Don’t just take it from them: This gadget also happens to be Amazon’s No. 1 bestselling butter knife.
Simple Spreading Stainless Steel Butter Spreader Knife
Amazon
$17
$10 at Amazon
At first glance, this stainless steel spreader resembles a regular butter knife you’d find in a flatware set, but look closer and you’ll see unique holes and serrations along the blade. These features make the rust-resistant spreader a 3-in-1 multifunctional tool.
Drag the slotted side along the surface of a hard stick of butter and the holes will create thin curls. These ribbons are much easier to spread than a solid chunk, and the strands melt much faster, too. Once you have enough butter curls, flip the knife around and spread it across bread or toast as normal to avoid ripping it. Want bigger butter ribbons? Use the larger slot at the tip of the knife. You can even use the top slot to cut strips of semi-hard cheese.
“I am generally patient with food preparation, but first thing in the morning I want my toast and tea quickly. And I want a ‘bit of butter' on my toast, my English muffin and even my hot cereal,” said one Amazon reviewer. “This sturdy butter knife gives me instant gratification without having to remember to take the butter out of the fridge in advance and without sloughing off too large a dab. Hope I never misplace this knife as it makes my breakfast easier.”
The clever spreader normally costs $17, but the current sale (plus an onsite coupon) means you can grab the tool for just $10. No more tearing through bread, no more nuking butter in the microwave only to accidentally melt it, and no more frustration.
“Gone are the days of struggling to spread cold, hard butter on my toast,” said another Amazon reviewer. “With this butter spreader, I can smoothly glide a thin layer of buttery goodness onto any food item in seconds. It's like a dream come true.”
