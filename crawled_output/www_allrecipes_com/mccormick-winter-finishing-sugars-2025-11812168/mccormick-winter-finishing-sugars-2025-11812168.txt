Sure, it may still be 90 degrees F (32 degrees C) or higher in some parts of the country, but that doesn’t mean we aren’t already feeling the holiday spirit. Numerous brands have released seasonal products and menu items that are getting us excited about the pumpkin, apple, and pecan flavors of autumn. And while we’re loving this time of year, the upcoming holidays are also on our minds.
Take a look inside our brains and you’ll see gorgeous holiday tablescapes, a growing list of gifts to buy and wrap, and of course, an extensive holiday baking menu: elaborately decorated sugar cookies, snickerdoodles, Linzer tarts, gingerbread cookies, buckeyes, peanut blossoms, and so much more—we’re already making grocery lists and collecting cookie tins for gifting.
We trust McCormick with all our baking add-ins, from ingredient extracts to the brand’s diverse array of finishing products. Now, hot on the heels of the brand rolling out a collection of fall-flavored finishing sugars last month, McCormick is introducing two new finishing sugars and bringing back two fan favorites.
McCormick Introduces Chocolate Hazelnut and Spiced Orange Finishing Sugars
McCormick
McCormick’s new Chocolate Hazelnut and Spiced Orange Finishing Sugars are already on shelves, sitting alongside returning favorites Candy Cane and English Toffee as a part of McCormick's 2025 Holiday Finishing Sugar collection. If you’re not familiar with finishing sugar, it’s a large-grained sugar used to add color, texture, and visual intrigue to baked goods. Think of it as the sweet version of flaky sea salt; it’s always added at the end of the cooking or baking process, adding a pop of flavor to every bite.
The Chocolate Hazelnut Finishing Sugar would make an excellent addition to fudgy brownies, hot chocolate, yule logs, or any dessert that could benefit from a touch of chocolate and nuttiness. McCormick recommends adding this finishing sugar to “pancake batter, with glazed donuts, or in white frosting as a dip.”

This Is When You Need to Replace Your Spices, According to McCormick
The Spiced Orange Finishing Sugar brings a warm citrus note to whatever it's added to. The beautiful orange and brown sugar would look beautiful atop a pavlova, citrus bar, cheesecake, or cinnamon rolls. McCormick recommends adding this sugar to cake batter for little bits of citrus in the cake crumb, or use it to rim the glass of a holiday cocktail (it would be so delicious with this Cranberry Blush Sparkler).
If this year is anything like last, there’s a good chance these finishing sugars will sell out fast. So, if you're already gathering ingredients for the holiday baking season, you'll definitely want to visit your local grocery store or shop online to snag these limited-time releases.
