We've seen this play out plenty of times. A major food brand tries something new, fans respond, the brand pivots, and the cycle repeats.
It's a familiar dance that has led many companies to go back to the drawing board on new ideas, like when Coca-Cola launched a new version of its cola to compete with Pepsi in 1985, only to rescind the product after customers across the country petitioned against it. The fate of Hostess' Suzy Q's is no different.
The fluffy chocolate sandwiches made their debut in 1961 and quickly gained legendary status. As the saying goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Apparently, Hostess didn't get the memo because in 2016, it released a new version of Suzy Q's, which fans all but snubbed.
Now, after years of fans begging for the original recipe to return, it looks like Hostess might finally be succumbing to their pleas.
Hostess Brings Back Suzy Q's Chocolate Cake
"Hostess Suzy Q's is the best snack cake ever made," shared one Redditor on the r/snacking subreddit. With their moist chocolate sponges and fluffy, sweet vanilla filling, it's easy to see how fans have fallen in love with this particular Hostess item. And for years, they were always within reach whenever the craving struck.
But between 2012 and 2013—right around when Hostess filed for bankruptcy—Suzy Q's were suddenly pulled from shelves, along with several other Hostess favorites. Years later, after fans begged the company to bring back their favorite nostalgic snack cake, the chocolate sandwiches would reappear on store shelves—but not without controversy. Some people noted that the Suzy Q's had become "smaller" and "had much less cream and were bone dry." By 2020, the cakes were pulled once again.
If you, too, have been mourning the loss of the OG Suzy Q's, then you'll be happy to hear that Hostess has brought the iconic treat back to stores. And according to early reviews of the product, it appears that Hostess might finally be giving fans what they want: the original cake sandwiches that have won over generations of people—or at the very least, something that comes pretty darn close to the original.
"I was so excited to see that Hostess brought back the original recipe for the Suzy Q," shared a reviewer. "This cake reminds me of the ones I used to get as a kid. Thank you, and please don't mess with the recipe, it's perfect."
"If you loved Suzy Q’s back in the day, you’ll be thrilled to know they taste just as good (if not better) now," added another fan.
The sentiment was echoed by countless others, including one person who noted, "The creamy filling in the middle adds the perfect balance, making every bite irresistible. It’s the kind of treat that satisfies a chocolate craving instantly."

The new "mega-sized" and "mega-yummy" (according to Hostess) snack cakes are available now at major grocery stores nationwide. Considering how long people have waited for this moment, there's a good chance store shelves will be cleared.
While we don't know whether Suzy Q's will have a permanent spot on the bakery company's lineup, we do know that good things come to those who ask (at least at Hostess). So, if you're reading this, Hostess, consider this our plea to keep these snack cakes for good.
