At the first nip of chill in the air, many of us switch out our summer beachy-scented candles for autumnal apple-scented ones, get out all the orange and pumpkin decor, and start cooking our favorite comfort food recipes on repeat. While there’s nothing quite like a Dutch oven filled with hot chili simmering on the stove and filling the house with spicy, tomato-y, meaty aromas, not every comfort food has to take all day to make.
In fact, some of our go-to comfort meals start in the pantry aisle. From a simple Ro-Tel dip for football game day to the easiest lazy lasagna with frozen ravioli and store-bought marinara sauce, there’s nothing wrong with pulling from the pantry to get incredible results.
And some pantry staples don’t require zhuzhing at all—like the ever-loved Kraft Mac & Cheese. Sure, there are ways to dress up a box of classic mac and cheese, but Kraft’s two new comfort food flavors certainly won’t need it.
Kraft Launches New Hot Honey & Garlic Parmesan Mac & Cheese
Kraft
Hot on the heels of its Pizza Mac & Cheese launch, Kraft is adding two more first-of-their-kind Mac & Cheese flavors to its lineup. This fall, the brand is releasing new flavors that bring the best of game day to your dinner, with its Hot Honey Mac & Cheese and Garlic Parmesan Mac & Cheese.
The sweet-and-spicy hot honey is having a major culinary moment—from placement on fast food menus to the swicy ingredient showing up in our favorite snacks. Now, hot honey is taking on mac and cheese.
Kraft’s new Hot Honey Mac & Cheese combines hot honey, paprika, and buttermilk flavors to create a one-of-a-kind flavor experience in the creamy, cheesy mac.

And since Kraft already sells a Smoky Barbecue Mac & Cheese, the brand is riffing on another favorite wing combination, garlic parm. Its new Garlic Parmesan Mac & Cheese features rich, punchy garlic flavors in a creamy Parmesan cheese sauce.
Both the new Kraft Mac & Cheese flavors will hit retailers this fall, with the Hot Honey Mac & Cheese available exclusively at Target beginning Sept. 28 and the Garlic Parmesan Mac & Cheese available nationwide beginning Oct. 20. Kraft says the limited-edition flavors are expected to be available through Spring 2026.
An easy fall comfort meal that’s ready in minutes? We’ll take 10 boxes.
