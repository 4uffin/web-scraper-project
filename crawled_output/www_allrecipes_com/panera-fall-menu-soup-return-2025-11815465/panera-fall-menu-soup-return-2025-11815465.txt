Key Takeaways
Panera is bringing back a fan-favorite soup after a seven-year hiatus, along with two returning autumn staples.The chain is also introducing two new seasonal menu items that are perfect for fall.
If the only soup you get at Panera is Broccoli Cheddar, you’re missing out. While it is undoubtedly iconic, especially when served in a bread bowl, the chain has so many great flavors to offer. The Cream of Chicken & Wild Rice Soup is a sick day staple, and there’s nothing like dunking a Ciabatta Dipper into a bowl of Panera’s Creamy Tomato Soup.
Luckily, just as soup season kicks off, Panera is bringing back three beloved soups, plus two new fall menu items that are perfect for pairing with all your favorite orders.
Panera Brings Back 3 Cozy Soups for Fall
After a seven-year hiatus, a fan-favorite soup is returning to cafés nationwide. Starting Sept. 24, Panera’s Black Bean Soup is back on menus. Just in time for fall, this soup features a cozy blend of black beans, onion, celery, red bell pepper, carrots, lima beans, potatoes, lemon juice for zing, and garlic. Enjoy it as the sole entrée or opt for a "You Pick Two" with complementary flavors such as the Spicy Fiesta Chicken Sandwich or a Southwest Chicken Ranch Salad.

On Reddit, there's no shortage of threads dedicated to the protein-forward soup. "The black bean soup was the best soup ever on the menu," said one user. "I miss it so much too. YP2 [You Pick Two] Black Bean soup and a fancy grilled cheese was the lunch date for my honey and me for years. We've tried many copycat recipes but none come close," wrote another.
In addition to Black Bean Soup, you can once again order Autumn Squash Soup and Hearty Fireside Chili. Autumn Squash Soup combines butternut squash and pumpkin with honey, apple juice, and warm spices. For those seeking bold flavor, Panera’s Hearty Fireside Chili is the perfect way to enjoy this fall staple without having to break out the slow cooker. The chili includes beef, kidney beans, fire-roasted tomatoes, and green chili peppers.

Alongside the returning fall favorites, Panera is launching two new seasonal menu items. The Harvest Medley Chicken Salad starts with a bed of mixed greens and fresh arugula tossed in a tangy balsamic vinaigrette. Layered on top is a whole grain blend, grilled chicken, mandarin oranges, feta cheese, dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds, toasted pecans, and crunchy beet strips.
And whether you’re stopping in for breakfast or just need a midday pick-me-up, Panera’s new iced beverage fits the bill. The Crème Brûlée Latte is made with freshly brewed espresso, foamed milk, and sweet crème brûlée syrup. Each is topped with whipped cream and a sprinkle of salted caramel sugar to tie all the flavors together.
Be sure to stop in and snag a cup (or bread bowl!) with one of these returning soups. And don't forget to snag a Pumpkin Cookie!
