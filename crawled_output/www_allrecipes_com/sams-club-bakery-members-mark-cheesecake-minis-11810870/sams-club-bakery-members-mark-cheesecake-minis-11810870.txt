I don't know about you, but my hosting instincts always come out during harvest season. Be it the cooling temperatures, changing leaves, or the ever-present threat of rain that makes me want to turn my home into a cozy haven, but once autumn hits, you can find me inviting friends and family over for brunches and dinner parties galore.
Though I'll always whip up at least a few fancy dishes for any gathering I host (or will deem it a potluck-style soirée when I'm feeling sluggish), I do rely on the occasional store-bought staple like a layered dip to add some easy pizzazz to the affair. I've been known to jazz up a Costco cheesecake with pretty toppings, turn some frozen meatballs into a yummy slow-cooker app, and even buy premade mimosas for an easy brunch bevvy. Fortunately for me, Sam's Club is at the ready when I need a ready-to-plate dessert.
Social media has introduced me to a popular product I was admittedly unaware of until recently. Am I late to the game? Maybe a little—but as the saying goes, better late than never. Here's the freezer-to-table dessert Sam's Club customers are swooning over…myself included.

Sam's Club Bakery's Cheesecake Minis Hit the Mark
Nestled among the tantalizing selections of Sam's Club's freezer section is a purple box you'll want to have at the ready for all dessert emergencies. The Member's Mark Cheesecake Minis are a stellar buy, at just under $20 for 63 tiny pieces of cheesecake in a few deliciously classic flavors. In addition to the classic New York-style cheesecake, you can also munch on Caramel Chocolate Chip and Strawberry Swirl. The best part, though, is the sheer convenience of the bite-sized desserts, which all come pre-portioned in their own little paper cups. You can easily thaw them in the fridge, serve, and pass them off as your own creation to impress a crowd.
Sam's Club customers are all over this sweet find, too. One Reddit user shared a scrumptious-looking image of the cheesecake bites on a platter to the platform, letting commenters know they devoured the entirety of the mini cheesecakes.
I'm not the only one who found out a little late about this buy through social forums. Another commenter confessed, "I was unaware that this sort of thing existed, and now I feel like my life has been empty before this moment. I must have it."
Another Reddit poster asked Sam's Club shoppers what to bring to a potluck and saw no shortage of responses. The top-voted comment: "Get the little mini cheesecakes in the ice cream section. There are about 60 in a box." And really, who can argue with 70 upvotes?
If you need any more proof that the cheesecakes are worth the hype, just take the nearly 5,000 five-star reviews of the product on Sam's Club's website as testament to the cheesecake's fairly universal appeal. Reviewers consistently mention that the dessert is a huge hit at gatherings, with one tempted to claim the bites as their own: "I almost took credit for how wonderful they tasted, but I let everyone know Sam's supplied them." It's safe to say the cheesecakes are a must-have dessert to have on hand for this season's potlucks.
