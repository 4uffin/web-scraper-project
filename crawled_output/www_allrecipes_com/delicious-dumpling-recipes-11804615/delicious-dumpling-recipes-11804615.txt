There are several big, on-going debates in the food world. Is a hotdog a sandwich? Does pineapple belong on pizza? Is a potpie a casserole? I’m not here to debate those, but I am here to pose another culinary brainteaser: What constitutes a dumpling? For the purpose of this article, dumplings need only two features: There needs to be a dough—be it made of flour, potatoes, corn, or other ingredients—and there needs to be one other element—be it a filling, soup, or topping. That’s it, that’s all.
While there aren’t many hard-and-fast rules about what makes a dumpling, there's no doubt that dumplings belong in the comfort food Hall of Fame. With so many different varieties of doughy goodness, they're a food you'll never tire of. National Dumpling Day is September 26, so to celebrate, we’re rounding up our favorite dumpling dishes from across the world—from perogi to potstickers, and everything in between. These dumpling recipes demonstrate the global appeal of these small but mighty morsels. Scroll through to find your new favorite dumpling recipes.

Manti - Traditional Turkish Dumplings

Dumplings—also known as manti—are filled with beef, onion, salt, and pepper and boiled until fully cooked. The manti are then plated and smothered with a yogurt sauce and a hot pepper oil to create a traditional Turkish dumpling dish.

Cantonese-Style Pork and Shrimp Dumplings
These little fried dumplings were actually created when recipe developer Vivian Lee wanted a dumpling that encompassed all her favorite ingredients: pork, shrimp, water chestnuts, and watercress.  “INCREDIBLE,” said one Allrecipes reviewer. “I can't say enough good things about them. They were a little bit of work but SO worth it. I made 50 to feed 6 people and they were gone before I knew it. Instant favorite—even with my non-seafood eating brothers! Thanks!”

Varenyky - Ukrainian Perogies
This Ukrainian spin on a pierogi calls for either a classic potato and cheese filling, or a sauerkraut, cabbage, and butter filling (sounds delicious). “Absolutely amazing recipe,” shared one Allrecipes member. “I made these for a food class in school a few years ago and they were a huge hit. Fairly simple to make and they tasted awesome. I made the recipe to the full serving size so I had a bunch to throw in the freezer. They still tasted great cooked from frozen.”

Indian Samosas
dslade
Samosas are a really ancient dish with roots that reach back to the “dawn of civilization itself,” according to a BBC story. Today, this delicious fried dumpling is most associated with Indian cuisine and the cuisine of the Indian diaspora. This version is baked, which makes it a little simpler for a weekday meal—but with all the same comfort and heartiness. “Excellent,” shared one Allrecipes member. “I followed [the recipe] to the T. More complex than I have had from restaurants.”

Apple Sausage Gravy Dumplings
John Mitzewich
This Chef John original is the perfect way to celebrate autumn. He says they have a “perfect balance of savory and fruity, and the dumplings have a gorgeous, delicate texture.” Sounds great to us—and reviewers agree.
“Definitely a keeper,” shared one Allrecipes member. “Common, simple ingredients, easy to follow instructions. I changed nothing and it was perfect. I recommend double the ingredient amount right away because it's too good and you'll be sorry if you eat it all at once.”
