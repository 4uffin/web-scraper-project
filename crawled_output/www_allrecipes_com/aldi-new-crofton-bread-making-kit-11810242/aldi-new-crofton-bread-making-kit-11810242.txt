The holidays are inching closer, and we’re already thinking about finding the best deals, discounts, and products for our gift list. We like to get creative with gifts for our friends and family and shop at our favorite grocery stores, from warehouses like Costco to budget grocers such as Aldi.
We shop Aldi Finds all year, buying way more than just groceries for our homes. Decor, appliances, and even copycats of more expensive name-brand wares can be found at Aldi. So with holiday gifting now on our minds, we’re keeping looking for great gifts at good prices—even if it means buying them months ahead of time.
And this week’s $15 Aldi gem is a gift we're buying in bulk.
Aldi's Crofton 8-Piece Artisan Bread Making Kit
Allrecipes / Aldi
Between the rise of cooking experiments amid the pandemic and increasing grocery prices, making artisanal bread at home has really become a phenomenon. Heck, even megastar Taylor Swift is getting in on the action! While flour and yeast are often sold at accessible prices, bread-making equipment often isn’t. That’s where this Aldi 8-Piece Artisan Bread Making Kit comes in.
The kit includes everything to make a great loaf of bread—except the oven and baking pan. These items would retail for more than $150 at stores like Williams Sonoma. But this Aldi kit is a tenth of that price—a relatively inexpensive way to help your loved one explore a new hobby. And there’s a good chance you’ll be thanked with a delicious loaf of bread!
But because it’s an Aldi Find, it’s only available for one week, so act fast. Here’s what the kit includes:
Proofing Basket With Liner: These baskets are used to help bread dough maintain its shape while it proves. The liner helps the dough release easily from the basket—so you don’t have to wrestle with sticky dough. Dough Whisk: Also known as a Danish whisk, the dough whisk is designed to tackle thick, sticky dough. It has thicker wire loops that can stand up to heavy mixing. The minimal design also helps to prevent overworking the dough. Dough Scraper: This scraper helps bakers move and manipulate sticky dough. The scraper can shape and divide your dough—and help clean up your workspace to boot!Bread Lame With Replacement Blade: The cuts made on the top of a loaf of bread aren’t just decorative—they help the bread rise and bake evenly in the oven. This lame helps you easily score the bread, and the leather cover helps for safe storage.Recipe Book: Perfect for true beginners, this recipe book helps lay down the foundations of bread-making.
If you are picking this up for holiday gifting, consider pairing it with Aldi’s Cast Iron Bread Dome, also available for one week only. Using a bread dome helps trap and circulate steam, which is great for a chewy crust and soft crumb. The Aldi version sells for $27, which is an incredible value compared to a similar Le Creuset version, which costs more than $200.

If you have a budding baker in your life, we bet they'd love to see this Crofton 8-Piece Artisan Bread Making Kit wrapped up for the holidays. Or if you love to bake, it's a great kit for making loaves of holiday bread to gift family and friends.
This is a popular annual release, so if you want to pick one up, we’d recommend stopping by your local Aldi ASAP for the best chance of snagging it. Because like all Aldi Finds, the deal will disappear in a week.
