If you have a can of tomatoes sitting in your pantry, you're already well on your way to a great meal. There are countless recipes—from tomato sauce to soup—that lean on this cupboard staple, but here are a few of our favorites that readers keep coming back to.
Note: Not all canned tomatoes are created equal. Tomatoes, even those of the same variety, can vary drastically in sweetness and acidity. When cooking with canned tomatoes, pay close attention to their taste—they might need a pinch of salt or a bit of white sugar to get the flavors in balance.

Best Marinara Sauce Yet
DOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS
You can't talk about canned tomatoes without talking about marinara. The sauce is one of the best ways to transform a can of tomatoes into your next meal. No food processor? No problem. A rich, smooth sauce is still achievable without one. Just be sure to crush your tomatoes before cooking them if you are using a can of whole tomatoes.

Penne with Spicy Vodka Tomato Cream Sauce
fabeveryday
This five-star vodka sauce recipe can be thrown together in a quick 25 minutes. Adjust the crushed red pepper flakes to suit your spice level, but don't skip the booze. Vodka is just as important as the crushed tomatoes in this recipe. It unlocks flavor from the tomatoes and adds a depth to the sauce.

Vegan Black Bean Soup
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
Whip up a batch of this black bean soup the next time you need to have leftovers for a few days. The flavors get better with time, thanks in part to the tang of the crushed tomatoes.
"Really good with a dollop of low-fat plain yogurt, some chopped green onions and cilantro to garnish," said reviewer N Lincoln.

Stuffed Pepper Soup
DOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS
"Great flavor and filling dinner. This is a great recipe a quick throw-together dinner. I usually have all the ingredients on hand," says Jaci Jacob Reese. "I did add one more bell pepper and omitted the sage (just don't like the taste of it in anything). Also used one can of Rotel and one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of one 28 oz can of tomatoes. It's even better the next day."

Puerto Rican Canned Corned Beef Stew
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
"This is an excellent and very filling dinner. I followed the instructions other than adding more veggies (bigger potato, diced carrots, an onion, and a can of tomatos/corn/okra) and extra sofrito as a taste preference," says SillyBacon2932. "I don't care for canned corned beef, but it sort of melts into the sauce....Tonight I'll add beef and more sauteed veggies yo stretch it into another meal. Thank you for sharing!"
