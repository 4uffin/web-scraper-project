If you want to get a cook’s attention, just mention bacon. The decadent ingredient brings so much more than just meatiness to a dish—it adds richness, smokiness, fattiness, and a flavor that’s simply irreplaceable.
But when it comes to bacon, it’s not only about how you use it in recipes—it’s also about which bacon you start with. Not all bacon is created equal, and whether it’s the star of a BLT or a supporting player in a creamy dip, the brand you choose can make all the difference.
Now, you could embark on the (admittedly tempting) mission of taste-testing every package in the grocery store, but the smarter move is to ask the experts who cook with bacon every week. That’s why we turned to our council of home cooks, the Allrecipes Allstars, to find out which brand they rely on for everything, from breakfast casseroles to appetizers to hearty weeknight dinners.
The Best Bacon Brand, According to Home Cooks
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
When we posed the question of "best bacon brand" to our Allrecipes Allstars, one name quickly rose above the rest: Wright Brand.
"Wrights! Hands down!!" one home cook declared.
The overwhelming favorite was Wright’s Hickory Smoked Thick Cut Bacon. Home cooks praised its natural smoky, not-too-salty flavor and noted the thick slices "work perfectly in dishes that call for frying, sautéing, or stir-frying." Many also appreciated that the strips don’t curl up and stay flat when baked in the oven.
"My husband is a bacon connoisseur, and he insists this is the most flavorful brand and the best at cooking up crispy," shared Diana BP.
And it’s not just the bacon itself—cooks also love what it leaves behind.
"As a southern belle who saves her bacon grease, Wright’s bacon gives cleaner grease," explained Allstar Ashley Elizabeth. "I know! Such an oxymoron, but so true!"
Cleaner grease means better, richer flavor in everything you cook with it, from fried eggs to cornbread to gravy. It’s yet another reason Wright’s has become the go-to choice for so many cooks.

While the Hickory Smoked Thick Cut was the clear champion, Wright’s other varieties had their fans, too. Some Allstars gave their votes to the Applewood Smoked Bacon, which brings a sweeter, more subtle flavor to the table. Others swore by Wright’s Steak Cut bacon, describing it as "substantial" and "an upgrade from regular bacon."
"It’s an indulgence every time I cook it—it’s bacon, but elevated," said community member Sarah E.
Whether you’re after an everyday staple or a special indulgence, starting with Wright Brand seems to be the secret to better bacon dishes. It’s a surefire way to get the smoky flavor, hearty texture, and yes—even the prime bacon grease—that home cooks swear by.
