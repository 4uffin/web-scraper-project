"'Tis the season when life gets really busy, yet you're still trying to figure out how to get dinner on the table," says Senior Producer Nicole McLaughlin. As we transition from lazy summer days to bustling fall afternoons and evenings, we need to make the most of every spare second. That's why Nicole rounded up five of her favorite make-ahead meals, from slow cooker dump dinners to freezer-friendly casseroles.

Make-Ahead Manicotti

This easy dinner is the "fastest manicotti I've ever made," according to Nicole. Shortcut ingredients, like jarred spaghetti sauce and frozen spinach, are key.

Easy Slow Cooker Cheesy Potato Soup with Ham
Peyton Beckwith
This slow cooker soup starts with a convenient secret ingredient from the freezer aisle. "A shortcut of the frozen hash browns is just genius," Nicole says. "This tastes like the ultimate loaded baked potato. It's also like a little southern flair with that ham."

Make-Ahead Breakfast Casserole
Peyton Beckwith
Breakfast for dinner, anyone? "This does not feel like a breakfast casserole, which is why it is the perfect choice for an easy make ahead weeknight dinner," says Nicole. "It feels very hearty, very healthy."
