If you’re a Trader Joe’s lover, you probably know just when the store brings back one of its most popular bakery items, the Kringle. What is a Kringle, you ask? It’s an oval-shaped Danish flaky pastry filled with fruits, nuts, custard, or cheese. While the pastry is sold year-round, it’s particularly popular around Christmas—even its name lends itself to Christmas.
However, considering the winter holiday is still more than two months away, Kringle lovers will be excited to learn that another beloved flavor has arrived in stores. It's one that was so popular at Trader Joe's that the chain had to impose a limit on how many Kringles people could buy at a time. And now, it's available at Aldi for a fraction of the price.
Aldi Now Has Pumpkin Caramel Kringles in Stores
According to some eagle-eyed shoppers, there's a new sweet treat nestled in this week's Aldi Finds: Pumpkin Caramel Kringles, priced at $6.99 each. Given that Trader Joe's sells its Kringles for $9.99, you might want to take this as your cue to start collecting your Kringles from the German retailer.
It's worth noting that the Kringles sold at Aldi are from Racine Danish Kringles, a third-generation bakery in Racine, Wisconsin, that specializes in the flaky pastry. The bakery that produces the Kringle sold by Trader Joe’s, O&H Danish Bakery, is also located in Racine. Coincidence? No. The city is known as “the Kringle capital of the world.” In the early 1900s, according to Wisconsin’s Wausau Daily Herald, many Danish settlers immigrated to southern Wisconsin, bringing their Kringle tradition. Today, several bakeries in Racine are known for baking the pastry.
How do these Pumpkin Caramel Kringles compare to the ever-popular Almond flavor and Raspberry flavor?
"It’s sooooo good," commented a shopper on an Instagram post showcasing the find.
"This one is my absolute favorite," another fan shared on Reddit. "I can take or leave the other flavors."
