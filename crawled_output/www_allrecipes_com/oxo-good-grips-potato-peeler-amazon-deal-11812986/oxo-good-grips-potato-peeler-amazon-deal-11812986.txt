My Mom’s $10 OXO Vegetable Peeler Has Prepped Thousands of Potatoes, and It’s Still Sharp

Everyone in my family is a die-hard potato lover, but my mother is the queen of mashed potatoes. I’ve never had potatoes as fluffy or creamy as hers in all my life. Every Thanksgiving and Christmas, I’m assigned to peel the potatoes so she can work her magic on them. After peeling hundreds, if not thousands, of potatoes, I can confidently say that her OXO Good Grips vegetable peeler is by far and away my favorite tool I’ve ever used. Right now, it happens to be just $10.

I can’t remember a single Thanksgiving when I didn’t use her OXO peeler to prep the russet potatoes for dinner. (Unless we were both peeling at the same time and she got the OXO first, leaving me with the ancient backup peeler.)
OXO’s vegetable peeler has a sharp stainless steel blade on a swivel, so the blade stays flush against the potato no matter what angle you hold it at. After thousands of potatoes, Mom’s OXO peeler is still wickedly sharp. It cuts through tough potato skin like butter. I can fly through a large potato in less than a minute when I’m in the zone.
One aspect that sets OXO’s peeler apart from the rest is the grip. (It is called the Good Grips peeler, after all.) Made of thick silicone, the handle is gentle on my hands yet doesn’t slip around. A comfortable grip is paramount for big potato peeling marathons—take it from someone who annually peels enough potatoes to feed at least 20 Thanksgiving guests. I’ve tried using other vegetable peelers with steel or plastic handles but would up with hand cramps.
There’s also a handy bonus feature hidden in plain sight. The tip of the peeler can core out potato eyes or brown bits. It’s a quick way to get rid of flawed parts without having to break out your paring knives.
Though we primarily use the OXO peeler for potatoes, it’s also great for carrots and apples. Now that apples are in season, my mom will use the OXO peeler to skin fresh-picked fruit for her famous apple crisp recipe.
One of these days, I’m going to steal her OXO peeler and never give it back. Granted, I could simply buy one of my own—especially since it’s on sale for $10 right now—but where’s the fun in that? Besides, if she comes over to my house to steal it back, we’ll probably wind up making delicious mashed potatoes together.
