It’s September, and even if the temperatures haven’t cooled down where you live, we know you’re ready to eschew summer cuisine and make something hearty. You’ve probably already shifted into soup mode and are incorporating autumnal spice blends or syrups into your baked goods and coffee, and you’re definitely daydreaming about a straightforward casserole that’ll keep you feeling cozy (and full!) during the approaching chilly nights.
Did we just read your mind? Good, and keep reading, because we’ve got the antidote for your cozy casserole craving. Get to know Stick of Butter Smothered Pork Chops, the simple but utterly delicious dish that brings a stunning blend of savory pork, salty soup mix, and starchy rice into one hell of a cold-weather meal.
Why We Love the Recipe
In case you didn’t notice, the first three words in this recipe are “stick of butter,” so there’s no way you’re not ending up with a hearty casserole. This recipe combines everything you love about comfort food—savory pork chops, creamy melted butter, shortcut cans of soup, and, of course, starchy rice to soak up all those juices—and into one course. Not only is Stick of Butter Pork ultra-indulgent, but it’s also a breeze to prepare. Mixing, dumping ingredients, and turning on your oven are the only steps required.

How to Make Stick of Butter Smothered Pork Chops
If you’ve got a stick of butter, an hour, a 9x13-inch baking dish, and 12 other ingredients, you’ve got everything you need to assemble Stick of Butter Pork. First, you’ll need pork chops, the aforementioned butter, a thinly sliced onion, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and parsley for garnish. You’ll also need some kitchen shortcuts: a can of chicken broth, a can of French onion soup, a can of cream of mushroom soup, and instant rice.
There’s minimal prep involved, so you can jump right into the recipe. Slice your onion into thin pieces and chop your stick of butter into eight pieces. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pour the minute rice into your baking dish and add French onion soup, chicken broth, and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to combine and top with butter. Season your pork chops with salt, pepper, garlic salt, and paprika and place them atop your rice mixture.
Stir cream of mushroom soup and sliced onions together in a medium bowl. Next, fill the soup can with water and add that to the mixture. Pour over the pork chops and cover the dish with foil. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes.
Uncover dish and gently stir any uncooked rice into the remaining rice mixture. Bake again for 20 more minutes, until pork is no longer pink in the center and the onion mixture is lightly browned. Let cool, top with parsley, and serve.
Tips and Variations
You know the drill: This recipe is simple, which means it’s also flexible.
Don’t fret over whether your pork chops come with or without a bone, because this recipe works for both. You’ll likely find more flavor in a bone-in chop, but make whichever your heart desires.
Can’t find French onion or cream of mushroom soup? It’s absolutely okay to grab a different type, like cream of celery, or even go with a packet of soup mix and water or beef broth.
Stick of Butter Pork is already an impressive meal on its own, but if you want to round it out, try serving it with a crisp salad and lightly seasoned vegetables. The produce makes a nice contrast to the salty casserole and adds a slightly fancy touch to a weeknight table.
