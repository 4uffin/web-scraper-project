Is it just us, or are the seasons now changing in the blink of an eye? One moment, it's all about savoring summer's sweet corn and juicy tomatoes. The next thing you know, grocery stores are overflowing with pumpkins, skeletons, and ghosts. There's no ignoring that snack giants, such as Kit Kat and Snickers, are rolling out their spooky treats earlier each year. And, some brands aren't stopping at Halloween—they're fast-forwarding to December.
Take, for instance, Lindt. The Swiss chocolatier has wasted no time introducing its newest truffle, which takes a beloved Christmas cookie and packs it into a rich, indulgent chocolate.
Lindt Releases New Lindor Shortbread Truffles
In a sea of pumpkin spice, apple cider, chai, and even horchata, Lindt's brand-new Shortbread Truffles feel like a breath of fresh air. While you won't find so much as a hint of cinnamon in these chocolates, you will find crunchy, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth shortbread pieces.
From Pepperidge Farm's Milano cookies to the iconic Twix bar, it's no secret that chocolate and shortbread are a match made in heaven. But here's the thing: Shortbread's dominant flavor is, well, butter, so it can sometimes taste a little one-dimensional. Throw some chocolate into the mix, and everything changes. Chocolate's slight bitterness and acidity can brighten up the richness of shortbread. In turn, the fat in shortbread enhances the cocoa flavor of chocolate, leaving you with something extra indulgent, creamy, and crave-worthy. Honestly? It's about time Lindt tapped into this perfect pairing.
Just like last spring's surprise carrot cake-inspired treat, Lindt kept this announcement under the radar—with a simple, no-frills post on its Instagram account. Nevertheless, fans quickly picked up on the news and weren't shy about sharing their excitement.
"You've outdone yourselves, Lindt," one fan raved. "These are incredible!!"
"What!?!? Please magically place that on my coffee table right now!!" added another.

As of now, it looks like the truffles are only available through the chocolatier's website in bulk sizes, which, yes, come with a higher price point. However, the brand did eventually roll out its Dubai chocolate bars nationwide after the initial limited release, so we are hopeful that the same will be done with this new flavor.
Sure, the autumnal equinox may have just begun, but we can't say we're mad about Lindt sprinkling in a bit of Christmas magic right out of the gate.
