Walmart recently released a ton of new cookware, gadgets, kitchen knives, and organization tools—and many of them are priced under $10. We scoured the site to find the very best options that cost between $2 and $10.

There are four different shapes to create square, rectangular, round, or flower-shaped treats in your favorite muffin pan.

Walmart New Kitchen Tools and Gadgets Under $10
A good chef’s knife is essential in any home cook’s kitchen, and Walmart has several to choose from for under $10. Along with knives, we found even more deals on kitchen shears and food scales, as well as kitchen gadgets like bag sealers, oil sprayers, and colanders. For just $8, you can also grab a sandwich maker or a mini waffle maker.

A food scale may seem like a luxury in the kitchen, but we’d argue that they’re worth it—especially for just $10. This digital model can help you measure more precise portions than standard measuring cups. Plus, it includes thoughtful features like a backlit LED screen and easy-to-read buttons.
