Key Takeaways
National Cheeseburger Day is Thursday, Sept. 18.McDonald's is giving away one of its popular menu items for just 50 cents to celebrate.
McDonald’s kicked off the summer with the return of the Snack Wrap, a fan-favorite we waited to see back on menus for years. Since then, McDonald's has shown no sign of slowing down. The fast food giant has launched numerous new meals, including the TinyTAN Happy Meal and the McDonaldland Meal, which had all of us feeling nostalgic. Soon after, the chain brought back two beloved pie flavors and released Gold Sauce, which became an instant favorite.
And while we love trying McDonald’s newest offerings, we can’t forget about the chain’s timeless classics. Mickey D’s Double Cheeseburgers have been a staple for decades, and it’s easy to see why. There’s no denying the appeal of two beef patties with cheese, ketchup, mustard, onion, and pickles. Pair that with an order of crispy fries, and you’ve got a meal that can bring a smile to just about anyone’s face.
This week, to celebrate National Cheeseburger Day, McDonald’s is launching an unbeatable deal on its Double Cheeseburgers—but fans will have just one day to snag the offer.

McDonald’s National Cheeseburger Day Deal
To celebrate National Cheeseburger Day on Sept. 18, McDonald’s is offering its Double Cheeseburgers for just 50 cents. This deal is available for one day only at participating locations nationwide.
There is one catch–this is an app-exclusive offer. So, if you haven’t already, you’ll need to download the McDonald’s app to get a discounted burger. If you frequent the golden arches, the chain’s loyalty app is a great way to snag deals, free food, and earn rewards points that can be redeemed for menu items.
And if you can’t make it to the drive-thru tomorrow, don’t worry. McDonald’s just lowered the price on a handful of its combo meals, so even if you miss out on 50-cent Double Cheeseburgers, you can still score savings on some of your other favorite menu items.
