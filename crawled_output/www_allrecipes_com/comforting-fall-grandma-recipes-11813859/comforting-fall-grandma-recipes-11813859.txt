Grandma's Polish Perogies
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
"This recipe for perogies has been in the family for generations, with a few alterations of course! My grandfather is Polish, and his mother taught my grandmother how to make these delicious dumplings. Serve plain, or with butter, sour cream, bacon, etc. Perfecting the pierogi technique takes time, and after a while, you will develop your own system," explains STEPH577. And hundreds of five-star reviews seem to agree.

Veggies and beans are amped up with diced ham in this classic soup recipe. By cooking it for hours in the slow cooker, each bite is infused with rich ham flavor.
