Yummy Ice Cream Bread
Allrecipes/Renee Pajestka
"I’m so impressed with this! Many times when I try something new, I prepare myself for disappointment, but I didn’t need to at all with this recipe! I didn’t have any self-rising flour, so I substituted it with 1-1/2 cups of flour combined with 2-1/4 tsp baking soda and 3/8 tsp salt. It has a cake-like crumb, so I’m not sure this would do well as French toast. I used maple-walnut ice cream; the scent was heavenly and the flavor wasn’t overly strong." —Margaret

Conchas (Mexican Sweet Bread)
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
"This is a great recipe, easy and tasty. The only thing I would like to advise you is that instead of making 12 big conchas (on a 12 portions recipe), make the balls or conchas smaller (around 20 portions). They are easier to handle and the crust seems to hold better than in the bigger ones. I had a blast making them, and the crust was so easy to decorate. In Mexico, usually we make not just the shells, but all kinds of decorations. Use your imagination...Thanks again for the recipe...they are delicious!!!!!" —Allanita

Easy Cloud Bread
Colleen Brose
"I leave out the sugar which is how I have made them for years. They are wonderful as a sandwich bread for burgers, PB and J, etc. but you must use 2, one as a bottom and one as a top. I add garlic powder and other spices so they are savory and not sweet." —BC

Choereg (Armenian Easter Bread)
"Ani, God Bless you for sharing this coveted recipe! I lost my grandmother's recipe for choereg :( No doubt I was thrilled to find this, which turned out as good as I remember grandma's. I had to use about 8 cups of flour for this recipe, and instead of the butter/margarine combo, I used all butter and the result was superb! Thanks again for sharing." —Suzie

Soft and Chewy Balkan Bread
"Very simple and delicious. I say eating these fresh tastes better than those from the restaurants. You have to try this. Other than waiting with my timer set up, I spent maybe only 20 min. Thanks for the recipe." —Jerry Em

Russian Black Bread
Allrecipes Magazine
"This bread was awesome! It was just like the one that the rustic bakery down the street from my house sells. Like others who commented on this recipe, I substituted molasses for the dark corn syrup. I did not use a bread machine; rather, I mixed everything, let it rise for about an hour. punched it down, formed it into a large round loaf, and cut deep "vents" in a star pattern across the top and baked for about 35 minutes at 350 degrees. GREAT RECIPE!!!" —LORIKAE

Persimmon Bread
ALLRECIPES / QI AI
"This bread is moist and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the spices. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a dash of cloves. Also, it was beautiful and brown after 50 mins of baking. I did use a dark, nonstick loaf pan. My oven temperature is usally quite accurate. It was the first time I've used persimmons in baking. My neighbor shared some from her garden. Now I'm anxious to get more so I can make more of this delicious bread. I read that you can freeze persimmon pulp so I'd like to do that and be able to make this even when they're not in season. Thank you v monte for this wonderful recipe!!" —VIVIBO

Vanilla Spice Bread
Alberta Rose
"This stuff is awesome. Made mine with all milk and I had to substitute cinnamon and nutmeg because that is what I have on hand. I did jack up the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp and nutmeg to 1/4 tsp. Since I did not have dark brown sugar, I just added 1 Tbsp of molasses to my light brown sugar. Made this entirely in the bread machine. 1 1/2 lb loaf with light crust and it is perfect. Best French Toast ever." —Sariah Griffin

Lebanese Mountain Bread
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
"Wow is this worth it. Made 1/2 batch before and the other after overnight refrigeration. Noticeably better after refrigerating but great either way. This tastes better than the naan I get at Indian restaurants. Used with Chef John's falafel and tahini sauce. Excellent combo. For me, a big difference was cooking 30 seconds on each side TWICE, rather than 45-60 secs at once. Less burn, and a GREAT air rise to create a nice pocket for the falafel." —billme123

Indian Chapati Bread
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
"I'm very impressed with this recipe. Instructions were easy to follow and the video was also great help . The chapati worked pretty much exactly as depicted. I used Spelt flour instead of half plain/half wholemeal." —DreamyPrawn9711

Khobz el Dar (Algerian Semolina Bread)
Doughgirl8
"Made this to go with the lunch today. Lots of prep to it, but worth the wait. It is definitely a heavier bread, not a light fluffy sandwich loaf. It was a great tasting bread on its own with butter, and I think it would be fabulous with a nice beef stew!" —Ann Freele

Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread
Stacy Allen / Food Styling: Julian Henserling / Prop Styling: Christina Daley
"This is a great soda bread recipe. I have made it several times now and it comes our perfect every time. I make my own buttermilk using 1 cup milk and 1 tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar. It is a family favorite, go-to recipe. Another winner from All Recipes!" —Maurfried

Amish White Bread
DOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS
"Arguably the best white bread recipe on the entire planet, and I should know. I've probably tried every last one! No faint praise, as I've been making bread for more than 35 years. I have made it exactly as written, and although it's very tasty with the full measure of sugar, we prefer cutting it slightly. " —Baricat
