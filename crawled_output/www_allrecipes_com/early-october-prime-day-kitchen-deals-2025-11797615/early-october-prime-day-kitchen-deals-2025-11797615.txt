October is easily my favorite month of the year thanks to cooler weather, autumn leaves, pumpkin spice lattes, and Halloween. Now there’s another reason to love October: Amazon just announced Prime Big Deals Days—a sales event chock-full of incredible discounts.
Colloquially known as “October Prime Day,” the 2-day event will feature thousands of deals on kitchen products, including air fryers, blenders, utensil sets, knife blocks, mixing bowls, and food storage containers, and so much more.
Though October is still a few weeks away, many top-notch kitchen brands are celebrating early with deals you don’t want to miss. I found 52 sales happening right now, up to 64 percent off, from beloved brands including Rubbermaid, Keurig, Crock-Pot, Cuisinart, Instant Pot, and more.

Some of my favorite brands and products have deals ahead of the October Prime Day event. I recently got this OXO Good Grips Pop Container, and it transformed my pantry. My Keurig K-Slim Single-Serve Coffee Maker might be my favorite kitchen appliance (I’ve used it twice this morning), and it’s now 41 percent off. Keep reading to see how you can save up to 64 percent on must-have kitchen equipment.

The most important tool in any kitchen is a good knife. This stainless steel set comes with six specialty blades and a pair of kitchen shears. Each knife has a cover to protect the sharp edges (and your hands). For a limited time, the set is 64 percent off—just $1.38 per blade.

$10 at Amazon
Kitchy reinvented the pizza wheel with this clever kitchen gadget. The cutter ditches an awkward handle, making it much easier to store. The rounded grip fits into your palm with a no-slip grip. When you’re done, pull down the built-in protective plastic casing to cover the blade. Grab it while it’s half off.

Best Early Amazon Prime Day Food Storage Deals
It seems everybody has personal preferences when it comes to food storage containers. Personally, I prefer glass containers so I can reheat leftovers in the microwave. This glass 8-pack caught my eye because it has secure snap-top lids and a 46 percent discount. I’m also a big fan of Stasher’s reusable silicone bags, and this half-gallon bag is marked down 43 percent for a limited time.
Rubbermaid Brilliance Food Storage Containers, 3-Pack, $30 (was $50)
OXO 1-Quart Good Grips Pop Container, $10 (was $15)
Homberking Large Glass Meal Prep Containers, 8-Pack, $35 (was $65)

$30 at Amazon
Rubbermaid has been in the food storage game since 1920 and is trusted by generations of home cooks—including my mom. The Brilliance collection is also a favorite of Allrecipes editors. This particular 3-piece set is a great option for storing dry goods. It has airtight lids, resists stains, has a slim shape for maximizing space, and is shatter-resistant. Each container also comes with a handy scoop.
JoyJolt 12-Piece Glass Storage Containers
Amazon
$65
$40 at Amazon
This variety pack of glass containers is all about convenience. It comes in three different shapes, ranges in size from 11 ounces to 35 ounces, and is safe to use in the microwave, oven, freezer, and dishwasher. I’m due for new containers, and this set is currently at the top of my list of worthy replacements.

Best Early Amazon Prime Day Kitchen Appliance Deals
Outfitting a kitchen can be costly, and usually the biggest price tags are attached to appliances. Fortunately, Amazon has some enticing deals on kitchen appliances. I’d be lost without my trusty air fryer, and this 4-quart model is now $40 off. This portable slow cooker is both colorful and 40 percent off—a win-win in my book.
Keurig K-Sl41im Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker, $89 (was $150)
Instant Pot Vortex 6-Quart XL Air Fryer, $100 (was $140)
Ganiza 8-Cup Electric Food Chopper, $35 with Prime (was $51)

Keurig K-Slim Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker
Amazon
$150
$89 at Amazon
I mentioned it earlier, but it bears repeating: the Keurig K-Slim is my favorite appliance, and it gets the most use out of anything in my kitchen. I use it at least twice a day (if not three times). As its name suggests, the coffee maker is slim, so it doesn’t take up much space on my counter. It’s a convenient way to get a quick cup of coffee that never disappoints. Best of all, it’s 41 percent off right now.
Chefman 4-Quart Compact Air Fryer
Amazon
$100
$60 at Amazon
Air fryers are wildly popular for their convenience and versatility—just ask our Allstar who owns four of them. While I only have one, I swear by it. In fact, I prefer it to my finicky oven. This 4-quart version from Chefman is a compact machine that has multiple cooking presets and reaches up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. The intuitive appliance is now $40 off.
Amazon
Best Early Amazon Prime Day Cookware and Bakeware Deals
I inherited most of my cookware and bakeware, and they’re starting to show their age. While browsing deals on Amazon, I found a 3-piece nonstick cookie sheet set for $7 per pan. Since my kitchen isn’t big, I’m also eyeing this 21-piece cookware set with detachable handles for easy storage—the fact that it’s 57 percent off definitely doesn’t hurt.

NutriChef 3‑Piece Nonstick Cookie Sheets, $20 (was $34)

Ramekins are underrated pieces of bakeware. You can make chocolate soufflé, crème brûlée, custard tarts, mini pies, and more in the 4-ounce porcelain cups. Dowan’s 6-piece set is on sale for $2 per ramekin. The white ceramic adds a touch of elegance to any dessert you make.
