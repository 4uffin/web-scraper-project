20 Clever Recipes You Won't Believe Start with Soda
Fizzy beverages aren’t just for drinking.

Mountain Dew, 7Up, Coca-Cola, and other soft drinks are timeless thirst-quenchers, but their high sugar content and acidity makes them ideal additions to recipes. The sugar sweetens sauces and marinades, while the acid tenderizes meats. The carbonation in soda can also serve as a leavening agent, giving cakes a tender crumb and making batters light and crispy. Here, 15 clever recipes that put soda's components to good use.

Perfect Marinated Chicken Breasts
Jburd777
The secret to super-tender chicken breasts? Sprite! "I used ginger ale instead of lemon lime soda since that's what I had," says Celena Pankhurst Shaw. "Also I baked it at 400F for about 45 min. It came out moist and delicious!!"

Sweet Simmered Pork Chops
Simmering thick pork chops in Dr. Pepper, barbecue sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and black pepper makes them tender and flavorful. If you prefer a thicker sauce, mix a flurry of corn starch and water into the mixture before pouring it over the pork chops.

Roasted Soda Can Chicken
Cynthia Vineyard-Brown
This riff on oven-baked beer can chicken involves baking the chicken on a can of lemon-lime soda, which gives the bird subtle citrus flavor and makes the meat tender and juicy. "This turned out great, but I did add a bunch of other seasonings & I used Sprite Zero," says reviewer Jenn M. "Will definitely make this again and again."

Pick up your choice of fruit-flavored soda and jam for this five-ingredient pork tenderloin recipe (Allrecipes community member Kris Schultz likes black cherry soda and plum jam). "Excellent!" says Terri Frank Ramseyer. "The best and easiest pork tenderloin recipe I have ever found! I have also used the marinade for chicken breasts. They are great.

Orange-Pineapple Ice
"We really enjoyed this, but used 2 liters of soda (about 8 cups, or a half gallon). It made 3 quarts of the 'ice.' Since the soda foamed up as I added it, I started adding a bit at a time and stirring/folding to reduce the carbonation. BTW, we also used fat-free condensed milk and diet soda. Came in at 52 calories and no fat for a half cup serving." —THYMEFORME

Bourbon Baked Beans
Bourbon and Dr. Pepper inject canned baked beans with rich notes of vanilla and caramel, while half a pound of bacon gives the dish plenty of meaty flavor. "Amazing and beautiful keep getting asked to make them over and over," says reviewer FairCrisp8283.

Easy 7-Up Biscuits

Country Apple Dumplings
DOTDASH MEREDITH FOOD STUDIOS

7Up Cake
Dotdash Meredith Food Studios
This cake is so good, one Allrecipes reviewer made the easy recipe four times in seven days. You can make a glaze out of confectioners' sugar to drizzle on top, but many who've made it say the citrus-zinged masterpiece is delicious on it’s own.

Crispy Cider-Battered Chicken Fingers
While sparkling apple cider isn't technically soda, it has similar properties! The carbonation helps self-rising flour become a light and crunchy batter for chicken and fish.
