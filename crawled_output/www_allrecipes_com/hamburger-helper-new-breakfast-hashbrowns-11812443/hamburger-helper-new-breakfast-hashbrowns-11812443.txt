We can’t talk about our favorite childhood meals without mentioning Hamburger Helper. The brand has been a pantry staple for decades, and it’s no surprise why. Not only is it shelf-stable and customizable, but it’s also helpful on busy weeknights when you have nothing on hand but a package of ground beef.
If you haven’t browsed the selection in a while, you may be surprised to see how much Hamburger Helper has changed. Last year, the Eagle Foods-owned company revamped its recipe to reduce cook times and update its flavor based on customer feedback. In addition, it has continued to grow with fresh meal options such as Spicy Garlic Parmesan, Sweet Heat Barbecue, and Tomato Basil Penne.
Now, Hamburger Helper is expanding once again with four new meal kits that will start your day off right.
Hamburger Helper Launches New Breakfast Meal Kits
Allrecipes / Hamburger Helper
For the first time ever, Hamburger Helper is lending a hand at the breakfast table. Hamburger Helper Breakfast is now on shelves and includes four soon-to-be favorites that start with shredded potatoes, including Cheesy Hashbrowns, Southwest Style Hashbrowns, Farmhouse Hashbrowns, and Sausage Hashbrowns.
All you need to get started is water. However, depending on the variety, you may need to add eggs, milk, or breakfast sausage to create a warm, satisfying bowl.
Most of the 4-ounce boxes contain four servings, except the 5.5-ounce box of Cheesy Hashbrowns, which has five. And at less than $2 each, you can double the servings without breaking the bank.
Here’s what you can expect from Hamburger Helper’s Breakfast lineup:
Cheesy Hashbrowns: Potatoes and cheese sauce come together for this comforting breakfast dish. Enjoy it as is or customize with sautéed mushrooms, peppers, onion, and a sprinkle of crispy bacon.
Southwest Style Hashbrowns: The options are endless with this zesty Tex-Mex seasoning blend. Enjoy it as a bowl, alongside fried eggs, or wrapped in a warmed flour tortilla for an effortless breakfast burrito. Add regular breakfast sausage or kick things up with spicy crumbles.
Farmhouse Hashbrowns: If you want to enjoy the flavors of your favorite loaded breakfast skillet but don’t have fresh veggies on hand, look no further than Hamburger Helper’s Breakfast Farmhouse Hashbrowns. Simply add a pound of your favorite sausage and two eggs to this box for a hearty bowl that’s perfect for chilly fall mornings.
Sausage Hashbrowns: Like sausage gravy? You’ll love the black pepper gravy seasoning that coats this box’s hash browns. Serve it up with eggs or alongside fluffy biscuits for a cozy breakfast the whole family will love.

In addition to the boxed offerings, shoppers can snag two new on-the-go breakfast cups. Hamburger Helper Cheesy Breakfast Hashbrown Microwave Cups and Hamburger Helper Breakfast Hashbrowns & Gravy Microwave Cups cook in just minutes and only require the addition of water.
You can find the entire Hamburger Helper Breakfast line at Kroger and Walmart locations nationwide. And be sure to look for the brand’s new restaurant-inspired pasta kits at Kroger, which include flavors such as Sweet & Savory Teriyaki, Brew Pub Cheeseburger, Zesty Marinara, and Cheesy Buffalo Mac.
