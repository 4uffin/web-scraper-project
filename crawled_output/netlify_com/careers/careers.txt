Careers at Netlify Help us build a better web
Find a Job
Our story What started as a vision between childhood friends in Denmark has grown into a movement that’s transformed how millions of developers build for the web. Founded in 2015, we’ve been driven by an unwavering belief that the web should be faster, more secure, and more accessible for everyone. Through every challenge and milestone, our mission has remained clear: enable the world’s developers to create, and unlock the power of the web. Today, we’re a venture-backed company headquartered in San Francisco with a truly global perspective. We’re not just remote-friendly: we’re remote-first and fully distributed by design, bringing together exceptional teams across the globe who collaborate, contribute, and help shape our shared mission. What truly sets us apart isn’t just our platform - it’s our people. You’ll work alongside some of the smartest, kindest, and most collaborative teammates, tackling high-impact challenges that affect millions of developers worldwide. If you’re excited to do meaningful work with a team that values empathy, ambition, and the power of a well-placed emoji, we’d love to have you on this journey with us! Launch something amazing with
your career
Health, Wellness, & Education We offer full benefits including flexible time off, sponsored mental health resources, at least
16 weeks of parental leave, $2k/yearly learning and development allowance, 401k, and more.
Home Office Build out a home office with a generous starting stipend. Expense your internet, cell phone, or
co-working membership within a monthly allowance.
In-person Connection We are a distributed culture but we also like to get together and meet! Netli-meet your coworkers
at annual team offsites and all hands. Our Values Netlivate We look to make things simpler vs. complicated when it comes to planning, engaging, and
delivering results with our customers and partners. Weigh In, Then Buy In Curious and open-minded vs. pushing an agenda. Ask tough questions yet are willing to be asked
and answer similar questions. We are data-driven, and we commit to moving forward as a team. Own It, Ship It We seize the opportunity in front of us. We take chances as we are creating a new market. We take
ownership and responsibility of our work vs. blame or deflect to others. We admit mistakes, ask for help,
apologize, and be open and honest when we don’t know something. We don’t quit and are relentlessly
resourceful. We choose impact and prioritize success. Care Deeply, and Have Fun We are passionate about the work we do and the impact we have. We are also passionate about our
customers and partners both internal and external to Netlify. We understand there are bad moments, not bad
days. We contribute with levity and fun and lift the spirits of others around us. Diversity = Intelligence We foster and build an inclusive and diverse culture, which makes us stronger and smarter.
Diversity will allow us to deliver the best product and services to our developers, customers, and
partners globally. We continually strive to be more emotionally intelligent. We will hire as an
organization consistently improving the diversity of our teams to be representative of the world.
