Our story What started as a vision between childhood friends in Denmark has grown into a movement that’s transformed how millions of developers build for the web. Founded in 2015, we’ve been driven by an unwavering belief that the web should be faster, more secure, and more accessible for everyone. Through every challenge and milestone, our mission has remained clear: enable the world’s developers to create, and unlock the power of the web. Today, we’re a venture-backed company headquartered in San Francisco with a truly global perspective. We’re not just remote-friendly: we’re remote-first and fully distributed by design, bringing together exceptional teams across the globe who collaborate, contribute, and help shape our shared mission. What truly sets us apart isn’t just our platform - it’s our people. You’ll work alongside some of the smartest, kindest, and most collaborative teammates, tackling high-impact challenges that affect millions of developers worldwide. If you’re excited to do meaningful work with a team that values empathy, ambition, and the power of a well-placed emoji, we’d love to have you on this journey with us! Launch something amazing with
your career
Investing In You Your growth and development are priorities that fuel our collective success. The natural curiosity that drives Netlify shines through in our generous annual education budget, supporting courses, conferences, and other resources that expand your skills and knowledge. We recognize that your environment shapes your productivity, which is why we provide a substantial stipend to create the perfect home office setup that works for you. Daily needs matter too, so we offer a monthly reimbursement for internet, mobile costs, or co-working space access to support your flexible work style. Most importantly, we believe everyone who contributes to Netlify's success should share in it, offering equity to every employee, making you not just a team member, but a meaningful stakeholder in our journey forward.
Distributed by Design We've been building Netlify as a distributed team from our very first day, connecting passionate people across 14+ countries who collaborate, create, and solve problems together. For us, being remote-first isn't just a policy: it's how we've always worked, and it's woven into the fabric of who we are. We believe everyone deserves an equal voice in our community, regardless of where they call home.
Thrive and Restore We believe that meaningful work happens when you're at your best, which is why we're committed to supporting your wellbeing both inside and outside of work. Taking time to recharge is essential, so our unlimited vacation policy empowers you to take the breaks you need to explore, rest, and return inspired. Your well-being forms the foundation of everything you do, which is why we provide comprehensive medical, dental, and vision benefits for you and your loved ones. Life’s big moments deserve time and attention, so we offer comprehensive parental leave options for both birthing and non-birthing parents. We see the connection between thriving personally and creating exceptional work together. Our Values Be Inclusive The best idea can come from anywhere. Act every day to create an inclusive environment where people of different backgrounds, viewpoints, origins, genders, cultures and beliefs collaborate to build a better web.  We welcome feedback and continuously work toward fostering a culture of transparency and psychological safety. We go to market with a rich set of partners in a composable ecosystem spanning all of the world, serving an incredible variety of customers. Always show up as an inclusive and welcoming partner across this broad spectrum of customers, vendors, service providers and web projects. We’re a platform for web developers, but we build inclusive solutions that help diverse web teams ship faster together. Own It, Ship It An owner cares about the whole business, involves stakeholders and contributors and informs coworkers, customers and partners along the way. Be a pilot, not a passenger. Take ownership and responsibility of your work. Don’t blame or deflect to others. Admit mistakes, ask for help, apologize, and be open and honest when you don't know something. Owning means shipping, and shipping means owning the business outcome and the customer experience - not just checking a mark. Owners bring urgency and focus on customers. Listen, iterate, ship and drive results. Care Deeply, and Have Fun We hire passionate people that care deeply about their work, their craft, their coworkers, our customers and about building a better web. As a mission driven company we have an incredible group of passionate people wanting to make a difference, but we all do our best work when we’re having fun together and inspiring each other, even when the problems we are solving are challenging or tough. Know that everybody cares deeply, and that sometimes emotions can run high, so contribute to bring levity and joy and to lift each other up. Simplify We remove friction for developers and when they choose Netlify, "it just works.".
Innovate by coming up with simple solutions to complex problems. All systems, processes and organizations will have an organic tendency to grow more complex over time, simplifying takes conscious effort and attention. Drive simplicity in planning, tool use, processes and workflows, when engaging, and delivering results internally or with customers and partners. Meet our Netlifolks
