New guidance: Tribal general welfare exclusion
The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) PDF to implement section 139E of the Internal Revenue Code, created by the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014 (Act). Additionally, Treasury held Tribal consultations on the proposed rule on Nov. 18, 19, and 20, 2024, at 1 p.m. Eastern time.
Treasury accepted written comments received by Jan. 3, 2025, 11:59 p.m. Alaska Time. Written comments were submitted to tribal.consult@treasury.gov.
Treasury and IRS issue proposed regulations providing clarity regarding the federal tax classification of entities entirely owned by Tribal governments
The Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations addressing the federal tax classification of corporations or LLCs that are owned entirely by Indian Tribal governments (Tribes) and formed under the laws of the Tribes that own them.
Under the proposed regulations, Tribal law entities that are entirely owned by Tribes would not be recognized as separate entities for federal tax purposes and would not be subject to federal income tax.
The proposed regulations would also clarify that Tribal law entities entirely owned by Tribes may receive the value of certain energy credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Until the final regulations are published in the Federal Register, Tribes and related entities may generally rely on these proposed regulations.
Treasury and IRS encourage interested parties to submit comments on this guidance through Regulations.gov. Please indicate IRS and REG-113628-21 in the submission.
Treasury accepted written comments received by Jan. 21, 2025, 11:59 p.m. Alaska Time.
Additionally, Treasury held Tribal consultations on the proposed rule on Dec. 16, 17, and 18, 2024, at 1 p.m. Eastern time.
