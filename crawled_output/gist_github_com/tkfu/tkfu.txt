Script to scrape SRD-licensed monster data from DnD Beyond. Brittle, simple, but it works as of the posting of this gist.
require 'json'
require 'nokogiri'
require 'open-uri'
require 'rails-html-sanitizer'
def get_monster_list
monster_urls = []
firstpage = Nokogiri::HTML(open("https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters?filter-search=&filter-source=1&filter-type=0&page=1"))
num_pages = firstpage.xpath('//li[@class="b-pagination-item"]')[firstpage.xpath('//li[@class="b-pagination-item"]').length - 2].text.to_i
puts "Found #{num_pages} pages..."
