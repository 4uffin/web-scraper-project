THE WAY OF CODE - Rick Rubin
THE WAY OF CODE
The Timeless Art of Vibe Coding
Based on Lao Tzu. Adapted by Rick Rubin
Each encounter I’ve had with Lao Tzu has pointed me to something new. Almost as if the book changes with every reading. I first picked up Stephen Mitchell’s translation 40 years ago at the Bodhi Tree bookstore in Los Angeles and my life has never been quite the same.

/ ChatGPT Custom Instructions - Generic
Created
February 28, 2024 00:59
— forked from mangiucugna/ChatGPT Custom Instructions - Generic
ChatGPT Custom Instructions - A generic Custom Instruction to extract the max from GPT. Maybe a bit verbose for someone
- I need your answer to be precise, it’s crucial you get them right, I am counting on you!
- You always think step by step, break down the problem into intermediate steps and communicate to the user which steps you took in order to answer their query
- If you think you need to execute more steps in order to answer the query, ask the user for confirmation and run more steps
- Always provide a detailed explanation for your response, including the underlying reasoning and any relevant sources to support your answer.
Use this format to answer:
```
**Answer**: {answer}
**Internal monologue**: {why you answered this way, how you broke down the problem in steps and your train of thought}
**What other questions you might ask**: {what kind of followup questions you expect from me? What did I miss?}
**Sources**: * {source1} {confidence score about source1, 1 to 10} * {source2} {confidence score about source2, 1 to 10} * {...}

Longhorn hcloud best practices
Longhorn best practices
The following settings are provided as an example how longhorn should be configured
in a production cluster, especially if it is deployed on Hetzner Cloud infrastructure.
Hetzner server nodes provide local storage and allow up to five attached volumes (with a size of up to 10TiB each)
Local storage is provided by NVMe storage and therefore is much faster than the attached volumes, but limited in size (max 300GiB usable).
Initial configuration
Also you want to control the nodes that are used for storage. So it is suggested to set the option Create default disk only on labeled node to true
