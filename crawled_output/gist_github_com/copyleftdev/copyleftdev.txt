Rust-Based Web Crawler with Kafka and PostgreSQL Integration - Design Specification
Rust-Based Web Crawler with Kafka and PostgreSQL Integration - Design Specification
1. Introduction
1.1 Overview
This document outlines the design specification for a high-performance Rust-based web crawler integrated with Apache Kafka and PostgreSQL. The crawler will act as a worker within a distributed system, consuming URLs from Kafka topics, crawling the associated web pages, and storing the results in a PostgreSQL database. Docker Compose will be utilized to manage the infrastructure, ensuring seamless deployment and orchestration of the services.
1.2 Objectives
Develop a high-performance web crawler using Rust that integrates with Kafka and PostgreSQL.
Ensure scalable crawling of up to 10 million websites.
