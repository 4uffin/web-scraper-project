Installing LiveContainer+SideStore from start to finish.
Raw
Installing LiveContainer+Sidestore.md
A Guide to Setting up Sidestore + LiveContainer
Works on the latest iOS versions, including iOS 26 db8.
Hello r/sideloaded!
After the mass revocation wave I decided to make this guide to help people sideload apps using an alternative method. A method that is 100% revoke free, costs nothing, and requires a computer only one time (for initial setup)!
After following this guide you will not need to worry about the 3 app limit OR refreshing every 7 days. You will be able to install as many apps as you want and they should not ever expire. This is a completely free method.
Here is what we will go over in this guide:
Installing LiveContainer+Sidestore
Setting up LiveContainer and Sidestore
Setting up auto-refresh that actually works
Installing Apps
————————————————————————
Prerequisites
Before starting this guide, please install the following applications for your computer platform. Any downloads are linked to their original source.
Windows:
iTunes (32x / 64x)
iCloud
Sideloadly or AltServer
idevice-pair
ℹ️ NOTE: If you already have iTunes installed from the Windows store, uninstall it. You need the .exe version from above.
Mac:
Sideloadly or AltServer
idevice-pair
iOS/iPadOS:
Download StosVPN (from the App Store) to your device.
LiveContainer+SideStore.ipa (from Github)
————————————————————————
We may now proceed with the guide.
1. Installing LiveContainer+Sidestore
There are two ways of doing this, this guide will cover both. Both require you to have the .exe versions of iCloud and iTunes installed if you are on a Windows machine.
AltServer • Recommended
Make sure you have AltServer installed and setup, detailed instructions can be found here for Windows and here for macOS.
Step 1: Plug your device into your computer. Make sure AltServer is running, click the AltServer icon found in the menu bar on macOS or the taskbar on Windows.
Step 2: While holding either Option (⌥) on macOS or Shift (⇧) on Windows, click the “Sideload .ipa” option. It will only appear if you are holding the key.
Step 3: Select the downloaded LiveContainer+SideStore.ipa to start sideloading it.
Step 4: If prompted, enter your Apple Account email, password, and 2FA code. If you’re concerned about this, use a burner account, you will be fine using your main account though. After this, you will see a notification that reads “Installing LiveContainer to [your device].”
Once you see another notification telling you that LiveContainer installed successfully, you can move onto setting up the app. Good job so far!
Sideloadly (NOT Recommended¹)
Make sure you already have Sideloadly installed and setup on your computer. The download can be found here for both macOS and Windows.
Step 1: Plug your device into your computer and open Sideloadly.
Step 2: Select your device from the dropdown manu, then click on the "IPA" button and select the downloaded LiveContainer+SideStore.ipa.
Step 3: If prompted, enter your Apple Account email and press start. You will be asked for your password and 2FA code. If you’re concerned about this, use a burner account, you will be fine using your main account though.
Step 4: Wait... eventually the log at the bottom of the Sideloadly windows will say "Done!', you can continue onto setting up the app. Great job!
————————————————————————
2. Setting up LiveContainer and Sidestore
Before we can open LiveContainer we need to both allow the app and enable developer mode on our phone, otherwise the app won’t open.
LiveContainer
Step 1: Open the settings app of your device, then go to General > VPN & Device Management.
Step 2: You should see the email of the Apple Account you use listed, tap on it, then allow app.
Step 3: Back out to the main settings menu, then scroll to Privacy and Security.
Step 4: Scroll to the very bottom, you will see Developer Mode as one of the last few options, turn it on then follow the directions given by your phone.
After your device restarts, you can now open LiveContainer! There are still a few more steps before we are finished though.
SideStore
Before setting up SideStore, open StosVPN. Add the VPN, enable it, then make sure you're connected to Wi-Fi.
Open LiveContainer and you will see an icon in the top left corner, it’s the SideStore logo! Tap on it to open SideStore (if the app just closes, open it again, it should take you to SideStore).
You will be greeted by probably a lot of popups, press allow to all of them and then when you see a screen asking for a pairing file, close the app. We will now load our pairing file into SideStore.
Step 1: Plug your device into your computer and open idevice-pair, select your device from the dropdown. Make sure it is unlocked, and trust your computer if needed.
Step 2: Press "Generate" to create your pairing file. You may be asked to trust your computer again, if you are, do it, then press "generate" again.
Step 3: You should see your pairing file on the right and some options on the left, scroll until you see LiveContainer and press the "Install" button under it. This will sync your paring file with SideStore within LiveContainer.
Step 4: Once your paring file is synced, open LiveContainer, then SideStore, and navigate to the "My Apps" tab. Tap on where it says "7 DAYS" next to LiveContainer to refresh the app.
Step 5: You will likely get a purple pop up screen, press "Refresh Now" and then authenticate with the same Apple Account you used to install LiveContainer. When you see a popup titled "App Contains Extensions", press "Keep App Extensions (Use Main Profile).
Now to complete setup, close SideStore and go to the main LiveContainer app. Go to settings and then tap "Import certificate from SideStore". After that tap "JIT-Less Mode Diagnose" and then "Test JIT-Less Mode". If you see "Success" then you are all done! Otherwise try following the SideStore setup one more time.
You now have LiveContainer and SideStore installed and ready to use! Great job! Almost done!!
————————————————————————
3. Setting up auto-refresh that actually works ~ (Being bug fixed right now! Sorry)
One of the main caveats of using AltStore/SideStore is the 7-day limit, and the "auto-refresh" that they have, admittedly, barely ever works. Let's get an actually working daily auto-refresh going. This means we never have to worry about refreshing.
Step 1: Add this shortcut to your device by opening/sharing the link to it.
Step 2: In the main menu of the Shortcuts app, naviagte to the "Automations" tab then press the "+" in the top right corner.
Step 3: Choose the following automation settings:
Trigger: Time of Day
When: (Pick a time your phone will be on and connected to Wi-Fi)
Repeat: Daily
Run Immediately (If this is not checked, your app won't refresh!
Notify When Run: Off
Step 4: Tap "Create New Shortcut", search for the "Run Shortcut" action on the next screen and add it to your automation.
Step 5: Select the imported "Refresh Sidestore Apps" shortcut, then press the checkmark to save the automation.
You now have LiveContainer and SideStore set up! Apps will be refreshed every single day and you can install as many as you want with LiveContainer!
————————————————————————
4. Installing Apps
There are currently two ways to install apps to LiveContainer, direct .ipa installing, or installing using LC-DL, which supports repositories, downloading tweaks, and more!
Installing .ipa files:
On the main screen of LiveContainer, tap the "+" in the top-left corner. You will see two options, you can either install an .ipa file you have downloaded or install an .ipa file from a URL, from Github, catbox.moe, or something similar.
Using LC-DL
LC-DL is actually a tool made by me, the same person who wrote this guide! I know this seems like an ad but LC-DL is completely free and comes with a repository of apps and games to get you started.
For detailed information, including setup, usage, and more, please go here. I hope you enjoy it. :)
————————————————————————
🎉 Setup Complete! 🥳
Yay! You can now install apps in LiveContainer without any worry of revokes or refreshing! This is a great and free alternative to a signing service so you may as well keep it on your device in case something like this happens again!
If you have any questions or concerns, please leave a comment and I will get to you ASAP. I hope this guide helped you out!
Thank you for reading, seriously, this took a long time to write.
————————————————————————
¹Sideloadly does not prompt to revoke previous certificates before installing an app, this causes issues when refreshing SideStore after installation, please use AltServer if you can for now.

Now that I can access the SideStore app within LiveContainer, what should I do with the dedicated SideStore app? Should I delete it?
Also now I have 2 extra slots to play with rather than 1, how do I refresh my apps? I heard it auto does it within livecontainer?

Is there a refresh shortcut that works for iOS 17? The one you shared says the action can’t be found in this version of shortcuts and I need to update Shortcuts
I also have this problem
It looks like the latest action is "unknown", I edited the shortcut to solve the issue. I hope it's okay for me to share it here.
https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2323601e00304ff2a964092846439bb6
If you want to edit the shortcut yourself on iOS 17, add it with the link from the guide above and follow these steps:
open the shortcuts app and press the three dots (...) next to the Refresh Sidestore Apps shortcut.
scroll down to the unknown action and delete it.
now use the bottom search bar to search for "sidestore" it should come up with an action to refresh all apps.
Now test it with the play button on the bottom-right. For me the vpn was a bit janky at times but it's working now.
Sorry, something went wrong.

Development certificate or a pending certificate request. (7460). how to fix it? same to u
When I clicked on 7 days there was no refresh now only a screen asking for my login and password. After filling that out there was no App Contains Extensions popup nor any Keep App Extensions options.当我点击 7 天时，现在没有刷新，只有一个屏幕询问我的登录名和密码。填写完毕后，没有“应用程序包含扩展”弹出窗口，也没有任何“保留应用程序扩展”选项。 When attempting to Import Certificate from Sidestore I get, Error尝试从 Sidestore 导入证书时，我得到错误 Certificate not found. Did you log into built-in SideStore?找不到证书。您是否登录了内置的 SideStore？
I go back into sidestore settings and sign in then I get this,我返回边存设置并登录，然后我得到这个， Operation Failed  作失败 You already have a current ios您已经拥有当前的 ios Development certificate or a pending certificate request. (7460).开发证书或挂起的证书请求。(7460).

yeah turns out you can get a manual code, turn on airplane mode on your device, go to settings, click your account at the top and click sign in and security
you'll have the option to generate a code

So, I tried doing this method, but the new ipa gave me an error when trying to put it over the new. I installed it in SideStoreHere’s the error :
(1006) SideStore could not determine this device's UDID.
SideStore.OperationError 1006
This means that SideStore couldn't read the device UDID embedded by AltServer when installing SideStore. Make sure you're installing SideStore with the latest AltServer version and not via another method.
This seems to happen when you have SideStore installed both inside livecontainer and outside of it. Here are steps to specifically resolve this error code:
This guide assumes you have live container in SideStore as separate apps.
⁠Download SideStore+livecontainer.ipa
⁠Open SideStore, press the + and select the SideStore+livecontainer.ipa
⁠After the ipa installs, delete SideStore (outside of LC)
⁠Open livecontainer
⁠Open SideStore in livecontainer
⁠Go to my apps and press on “7 DAYS” beside SideStore
⁠Sign in to Apple ID, press yes when asked to revoke previous certificates, remove extensions (or use main profile), then press refresh now when each prompt appears
⁠Go to my apps in SideStore, long press SideStore, press remove.
Feel free to edit this (or not use this) as you please, posting here to help others who may experience this error as well though, as if you don’t delete SideStore outside of LC prior to setting it up you will result in could not determine UDID error when attempting to sign in when prompted

Yeah but you will still need to use idevice-pair to import the paring file for your device into SideStore

If you don’t keep a copy which I personally don’t see why anyone wouldn’t but can definitely see a majority that wouldn’t. However, like I had stated before feel free to edit/add on to it as you feel. It’s just that if someone already has SideStore added before following this, they HAVE to delete SideStore before setting up in livecontainer otherwise you get stuck behind an error which the only resolution is deleting the SideStore outside of LC and that’s all I was really getting at

You dont have to delete SideStore before setting up LiveContainer. I have installed it multiple times from AltServer and from SideStore itself on my own devices.
Also considering the guide on sidestore.io says to use idevice-pair to import the pairing file to your device, it makes sense to say that here, it’s the recommended way as idevice-pair will always sync a working pairing file while .mobiledevicepairing files may stop working if you accidentally generate a new one. It’s the most user friendly option.

Well how about this. This error message is CAUSED by having both sidestores and trying to setup the one in SideStore. You may not necessarily receive this error message, however if so, then this is the route need to be taken. There was no other way around this. I tried multiple times to no avail. It wasn’t until I deleted the one outside that I had success.

Everyone’s experience is different. Already having SideStore installed does not always cause this issue, I can say that confidently since I, myself used SideStore to install the SideStore+LiveContainer.ipa multiple times without failure.
Caps are not necessary and I am not going to edit my guide because of a specific issue that happens on a device to device/user to user basis, the guide works for a majority of people and is meant for people switching from signing services (meaning they likely never used SideStore before), if you already used SideStore/LiveContainer in the past then this should be easy to figure out.

So, I tried doing this method, but the new ipa gave me an error when trying to put it over the new. I installed it in SideStoreHere’s the error :
(1006) SideStore could not determine this device's UDID.
SideStore.OperationError 1006
This means that SideStore couldn't read the device UDID embedded by AltServer when installing SideStore. Make sure you're installing SideStore with the latest AltServer version and not via another method.
This seems to happen when you have SideStore installed both inside livecontainer and outside of it. Here are steps to specifically resolve this error code:
This guide assumes you have live container in SideStore as separate apps.
⁠Download SideStore+livecontainer.ipa
⁠Open SideStore, press the + and select the SideStore+livecontainer.ipa
⁠After the ipa installs, delete SideStore (outside of LC)
⁠Open livecontainer
⁠Open SideStore in livecontainer
⁠Go to my apps and press on “7 DAYS” beside SideStore
⁠Sign in to Apple ID, press yes when asked to revoke previous certificates, remove extensions (or use main profile), then press refresh now when each prompt appears
⁠Go to my apps in SideStore, long press SideStore, press remove.

Is there any way to do it without needing any additional App Store apps (StosVPN)?

No, what’s wrong with downloading StosVPN? It is a very light app that takes almost no space

Is this bug fixed?
@sinceohsix would it be possible to have a repo or something to subscribe to for updates on this shortcut specifically?
Daily auto-refresh would be a delight.

Is it possible for the app clip not to open LiveContainer everytime I open it? I.e., making it run like a normal app

LiveContainer App shortcut don't start (ios 17.5.1):
So the refresh sequence from step 3 won't execute.
However if i manually tap 'refresh all' in sidestore's MyApps tab - it works.
