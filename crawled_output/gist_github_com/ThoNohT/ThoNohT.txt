Cleaning haskell packages from pacman
Cleaning up haskell packages on Arch Linux
In Arch Linux, all haskell packages are dynamically linked. This can be a headache for the user, since it results in a large amount of haskell-* packages being installed on your system, and the possibility for version conflicts. A way around this is to not depend on pacman at all for haskell packages, but manually install them.
In this document I explain how I switched from a lot of haskell packages installed with pacman, to a few manually installed packages.
Finding packages to uninstall
To determine which packages to uninstall (and replace), a few tools are useful:
pacman itself
pacgraph

Assuming you use XMonad.Util.EZConfig to configure your key mappings, this code allows you to print those mappings in a nice format and let them be visualized in multiple ways.
Starting from the latest darcs template xmonad.hs, but the key map configuration already replaced with XMonad.Util.EZConfig, I need the following imports extra imports:
import Data.Foldable
import qualified Data.List as L
This is the code containing the types used for formatting the input, and the actual formatting code.
