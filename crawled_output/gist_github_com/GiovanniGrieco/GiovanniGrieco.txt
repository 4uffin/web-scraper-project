Setup Podman on LXC
Before you start, please NOTE: this guide does not cover rootless containers!
On an hypervisor with LXD installed, create a new container, ensuring that -c security.nesting=true -c security.privileged=true is set:
lxc launch -c security.nesting=true -c security.privileged=true images:fedora/35 my-container
If the container already exists, set this parameter through lxc config:
lxc config set my-container security.nesting=true
lxc config set my-container security.privileged=true

Install Podman on WSL2
Install Podman on Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2)
This guide allows a safe and rootless installation of Podman on WSL2.
Head over the hyperlinks to discover more about these two wonderful technologies!
This guide assumes that Debian 11 "bullseye" is installed as WSL2 base OS. To do it, simply open your Windows Powershell console under Admin rights and run
PS> wsl install -d Debian
After installation, please check that you are under the latest Debian. If not, please upgrade it.
