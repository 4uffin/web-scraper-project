Using KasmVNC as a vnc server (access the desktop via your browser)
Unprivileged LXC in Proxmox 7.4 (no extra features enabled, if you're using PVE 8 ignore this guide, there is an easier way via the gui)
Running Debian 12
AMD APU passthrough from host CPU (should also work with Intel and Nvidia, but haven't tested it)

Headless A2DP Audio Streaming on Raspbian Stretch with Python 3
About
This gist will show how to setup Raspbian Stretch as a headless Bluetooth A2DP audio sink. This will allow your phone, laptop or other Bluetooth device to play audio wirelessly through a Rasperry Pi.
Motivation
A quick search will turn up a plethora of tutorials on setting up A2DP on the Raspberry Pi. However, I felt this gist was necessary because this solution is:
Automatic & Headless - Once setup, the system is entirely automatic. No user iteration is required to pair, connect or start playback. Therefore the Raspberry Pi can be run headless.
Simple - This solution has few dependencies, readily available packages and minimal configuration.
