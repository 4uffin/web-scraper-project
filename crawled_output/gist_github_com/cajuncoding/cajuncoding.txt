/ FlurlDownloadAsAsyncEnumerableExtensions.cs
Last active
July 17, 2024 02:17
Flurl Extensions for Downloading Binary Data for easy Deferred streaming as AsyncEnumerable streams.
//WIP: This is an extension method for Flurl to download a Binary file direcctly into an AsyncEnumerable that that
//
can then be iterated with deferred execution for streaming binary data without downloading all data into Memory
OR
//
needing to store in an intermediate location.
//TODO:
// - Implement IAsyncEnumerable wrapper for the Stream Reading which can then be easily chunked via Linq just as it currently is...
// - This method may run a quick HTTP GET for headers Only to check and confirm existence, and then return an AsynEnumerable wrapper with an internal Delegate that creates the Stream
//
reads the bytes in buffer/chunk sizes until Zero bytes are read; this would occur inside the GetEnumerator() call...
// - Develop this as an Open Source (e.g. Gist) Flurl Extension method for Re-use and sharing!
// - Reference Flurl's DownloadFileAsync for getting a true Async stream (would happen in the Delegate when IAsyncEnumerable.GetEnumerator() is called...
