Setting Up Chromium and ChromeDriver for Browser Automation on Ubuntu
This guide explains how to properly set up Chromium and ChromeDriver on Ubuntu servers for browser automation tasks using tools like Selenium WebDriver.
The Problem with Ubuntu's Default Chromium Package
On Ubuntu (especially 20.04 and newer), the chromium-browser package in the default repositories is actually just a transitional package that redirects to the Snap version. This Snap-packaged version of Chromium runs in a confined environment with restricted filesystem access, which often causes permission issues when used with browser automation tools.
Common errors you might encounter with the Snap version include:
cannot create default profile directory

Logging vs Tracing vs Metrics
Logging vs Tracing vs Metrics
Logging, Tracing, Metrics
Logging, tracing, and metrics are 3 pillars of system observability.
Logging
Logging records discrete events in the system. For example, we can record an incoming request or a visit to databases as events. It has the highest volume. ELK (Elastic-Logstash-Kibana) stack is often used to build a log analysis platform. We often define a standardized logging format for different teams to implement, so that we can leverage keywords when searching among massive amounts of logs.

Command folder names to csv
You can run this command in a shell from the directory that you want to get the names of the folder into a csv.
find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "MA*" | sed 's|./||' > folder-names.csv
What this does is it looks for any directories ('-type d') within your current location ('.') that start with 'MA' ('-name "MA"')*. The '-maxdepth 1' part just means we're only looking at the top level, and not diving down into subdirectories.
Once those directories are found, we strip out the './' at the beginning of each folder name using 'sed', and then we put all of these names into a file called 'folder-names.csv'
