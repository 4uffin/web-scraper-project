Mass-validate all Steam games on Windows
########################################################################################################################
# Mass Steam Game Validator
#
# This script, meant to be used on Windows, validates whole Steam libraries. By default, Steam client can only do it
# one-by-one which is cumbersome in larger libraries. This tool uses the Valve's official steamCMD.
# The tool, by default, will attempt to validate all games in all libraries found, using the default account. Use -Help
# to see available options.
#
# To run this tool, save it as ".ps1" file, start Windows PowerShell/Windows Terminal, and type
# .\Validate-Steam-Games.ps1 in the console. You may need to enable PS scripts (https://superuser.com/a/106362) first.

1) enable listing of devices even if IOMMU is disabled
#
2) add support for NVMe & SAS block devices
#
3) display disks serial & firmware (if available)
#
4) QOL improvements: disabled paging by default; don't crash on missing lsusb
