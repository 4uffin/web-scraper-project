@Samk13 Search is not yet supported. As a temporary solution, I added this line in the config on my macOS:
keybind = "ctrl+f=write_scrollback_file:open"
Pressing Ctrl + F now opens up a textedit file containing the content of the current terminal's output, and you can Cmd + F to search in that file. Not elegant but a fine stopgap solution for me.

@qu8n, cool workaround! I later noticed the limitation too, and I'm currently using tmux to get by while the issue gets sorted out using Ctrl-b
[ / foo
b n. I‚Äôll give your method a try though. Appreciate you sharing it!

That doesn't work for me. I feel like I've tried many different key combinations and other terminal defaults.
I can not figure out how to close a split, or what to add to the configuration to do this.

Maybe not as nice of formatting, but you can also do it with this: ghostty +list-keybinds --default

@jorgeobnd the only thing I've achieved to do is to make it thick: adjust-cursor-thickness = 3
there is this option in settings: https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference#cursor-style
though, it did not work for me. probably I would need to configure fish for that

How to set a keyboard shortcut for activating the dropdown terminal on macOS, or what is the shortcut?
Nevermind, found it.
UPDATE
@rubywwwilde keybind = global:cmd+grave_accent=toggle_quick_terminal Add this to your config and then use the command plus tilde key combination to toggle the drop-down terminal. Here, the grave accent is the tilde key on the keyboard.
