OpenPGP SSH access with Yubikey and GnuPG
NB: This document describles a 'Old-School' way of using Yubikey with SSH
Modern OpenSSH has native support for FIDO Authentication. Its much simpler and should also be more stable with less moving parts. OpenSSH also now has support for signing arbitary files witch can be used as replacement of gnupg. Git also supports signing commits/tags with ssh keys.
Pros of FIDO
Simpler stack / less moving parts
Works directly with ssh, ssh-add and ssh-keygen on most computers
Simpler
Private key can never leave the FIDO device
Cons of FIDO
