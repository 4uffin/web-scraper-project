Parallel Soup
High Performance Library to parallelize BeautifulSoup
A library that wrappes BeautifulSoup to provide multi threaded scrapping, reducing the total time involved in the
scrapping process. The library should implement the following affectively: (this list can be extended in future)
Parallelization
Should have a generic interface that maps to beautiful soup
All parts of the library should be documented heavily
All parts of the library should have unit tests written for verification of their functionality
Showcase written examples for different sorts of scrapping

Changes in Mitra v0.0.4
List of changes in Mitra v0.0.4
Bug Fix:
Setting screen app info should retrive info from package details
Edit profile relationship status being shown in occupation
Enhancement:
Remove bottom tab navigation and modify top drawer navigation to show only a back button on content screen
(will provide more space for content display)
Hide the detailed profile content and age should be just month and year
List selectors such as for theme, age, etc should be easier (Use modals for selection)
