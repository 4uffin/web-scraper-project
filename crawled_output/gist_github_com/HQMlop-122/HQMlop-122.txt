What is Hollow Knight Silksong?
Hollow Knight Silksong is the highly anticipated sequel to the award-winning indie game Hollow Knight. Developed by Team Cherry, the game follows Hornet, a skilled and agile warrior, as she journeys through a vast new kingdom filled with mysteries, enemies, and treasures.

In 2025, many fans are excited about possible Mobile adaptations, including versions optimized for Android, making the experience more accessible to players worldwide.
