Rename the licenserar.cmd script with the config below:
SHANLEY_Single User License_licenserar.cmd
Update:
In version 0.12.0 you can now use just your name to license WinRAR:
SHANLEY_licenserar.cmd

@Sait0Hiraga There isn't any video guide on how to configure the script, but I'll surely create and upload one on YouTube. Thanks for the suggestion.
For now you can look at the instructions in the configuration and naming patterns sections of the documentation to get a clearer understanding.

Use installrar.cmd to stay up to date.
Or you can run this code in a powershell terminal to quickly update to the latest WinRAR version.
irm "https://dub.sh/installrar" | iex
Upon lauching the script I get a dialog with "Please remove DXG|Debug.dll, it is unsecure to run...." But I don't find the file. Where do I have to look for it ?

There shouldn't be any error like this...
DXG|Debug.dll isn't a standard Windows library so I'm not sure what this is. Maybe a DirectX graphical error?
Download the script from the repo and run it directly. See if there's any difference.

The previous download was also from the repo. Did it again and still getting the dialog stating to remove DXG|debug.dll followad by some chinese letters.

Why do you need to download a script when the key still works fine?

I ran some tests on Windows 10 in a VM and it works fine.
I'm unable replicate this kind of error.
Btw, are you running some custom version of Windows 10 or is that just a software skin?

It's Stardock's Windowsblind and one skin as I'm blinded by white backgrounds due to a bad glaucoma so my OS is in black mode and I have to skin parts of the UI still microsoft hardcoded.
Besides this, it's standard win10 with some startup software :
Pop-mouse, a win xp old mouse launcher (https://carltonbale.com/tag/pointix-popmouse/) I've used it since xp. Too bad there isn't one more modern.
SRS audio sandbox, audio surround compressor.
Reverso dictionnary/tranlation.
the old yahoo widgets manager.
Internet download manager
Glasswire network security
Asus Xonar DX sound app
Rainmeter weather
Hard disk sentinel
Ditto
Codesector Direct Folders
And last one skin with the old Samurize.
I'll try to deactivate all for a clean bare startup to see where it leads to.
EDIT : I disabled startup software with no luck. Still getting the dialog.
What does mean chinese letters/symbols in it ?

There seems to be an issue with the character encoding in the error where the referenced characters are outside what can be displayed by your system's language settings. You can download the Everything utility to scan for this DXGIDebug.dll file if it's present on your system.

That was my 1st move. Unfortunately, nor the folder or the file shows up as the query result.

One thing tho; I used licencerar.cmd to generate a licence : it did worked WITHOUT any error/dialog, so it seems to be only related to oneclickrar.cmd.

What does mean chinese letters/symbols in it ?
There seems to be an issue with the character encoding in the error where the referenced characters are outside what can be displayed by your system's language settings. You can download the Everything utility to scan for this DXGIDebug.dll file if it's present on your system.
That was my 1st move. Unfortunately, nor the folder or the file shows up as the query result. I'm puzzled !
One thing tho; I used licencerar.cmd to generate a licence : it did worked WITHOUT any error/dialog, so it seems to be only related to oneclickrar.cmd.
A bit of update here.
Win7 => (ran as admin) opening windows and fast closing. No update.
Win11 => (ran without elevated rights) opening windows, closed & reopened as admin automatically. Success => updated.
Sorry, something went wrong.

Thank you so much! I tried some of what others wrote and most either no longer exist or just don't work. So i followed what you wrote with your step by step very easy directions to follow and they worked perfectly!!! My winrar no longer says evaluation copy! I had an older copy and not thinking computer asked me to update my old winrar so i did not realizing i would lose my old winrar that had a free key. I'm so thankful brilliant people like you are around helping us. I don't have the money to pay for a winrar licence. I just wanted to say Thank you! for the good that you do! Take care!

Upon lauching the script I get a dialog with "Please remove DXG|Debug.dll, it is unsecure to run...." But I don't find the file. Where do I have to lool for it ?
There shouldn't be any error like this... DXG|Debug.dll isn't a standard Windows library so I'm not sure what this is. Maybe a DirectX graphical error?
Download the script from the repo and run it directly. See if there's any difference.
The previous download was also from the repo. Did it again and still getting the dialog stating to remove DXG|debug.dll followad by some chinese letters. Running tweaked file : idoru_Unlimited Lifetime License_oneclickrar_x64_712_fr Win10 22h2 updated. All drivers updated.
I ran some tests on Windows 10 in a VM and it works fine.
I'm unable replicate this kind of error.
Btw, are you running some custom version of Windows 10 or is that just a software skin?
It's Stardock's Windowsblind and one skin as I'm blinded by white backgrounds due to a bad glaucoma so my OS is in black mode and I have to skin parts of the UI still microsoft hardcoded. Besides this, it's standard win10 with some startup software :
Pop-mouse, a win xp old mouse launcher (https://carltonbale.com/tag/pointix-popmouse/) I've used it since xp. Too bad there isn't one more modern.
SRS audio sandbox, audio surround compressor.
Reverso dictionnary/tranlation.
the old yahoo widgets manager.
Internet download manager
Glasswire network security
Asus Xonar DX sound app
Rainmeter weather
Hard disk sentinel
Ditto
Codesector Direct Folders
And last one skin with the old Samurize.
I'll try to deactivate all for a clean bare startup to see where it leads to.
EDIT : I disabled startup software with no luck. Still getting the dialog.

Issue with Windows 7 is likely due to the difference in the versions of PowerShell installed on the system compared to Windows 10/11.

Winrar 85% off https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lBsg2 Winzip bro, they have now 60% off https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101lBsgr
Official subreddit for any question https://www.reddit.com/r/winRAR/ for free downloads
Every time I've needed a Windows 10 Enterprise Ltsc key, they've come through for me. Their prices are reasonable, and the best part is their support team. When I had some issues activating my Windows 11 Pro, their support was super helpful and patient. They walked me through the entire process until everything was working perfectly.
Seriously, if you're looking for a reliable place to get your Windows key, I highly recommend checking them out.
Thanks for recommendation bro, this works
