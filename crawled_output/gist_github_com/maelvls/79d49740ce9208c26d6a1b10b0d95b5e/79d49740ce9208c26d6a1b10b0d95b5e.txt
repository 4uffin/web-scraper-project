README.md
Dealing with secrets
GNOME comes with libsecret. You can use libsecret to store your git credentials:
sudo apt install libsecret-1-0 libsecret-1-dev libglib2.0-dev
sudo make --directory=/usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret
git config --global credential.helper /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret/git-credential-libsecret
Then, create a personal access token on github/gitlab. Remember that the username does not matter when using a PAT: you can just use foo as username.
To list the secrets stored, you can use lssecret:
git clone https://github.com/gileshuang/lssecret /tmp/lssecret
cd /tmp/lssecret
make && DESTDIR=/usr/local sudo make install
% lssecret

Thanks, but I think you forgot to add gcc to the list of installed packages.
When following the instructions on Ubuntu Desktop 20.04, I get the following error:
make: Entering directory '/usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret'
gcc -g -O2 -Wall
-pthread -I/usr/include/libsecret-1 -I/usr/include/libmount -I/usr/include/blkid -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/glib-2.0/include -o git-credential-libsecret.o -c git-credential-libsecret.c
make: gcc: Command not found
make: *** [Makefile:19: git-credential-libsecret.o] Error 127
make: Leaving directory '/usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret'
Sorry, something went wrong.
Uh oh!

Also build-essential need to be added.

Need to add make build-essential to the apt list.
It's bewildering that Ubuntu doesn't build this binary.
Sorry, something went wrong.
