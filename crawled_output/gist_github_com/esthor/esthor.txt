Custom cursor command to run CodeRabbit code review via the CodeRabbit CLI
For expert code review, we will use CodeRabbit's CLI.
To do that, run coderabbit --prompt-only and wait.
Keep in mind that this will trigger a fairly long-running and thorough code review. So you will need to wait a while for the review. Once it does return to you, you will likely have multiple issues to address. Complete those and submit changes for review again.
Run this loop (fix issues CodeRabbit found -> CodeRabbit review) until CodeRabbit is satisfied. You will know when CodeRabbit is satisfied because it will end with something like "Review completed âœ”" and not have any tasks or issues for you to address.
Note: Try using the coderabbit command first, but if the coderabbit comand is not available, ask the user if they want you to install it. If the user wants to proceed, proceed with executing this command and prompt the user to manually go through the secure authorization steps: curl -fsSL https://cli.coderabbit.ai/install.sh | sh

/ prototype in javascript
Created

NOTES:
# Intro
We're going to be talking about Prototypes in JavaScript.
This is a fundamental concept to understand the language, and I promise will bring you enlightenment once you understand it.
That said, this is not something that I expect you to just get right away. Honestly, it's kind of weird at first.
