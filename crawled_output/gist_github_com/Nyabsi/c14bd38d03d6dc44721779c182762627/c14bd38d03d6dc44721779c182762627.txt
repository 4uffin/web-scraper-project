Custom Environment Guide
This guide is meant to serve as an basis for custom environment creation on the Pico OS, it will requires basic knowledge of Unity, Git and command-line
Known Limitations
C# Scripting is not possible
Unity Audio Components do not work
Prerequisites
Please install the required prerequisites before proceeding further in the Guide without them you cannot create custom environments
Unity Hub
Unity 2021.3.5f1
Android Studio
Git
Installing Templates
Template below is provided AS-IS to help with the creation of environments because creating an environment from scratch is time consuming and technically complicated process
Pico Environment Application Template
You can clone the repository with git using the following command
git clone https://github.com/Nyabsi/pico-environment-app-template.git
Configuring Application Template
First, we have to rename the environment, since we don't want to have multiple environments with the same name
Locate app/build.gradle.kts and change applicationId according to example below
defaultConfig {
applicationId = "com.pvr.MyFunEnvironment.scene" // CustomEnvironment -> MyFunEnvironment
/* ... */
}
Next Locate app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml where we need to change few values
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
<!--
SceneName_CustomEnvironment to SceneName_MyFunEnvironment
Custom Environment to "My Fun Environment"
-->
<string name="SceneName_MyFunEnvironment">My Fun Environment</string>
<!-- CustomEnvironment to MyFunEnvironment -->
<string name="linkedPackageName">com.pvr.MyFunEnvironment</string>
<string name="linkedUnlockKey" />
<string name="linkedVersionIdentification" />
<!-- CustomEnvironment to MyFunEnvironment -->
<string name="sceneTag">MyFunEnvironment</string>
</resources>
Next inside app/src/main/assets you will find two folders
scene
thumbs
inside these folders you will find a folder called CustomEnvironment rename these in the following format
app/src/main/assets/scene/CustomEnvironment -> app/src/main/assets/scene/MyFunEnvironment
app/src/main/assets/thumbs/CustomEnvironment -> app/src/main/assets/thumbs/MyFunEnvironment
Now we have configured the basic environment for your brand new custon environment, we can continue to the next step
Configuring Unity Project
Create a new "Universal 3D" project in Unity Hub, make sure "2021.3.5f1" is selected as the version
If you encounter the following error, just press "Retry"
Once the project is loaded, download "PICO Unity OpenXR SDK" from https://developer.picoxr.com/resources/
You can unpack the zip to anywhere and then install it to the project through Unity Editor
Window -> Package Manager -> "+" -> Add package from disk
now that we have Universal Rendering Pipeline project with the PICO Unity OpenXR SDK you can download the premade template (environment_template.unitypackage) from https://github.com/Nyabsi/pico-environment-unity-template/releases
once you have downloaded environment_template.unitypackage import it to the Unity Project you created
then you can navigate to Environment/Scene.unity and modify it, once it has been modified you can proceed to the next step
Additional note:
You should remove the reference Main Camera in the Scene, it is not used, the Pico always spawns at (0, 0, 0) rotated -180 in Y-axis
Building Unity Scene
Make sure folder "AssetBundles" exists in the Assets folder root if not, create it
Navigate Assets -> Build AssetBundles(s) in the Unity Editor
check the "AssetBundles" folder, it should have file called gamebundle
copy that file to app/src/main/assets/scene/[Name] and rename the file to Scene_[Name]_1_1.unity3d
you should delete the default .unity3d file which serves as example for naming
Packaging The Environment
Theme thumbnail
You also should replace the Scene_[Name]_1_1.png in app/src/main/assets/thumbs/[Name] with image sized 960x800 saved as png to change the theme thumbnail
Theme background audio
ImportantTheme background audio only works on PicoOS >=5.13.3 and has been only tested on Pico 4 Ultra
Copy file with the specific naming sceme of [Name](1min)xxx.wav to app/src/main/assets/audio/[Name] and the audio should work.
now that you have configured the app and transferred the newly built unity3d bundle we can theme with gradle
./gradlew assembleDebug
once gradle is done building the theme, you should be able to find the built apk from app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
Installing The Environment
There is two methods of installation, usage of PicoThemeManager is heavily recommended.
Automatic Method (Recommended)
Install PicoThemeManager onto your device.
PicoThemeManager requires permission "android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS" otherwise it will crash
Grant "android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS" to PicoThemeManager:
adb shell pm grant cc.sovellus.picothememanager android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
Now you can install the built apk from app/build/outputs/apk/debug/ by executing the following command
adb install -r app-debug.apk
Manual Method
You can install the built apk in app/build/outputs/apk/debug/ by executing the following command
adb install -r app-debug.apk
You can change the current environment by settings these system settings with adb
adb shell settings put global SceneManager.CurPackage com.pvr.[Name].scene
adb shell settings put global SceneManager.CurrentScene [Name]
adb shell settings put global current_scene /assets/scene/[Name]/Scene_[Name]_1_1.unity3d
You need to restart the shell to be able to see new the environment
adb shell am start -S -n "com.pvr.vrshell/com.pvr.vrshell.MainActivity"
Now you should be able to see your brand new environment
