AP style month abbreviations with strftime in Liquid
AP style month abbreviations with strftime in Liquid
AP style is particular about how dates are formatted in various circumstances. strftime uses %b for month abbreviations, but its format (the first three letters of the month: Jan, Feb, etc) differs from AP style’s preferred abbreviations for some months.

// Unitless negative integer
$scale-max: 2;
// Unitless positive integer
