Using encrypted 7z archives (Ubuntu, zip, 7zip)
Using 7zip to create encrypted archives
Let's use 7zip for strong AES256 encrypted archives with a password. The guide assumes you're on Ubuntu 22 or newer. Note: this creates .7z archives, which is not the same as the regular .zip!
# Install 7zip. Note: don't install "p7zip-full" or "p7zip" (it's an older version!)
# Source, version things: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1465853/difference-between-several-command-line-tools-provided-for-7-zip-compression-li

Asyncio error antipattern
An antipattern in python asyncio error handling
Don't do this:
The try catch will catch any instance of SomeError, even if it's not emitted inside my_async_function.
This happens if my_async_function runs for long enough so that SomeError is emitted elsewhere in the
program, while this piece of code is still inside the try-except.

Pixel aspect ratios - a potential issue in object detection?
Pixel aspect ratios - a potential issue in object detection?
Updated: Jan 25, 2021
Quick write-up about pixel aspect ratios in video files, and how they might affect performance in an object detection pipeline. I found very little good information about this online, so I decided to write this to summarize my findings.
