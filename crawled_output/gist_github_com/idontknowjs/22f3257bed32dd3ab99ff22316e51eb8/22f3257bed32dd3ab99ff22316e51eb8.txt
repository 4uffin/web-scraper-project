I'm Indian but I've been in Ireland for the last 4 years. This post is highly accurate.
I recently concluded my new role hunt. I received offers from Salesforce, VMware, Bolt, Personio, Klarna, Arm, Microsoft, Skyscanner, Tiqets, Booking.com, Toast, Etsy & Spotify for mid-level to senior engineering roles within Ireland & EU. All of them hire internationally and provide relocation and visa support.
To be honest, relocation is a secondary factor (for anything above graduate roles) for most companies these days, as long as you are doing well in the interviews.
For companies that don't provide relocation support within EU(for direct hire from India) as far as I am aware: Qualtrics, Workday, Hubspot, Github, Revolut

Not aware of any.

Tried applying with a referral. Got better response on Blind app than via LinkedIn to get referrals. Otherwise applied directly on the career portal.
Made LinkedIn alerts for specific companies, to get notified about openings.
Reaching out to hiring managers/recruiters directly might also help.
