AI Summary of Nociplastic pain: towards an understanding of prevalent pain conditions
The document titled "Nociplastic pain: towards an understanding of prevalent pain conditions" is a comprehensive review published in The Lancet (2021) that introduces and elaborates on the concept of nociplastic pain, a third mechanistic category of chronic pain distinct from nociceptive and neuropathic pain.
üîç Summary of Key Points:
1. Definition and Concept
Nociplastic pain is caused by altered nociceptive function without clear tissue damage or nerve injury.
It is typically associated with central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, including amplified sensory processing, altered pain modulation, and non-pain symptoms like fatigue, poor sleep, mood disturbances, and memory issues.
2. Examples of Nociplastic Pain Conditions

Call of Cthulhu character : Sal Caruso
Salvatore "Sal" Caruso is a newspaper reporter in the middle of his career. He's worked at the Arkham Advertiser for 9 years and occupies a solid middle rung in the newsroom hierarchy. He started at the Advertiser after the war. He had been in the Signal Corps stationed in Libya early in the North Africa campaign, then transferred to Naples in '43 handling field transmissions during the liberation and finally slogged his way north into the Po Valley in Northern Italy until the end of the war in '45 where he saw just enough action to never romanticize it. The war didn't break him, but it aged him. He came back thinner and quieter.
His thick floppy black hair, impossible to fully tame, tends to fall into his eyes when he's leaning over his notepad. He prefers to wear a dark wool suit jacket, single breasted, with a narrow lapel over a white dress shirt with a skinny black tie and pleated high-waisted slacks with suspenders rather than a belt, an old-fashioned touch he never quite let go of. He wears well-polis
