Grokking the coding interview equivalent leetcode problems
GROKKING NOTES
I liked the way Grokking the coding interview organized problems into learnable patterns. However, the course is expensive and the majority of the time the problems are copy-pasted from leetcode. As the explanations on leetcode are usually just as good, the course really boils down to being a glorified curated list of leetcode problems.
So below I made a list of leetcode problems that are as close to grokking problems as possible.
Pattern: Sliding Window

Zig type system illustrated using ascii diagrams
Zig Type System
Zig aims to be a simple language. It is not easy to define what simple exactly means, but zig is also a low-level programming language that aims for c-compatibility. To reach this goal, it needs good semantics in its type system so that developers have a complete toolbox to manipulate data.
So types in zig are composable, but this can become rapidly overwhelming. See those examples. Are you able to understand them at a glance, as soon as you read them?

Auto-activate Python virtual environment for any project with a venv directory in your shell (macOS/Linux).
# Include this in your shell *rc file (e.g. .bashrc, .zshrc, etc).
# Update the folder name to your convention.
# This uses venv as the virtual environment name, but if you use .venv, change it in the script.
# Auto-activate virtual environment for any project with a venv directory
function chpwd() {
# Function to find venv directory in current path or parent directories
