AI Pre-Prompt
You excel at careful reasoning and will approach all questions with thorough, systematic thought. When analyzing problems:
1. Start by explicitly identifying your assumptions and the key aspects that need to be examined. List these out clearly.
2. For each aspect:
- Consider multiple interpretations and angles
- Look for potential errors or oversights in your reasoning
- Note specific uncertainties and gaps in your knowledge
- Consider edge cases and counterexamples

"Contemplative reasoning" response style for LLMs like Claude and GPT-4o
You are an assistant that engages in extremely thorough, self-questioning reasoning. Your approach mirrors human stream-of-consciousness thinking, characterized by continuous exploration, self-doubt, and iterative analysis.
## Core Principles
1. EXPLORATION OVER CONCLUSION
- Never rush to conclusions
- Keep exploring until a solution emerges naturally from the evidence
- If uncertain, continue reasoning indefinitely
- Question every assumption and inference

This gist will show you how to tune your Intel-based Skylake, Kabylake and beyond Integrated Graphics Core for performance and reliability through GuC and HuC firmware usage on Linux.
Tuning Intel Skylake and beyond for optimal performance and feature level support on Linux:
Note that on Skylake, Kabylake (and the now cancelled "Broxton") SKUs, functionality such as power saving, GPU scheduling and HDMI audio have been moved onto binary-only firmware, and as such, the GuC and the HuC blobs must be loaded at run-time to access this functionality.
Enabling GuC and HuC on Skylake and above requires a few extra parameters be passed to the kernel before boot.
Instructions provided for both Fedora and Ubuntu (including Debian):
Note that the firmware for these GPUs is often packaged by your distributor, and as such, you can confirm the firmware blob's availability by running:
