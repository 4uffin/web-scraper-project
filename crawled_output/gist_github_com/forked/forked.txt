Fix Apple’s broken 10.9.0-10.9.2 default Ruby gems installation.
On Mac OS X 10.9.0 through 10.9.2, Apple shipped a Ruby and RubyGems installation that was missing specifications for the libraries that are included with Ruby by default, which leads to the user having to install a gem like the JSON gem even though the user already has that library installed.
(This is even more problematic if you want users to be able to install gems without having to have a properly configured compiler toolchain. I.e. where you do not want users to have to install gems with C extensions, such as the JSON gem.)
This was fixed starting from Mac OS X 10.9.3.
What it should look like
The following libraries are installed by default and should have their specifications installed:

Download MSVC compiler/linker & Windows SDK without installing full Visual Studio
This downloads standalone MSVC compiler, linker & other tools, also headers/libraries from Windows SDK into portable folder, without installing Visual Studio. Has bare minimum components - no UWP/Store/WindowsRT stuff, just files & tools for native desktop app development.
Run py.exe portable-msvc.py and it will download output into msvc folder. By default it will download latest available MSVC & Windows SDK - currently v14.40.33807 and v10.0.26100.0.
You can list available versions with py.exe portable-msvc.py --show-versions and then pass versions you want with --msvc-version and --sdk-version arguments.
To use cl.exe/link.exe first run setup_TARGET.bat - after that PATH/INCLUDE/LIB env variables will be updated to use all the tools as usual. You can also use clang-cl.exe with these includes & libraries.
To use clang-cl.exe without running setup.bat, pass extra /winsysroot msvc argument (msvc is folder name where output is stored).
