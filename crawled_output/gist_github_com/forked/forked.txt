Q: If the submission was accepted it is not considered late?
A:
Please stop asking us if it’s late, and explaining to us how the internet works... The reason there’s a buffer is so we don’t get all of these posts and emails explaining how you submitted it on time but, man oh man, my internet was really slow just tonight and etc etc etc which for some reason always seems to happen the night an assignment is due.

A product idea is something that you want to explore further --- you have some information but not all of it. This template provides questions to help get Product Managers focused and help them dive into the idea. It serves as a guide as PMs decide whether or not to pursue the opportunity and draft a Product Opportunity for their team.
Product Idea Template
The purpose of filling out this template is to set up a plan for further exploration. The questions are designed to help determine where to investigate further, and to encourage discussion with the team. This template is intentionally lightweight, can be used to quickly give ideas structure, and record ideas so they don't get lost. Product idea docs can be closed/archived and re-opened/unarchived later. They are not to be prioritized, rather product idea docs serve as a 'bulletin board' for ideas that come from other product opportunities, customer conversations, market research,

There's a lot of recommended reading for product managers out there. Some of it is incredibly useful, and some of it is a waste of time. Business books don't really get me excited, but there are a few books, articles, newsletters, and podcasts authored by folks I look up to in the industry that I find myself coming back to often. When you're reading about product management, it's important to take everything with a grain of salt. The industry changes rapidly, and so does the discipline. If you learn something you want to try out from one of these books, go for it! But be careful not to whiplash yourself or your team.
I find new books and articles all the time, so I'm going to start dropping them here. Hope they help and inspire some other Product folks!

Criando um deploy automatizado com GitHub Actions, AWS e Docker
Criando um deploy automatizado com GitHub Actions, AWS e Docker
AWS IAM
Introdução
O IAM faz o gerenciamento da parte de identificação e acesso aos serviços da AWS. Para o correto funcionamento de todas as funcionalidades do deploy, vamos criar duas funções do IAM, uma para o CodeDeploy acessar o EC2, e outra para o EC2 utilizar o SSM (que concede acesso ao System Manager) e possibilitar a comunicação com o CodeDeploy. Pot último, vamos criar um usuário do IAM, para o GitHub acessar posteriormente o CodeDeploy.
Função para o CodeDeploy
