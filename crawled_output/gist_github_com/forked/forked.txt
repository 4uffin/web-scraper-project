— forked from jjmu15/in_viewport.js
check if element is in viewport - vanilla JS. Use by adding a “scroll” event listener to the window and then calling isInViewport().
// Determine if an element is in the visible viewport
function isInViewport(element) {
var rect = element.getBoundingClientRect();
var html = document.documentElement;
return (
rect.top >= 0 &&
rect.left >= 0 &&
rect.bottom <= (window.innerHeight || html.clientHeight) &&
rect.right <= (window.innerWidth || html.clientWidth)
);

Bitcoin UTXO and Transaction Implementation for Blockchain 'javascript'
Bitcoin UTXO and Transaction Implementation in JavaScript
Overview
Implementation of UTXO management and transaction handling in JavaScript, demonstrating core blockchain mechanics such as double-spending prevention and fee calculation.
In this project, I implement two classes: TXO and Transaction, to demonstrate how UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) are managed in a blockchain system.
UTXOs are fundamental to the Bitcoin model (as Account Model is to Ethereum), ensuring the prevention of double-spending and maintaining the integrity of transactions.
Project Features
TXO Class: Represents a single transaction output, storing ownership, value, and whether it has been spent.

Binary Search Tree Implementation in JavaScript
Binary Search Tree Implementation
This gist provides an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in JavaScript. It includes a Node class to represent individual nodes of the tree and a Tree class to manage and operate on the binary search tree.
Node Class
The Node class is used to create elements for the binary search tree. Each node has the following properties:
data: The value of the node.
left: A reference to the left child node (initially null).
