Nushell Get Words with Suffix from a list
Purpose
I had a need to get words (four characters) that have a suffix from a list.
This was to help someone in the second grade with the words.
I used the unixdict.txt to get the words.

Think twice about Wayland. It breaks everything!
Think twice before abandoning X11. Wayland breaks everything!
Wayland breaks everything! It is binary incompatible, provides no clear transition path with 1:1 replacements for everything in X11, and is even philosophically incompatible with X11. Hence, if you are interested in existing applications to "just work" without the need for adjustments, then you may be better off avoiding Wayland.
Wayland solves no issues I have but breaks almost everything I need. Even the most basic, most simple things (like xkill) - in this case with no obvious replacement. And usually it stays broken, because the Wayland folks mostly seem to care about Automotive, Gnome, maybe KDE - and alienating everyone else (e.g., people using just an X11 window manager or something like GNUstep) in the process.
