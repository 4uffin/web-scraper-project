Conventional Commit Messages
See how a minor change to your commit message style can make a difference.
git commit -m"<type>(<optional scope>): <description>" \
-m"<optional body>" \
-m"<optional footer>"
NoteThis cheatsheet is opinionated, however it does not violate the specification of conventional commits
TipTake a look at git-conventional-commits ; a CLI util to ensure these conventions, determine version and generate changelogs.
Commit Message Formats
General Commit
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>
empty line as separator
<optional body>
empty line as separator
<optional footer>
Initial Commit
chore: init
Merge Commit
Merge branch '<branch name>'
Follows default git merge message
Revert Commit
Revert "<reverted commit subject line>"
Follows default git revert message
Types
Changes relevant to the API or UI:
feat Commits that add, adjust or remove a new feature to the API or UI
fix Commits that fix an API or UI bug of a preceded feat commit
refactor Commits that rewrite or restructure code without altering API or UI behavior
perf Commits are special type of refactor commits that specifically improve performance
style Commits that address code style (e.g., white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons) and do not affect application behavior
test Commits that add missing tests or correct existing ones
docs Commits that exclusively affect documentation
build Commits that affect build-related components such as build tools, dependencies, project version, CI/CD pipelines, ...
ops Commits that affect operational components like infrastructure, deployment, backup, recovery procedures, ...
chore Miscellaneous commits e.g. modifying .gitignore, ...
Scopes
The scope provides additional contextual information.
The scope is an optional part
Allowed scopes vary and are typically defined by the specific project
Do not use issue identifiers as scopes
Breaking Changes Indicator
A commit that introduce breaking changes must be indicated by an ! before the : in the subject line e.g. feat(api)!: remove status endpoint
Breaking changes should be described in the commit footer section, if the commit description isn't sufficiently informative
Description
The description contains a concise description of the change.
The description is a mandatory part
Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
Think of This commit will... or This commit should...
Do not capitalize the first letter
Do not end the description with a period (.)
I case of breaking changes also see breaking changes indicator
Body
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.
The body is an optional part
Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
Footer
The footer should contain issue references and informations about Breaking Changes
The footer is an optional part, except if the commit introduce breaking changes
Optionally reference issue identifiers (e.g., Closes #123, Fixes JIRA-456)
Breaking Changes must start with the word BREAKING CHANGE:
For a single line description just add a space after BREAKING CHANGE:
For a multi line description add two new lines after BREAKING CHANGE:
Versioning
If your next release contains commit with...
Breaking Changes incremented the major version
API relevant changes (feat or fix) incremented the minor version
Else increment the patch version
Examples
feat: add email notifications on new direct messages
feat(shopping cart): add the amazing button
feat!: remove ticket list endpoint
refers to JIRA-1337
BREAKING CHANGE: ticket endpoints no longer supports list all entities.
fix(shopping-cart): prevent order an empty shopping cart
fix(api): fix wrong calculation of request body checksum
fix: add missing parameter to service call
The error occurred due to <reasons>.
perf: decrease memory footprint for determine unique visitors by using HyperLogLog
build: update dependencies
build(release): bump version to 1.0.0
refactor: implement fibonacci number calculation as recursion
style: remove empty line

What type should be used when we've updated our app's repository to incorporate changes from the upstream repository on which our app is based?
I've named the commit like this:
chore: sync codebase with upstream repository changes

@hacker-hackman thats a tricky one. If its a merge just keep it a merge commit. If it is a commit without history, then it depends what the changes are, in other words could be any commit type. chore is probably not a good fit because it gives the impression of an safe commit without the risk of breaking changes or new features.

In this specific case, it was indeed a low-risk sync with the upstream repository, containing only formatting and type checking changes. Thanks for the insight!

@GabenGar again I would highly recommend to NOT use chore for syncs from repository external sources. It should reflect what has been synched especially if you sync feat or fix commits. If you do a regular merge, within the sam repo and history chore would be okay, however I would stick with the default merge message.

In the Breaking Changes Indicator section it says that breaking changes MUST be described in the commit footer section. Is this correct?
My understanding is that the footer entry is optional.
The Conventional Commits spec items 11 and 12 says (I have highlighted and capitalised a few words):
Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, OR as an entry in the footer.
IF INCLUDED AS A FOOTER, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files.
Do I misunderstand?

After some thinking about the breaking changes indicator I changed it to mandatory (must) and the footer is optional (should) if the commit description is sufficient tu understand the breaking change. I don't agree on the conventional commit specs in that case. Because
if you scroll through your commit you probably only see the the first line of the commit message therefore you easily miss a breaking change. To avoid this it's best practice to always add the ! as breaking change indicator.

Hi @qoomon,
I don't agree on the conventional commit specs in that case.
Sure, and helps clarify what the intent of this document is. I like it, it has some good ideas but it reads as a Conventional Commits cheatsheet. I think the intent is to describe a specific approach based on Conventional Commits (CC). Or, maybe it is a spec for the pre-commit hook (nice btw). A newbie reading this now will be confused or misled as to what the standard is.
e.g. While CC specs feat and fix, it does not spec the compliant build. These come from industry practices and complimentary standards (as I think you give a link to).
I think it would help the reader if variations to the Conventional Commits (CC) spec (like making an optional bit mandatory) are highlighted with reasoning. Deviations, if any, are important as if your using CC for automatic versioning (e.g. my Git2SemVer) or automated changelog generation you need to know what may not work with other tools.
But as for the breaking change visibility ... i get your reasoning but (for me) it is not so important as I use CC as a semantic versioning tool:
I expect the versioning tool to see a breaking change indication and bump the MAJOR version automatically. That is very visible and the objective.
I expect a changelog generator to pick and highlight the breaking change in the changelog automatically (the version bump already highlights it).
A breaking change is never the intent of a change but a side effect. Describing the change is most important.
BTW: Multiple version number incremtns without a realse might not be valid Semantic Versioning as you do not mention releases. See Version Incrementing.
Like what your doing. Let me know if I have anything not quite right.
Sorry, something went wrong.

IMHO it is still a cheatsheet for best practice of how to use the conventional commits specs, because there is nothing described in this cheatsheet that conflicts with the specs. I case of breaking changes it just narrow down what is best practice.
e.g. While CC specs feat and fix, it does not spec the compliant build. These come from industry practices and complimentary standards (as I think you give a link to).
Same applies here, it does not violate the specs it extend them.
Multiple version number incremtns without a realse might
I don't think that this would violate semantic versioning specs.

and, when we're removing something like remove pages, remove unused functions, replace a plugin with another one. We use feat for that right? I've been using chore this whole time. I interpret it as the wildcard type.

IMO
remove unused functions - refactor as no change in functionality but improves code structure. The purpose is to improve code maintainability. But ... if those functions are part of the puplic API it is a breaking change and not refactoring.
replace a plugin - chore (if that is a dependency) and no change in functionality to last release.
remove pages - If it is removing functionality, that a breaking change (even if few affected) that people ought to know about - e.g: 3.0.0?
"refactor" If the page is no longer accessible to anybody is refactor.
FYI - "refactor" is good to use as it flags to reviewers that the PR has NO functional changes. So the reviewer can focus on looking for any functional change and judge if the code structure is improved. Hint - as recommended by Conventional Commits never mix commit types in asingle commit it just makes life hard and has poor outcomes.
May help too, similar but may help: https://cheatsheets.zip/conventional-commits

What would you say about capitalizing after a stop in one line? It bothers me a lot to not capitalize the first word but then do it for the second stop. But it also bothers me to not capitalize after a stop 😂
Example:
// this
chore: update eslint rules config. fixed all existing errors
// or this
chore: update eslint rules config. Fixed all existing errors
