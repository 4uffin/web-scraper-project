Easy Telemetry Disable for 10/11
Prerequisites
Upgrade to Enterprise edition of Windows 10/11 if you are running Home or Pro.
You can do this through the Change Edition option in the Extras menu in MAS.
Disabling Telemetry via Group Policy
Open the Group Policy Editor. Search for "Edit Group Policy" in search or run gpedit.msc.
In the Group Policy Editor, navigate to the following path: Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Data Collection and Preview Builds
Double-click on Allow Telemetry (Windows 10) or Allow Diagnostic Data (Windows 11) in the right pane.
In the properties window, select Enabled. Then select Security [Enterprise Only] (Win10) or Diagnostic data off (Win11), which disables all telemetry.
Select OK. Telemetry should now be disabled.
Optional: Disable Windows Error Reporting
While disabling telemetry should be enough to prevent diagnostic data from being sent to Microsoft, to be extra safe you can also explicitly disable Windows Error Reporting:
In the Group Policy Editor, navigate to: Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows Error Reporting
Double-click on Disable Windows Error Reporting in the right pane.
Select Enabled and click OK.
Verify the Changes
To verify that the changes have been applied, you can check the registry.
Open regedit.
Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection.
On the right side, you should see AllowTelemetry with a value of 0. This means that telemetry has been disabled.
For Error Reporting, check HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting. The Disabled value should be set to 1.

Hey, I did everything mentioned here but when I go to regedit to confirm the changes there is no dword called AllowTelemetry in DataCollection but there is a dword for windows error reporting which shows that it worked properly, what am I doing wrong?

Did you check the registry keys after rebooting but before following the guide again? It's possible the keys were set during reboot.
My 0.02:
I followed the guide and checked the reg keys right after (no reboot). Keys were present for me. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Do upgrade to Enterprise still needed? In Pro edition, there is such settings, I can disable Telemetry too.

@cyberboh There is an option, but Home and Pro don't let you turn off telemetry completely. You can change the option, but it will still send security only data. On Enterprise and Education versions these completely turn off telemetry.

Do you know if this has any side effects (such as preventing auto updates)?

Normal auto-update will work fine, but Microsoft has mentioned that systems without telemetry on might not have UEFI updates pushed to them. Check https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/windows-devices-for-businesses-and-organizations-with-it-managed-updates-e2b43f9f-b424-42df-bc6a-8476db65ab2f for more

I changed from Pro to Enterprise using MAS, disabled telemetry completely and I keep getting Lenovo system (firmware) updates through Windows Update.
There shouldn't be any side effects whatsoever. Enterprise version is the same as Pro with additional settings you can't change in Home/Pro. This edition is made for businesses because they need to have total control over OS, unlike that's the case with Home/Pro.
