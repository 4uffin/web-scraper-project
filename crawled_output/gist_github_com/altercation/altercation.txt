Karabiner Goku Config Snapshot - es
; {
; Karabiner-Elements Goku Config
; es@ethanschoonover.com / github: altercation
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; SUMMARY
; Karabiner-Elements is a low level utility to manage macOS keyboard behavior.
; The JSON config for K-E is awkward to manage at any level of complexity and
; thus we use Goku to maintain the configuration in EDN and compile it out to
; native K-E JSON config.

Display Reset Script for macOS
#!/bin/sh
# dispreset:
# When called reset displays to last known arrangement using displayplacer
# if called within a timeout period (30 seconds), swap position.
# This is to work around the fact that in certain multimonitor configurations
# macOS fails to properly ID the displays using serial numbers pulled in via
# EDID and so loses track about which monitor is left/right positioned.
