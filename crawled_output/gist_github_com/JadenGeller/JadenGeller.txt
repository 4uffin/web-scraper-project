Keep view state and identity while animating into it from a list
/// A view that displays a collection of items in a scrollable list that can "zoom" to focus on a single selected item.
///
/// `ZoomNavigator` provides a navigation pattern similar to the iOS lock screen wallpaper picker,
/// where items can be viewed together in a scrollable list or individually in full screen.
/// The same view instance is maintained during transitions, preserving state and identity.
///
/// When no item is selected (`selection` is `nil`), all items are displayed in a scrollable list.
/// When an item is selected, the view filters to show only that item, expanded to fill the available space.

Front Matter: Enclosed within --- delimiters, specifies component attributes.
