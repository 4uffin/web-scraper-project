Installing nvidia drivers on Arch Linux
Enable multilib repository in /etc/pacman.conf
sudo pacman -Syu nvidia nvidia-settings lib32-nvidia-utils for standart linux kernel. If you use other kernel like lts or zen use sudo pacman -Syu nvidia-dkms nvidia-settings lib32-nvidia-utils
You need to install package from AUR optimus-manager. I recommend to use yay. Tutorial how to install is here!
yay -S optimus-manager
After installation you need to restart your computer.
After restart open your terminal and type optimus-manager --switch nvidia. You will be logouted from your account. Log in again and you using nvidia videocard!
You need to enter the command every time when you start the computer.
