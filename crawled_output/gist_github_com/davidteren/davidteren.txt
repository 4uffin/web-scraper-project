Rules for LLM Agentic Coding in Docker Containerization Projects
Rules for LLM Agentic Coding in Docker Containerization Projects
1. Container Architecture Patterns
Follow the Established Pattern: Always respect the established architecture patterns across services (Dockerfile, entrypoint script, management script).
Separate Concerns: Keep build-time operations in Dockerfile, initialization in entrypoint scripts, and user operations in management scripts.
Delegate Appropriately: Entrypoint scripts should handle environment initialization; management scripts should provide a clean interface.
Minimize Verbosity: Management scripts should be concise in output; verbose operations belong in entrypoint scripts.
2. Environment Detection & Configuration
Use Defaults Wisely: Always provide sensible defaults for environment variables.
Check Dependencies: Explicitly check for required dependencies (database, Redis, other services).
Respect Technology Specifics: Recognize and accommodate technology-specific patterns (rake vs rails, Nod
