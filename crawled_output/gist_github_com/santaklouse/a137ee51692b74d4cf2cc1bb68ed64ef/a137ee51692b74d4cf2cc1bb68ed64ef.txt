If anyone needs it, I'll drop the Python script I made in like 5 minutes that I've been using for little over a month. All this does is set the FirstRunDate to the current time. This doesn't fix effected bottles.
import plistlib
import os
from datetime import datetime
# set os path
userPath = os.path.expanduser('~')
# open plist
with open(f'{userPath}/Library/Preferences/com.codeweavers.CrossOver.plist', 'rb') as f:
pl = plistlib.load(f)
# set first run date to correct time
pl['FirstRunDate'] = datetime.utcnow()
# save plist
with open(f'{userPath}/Library/Preferences/com.codeweavers.CrossOver.plist', 'wb') as f:
plistlib.dump(pl, f)
works for me, very thx

Here's a Python script that should completely reset the trial (I basically just put together what everyone has already sent before):
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os
import shutil
import re
import plistlib
from datetime import datetime
print("Resetting Crossover FirstRunDate...")
# Set os path
userPath = os.path.expanduser('~')
# Open plist
with open(f'{userPath}/Library/Preferences/com.codeweavers.CrossOver.plist', 'rb') as f:
pl = plistlib.load(f)
# Set first run date to correct time
pl['FirstRunDate'] = datetime.utcnow()
# Save plist
with open(f'{userPath}/Library/Preferences/com.codeweavers.CrossOver.plist', 'wb') as f:
plistlib.dump(pl, f)
print("Resetting Crossover bottles...")
while True:
# Get bottle name
bottle_name = input("Enter the bottle name: ")
# Define paths
regfile = os.path.expanduser(f"~/Library/Application Support/CrossOver/Bottles/{bottle_name}/system.reg")
bakfile = regfile + ".bak"
# Create backup
shutil.copy2(regfile, bakfile)
print(f"Backup created: {bakfile}")
# Compile the regex pattern
pattern = re.compile(r"\[Software\\\\CodeWeavers\\\\CrossOver\\\\cxoffice\] [0-9]*")
# Read the file and search for match line
with open(regfile, 'r') as f:
lines = f.readlines()
match_line_num = None
for i, line in enumerate(lines):
if pattern.search(line):
match_line_num = i
break
# If match is found
if match_line_num is not None:
print(f"Match found at line {match_line_num + 1}.")
for line in lines[match_line_num:match_line_num + 5]:
print(line, end='')
resp = input("Do you want to delete these lines (delete to reset bottle)? (y/n): ").strip().lower()
if resp == 'y':
new_lines = lines[:match_line_num] + lines[match_line_num + 5:]
with open(regfile, 'w') as f:
f.writelines(new_lines)
print("Lines deleted.")
else:
print("Deletion canceled.")
else:
print("No match found.")
# Ask if we should continue
resp = input("Do you want to reset another bottle? (y/n): ").strip().lower()
if resp != 'y':
print("CrossOver trial reset.")
break
This will reset the Crossover trial and all the bottles. You should know the names of your bottles. To run it, save it as reset_crossover.py in a folder, and then open a terminal there and run python3 reset_crossover.py (the script should walk you through the rest).

Alternatively if you dont want to use scripts, you can just download "prefs editor", open it, search for crossover, click on it, and change "first run date" to whenever you want it to and the trial will start on that day.
Beware that your bottles will have to be redownloaded, at least from my very basic knowledge

this works way better than other ones listed here, just one command for it all, not saying that the other ones here are bad, just because i'm not experienced and i think this is good for getting it done quickly

Did not work for me, running the script in terminal, it still counts down on the trial period days. Can anyone elaborate on how to do it correctly? what I did was put copy paste the link/line from the main post and put it into terminal, hit enter. Also tried this "Script here — resets trial, bottle reset included (experimental)." but it still counts down on the trial period. Im 100% doing something wrong

try to download and run it locally: curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xVc323/crossover-trial/main/reset_crossover_fully.sh" -o reset_crossover_fully.sh
chmod +x reset_crossover_fully.sh
./reset_crossover_fully.sh

anyone know if the command at the very top of the thread actually works? i’m a little skeptical about it due to it linking to elsewhere…
Sorry, something went wrong.
Uh oh!

running the command on my iTerm returns the following err:
`bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gist.github.com/santaklouse/a137ee51692b74d4cf2cc1bb68ed64ef/raw/install.sh?token=$(date +%s))"
zsh: no matches found: https://gist.github.com/santaklouse/a137ee51692b74d4cf2cc1bb68ed64ef/raw/install.sh?token=1758819549`
any idea what's happening or where I'm wrong?

Is there a noob guide to doing this? I know how to use terminal and all, and I installed the brew/crossover command, but Im a little confused on what steps to take (click every link?) and in what order..
TIA
