How to Enable Wi-Fi on MacBook, Mac Mini, MacBook Air for Ubuntu/Linux OS
By default older Mac computer models have driver issues with the Broadcom Wi-Fi chip.
Most instructions online (such as this one from the official Ubuntu docs @ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Macmini5-1/Precise) suggest to use sudo apt-get and install these packages from the PPA.
BUT you don't have Internet so you can't use apt-get!
Instead you can use a different computer to download the packages, then transfer them over.
In the instructions below, you will need to replace sid in the download URL's with the proper version of Debian your version of Ubuntu/Linux is using.
To find which version you should use, you can view the chart at https://askubuntu.com/questions/445487/what-debian-version-are-the-different-ubuntu-versions-based-on#445496.
If you're using jessie for example, then replace all sid with jessie in the links below.
Download b43-fwcutter @ https://packages.debian.org/sid/b43-fwcutter (replace "sid" in the URL as needed -- scroll down to "Download" section and choose based off your architecture, and then select a mirror/FTP link to download from on the next page that appears).
Download firmware-b43-installer @ https://packages.debian.org/sid/firmware-b43-installer (repeat same note as above)
Download webfs @ https://packages.debian.org/sid/webfs (repeat same note as above)
Download http://www.lwfinger.com/b43-firmware/broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2 (e.g. using wget http://www.lwfinger.com/b43-firmware/broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2)
Save these downloaded files to flash storage and then insert flash storage into your Ubuntu/Linux machine.
Copy the files from the flash storage to your Ubuntu/Linux machine's desktop.
Open a terminal and run the command echo '127.0.0.1 www.lwfinger.com' | sudo tee --append /etc/hosts
Run the command sudo dpkg -i ~/Desktop/webfs.deb (replace webfs.deb with the webfs deb file name)
Run the command sudo mkdir -p /var/www/b43-firmware
Run the command sudo mv ~/Desktop/broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2 /var/www/b43-firmware/
Run the command sudo sed -i -e 's/web_root="\/var\/www\/html"/web_root="\/var\/www"/' /etc/webfsd.conf
Run the command sudo sed -i -e 's/web_port=""/web_port="80"/' /etc/webfsd.conf
Restart the web server sudo /etc/init.d/webfs restart (you may need to use sudo systemctl restart webfs if your system uses systemd)
Run the command sudo dpkg -i ~/Desktop/b43-fwcutter.deb (replace b43-fwcutter.deb with the b43-fwcutter deb file name)
Run the command sudo dpkg -i ~/Desktop/firmware-b43-installer.deb (replace firmware-b43-installer.deb with the firmware-b43-installer deb file name)
Run the command echo 'blacklist ndiswrapper' | sudo tee --append /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
Run the command echo 'SUSPEND_MODULES="b43 bcma"' | sudo tee ---append /etc/pm/config.d/modules
Run sudo reboot and then check if you can connect to Wi-Fi.
See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro8-2#Wireless for other instructions, such as enabling Sensors.
Also see https://askubuntu.com/questions/334561/problems-with-broadcom-bcm4311-wireless-card-on-hp-pavillion-dv6000#667832 for reference.
Remove webfs and the temp dir by typing sudo apt-get remove -y webfs and sudo rm -rf /var/www/b43-firmware/ on your Ubuntu/Linux machine afterwards.

I created a GitHub account just now for the express purpose of returning here to say: holy crap, it worked! thankyouthankyouthankyou
inherited my mom's mid-2009 15" MB Pro when she passed a few years ago. It's still a super beefy rig (4g dual core half gig storage -- very well suited for creative content production), excepting of course for the Cupertino Colossus' insistence upon abandoning their own still-working hardware. I was determined to return it to a state of usefulness. Ubuntu was the obvious choice. I'd tried it several years ago and really liked it. (fwiw, non-tech me had ZERO problems setting it up as a dual-boot in the PC / Windows environment on a Dell I'd had at the time, although that ease probably had a lot to do with having had a cooperative CD burner at the time).
Again -- I am not a super tech-savvy guy.
Neither of our Apple "super drives" (hows THAT for cynical branding, btw?) work reliably
(i.e. no burn-to-DVD), so the OS installation itself required my patience and LOTS of persistence.
And then I ran into the Broadcom / wifi issue ... good times hahaha
more persistence applied ... but even though my deep dive into a discomfort zone found me working through these steps VERY slowly / cautiously, at the culmination of the last step, first attempt, the clouds parted, a chorus of angels began singing, and blink! -- wifi visible and functional.
Super relieved, and extremely grateful. I have what's functionally a brand new decade old laptop. And it's again a nimble screamer of a rig. Thank you again! -dave

This worked for me.
One thing I had to do was run chmod -R 777 /var/www because I was getting a 403 access denied error at step 15. Probably would be better to allow just read access to the specific file that we moved there. Might be worth adding to the instructions if this is an issue a lot of people will run into.

please do not ever use chmod 777 unless you absolutely know what you're doing. You almost certainly could have simply done chmod -R +r /var/www (which grants read permissions recursively to everything under /var/www) instead and not have compromised the security of your system.

Dear @niftylettuce, thank you very much for your 20 steps above. I have a 2006 iMac 6,1 and I managed to successfully install Lubuntu 20.04 on it using this thread: https://mesom.de/efi32boot/index.html
Next, I follow your steps above, since I suspect that my iMac ethernet adapter is broken. It all goes well until step 15. Here it goes wrong. See the error message below:
mdeterink@iMac:~$ sudo dpkg -i ~/Desktop/firmware-b43-installer_019-5_all.deb

I do not know what to do. I checked my '/etc/hosts' file and it includes the line '127.0.0.1 www.lwfinger.com'. I would be very greatful if anyone can help me. Lubuntu is working very nicely on my old iMac, but without network it becomes impossible.
Thanks, Marco

This can be done much easier by using netcat to serve the file. That way you don't need any of the web server steps.
Download all the files (b43-fwcutter, firmware-b43-installer and http://www.lwfinger.com/b43-firmware/broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2)
Open a terminal and run these commands:
cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.bak
echo 127.0.0.1 www.lwfinger.com >> /etc/hosts
{ echo -ne "HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: $(wc -c <broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2)\r\n\r\n"; cat broadcom-wl-5.100.138.tar.bz2; } | nc -l -p
80 &
dpkg -i ~/Desktop/b43-fwcutter.deb
dpkg -i ~/Desktop/firmware-b43-installer.deb
cat /etc/hosts.bak > /etc/hosts
Worked for me 💯

I am using Air 2012 . I installed Debian (full DVD on USB) wiping off Catalina completely. Everything worked great except for the WiFi. Getting WiFi needed some research but it is as simple as downloading two files ... Details on the page here https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/brcm80211
Most of the information on internet is quite outdated
.. Now we have fully open sourced drivers for most of the older Broad-com WiFi cards. Just download Linux firmware from the link https://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git
;
expand the archive on some internet connected machine . Copy brcm/bcm43xx-0.fw and brcm/bcm43xx_hdr-0.fw to /lib/firmware/brcm (or wherever firmware is normally installed on your system) via a usb
.. and reboot

Hi, nice procedure but like some others I got stuck at step 15.
I'm working with Ubuntu 22.04, and dpkg is doing an https (not http) request to the webserver which it can't handle, it gives a 443 error.
Not sure if there's an easy way around this, webfsd has no support for https and I can't see anyway to make dpkg to use http instead of https.
Also, for 22.04 the version number used at step 4 is different.

I installed the oem version of Xubuntu on my Macbook Air (2016). It found the wifi connection during the setup without problems. After that i changed the oem to a custom version by dblclicking the shortcut on the desktop for redistribution to users. Restarted and wifi works. Hope it will help others.

I gave this a try when I discovered my entire Broadcom device was not working for my new ubuntu install - both for wired and wireless were not working. It failed at step #8 because of missing dependencies.
After trying to resolve them briefly, I decided to re-install from scratch. This time, I had a wired connection, and I checked all the boxes for third party software and updates. This ensured that all required packages would be downloaded. That worked. After the install, the wired connection worked but the WiFi did not. I found a fix for that here: https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/ubuntu/no-wi-fi-adapter-found-error
