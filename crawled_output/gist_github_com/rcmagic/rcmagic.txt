Readme: In the following pseudo code, [] indicates a subroutine.
Sometimes I choose to write the subroutine inline under the [] in order to maintain context.
One important fact about the way rollbacks are handled here is that we are storing state for every frame.
In any real implementation you only need to store one game state at a time. Storing a game
state for every frame allows us to only rollback to the first frame where the predicted inputs don't match the true ones.

FRAME_ADVANTAGE_LIMIT
:= Any Positive Integer
# Specifies the number of frames the local client can progress ahead of the remote client before time synchronizing.
