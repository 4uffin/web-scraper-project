Why `npm-shrinkwrap.json` seems unusable
For historical purposes and possible future reference, here are my notes on why I backed out a change to use npm-shrinkwrap.json in markdownlint-cli2.
The basic problem is that npm will include platform-specific packages in npm-shrinkwrap.json. Specifically, if one generates npm-shrinkwrap.json on Mac, it may include components (like fsevents) that are only supported on Mac. Attempts to use a published package with such a npm-shrinkwrap.json on a different platform like Linux or Windows fails with EBADPLATFORM. This seems (to me, currently) like a fundamental and fatal flaw with the way npm implements npm-shrinkwrap.json. And while there are ways npm might address this problem, the current state of things seems unusably broken.
