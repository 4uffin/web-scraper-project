experiments with using v3 onions with client auth (as of tor 0.3.5.X)
#!/bin/bash
# needs openssl 1.1+
# needs `basez` https://manpages.debian.org/testing/basez/base32hex.1.en.html
#
(but something else that decodes the base64 and re-encodes the raw key bytes
#
to base32 is probably fine too)
##### generate a key
openssl genpkey -algorithm x25519 -out /tmp/k1.prv.pem

some notes about meltdown & spectre patches
(originally from a tweet thread: https://twitter.com/mtigas/status/949337073495916544 )
updated january 5, 2018; 12:47 US Eastern Time
ok here's a rough list of links i have collected about patches for meltdown / spectre https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/584653 , that i sort of compiled for my own reference but figure others might want. (info as of this morning, january 5. might have mistakes, use at own risk, etc)
MacOS High Sierra 10.13.2+, Sierra 2017-002 security update, and El Capitan 2017-005 security update mitigate meltdown:

/ 0 ProPublica Tor hidden service config.md

Configuration for ProPublica’s Tor hidden service proxy.
Note (December 16, 2021): These example files haven't been updated since 2016. In either 2019 or 2020, our onion domain was changed to a longer v3 onion address (p53lf57qovyuvwsc6xnrppyply3vtqm7l6pcobkmyqsiofyeznfu5uqd.onion). The examples below don't reflect this, but the configuration portions remain accurate regarding how we currently serve the onion site. (Tor Browser dropped support for v2 addresses, such as propub3r6espa33w.onion, in the second half of 2021.)
These files contain the base configuration for ProPublica’s Tor hidden service mirror.
Of note:
We're using the nginx "subs_filter" and "headers more" modules to allow us to rewrite content and update headers, so that we can convert clearnet links into onion links, where possible.

Example code for running a (HTTP/HTTPS) Tor hidden service supporting subdomains.
The following files show an example of how to create subdomains for onion site
hidden services. (This hasn't been tested for hidden services for anything other
than HTTP/HTTPS.)
(You might also want to read our blog post about ProPublica’s Tor hidden service, including a tutorial and notes on running a hidden service: https://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/a-more-secure-and-anonymous-propublica-using-tor-hidden-services )
In general, this works (maybe just in recent Tor clients) because Tor will handle
the connection to www.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.onion as a connection to
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.onion. The encapsulated HTTP/HTTPS connection contains the
subdomain in the Host: header (and in the case of HTTPS, the SNI
