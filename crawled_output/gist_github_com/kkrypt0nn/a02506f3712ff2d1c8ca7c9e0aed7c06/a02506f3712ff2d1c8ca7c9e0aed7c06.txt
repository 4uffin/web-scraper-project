A guide to ANSI on Discord
Discord is now slowly rolling out the ability to send colored messages within code blocks. It uses the ANSI color codes, so if you've tried to print colored text in your terminal or console with Python or other languages then it will be easy for you.
Quick Explanation
To be able to send a colored text, you need to use the ansi language for your code block and provide a prefix of this format before writing your text:
\u001b[{format};{color}m
Important\u001b is the unicode escape for ESCAPE/ESC, meant to be used in the source of your bot (see http://www.unicode-symbol.com/u/001B.html). If you wish to send colored text without using your bot you need to copy the character from the website.
After you've written this, you can now type the text you wish to color. If you want to reset the color back to normal, then you need to use the \u001b[0m prefix again.
Formats
Here is the list of values you can use to replace {format}
0: Normal
1: Bold
4: Underline
Colors
Here is the list of values you can use to replace {color}:
Text Colors
30: Gray
31: Red
32: Green
33: Yellow
34: Blue
35: Pink
36: Cyan
37: White
Background Colors
40: Firefly dark blue
41: Orange
42: Marble blue
43: Greyish turquoise
44: Gray
45: Indigo
46: Light gray
47: White
Example
Let's take an example, I want a bold green colored text with the firefly dark blue background.
I simply use \u001b[0;40m (background color) and \u001b[1;32m (text color) as prefix. Note that the order is important, first you give the background color and then the text color.
Alternatively you can also directly combine them into a single prefix like the following: \u001b[1;40;32m and you can also use multiple values. Something like \u001b[1;40;4;32m would underline the text, make it bold, make it green and have a dark blue background.
Result:
Raw message used:
```ansi
\u001b[0;40m\u001b[1;32mThat's some cool formatted text right?\u001b[0m
or
\u001b[1;40;32mThat's some cool formatted text right?\u001b[0m
```

Disclaimer
Note: The change has been brought to all stable desktop clients. Since syntax highlighting on mobile is far behind, ANSI is not supported on mobile as well. Refer to this gist for other syntax highlighting methods.

This is a small gist to show how I've made the picture showcasing the different ANSI formats above.
Important\u001b is the unicode escape for ESCAPE/ESC, meant to be used in the source of your bot (see http://www.unicode-symbol.com/u/001B.html). If you wish to send colored text without using your bot you need to copy the character from the website.

Is it possible to use colored text but not enlarge the message field?

It looks like the bottom code block is an inline code block (`like this`), which has no formatting. So no. The only way to do the colored text is with syntax highlighting, which is only possible via the
```ansi
```
multi line code blocks

Can confirm it completely works - that's what happens when you use BetterDiscord, or similar, with plugins that alter the default behaviour of code blocks or syntax highlighting 🙃

Thanks to Clyde for pointing that out, you can clear any effects (bold/underline, fg color, bg color) by using 0.

apparently you can also use the escape code number 5 which is supposed to make the text blink and uncer certain circunstances when you hover the mouse over the text it changes the background, I haven't figured out exactly how it works also you can input multiple codes into one for example
�[0;32;40m where 0 is the code to clear the format, then comes the text color then the background color all separated by semicolons

i hope discord devs add support for color in regular chat without having to use code blocks. thanks for this page, it was used as a reference in this article about using color in text on discord which also has a link to the youtube tutorial that has 58K views! clearly, there is so much demand for this feature, discord should just add it out of the box.

what you called "yellow" is called ocher or gold, in a normal world. Yellow is yellow, like a mature lemon.

The other colors have custom names because they're not really following ANSI.
