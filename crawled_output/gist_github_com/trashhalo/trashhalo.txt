# Script to migrate from obsidian readwise to logseq readwise

# 2. Merge obsidian readwise content into new vault using this ruby file
# 3. Delete Readwise folder from obsidian vault
# 4. copy the pages files into your obsidian pages folder
# map of url => new filename
logseq_url_map = Dir["pages/*"].map do |page|

Obsidian CSS Check
Obsidian CSS Check
After noticing a css error in the most popular theme (minimal), I decided to download every theme and see how widespread css errors are. Shell script using curl, jq to download them all. Stylelint with all rules turned off to just check for syntax errors.
Findings
21 themes in the official theme list have syntax errors.
Most common type of error is theme makers thinking css supports // foo shape comments. CSS only supports /* foo */ shaped comments. These all show up as unknown word in the syntax-check.txt report.
A couple of these were introduced when someone tried to "comment out" a rule. // color: red;
Handful of extra or missing } ;. I tried to file pull requests for the obvious ones.
