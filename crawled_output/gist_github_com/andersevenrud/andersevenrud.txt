KlipperScreen Splash Screen Video
KlipperScreen Splash Screen Video
A simple systemd service to show a splash video before KlipperScreen loads.
Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=En1gtl8IiC8
Note:
This interrupts the launch of KlipperScreen. However the other Klipper services still start up in the background, so it's not really noticable in terms of total startup time.

Klipper piezo buzzer configuration (M300)
I wanted to connect a simple piezo buzzer to my 3D-printer running Klipper to make some beeps when a print starts, stops, etc.
Parts required
A passive buzzer (I bought these cheap ones from Ali)
Note that active buzzers have an internal oscillator and cannot emit tones of different frequencies.
Some wires and a connector

DIY Z-Wave Power Metering Pulse Sensor
DIY Z-Wave Power Metering Pulse Sensor
I created this because my meter doesn't have an accessible HAN port, and I was not able to find any basic Z-Wave sensor to monitor pulses
that did not require the use of some (packaged) proprietary solution or a subscription (and mobile apps). Also, kinda expensive.
This cost me $50 in total (2023), which was considerably cheaper and very beginner friendly.
Accuracy is ~99% (when compared to billing information from my provider over a period of 90 days).

Nexa Bridge X Documentation
Nexa Bridge X Documentation
The "Nexa Bridge X" is a Smart Home bridge device. The internal name is "Bridge2".
There is now also the Bridge3, which seems like it's mostly the same as Bridge2 except it has a separate adapter for Z-Wave!
It can be attached to a home network and monitor / control devices via an App/Cloud or Local Web UI. Supports assigning devices to rooms and various automations via the provided firmware.
Since this devices comes with a (semi) open API and Websocket it's custom to create custom integrations.
