I've been looking for emojis saved as 128x128 png format. I found some but the problem I have is I need file name of the emoji to the the emoji itself. So joy.png would result in 😂. Anyone know any ressources or how I can get those?

The beetle

seems to be gone (as per 22/Sep/2021) at least in Chromium based browsers.
Firefox is still displaying it, but in a awkwardly different font style.

@abravalheri I think it happens because Firefox is already on Unicode Version 13.0 https://emojipedia.org/unicode-13.0/
which contains the beetle.
Chrome is still on Unicode Version 12.0 https://emojipedia.org/unicode-12.0/ (at least on Windows 10)
It is the same for other new emoji: e.g.
cockroach
🪳
beaver 🦫

I just created a simple Emoji Picker that contains all the emojis that GitHub supports. The emojis are automatically updated using GitHub's Emoji API. You can use this picker to search for emotion and copy its shortcode. Feel free to check it out on https://github-emoji-picker.vercel.app/.

You can hold shift to get the Unicode version which should work in Telegram (see https://github-emoji-picker.rickstaa.dev/). However, please remember that it is a filtered set of emojis showing only the ones supported on github. Feel free to create a feature or pull request to display all emojis with no GitHub shortcode 👍.

The comments here are pretty inspiring. 🤔
Although, instead of relying on someone's website, the best solution would be to have a userscript that references https://api.github.com/emojis.
It could store the current listing in your browser's localstorage and have a toggle to let it update weekly or something.
Then you'd have a full searchable list that grabs from localstorage when you press :
I was actually looking for such a script before I saw this gist.

I generally don't visit websites that aren't familiar so I can only take your word that whatever you have is useful.
Also, using another website directly conflicts with my statement instead of relying on someone's website.

Ah I overlooked that part 😅. It however is open source and quite easy to convert it into a chrome application if someone wants to take on the challenge (see rickstaa/github-emoji-picker#214).

Ah, I can understand that. I removed it in rickstaa/github-emoji-picker#261. It was used during development but is no longer needed 👍.
