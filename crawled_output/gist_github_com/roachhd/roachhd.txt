Reference: List of iOS App URL Scheme Names & Paths for Shortcuts

If you've ever customized your app icons or played around with Shortcuts (previously called Workflow), you probably know how important URL scheme names are. Nearly all iOS apps assign themselves one of these names, and you need to know them if you want to add custom icons to your home screen or create a Shortcuts workflow that opens an app on your iPhone up.
Finding the URL scheme name, also known as a URI scheme, for a particular app is not easy. First, you have to download the IPA file for the app — a difficult task since the iTunes 12.7 update removed iOS apps from it. When you finally find the IPA, you have to turn it into a ZIP file, show the contents of the app package, then hunt for the specific PLIST file that contains the URL schemes. It's a lot of work.

How to Set Exercise Goals
![][2]
Mount Everest. The Badwater Ultra-Marathon. What do the these things have in common? They are Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals (BHAG) that are achieved by putting one foot in front of the other. And they are rarely achieved. The only person who's both climbed Everest and run Badawater is Marshall Ulrich. In his autobiography Running on Empty, Ulrich's recommendation for achieving BHAGs is to "focus on the present and set intermediate goals." And the best Sport Psychology research points to the same thing. Setting intermediate, or "process goals" are vastly superior to BHAGs.
