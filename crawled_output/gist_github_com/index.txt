1. Nova-Core (drivers/gpu/nova-core/)
This is the low-level hardware abstraction layer that directly interfaces with the GPU hardware.

Free & Secure API Key Rotator for Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (Deno Edge Functions)
Great. I’ll develop a phased implementation plan, edge function code, deployment strategy, user guide, and full documentation for a key rotator using Deno Edge Functions. This will focus on rotating Gemini 2.5 Pro API keys to handle 429 rate limits efficiently.
I’ll return with a clear breakdown of components, including a secure architecture, key storage and cycling logic, usage limits, and guidance for setup and customization.
Secure API Key Rotator for Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (Deno Edge Functions)
Overview: This solution is an edge-deployed proxy that securely rotates through a pool of Google Gemini 2.5 Pro API keys to avoid hitting per-key rate limits (e.g. free-tier limit of ~2 requests/minute (Gemini 2.5 Pro via OpenRouter triggers RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED despite API key and usage being within free-tier limits · Issue #2000 · RooVetGit/Roo-Code · GitHub)).
