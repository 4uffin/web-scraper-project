DELETE FROM users WHERE location = 'IRAN';
Hi! I am an Iranian Software Engineer, and in this torn paper note, I want to talk about
some funny moments I had online related to the fact that I was spawned in this specific region of the world: Iran.
Microsoft deleted my app, ignored my mails
Back when I was a student, I got access to the Microsoft Imagine, and as a result, I got
access to the Microsoft Store as a developer. This inspired me write one of my open-source projects called EyesGuard
and publish it on Microsoft Store. However, one day, somebody told me that they can no longer find EyesGuard on the store.

LLM Samplers Explained
LLM Samplers Explained
Everytime a large language model makes predictions, all of the thousands of tokens in the vocabulary are assigned some degree of probability, from almost 0%, to almost 100%. There are different ways you can decide to choose from those predictions.
This process is known as "sampling", and there are various strategies you can use which I will cover here.
OpenAI Samplers
Temperature
Temperature is a way to control the overall confidence of the model's scores (the logits). What this means is that, if you use a lower value than 1.0, the relative distance between the tokens will become larger (more deterministic), and if you use a larger value than 1.0, the relative distance between the tokens becomes smaller (less deterministic).
1.0 Temperature is the original distribution that the model was trained to optimize for, since the scores remain the same.

## Code Quality & Best Practices
Default to these rules to keep the codebase clean, maintainable, and layered.
### Code Duplication
- Extract shared behavior into reusable functions, hooks, or utilities.
- Follow the DRY principle so fixes happen in one place.
```typescript
// ✅ Reuse shared logic
const useApiCall = (endpoint: string) => {

Acronyms Seriously Suck - Elon Musk
From time to time, Musk will send out an e-mail to the entire company to enforce a new policy or let them know about something that's bothering him. One of the more famous e-mails arrived in May 2010 with the subject line: Acronyms Seriously Suck:
There is a creeping tendency to use made up acronyms at SpaceX. Excessive use of made up acronyms is a significant impediment to communication and keeping communication good as we grow is incredibly important. Individually, a few acronyms here and there may not seem so bad, but if a thousand people are making these up, over time the result will be a huge glossary that we have to issue to new employees. No one can actually remember all these acronyms and people don't want to seem dumb in a meeting, so they just sit there in ignorance. This is particularly tough on new employees.
That needs to stop immediately or I will take drastic action - I have given enough warning over the years. Unless an acronym is approved by me, it should not enter the SpaceX glossary.
