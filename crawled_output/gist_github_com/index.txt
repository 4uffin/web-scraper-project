You can place the file whatever you like as long as you have installed TransMac in the default install path.
You can also put TransMac_Reset_Trial.cmd in the same directory as TransMac.exe and run it from there.
This is useful if you want to put TransMac.exe in another path than default.

Grokking the coding interview equivalent leetcode problems
GROKKING NOTES
I liked the way Grokking the coding interview organized problems into learnable patterns. However, the course is expensive and the majority of the time the problems are copy-pasted from leetcode. As the explanations on leetcode are usually just as good, the course really boils down to being a glorified curated list of leetcode problems.
So below I made a list of leetcode problems that are as close to grokking problems as possible.
Pattern: Sliding Window
