Discord Timestamp Syntax
Discord Timestamps
Discord timestamps can be useful for specifying a date/time across multiple users time zones. They work with the Unix Timestamp format and can be posted by regular users as well as bots and applications.
The Epoch Unix Time Stamp Converter is a good way to quickly generate a timestamp. For the examples below I will be using the Time Stamp of 1543392060, which represents November 28th, 2018 at 09:01:00 hours for my local time zone (GMT+0100 Central European Standard Time).

Simple Github -> Discord webhook
Step 1 - Make a Discord Webhook
Find the Discord channel in which you would like to send commits and other updates
In the settings for that channel, find the Webhooks option and create a new webhook. Note: Do NOT give this URL out to the public. Anyone or service can post messages to this channel, without even needing to be in the server. Keep it safe!
Step 2 - Set up the webhook on Github
Navigate to your repository on Github, and open the Settings

📖 Introduction
Many users who have rooted their devices finds issues where system or third-party applications detect the root status and refuse to operate. This guide outlines a procedure to hide root detection on the majority of Android devices, specifically the ones running Noble ROM for Samsung S9/S9+/N9. The approach detailed here leverages KernelSU-Next in conjunction with SuSFS.

Exporting Microsoft Authenticator TOTP secrets
Background
Workplaces may enforce TOTP 2FA to be enabled Office 365 accounts, which require the Microsoft Authenticator app to be installed.
Regular TOTP applications (such as Aegis, Authy, or LastPass) cannot be used as Microsoft uses a proprietary scheme called phonefactor. Furthermore, the application requires Google Services Framework (GSF) to be installed (likely to provide device notifications), and will refuse to work when it is not present on the device.
Forunately, after the registration is complete, the underlying mechanism the app uses to generate TOTP codes is regular otpauth, and its secrets can be exported with a little bit of effort.
