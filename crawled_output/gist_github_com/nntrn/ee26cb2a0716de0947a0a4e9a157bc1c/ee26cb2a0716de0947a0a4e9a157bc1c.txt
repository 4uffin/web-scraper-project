My 2 cents on the ESPN NBA data - it's unreliable and incomplete. You're better off using the NBA static JSON data they have because 1, most of their JSONs contain everything you need to know in a single request, and 2, it's more conducive to better quality data. The ESPN play by play data for example - there are player ID's in recent data for players who aren't active anymore. There are missing data points - my best example is 3 pointers. You only have descriptions to rely on to pull out the data. Sometimes the player names in the descriptions don't match the player ID's. I reverted to pulling the data from ESPN's website and even then, there are not enough data points to pull the info I wanted. The NBA data has the data points built in and there's little guessing.

if you're trying to target regular season games, my advice is to use
&dates=YYYY&seasontype=2 instead of &dates=YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD

Concerning the NFL only,
Does anyone know any other status text ESPN uses to signify whehter a game is live in progress or not other than these?
"STATUS_SCHEDULED" ,
"STATUS_IN_PROGRESS",
"STATUS_HALFTIME",
"STATUS_END_PERIOD",
"STATUS_FINAL"
For example is there a STATUS_OVERTIME or *_OVER_TIME maybe?
Or STATUS_POST_PONED? etc...
thanks!

hello, need help getting detailed injury reports per team. I can get it from : https://sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/basketball/leagues/nba/teams/3/injuries
but returns links to individual players without names
i know the roster endpoint gives Status Out/Active but im looking for an endpoint that gives full team statuses with injury report. the ESPN injury page has it all for teams https://www.espn.com/nba/team/injuries/_/name/chi/chicago-bulls
just cant get it in an endpoint, any help is appreciated thanks
update:
got this to work for individual nba teams
https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/nba/injuries?team=ATL
for a matchup
https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/nba/injuries?team=ATL&team=NYK https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/baseball/mlb/injuries?team=ATL&team=NYY
Looks like you need to use abbreviations
When I heavily involved in DFS my approach was to use the NBA injury report page and twitter. Maybe things have changed the past couple years but ESPN was always super sketchy with updates.

This. Waste of time messing with ESPN for PBP unless its college basketball/football and the only other option is parsing the archaic ncaa site. MLB/NBA/NFL API's are the way to go.

Anyone have a feed link that woud let me see who was OUT for a given week on a roster?
For example, Barkley sat out week 18 for Eagles. But in his roster the active: "false" is set. And it's false for all players so I assume that's just a throw away meaningless thing for that end point.
Any thoughts?

@JimNayzium, your definition of OUT isn't clear - what counts as out? present, but didn't play? not present and didn't play?
players in event rosters with .statistics["$ref"] definitely played and players missing this field probably didn't
i think active is a real time field that shows when a player is active during the game.
---
view players from event roster:
/nfl/events/401671841/competitions/401671841/competitors/21/roster
not pratical, but you can validate this by checking each player's eventlog:
/nfl/seasons/2024/athletes/3929630/eventlog

@nntrn - Thanks so much for the help!
the active explanation makes sense, and thanks for that!
So I just meant the actual injury report status going into the game.
Present, but didn't play is not what I mean at all. A player who dresses out, is on active roster and garners no playing time would not have been "OUT" on the injury report. But Barkley was in a ball cap the entire game week 18, so he would have been OUT week 18.
So for Barkley, on the roster for that week, the didNotPlay === false, does not mean necessarily he was listed as "OUT" if that makes sense?
Also, not having statistics would not be 100 percent accurate either. A WR could go in for a a number of plays, never be targeted and never gain statistics of any kind.
Was just hoping to see a pregame injury report end point of some kind. Or "This week's inactives" type thing.

@JimNayzium I'm not sure if this would help pre-game but for post, you could check their event log.
It looks like it shows a played => true/false, and for week 18 on Barkley it shows false.

Noticed something odd:
For the 2024 events API, it doesn't return playoff games past the 1st divisional round. For example, for the Eagles (ID = 21), you can see the response of https://sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/football/leagues/nfl/seasons/2024/teams/21/events is missing Games 401671889 (SuperBowl) and 401671888 (NFC champ).
For previous years (2023 season), I verified that all games were there (pre, in, post season).
I checked the other Events API: https://sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/football/leagues/nfl/events?season=2024&seasontypes=3&page=3. Here you can filter by page to go through each result. None of these pages contain these missing games either.
Do we think ESPN forgot to track these games or is there a new playoffs API?

If anyone's interested, I've gotten pretty far in creating an OpenAPI spec for all of the endpoints listed here + more: https://github.com/aaronweldy/espn-openapi
Fully types out the response schema & is easy to create generated clients for whatever language you want with your favorite OpenAPI generator.

Hi, a specific one regarding the NFL. Is anyone aware of a way to view the correct values for passing yards after catch? Receiving yards after catch seems fine but passing yards after catch I'm struggling to find.
The player stats of an event don't have that stat (e.g. https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/summary?event=401671764)
And the statistics section of a player's event log has the stat, but its seemingly 0 no matter what
(e.g. Jared Goff and Amon-Ra for the same Lions-Cowboys game
Goff - https://sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/football/leagues/nfl/events/401671764/competitions/401671764/competitors/8/roster/3046779/statistics/0?lang=en&region=us
Amon Ra - https://sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/football/leagues/nfl/events/401671764/competitions/401671764/competitors/8/roster/4374302/statistics/0?lang=en&region=us)

Ah I never noticed it in the play by play section, thanks @nntrn. I'll have to take a look and see if there is a realistic way for me to total them and attribute to correct QB.

Thank you so much for putting this together! I am creating a website to run an alternate rules DFS contest for my friends and I wanted to add live scoring. I'll only need to fetch the scores for around 50 players, what endpoint do you think would be best for this?
I see that I could potentially make a call to each player endpoint or to each game endpoint, but I'm guessing that I could add headers to one of these requests to just get the stats for the games happening today for only a certain set of playerIds. Does any endpoint come to mind?
I can probably hack it all together with the existing ones, I just don't want to spam the api and parse through a bunch of data if I don't have to

I have a fun one that is quite maddening. (No pun intended)
In the drive play-by-play feed from a Bills game week 1 with id: 401671617
There was a discrepancy in the totals I was getting for James Cook's stats and I found a mistake by ESPN apparently.
I see no real way to know the mistake should be discounted or removed in the feeds either, at least not in these feeds. Other than comparing the stat totals at the end, but then determining what is wrong is near impossible.
I compared the PDF at nfl.com of the play by play hard copy of the actual game on these two plays and it would seem that the James Cook 11 yard rush does not exist at all. Somehow it just got entered for James Cook. Typically if a penalty happens or a play is reviewed that is well documented by ESPN's feeds. This is a pure mistake I am afraid. Like the intern who entered the data just shanked.
To be clear, this first play just doesn't appear in the https://static.www.nfl.com/gamecenter/7d40236a-1312-11ef-afd1-646009f18b2e.pdf report here. And if you look at the json data you will see the same exact clock times.
I guess this is the type thing that causes a "stat" correction to be made in fantasy maybe?
Any thoughts on a way to detect these type things? Something I am missing?

@JimNayzium, I've taken a look at what you've mentioned and think you're spot on with this being a phantom play.
In terms of detecting things like this, it seems pretty tough as the non-existent play is populated as though its real. The one discrepancy I can find is the value of the wallclock field. I've listed a few plays around the play you're looking and the fake Cook play breaks the sequence. Its hard to know if this will be the case in other instances though.
The real Cook rush with penalty on play - 2024-09-08T19:39:07Z
The phantom Cook rush
- 2024-09-08T19:40:06Z
The Kincaid pass
- 2024-09-08T19:39:58Z
The Cook rush for loss of 3 yards
- 2024-09-08T19:40:41Z
Also out of curiosity, what URL are you requesting this data from? My responses all lacked the "yardsAfterCatch": 0 for the Kincaid pass which you seem to have.

Hi, a specific one regarding the NFL. Is anyone aware of a way to view the correct values for passing yards after catch? Receiving yards after catch seems fine but passing yards after catch I'm struggling to find.
You can get this in the play by play https://sports.core.api.espn.com/v2/sports/football/leagues/nfl/events/401671764/competitions/401671764/plays?limit=300
This is what I see for Goff btw:
@KieranMunslow
Hi @nntrn, I'm just coming back to this now and I'm struggling to find the 'yardsAfterCatch' field in the play-by-play, even using the URL you've provided. It was definitely there when I first accessed it so confused as to why its seemingly different now.
Any ideas on what might be happening here?

Cannot Tell if Picks are made for College Pick 'em or Pigskin Pick 'em Current Week via ESPN Pick'em API
Problem Summary
I'm using ESPN's Pick'em API to track user picks for challenges like NFL Pigskin Pick'em and College Football Pick'em.
The core issue:
I need to know, each week, whether a user has made their picks before the games start. However, the way the API is structured makes this difficult once the season has started.
Current Behavior
Before Week 1:
If .picks doesn’t exist: The user hasn’t made any picks.
If .picks exists but is empty: The user has submitted picks, but the pick data isn’t available until the games start.
After Week 1 & Throughout the Season:
The .picks array is a flat list with all picks for the season added as games begin.
There’s no breakdown by week (no .picks.week2, .picks.week3, etc.).
For example:
Just before Week 2, .picks for everyone has 16 entries from Week 1.
There are no empty or null entries for future weeks.
As Week 2 games start, new picks are revealed, and the array grows (17, 18, 19, ...).
There's no way to tell ahead of time if someone has made their picks for the upcoming week; you only find out after kickoff, when it’s too late for users to make the picks for the week.
Ideal vs. Actual Data Structure
Ideal structure (week-by-week distinction):
{
"picks": {
"week1": [...],
"week2": [...],
// etc.
}
}
Actual structure (flat array, no week info):
{
"picks": [
{...}, // week 1
{...}, // week 1
// ... (only fills as games start, no separation by week)
]
}
API URLs
College Football Pick'em:
https://gambit-api.fantasy.espn.com/apis/v1/challenges/college-football-pickem-2025/entries/{user_guid}
NFL Pigskin Pick'em:
https://gambit-api.fantasy.espn.com/apis/v1/challenges/nfl-pigskin-pickem-2025/entries/{user_guid}
What I Want
Is there any way, using the current ESPN Pick'em API, to determine before kickoff whether a user has or hasn't made their picks for a given week during the season?
Right now, I can only detect an empty/null picks list at the very start of the season (before Week 1).
After that, the .picks array grows each week, and there's no way to distinguish “not made picks for this week yet” from simply “picks for this week aren’t public yet”—until it’s already too late.
Before the pick ems site redesign a few years ago, ESPN provided this information.
If you viewed a person's picks entry, it would say "Chuck has not made their picks yet", but this functionality was removed in the redesign
Question
Is this a current limitation of the API, or is there a workaround to detect per-week pick completion before games start?
Thank you!

Is there a way to get Men's and Women's College Basketball week data? For example, https://site.api.espn.com/apis/common/v3/sports/football/college-football/seasons?startingseason=2023 will give me a weeks array with the number and their start and end date. However, https://site.api.espn.com/apis/common/v3/sports/basketball/mens-college-basketball/seasons?startingseason=2023 does not give me any of that data.

Concerning the NFL only, Does anyone know any other status text ESPN uses to signify whehter a game is live in progress or not other than these?
"STATUS_SCHEDULED" ,
"STATUS_IN_PROGRESS",
"STATUS_HALFTIME",
"STATUS_END_PERIOD",
"STATUS_FINAL"
For example is there a STATUS_OVERTIME or *_OVER_TIME maybe? Or STATUS_POST_PONED? etc...
thanks!
I don't know of any official list but just discovered there's a "STATUS_DELAYED" from the Panther / Jags game with a weather delay right now!

For college football, is there a way to get stats per week per division? For example, for FBS I want to see the passing yards leader, touchdown leader, sack leader, etc etc.
