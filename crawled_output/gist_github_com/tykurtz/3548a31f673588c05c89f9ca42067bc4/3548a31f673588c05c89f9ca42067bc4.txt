Grokking the coding interview equivalent leetcode problems
Raw

GROKKING NOTES
I liked the way Grokking the coding interview organized problems into learnable patterns. However, the course is expensive and the majority of the time the problems are copy-pasted from leetcode. As the explanations on leetcode are usually just as good, the course really boils down to being a glorified curated list of leetcode problems.
So below I made a list of leetcode problems that are as close to grokking problems as possible.
Pattern: Sliding Window
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/ # Close enough
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/
https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/
https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/
https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/
https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/
Pattern: Two Pointers
https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/
https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/
https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/
https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/
https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-smaller/
https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-product-less-than-k/
https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/
https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/
https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/
https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-unsorted-continuous-subarray/
Pattern: Fast & Slow pointers
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/
https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/
https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/
https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/
https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/
https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-array-loop/
Pattern: Merge Intervals
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/
https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/
https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections/
https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/
Could not find equivalent. Given a list of intervals with values, find the peak sum (i.e. if intervals are overlapping, sum their values)
https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/
Pattern: Cyclic Sort
Couldn't find equivalent for the first question. The second question below encompasses the first one though. See https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/discuss/859510/C%2B%2B-O(N)-O(1)-using-Cyclic-Sort for how grokking the coding interview approached these problems. It uses the fact that we can sort the array in O(n) without comparison operators
https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/
combine https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/ and https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/
https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/
https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-missing-positive-number/
Pattern: In-place Reversal of a LinkedList
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/
Next question is the same, but alternate each subgroup
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/
Pattern: Tree Breadth First Search
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii/
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/
https://leetcode.com/problems/inorder-successor-in-bst/
# Close, not exact
https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/
# Close, grokk assumes non-perfect tree
Next question is the same, but connect end nodes to the next level instead of null
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/
Pattern: Tree Depth First Search
https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/
https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/
https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/
https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-string-is-a-valid-sequence-from-root-to-leaves-path-in-a-binary-tree/description/
https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/
https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/
Pattern: Two Heaps
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/
https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-median/
https://leetcode.com/problems/ipo/
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-right-interval/
Pattern: Subsets
https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/
https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/
https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/
https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-case-permutation/
https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/
https://leetcode.com/problems/generalized-abbreviation/
https://leetcode.com/problems/different-ways-to-add-parentheses/
https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees-ii/
https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/
Pattern: Modified Binary Search
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/
# Close enough. The grokking problem allows sorted input arrays as ascending or descending, which only introduces a simple check
Did not find. Problem is find index of smallest element greater or equal to input value
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-sorted-array-of-unknown-size/
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/ (with K == 1)
https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-in-mountain-array/
https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/
Similar to previous, but find the number of rotations of the array.
Pattern: Bitwise XOR
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/
https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/
https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/
https://leetcode.com/problems/flipping-an-image/
Pattern: Top 'K' elements
Same as second question, but the first Grokking question wants the top K instead of the bottom K
https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array
https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-connect-sticks/
https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/
https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/
https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/
https://leetcode.com/problems/least-number-of-unique-integers-after-k-removals/ closest leetcode or https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-distinct-elements-removing-k-elements/ for exact
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-elements-k1th-k2th-smallest-elements/ no leetcode equivalent found
https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/
https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-string-k-distance-apart/
https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-stack/
Pattern: K-way merge
https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/
Same as previous, but return the Kth smallest number
https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/
https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-range-covering-elements-from-k-lists/
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-pairs-with-smallest-sums/ small difference, grokking has different sort order and wants the largest
Pattern: 0/1 Knapsack
https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-dynamic-programming-patterns-for-coding-interviews/RM1BDv71V60
https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-dynamic-programming-patterns-for-coding-interviews/3jEPRo5PDvx or https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum/
https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-dynamic-programming-patterns-for-coding-interviews/3j64vRY6JnR
https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/ similar concept, but problem description is more abstract.
https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/ similar, but return the number of combinations instead of the combinations
https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/
BONUS : Not in grokking, but I still found this very useful https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/
Pattern: Topological Sort
First problem is identical to the following three
https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/
https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/
Same as above, but return all instead of any
https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/
https://leetcode.com/problems/sequence-reconstruction/description/
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/

Awesome list!
For Cyclic Sort, you have the last item in the list linked to https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-missing-positive-number/ which is not correct.
The leetcode question has an array of sorted, positive numbers and you are looking for the kth missing positive. This is an LC easy and you don't even need cyclic sort since the numbers are already sorted.
The grokking question is an unsorted array containing both positive and negative numbers, possibly duplicate values, and you are finding all values from 1-k. This is a LC hard (per grokking)

I bought the course a couple months ago for full price and all I can say is that I regret buying it and feel it was a waste of money. For how much it costs for what is basically a curated LeetCode problem set with solutions, a significant amount of the solutions don't offer much in depth or detailed explanation and some of the solutions fail to pass their closest LC equivalent problems. I've found better solution explanations and help from looking on the Discuss page of those LC problems and watching NeetCode's video solutions.
