Grokking the coding interview equivalent leetcode problems
GROKKING NOTES
I liked the way Grokking the coding interview organized problems into learnable patterns. However, the course is expensive and the majority of the time the problems are copy-pasted from leetcode. As the explanations on leetcode are usually just as good, the course really boils down to being a glorified curated list of leetcode problems.
So below I made a list of leetcode problems that are as close to grokking problems as possible.
Pattern: Sliding Window
