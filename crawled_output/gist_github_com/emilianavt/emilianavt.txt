This component uses the UnityEngine.LowLevel API to run Final IK things before Unity constraints and particle systems are evaluated.

using RootMotion.FinalIK;
// Disable IK and TwistRelaxers and set them on this to have them run before constraints and particle systems are evaluated.
// Only one instance of IKRunner is possible, but it should be easy enough to extend.
// Remember to call Start() on the TwistRelaxers once if they are disabled from the beginning. The IK may also need manual initialization.

Best VTuber Software
Best VTuber software
This is a list of the most commonly used and relevant vtubing software. The "best" will always be subjective and depend on your specific requirements. Overall, the information in this list is as accurate as I could figure it out, but there might be errors or some details might become out of date. If you find anything that needs to be corrected, please let me know. You can also note it in a comment.
Additional explanations:
iPhone means that an iPhone is basically required
iFacialMocap support means that tracking data can be received from the iFacialMocap iPhone app
VMC protocol means that the application can send and/or receive tracking data from other VMC protocol capable applications, allowing the combination of multiple tracking methods (e.g. VSeeFace receiving VR tracking from Virtual Motion Capture and iPhone/ARKit face tracking from Waidayo)
Tobii means that the Tobii eye tracker is supported

Converting an avatar to VRM format
Converting an avatar to VRM format
In this guide, I assume you already know the basics of Unity and probably have previously uploaded an avatar to VRChat. If you haven't, you can still try to follow along, but some descriptions might be a bit too brief.
A more in-depth guide with screenshots can be found here.
