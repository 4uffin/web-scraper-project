Sed CIL Linux
sed stands for Stream Editor.
It is a powerful command-line tool on Linux and macOS. It's main job is to find and change text inside files.
Basic Syntax
sed [OPTIONS] 'SCRIPT' [INPUT_FILE...]
OPTIONS: Settings that change how sed works.
SCRIPT: The command you want to run and change text.
INPUT_FILE: The file you want to read. If you don't provide a file, sed reads from standard input (like a pipe |).
NOTE: If use sed without -i option, only prints the changes and It does not change the original file. you can check your changes at frist.
Saving Your Changes
sed -i 'SCRIPT' [INPUT_FILE...]
NOTE: Your changes saving in the file directly using the -i (--in-place) flag. so be careful to using this.
