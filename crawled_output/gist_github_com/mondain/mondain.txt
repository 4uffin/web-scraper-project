Red5 WsSession leak fix
Change log for WsSession leak in Red5; new version 2.0.16 released 4/23/2025
The leak was primarily seen during regular use of Red5 Pro's RTC client which uses a WebSocket for the initial connection with a switch to DataChannel if accepted / configured in the RTC client during startup.
Classes modified:
org.red5.net.websocket.WebSocketConnection - local reference to the connected scope was modified from a WeakReference to the WebSocketScope itself and marked final. In the ctor the scope is also added to the WsSession user properties for consolidated access within Tomcat. Several timeout properties were also added from the latest Tomcat 11.x documentation: BLOCKING_SEND_TIMEOUT our default to 8000ms, ABNORMAL_SESSION_CLOSE_SEND_TIMEOUT our default 10000ms, SESSION_CLOSE_TIMEOUT our default 5000ms. The properties are standard for Tomcat and may be modified at-will via system property override; all values are long type in milliseconds. The maximum idle timeout is now configured to use the largest

Address SLF4J logger update
Red5 updated its slf4j and logback libraries recently to address security vulnerabilities; in doing so, this broke the old code in Red5 open source logging that allowed the separation of logging into additional contexts such as those used by custom webapps and Red5 Pro cloudstorage. The symptom of which was difficult to catch since it just prevented logging without any indication. Currently, the only work-arounds are to replace the logger libraries with the older versions or replace every use of Red5LoggerFactory with the SLF4J default interface LoggerFactory; the SLF4J factory does not accept a context. Here is an example:
/*
* The recent updates for SLF4J prevents Red5 logger factory use of a context,
* it does not work in the latest Red5 open source libraries. We suggest a
* replacement in the interim.
