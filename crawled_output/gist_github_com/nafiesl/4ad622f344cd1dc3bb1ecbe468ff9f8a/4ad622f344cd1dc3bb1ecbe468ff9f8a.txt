How to get Telegram Bot Chat ID
Content :
Create a Telegram Bot and get a Bot Token
Get Chat ID for a Private Chat
Get Chat ID for a Channel
Get Chat ID for a Group Chat
Get Chat ID for a Topic in a Group Chat
Create a Telegram Bot and get a Bot Token
Open Telegram application then search for @BotFather
Click Start
Click Menu -> /newbot or type /newbot and hit Send
Follow the instruction until we get message like so
Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/new_bot.
You can now add a description.....
Use this token to access the HTTP API:
63xxxxxx71:AAFoxxxxn0hwA-2TVSxxxNf4c
Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot.
For a description of the Bot API, see this page: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
So here is our bot token 63xxxxxx71:AAFoxxxxn0hwA-2TVSxxxNf4c (make sure we don't share it to anyone).
Back to top ‚Üë
Get Chat ID for a Private Chat
Search and open our new Telegram bot
Click Start or send a message
Open this URL in a browser https://api.telegram.org/bot{our_bot_token}/getUpdates
See we need to prefix our token with a word bot
Eg: https://api.telegram.org/bot63xxxxxx71:AAFoxxxxn0hwA-2TVSxxxNf4c/getUpdates
We will see a json like so
{
"ok": true,
"result": [
{
"update_id": 83xxxxx35,
"message": {
"message_id": 2643,
"from": {...},
"chat": {
"id": 21xxxxx38,
"first_name": "...",
"last_name": "...",
"username": "@username",
"type": "private"
},
"date": 1703062972,
"text": "/start"
}
}
]
}
Check the value of result.0.message.chat.id, and here is our Chat ID: 21xxxxx38
Let's try to send a message: https://api.telegram.org/bot63xxxxxx71:AAFoxxxxn0hwA-2TVSxxxNf4c/sendMessage?chat_id=21xxxxx38&text=test123
When we set the bot token and chat id correctly, the message test123 should be arrived on our Telegram bot chat.
Back to top ‚Üë
Get Chat ID for a Channel
Add our Telegram bot into a channel
Send a message to the channel
Open this URL https://api.telegram.org/bot{our_bot_token}/getUpdates
We will see a json like so
{
"ok": true,
"result": [
{
"update_id": 838xxxx36,
"channel_post": {...},
"chat": {
"id": -1001xxxxxx062,
"title": "....",
"type": "channel"
},
"date": 1703065989,
"text": "test"
}
}
]
}
Check the value of result.0.channel_post.chat.id, and here is our Chat ID: -1001xxxxxx062
Let's try to send a message: https://api.telegram.org/bot63xxxxxx71:AAFoxxxxn0hwA-2TVSxxxNf4c/sendMessage?chat_id=-1001xxxxxx062&text=test123
When we set the bot token and chat id correctly, the message test123 should be arrived on our Telegram channel.
Back to top ‚Üë
Get Chat ID for a Group Chat
The easiest way to get a group chat ID is through a Telegram desktop application.
Open Telegram in a desktop app
Add our Telegram bot into a chat group
Send a message to the chat group
Right click on the message and click Copy Message Link
We will get a link like so: https://t.me/c/194xxxx987/11/13
The pattern: https://t.me/c/{group_chat_id}/{group_topic_id}/{message_id}
So here is our Chat ID: 194xxxx987
To use the group chat ID in the API, we need to prefix it with the number -100, like so: -100194xxxx987
Now let's try to send a message: https://api.telegram.org/bot63xxxxxx71:AAFoxxxxn0hwA-2TVSxxxNf4c/sendMessage?chat_id=-100194xxxx987&text=test123
When we set the bot token and chat id correctly, the message test123 should be arrived on our group chat.
Back to top ‚Üë
Get Chat ID for a Topic in a Group Chat
In order to send a message to a specific topic on Telegram group, we need to get the topic ID.
Similar to steps above, after we click the Copy Message Link, we will get a link like: https://t.me/c/194xxxx987/11/13, so the group Topic ID is 11.
Now we can use it like so (see message_thread_id): https://api.telegram.org/bot783114779:AAEuRWDTFD2UQ7agBtFSuhJf2-NmvHN3OPc/sendMessage?chat_id=-100194xxxx987&message_thread_id=11&text=test123
When we set the bot token and chat id correctly, the message test123 should be arrived inside our group chat topic.

Question being a noob learner, would an automatic bot be considered as "Private" or group or channel"?
I got this when I applied Private
ok | true
-- | --
result | []
Sorry, something went wrong.

It depends on where you put the bot. When you chat with the bot privately, then it will be a private chat. When you add the chat in a group, then it will be a group. Same goes for channel.
When you only get the result above, you need to send a message to the bot (on privact chat, group, or channel). If you still get nothing, try to end chat with the bot, then start again. (Scroll comments above if you not sure how to do it).

I tried ending and starting a new chat with my bot, no luck
I invited the bot into a group, then I see results, but I prever a private chat. But no solution works (any more)
Workaround with a 3rd bot @RawDataBot forward a message to it...

Hi @nafiesl thanks for your efforts.
I just created a bot and got my bot token. Also opened a private chat with it. I did not invite it into any group or so. It is just for me.
When I open the website https://api.telegram.org/bot7692xx035:Axx5qa79SSxxxVFpU/getUpdates I see the following:
There is no result being shown anymore.
Thanks for your help

Solution for
{‚Äúok‚Äù : true, ‚Äúresult‚Äù:[ ] }
TL;DR
disable privacy mode using BotFather (/mybots ‚Üí select your bot ‚Üí "Bot settings" ‚Üí "Group privacy" ‚Üí
choose "Disable")
Context
I got the problem of "result": [] during the setup for Get Chat ID for a Private Chat. With the solution above, I no longer have the problem.

Hi, I'm new to github, and looking for help with my telegram bot.
I'm building a system to deliver timed messages.
I've built the backend and the features of the bot which all work and correspond with my sheets.
But I'm having difficulties with sending the texts.. /start runs and collects telegram id.
But I cannot get it to collect the chat id which is what I believe is failing?!
I can force send the messages to all users.
But that's only from inside the code. If I use a command like startover from telegram rather than the script, it wipes my sheet but does not send the first text.
So the webhook and api appear to be working..?
But I'm not sure if this is due to the privacy described a few comments ago. Or is somewhere else
Here is a snippet of the code I'm using during my onboarding phase of my script.
function doPost(e) {
try {
const contents = JSON.parse(e.postData.contents);
const message = contents.message;
if (!message || !message.chat || !message.from) return;
const userId = message.from.id;
const chatId = message.chat.id;
const text = message.text ? message.text.trim() : "";
const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById(SPREADSHEET_ID).getSheetByName("Users");
const userRow = findOrCreateUserRow(sheet, userId);
Any help and I would be most greatful

I noticed in the terminal, if you write curl https://api.telegram.org/bot63xxxxxx71:AAFoxxxxn0hwA-2TVSxxxNf4c/getUpdates it returns a response. But the normal web browser takes you nowhere.
With curl I was able to see my old bots ID's but the new ones I create return empty "result":[]

Hello,
The old bot suddenly stopped working.
I created a new bot, and I obtained the chat ID using different methods, but it is not responding on the api.telegram.org page. I am uncertain how to resolve this issue.
