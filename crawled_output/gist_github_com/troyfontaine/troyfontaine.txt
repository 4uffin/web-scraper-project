certbot-dns-cloudflare on Asustor NAS running ADM 5
This will configure an Asustor NAS running ADM 5 to use a letsencrypt issued certificate without exposing the NAS to the internet (by using DNS Challenge instead of using port forwarding).
To accomplish this, we need to use certbot with DNS-01 challenge to Cloudflare.
To perform this task, you must SSH into the NAS.
Elevate the terminal to root
sudo su

HP iLO4 on Ubuntu Noble 24.04 for use with HP ProLiant 8th Gen Servers
If you're a homelabber and are interested in attempting to use the iLO4's agentless management functionality (how is it agentless if you have to install software on the OS?), you can do so by installing the HP AMS Package
Install the Agentless Management Service

Set up a Palworld Dedicated Server On Ubuntu 22.04
How to Set up a Palworld Dedicated Server On an Ubuntu 22.04 Host (VM or baremetal)
WORK IN PROGRESS
Because the documentation scattered around the internet is pretty inconsistent, I'm putting everything I've found that seems to work together here.
Overview
This took too much effort to get sorted out, so I'm documenting everything figured out so far here.

How to Update the Firmware of a Crucial Consumer SSD on Linux via the Terminal
How to Update the Firmware of a Crucial Consumer SSD on Ubuntu 22.04 via the Terminal
This has been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with 3x Crucial MX500 1TB SSDs purchased in 2023
Install the required packages
sudo apt-get install -y smartmontools unzip curl
Check your current firmware version and note it-you will want to be sure that you are actually updating the firmware version (replace sdX with your actual device's identifier-leaving off any partition numbers as you're checking the block device and not the data on it)

How to Remap Left-Alt and Left-Windows keys on the ASUS ROG Falchion NX (Mac Style Key Layout)
How to Remap the Left-Alt and Left-Windows keys on the ASUS ROG Falchion NX (Mac Style Key Layout)
Because remapping can confuse the keyboard, we have to temporarily reprogram two keys outside of the left Windows and Left Alt keys that we're trying to work with in order to get the keys swapped like we want.
It would be nice if the Armour Crate software would provide a way to specify a known key rather than having us type it-but c'est la vie!
Open Armoury Crate
On the left nav, click on the "Device" tab, then select your keyboard from the list
Click on the "Keys" tab at the top
Click on the / ? key in the Armoury Crate Window, then on the right side of the Window, toggle the drop down from Default to Keyboard Function
Now, click in the box that says "Click here then press the key."
Hold down the right Alt key on your keyboard and press the left Alt key, you will now see that the / ? key is set to Left Alt

Raspberry Pi with LED Power Button and RTC
How to Set up a Raspberry Pi with LED Power Button and RTC
After a lot of trial and error, I've figured out how to set up a Raspberry Pi (in my case, I tested with a 2B and 3B+, this may not work on a Pi 4B).
This involves using the i2c0 bus (which normally isn't recommended), but this is what I was able to get working as re-mapping would communicate with the RTC via i2c, but the overlay for the RTC wouldn't adjust its configuration when told to use i2c3 or higher.
Required hardware
Power button (this should be a momentary switch type)
Power LED (for me, this was actually built into the power button)
330K Ohm resistor (this is connected between the LED and the 3.3v header
A Real Time Clock (RTC) Module (preferably, one with built-in pull up resistors)
Jumper wires
