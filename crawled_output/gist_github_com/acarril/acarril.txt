Create a bootable Windows USB using macOS
For some reason, it is surprisingly hard to create a bootable Windows USB using macOS. These are my steps for doing so, which have worked for me in macOS Monterey (12.6.1) for Windows 10 and 11. After following these steps, you should have a bootable Windows USB drive.
1. Download a Windows disc image (i.e. ISO file)
You can download Windows 10 or Windows 11 directly from Microsoft.
2. Identify your USB drive
After plugging the drive to your machine, identify the name of the USB device using diskutil list, which should return an output like the one below. In my case, the correct disk name is disk2.

GlobalProtect toggle (start/quit)
Regain control over the annoying GlobalProtect macOS install
I need to use GlobalProtect because it's becoming the only VPN to access resources in my school. The VPN client is simple enough, but it does two annoying things:
Registers itself to autostart on login
Doesn't provide you with a simple 'quit' action
Here I'll show you how I fixed both issues in macOS 12.2 (Monterey).

My Python setup (OSX)
My Python setup (OSX)
Lots of people (myself included) have been confused about how to go about installing Python on a new (or old) machine. This document is an attempt to maintain an up-to-date, succint guide on how to properly set up Python on macOS. It's 2021, so we'll focus on Python 3 here ffs.
The process is simple. Broadly speaking, my method boils down to
installing Homebrew,
installing pyenv using Homebrew, and
installing one (or more) Python version(s) using pyenv
Yes, there are many more ways of doing this. Here we'll focus on my way, which is nevertheless based on careful testing and assesment of pros and cons of each method. See here or here for more details on available alternatives.
