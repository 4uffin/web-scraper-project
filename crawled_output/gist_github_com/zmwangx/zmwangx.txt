Android Studio can't find devices connected via USB
If Android Studio can't find a device connected via USB on macOS even though adb devices lists it, check in Activity Monitor if the running adb is ~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb (double click on the process and check executable path). Maybe you're running the adb from android-platform-tools. If that's the case, uninstall android-platform-tools (brew uninstall android-platform-tools if you installed with brew).

/ Finder busy xattr.md

When a file is being copied in on macOS, the com.apple.FinderInfo xattr is set to the 32-byte value
627a7920 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
which would show up as bzy
with xattr -p com.apple.FinderInfo /path/to/file. (This may only be true when there are no additional attributes likes flags.) This can be used to test whether a file copy has completed.
Conversely, one can also use
xattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo '627a7920 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000' /path/to/file

Tested on macOS 13.3.1.
In Disk Utility, create new APFS volume under internal SSD's Container disk1.
Unmount the volume.
‚åòI to open the Info panel of the volume, copy the Volume UUID. Alternatively, the UUID can be copied from the output of diskutil info disk1s7, where disk1s7 should be replaced with the corresponding device node.
