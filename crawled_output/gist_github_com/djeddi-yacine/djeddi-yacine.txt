isolate vscode bash history from user bash history.
VSCode Isolated Bash History
Got tired of VSCode terminal polluting your main bash history? This script creates workspace-specific bash history that's completely isolated from your system terminal.
What it does
Workspace mode: Creates .vscode/.workspace_bash_history for each project
Temporary mode: Uses /tmp history when not in a workspace
Real-time sync: Commands are shared between all terminals in the same workspace instantly
Auto gitignore: Automatically adds history files to .gitignore
