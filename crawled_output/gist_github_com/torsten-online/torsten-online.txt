OpenSuSE MicroOS - KDE Discover asking for User/Admin-Password by running Updates (again and again...)
If you get any policykit issue, by running some software updates over Discover at KDE, even when system patches will be installed,
the default installation of OpenSUSE Micro is missing the wheel group, which gots checked by policykit.
I dont recommend to modify / add any rules to policykit, so if you dont want be asked again and again for the user password,
simply add the wheel group and your users to that group!

OpenSuSE MicroOS Linux - Unlock PIN Yubikey BIO FIDO USB Key
If your FIDO Key gots locked, because the fingerprint was not OK,
then its quite easy to unlock the Yubikey FIDO BIO USB Key (if you know it!)
For me, only reset was possible over GUI with yubikey-manager, so the unlock requires shell command!
Install the yubikey-manager package:

Steam with OpenSuSE MicroOS and AgeOfEmpires 4
I recommend to install steams as RPM Package, because then all the dependencies e.g. for Proton Experimental will be installed.
Fell free to use with Flatpak, if thats working fine for you. See Packages list!
These steps I used to run Steam with AMD Radeon Vega
System: ASUS Mini PC PN52 BBR959XD - Barebone - Mini-PC - 1 x Ryzen 9 5900HX / 3.3 GHz
