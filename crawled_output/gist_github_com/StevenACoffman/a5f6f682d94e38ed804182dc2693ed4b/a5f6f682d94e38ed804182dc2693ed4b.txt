Ooooh, thanks for the list! My original list was compiled for my then 9-year old daughter's first webapp: https://stevenacoffman.github.io/homoglyphs/
so she and her friends could type funny looking messages to one another. As a result, she wanted only similar rather than identical symbols.

As you can see here wikipedia․org I wanted to cite sources but did not want the site preview to take up extra space. You'll find you are unable to click the link to Wikipedia because I've hacked your mouse.†
† Just kidding, I didn't hack your mouse. Instead of a period, I used a unicode character which looks identical to the period
bing.com
bing․com
You can click only the first one. Also, as I'm typing this I can see the second one is underlined red, signifying a misspelling.
My motivation in finding a period twin: I wanted to cite sources in a group chat while being courteous to readers (so my comment takes up less space). But you cd use this for trolling as well.

Personal opinion, lowercase to uppercase, size and as last emoji, what are your thoughts, maybe we should sort them by unicode code?
Currently I play around with similar \ and space characters under Windows, you can do funny stuff.
like: "E:\⧵"

How can I find out the alt codes to type these? I need to enter one into a program but it won't let me copy paste, so I need to actually hold
alt and type the number pad code. I've even tried to use autohotkey but it won't work for the clean special characters (the ones that look like the real letters.) I'm trying to use the special 'а' character for use in my name in a game, since it stupidly censors the name 'passion' to make it 'p***ion. So this seemed like a way to fix it.
Sorry, something went wrong.

in AutoHotkey, use the CHR() and SEND commands
https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/lib/Chr.htm
https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/lib/Send.htm
Send, "P" . chr( [whatever the code number is] ) . "ssion"

Windows Unicode Input via Numpad
Hello, I took a look how Windows can handle unicode via Numpad.
You have to create a registry entry manually:
NoteIf this key does not exist, add it as type REG_SZ (string value).
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Input Method
EnableHexNumpad = "1"
Restart or relogin required after registry change.
TipFor user related registry changes HKEY_CURRENT_USER is a relogin enough otherwise changes to HKLM do a full restart
mnemonic bridge:
HKLM / machine = restart,
HKCU / user = relogin
Usage
Hold Alt
Press Numpad +
Type the lowercase hex code (e.g. 03b2 for β, 0393 for Γ)
Release Alt
Important Notes
ImportantLetters A–F must be lowercase for this method to work.
For case-insensitive entry or more flexibility, consider AutoHotkey or WinCompose
Test Examples
Hex Code
Result
Description
03b2
β
Greek small letter beta
0393
Γ
Greek capital letter gamma
Sources
Unicode Character "Γ" (U+0393)
