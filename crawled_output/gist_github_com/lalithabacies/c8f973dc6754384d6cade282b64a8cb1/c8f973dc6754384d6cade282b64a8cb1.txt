this code can be written in a simple notepad and saved in an html file, replacing the icon with any .ico
if something doesn't work, you can create your own icon from any photo on the internet directly from .png to .ico
Thank you all for your attention))
There is also an option to replace the weather city with your own instead of "London" and specify your API-Key.

thank you
here is my final work.
I did a city search, added exact city coordinates, dark and light design, added a city search, which can be activated by pressing the "Enter" button or the next button on the phone keyboard, a 3-day weather forecast and expected day/night temperature, added the probability of precipitation so that it wouldn't be boring, added 3 popular radio stations that immediately play the air without transitions.
nothing superfluous))

here is the code, all you need to replace are the traps for your channels and connections to you 7screen, if you need them of course.
Screen 11 noted that I closed the code, these are almost identical screenshots from screen 10, just for those who don't understand how it works.
