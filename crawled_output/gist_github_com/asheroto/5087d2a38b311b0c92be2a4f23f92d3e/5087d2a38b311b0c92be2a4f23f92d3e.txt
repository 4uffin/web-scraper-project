Bypass Windows 11 Upgrade Assistant / PC Health Check / TPM and CPU Settings. Ignore PC Health Check results.

README.md
Bypass Windows 11 Upgrade Assistant / Setup Hardware Checks (TPM, CPU, RAM)
This PowerShell script allows you to bypass TPM 2.0, unsupported CPU, and memory checks enforced by the Windows 11 Upgrade Assistant and setup.exe from Windows installation media. It eliminates common upgrade blocks such as:
This PC doesn't currently meet Windows 11 system requirements.
TPM 2.0 must be supported and enabled on this PC.
The processor isn't currently supported for Windows 11.
What It Does
This script:
Deletes legacy upgrade failure registry keys that may block future attempts.
Simulates hardware compatibility by setting known override values (e.g., TPM, RAM, Secure Boot).
Enables Microsoft's official upgrade bypass by setting AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU to 1.
Enables Upgrade Assistant to proceed by setting UpgradeEligibility to 1 under the current user.
Registry Keys Modified or Removed
Purpose

Windows11-Enable-Upgrade.ps1
Open PowerShell as Administrator.
Run the script:
.\Windows11-Enable-Upgrade.ps1
Option 2: Run Directly from the Web
Click the "Raw" button at the top right of the script to view it as plain text.
Copy the full Raw URL from your browser’s address bar.
In Administrator PowerShell, run:
irm "<paste raw url here>" | iex
✅ This lets you execute the script immediately without saving it to disk.

Hey @tommysmeg - Those just disable the TPM / Upgrade checks - the rest of the install is normal.
I just did a couple desktops by running those and then using the upgrade assistant.
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11
If you want to do a fresh install from disk, download a Windows 11 ISO and "burn" it to a USB w/ Rufus
https://rufus.ie/en/
There's a popup option to disable the checks built into this tool.

I have read that the Win 11 upgrade assistant doesn't remove your apps or data ( dont know how true that is ), I tried those bat files and reg files and it still says I need secure boot, so I edited the reg files needed added a few in to bypass those issues and it still comes up I need secure boot.

Win 11 upgrade assistant doesn't remove your apps or data:
It's pretty true actually.
I did it on a domain joined system remotely lol. Nothing at all lost, not even remote access.
I don't think it's related to the version of Win 10 tbh.
It's possible your system is booting in an older way (non-UEFI) - not really sure.
I'd take a complete backup (either way) and wipe it 😎

Yer I tired the upgrade assistant and kept getting I need secure boot even thou I disabled those steps, I can boot both ways UEFI and non UEFI
anyway I put it down to it can't be done on these machines so I'm going to give PCTrans ago, just putting the image onto the 2nd machine now so I can try it.

Secure boot needs UEFI, but you shouldn't be able to boot either way (UEFI or BIOS), only one way. If you can boot either way, Windows may have some boot remnants from a prior OS which may be part of the problem.
it's probably best to make a full backup then wipe it (remove partitions) and do a clean install. Then reinstall programs and pull in the files you need.

To bypass Windows 11 Upgrade Assistant checks, modify two registry values: set UpgradeEligibility to 1 in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\PCHC, and AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU to 1 in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup. After running the registry file, you can upgrade without hardware checks using the Upgrade Assistant.

PC ta com Windows 10 Pro em um dominio;
Tem todos os requisitos menos o TMP 2.0;
Fiz o processo de alterrar os registros, ele inicia a instalação pelo assistente de instalação, mas quando chega em 70% - 77% da 3° etapa,
ele buga e "começa do 0" e depois da erro. falando que o PC não tem o TPM 2.0. Tristeza

Translation from Portuguese to English:
Didn't work for me.
The PC is running Windows 10 Pro on a domain;
It meets all the requirements except for TPM 2.0.
I went through the process of changing the registry settings — the installation assistant starts the upgrade, but when it gets to 70%–77% of the third stage,
it crashes and "starts over," then gives an error saying the PC doesn't have TPM 2.0. Sad.
English response:
If it crashes, that sounds more like a compatibility issue with the CPU or other hardware components. You might check to see how old the hardware is.
Translation from English to Portuguese:
Se ele travar, isso parece mais um problema de compatibilidade com o processador ou outros componentes de hardware. Vale a pena verificar a idade do hardware.

Just a tip, In the end I got it going, now I've done it so many time's it just works, download the 11 ISO and burn it to USB using Rufus depending on your Windows 10 version, been UK, US or
English International ISO, then the upgrade will allow you to keep all your files and apps, just have to know what version of Windows 10 your using. open the win 11 USB you created run the win 11 exe file from the USB using Windows explorer and upgrade that way.

One potential gotcha is that the "HKCU" path below is contextual:
Enable Upgrade Assistant flow
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\PCHC
UpgradeEligibility = 1
If logged into a standard user, and elevating a whole powershell session against and admin account and running the script, the HKCU "UpgradeEligibility = 1" will be set on the admin account HKCU and not the standard account that's eventually running setup.exe (upgrade assistant) -- even with the UAC admin elevation to run it.
I had to run the script in an admin powershell session, then user powershell session (most things failed because permissions, but not the HKCU entry), and then reboot and try upgrade assistant -- then the standard user in-place upgrading worked when UAC elevated.
It's probably because of UAC and how context and admin tokens work -- it seems like it's referencing the HKCU of the standard user when elevated by UAC to run setup.exe of upgrade assistant.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/user-account-control/how-it-works
Not sure how how old is "too old" for this script to work, but it worked fine to in-place upgrade a Dell Optiplex that failed because of a 7th gen intel Chip.
Additionally, the TPM was firmware updated from v1.2->v2.0 using Dell updates, secureboot was enabled, TPM enabled, and UEFI enabled without legacy ROMs.
Thanks for the script and compilation -- There's too much misinformation and chaos on this process out there on the internets.

I didn't think of that. I suppose that issue would occur, but that is, unfortunately, the key that the software checks. I used Process Monitor to confirm. The options I see are to do what you did, or log off as a standard users and log in as an admin.

Oh, no problem.
Figured it could be mentioned in case someone else had an issue.
In the end, I just wacked it with a "hammer" and put the user-value on ALL local accounts.
This way, the bypass script can just be run once as an admin, and then the following "setup.exe/upgrade assistant" execution context doesn't matter.
In testing, this "hammer" below seems to do the trick for handling user-type keys -- and handles both logged in/out local accounts.
Thanks, again.
Some ideas: could also add an admin elevation check at the top of the script, and a pause at the bottom to read console messages before closing the window.
# Admin rights check & auto-elevation
if (-not ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal] [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole] "Administrator")) {
Write-Host "Restarting script as Administrator..."
Start-Process -FilePath "powershell.exe" -ArgumentList "-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -File `"$PSCommandPath`"" -Verb RunAs
exit
}
# Pause after script execution to read console messages.
Write-Host "`nScript complete. Press Enter to close..."
[void][System.Console]::ReadLine()
Could parameterize the user-reg block below, and have a usage like:
Set-RegistryValueAllUsers -SubKey "Software\Microsoft\PCHC" -Name "UpgradeEligibility" -Type DWord -Value 1
function Set-RegistryValueAllUsers {
[CmdletBinding()]
param (
[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
[string]$SubKey,
# e.g. "Software\Microsoft\PCHC"
[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
[string]$Name,
# e.g. "UpgradeEligibility"
[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
[ValidateSet("String","ExpandString","Binary","DWord","QWord","MultiString")]
[string]$Type,
# e.g. "DWord"
[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
[object]$Value
# e.g. 1
)
...
...
Setting the value for all user reg hives:
# Path to desired user-type registry key
$regSubKey = "Software\Microsoft\PCHC"
$regName
= "UpgradeEligibility"
$regType
= "DWORD"
$regValue

That's an interesting idea, but the problem is that we cannot load an NTUSER.dat file into registry if the user is currently logged in. On computers that have multiple accounts, this could pose a problem. It's also a bit drastic, or as you said, hammer approach. We only need 1 admin user to run it, so we don't need to force values for all accounts.
Since most folks will either have admin rights at home, or if at a workplace the IT staff will run an upgrade from an admin account or through an RMM, I don't know if there's a viable - and also safe - solution. You can't run an upgrade from a standard users' account anyway, unless you "Run as Other User", but that's usually reserved for small things. 😊

Greetings,
Ah, that use case should already be modeled -- The code works for multiple active users (GUI and console session), and multiple offline users.
The if-else will check if the user is active, then switch path to "HKEY_USERS$sid" where the hive is already open for the active user(s).
If not an active user, it loads the user's NTUSER.dat hive in "HKU$sid", does the stuff, then unloads the hive.
I repurposed this for some others to use, and needed to fool-proof it -- A handful production machines need a crutch before replacement.
Just a thought, as people running it might not understand the context problem, and tossed the admin-check at the top of the code.
Thanks again -- take care.

I ran into black screen right after login on my laptop a few months back. I could move the mouse but nothing else loaded. Safe mode worked fine and that is how I started fixing it. I uninstalled the graphics driver from Device Manager and rebooted which allowed Windows to reinstall the default driver. That cleared the problem instantly and then I updated the driver from the manufacturer’s site. Another tip if it still happens is using Task Manager to restart Windows Explorer because many times the shell just fails to load. After locking down the drivers I also checked activation since missing updates can cause weird issues. I bought a license through Microsoftprokey and since then my updates run without interruptions. If your PC keeps showing black screens after login it is usually display driver or corrupted system file related.

@blinkblinktwo gotcha, sorry I didn't see that before. I'll work on implementing when I get a chance.

Your script worked Perfectly to prep and then

<<< Just used this in hopes it may not get cleaned out because of filers. >>> to create the USB stick needed for win 11 install.
After flash sick created ne reboot required and just run the setup.exe from the flash stick and accepted any
warnings
about not going to supported but installed Win 11 and all seems windows 11 works well from there.
Some games still may not work because needing either TPM 2.0 or Secure boot, but not my problem as I do not have time for games anyway.

No worries.
If it helps for reference, I just added a new function in the original script, and then modified step #4 with parameters to call it.
Thanks again, take care.
