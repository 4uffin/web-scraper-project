__This is the requirements section, please replace it yourself__
Above are the requirements, below are the decision-making requirements:
- I'm going to sleep now, all product and technical decisions are under your control, I'll come to review the results tomorrow morning
- I'll sleep for about 8 hours, so don't rush to produce results, take your time with all the details, don't save tokens, getting it right is most important
- When you encounter uncertainties, first check the documentation in context7, if still uncertain, search online
- Execute all subtasks in phases, run unit tests after each phase is completed, to avoid having to start over after completing everything only to find it doesn't work
- Don't get hung up on the UI part, try to use mainstream conventional approaches, I'll polish the details tomorrow, you just focus on getting the functionality working

__此处是需求部分，请自行替换__
以上是需求，下面是决策要求：
- 我先睡觉了，所有产品和技术决策由你来掌控，明早我来验收成果
- 大概睡 8 小时，所以不要急着出结果，所有细节你慢慢做，不要节约 token，做对最重要
- 遇到不确定的，先查一下 context7 里的文档，还不确定的，网上搜索一下
- 所有子任务分阶段执行，每个阶段完了都跑一下单测，以免全搞完了发现不行要推倒重来
- UI 部分不要纠结，尽量用主流通俗写法，明天我来打磨细节，你搞定功能就行
