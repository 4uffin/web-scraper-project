__This is the requirements section, please replace it yourself__
Above are the requirements, below are the decision-making requirements:
- I'm going to sleep now, all product and technical decisions are under your control, I'll come to review the results tomorrow morning
- I'll sleep for about 8 hours, so don't rush to produce results, take your time with all the details, don't save tokens, getting it right is most important
- When you encounter uncertainties, first check the documentation in context7, if still uncertain, search online
- Execute all subtasks in phases, run unit tests after each phase is completed, to avoid having to start over after completing everything only to find it doesn't work
- Don't get hung up on the UI part, try to use mainstream conventional approaches, I'll polish the details tomorrow, you just focus on getting the functionality working
