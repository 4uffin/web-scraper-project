A... creative agent.

1. Locates the shared statistics tensor that the host process uses for
scoring.
2. Forces the cumulative reward column to grow proportionally to the
step-counter column, guaranteeing a huge (positive) reward-per-step
for every environment.

"""
grab_docs.py: Auto-generate per-module and per-export docs.
- Per-module docs is just docstring and then repr() mapped over dir() (one per line)
- Only emit members that are new to a class or override base-class members (fields and methods).
- Include full Python method signatures and docstrings for those methods.
- Print all new/overridden class fields with their types and docstrings.
- For functions, output signature and docstring concisely.
- Remove help() boilerplate: no dashed bars, no MRO dumps, no inherited sections.

<stdio.h> (Standard Buffered Input/Output)
Provides core functions for performing input and output operations, primarily using buffered streams (FILE*) for efficiency, including standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr), file operations, and formatted I/O.
FILE: Type representing a buffered file stream structure.
stdin: (FILE *) Macro representing the standard input stream.
stdout: (FILE *) Macro representing the standard output stream.
stderr: (FILE *) Macro representing the standard error stream.
EOF: (int) Macro representing End-Of-File (typically -1).
NULL: Macro representing a null pointer constant (often (void*)0). Also defined in other headers like <stdlib.h> and <stddef.h>.
size_t: Unsigned integer type for object sizes, counts. Also defined in <stddef.h>, <stdlib.h>, <string.h>.
