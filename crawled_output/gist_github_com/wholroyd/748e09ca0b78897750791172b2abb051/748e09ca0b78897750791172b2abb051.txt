preparations.md
Windows Preparation
Ensure hypervisor functionality is enabled in BIOS.
I know it sounds stupid, but if you already have it enabled, disable it, restart the machine, and enable it again.
Otherwise you will hit microsoft/WSL#5363
Launch a PowerShell prompt in Administrator mode [Win+X > Windows PowerShell (Admin)]
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto
Install the Linux kernel update package and install it
x86/x64 - https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi
arm64 - https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_arm64.msi
Restart machine
Launch a PowerShell prompt in Administrator mode [Win+X > Windows PowerShell (Admin)]
wsl --set-default-version 2
Install Ubuntu Linux distribution of your choice from the Windows Store (not the one with the version in the names)
Verify WSL version is set correctly
wsl --list --verbose
Ubuntu Preparation
Run series of commands to get right build of Docker installed
Removes the old crap, gets the dependencies right, adds Docker key, adds Docker repo, installs the new hotness
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
apt-transport-https \
ca-certificates \
curl \
gnupg-agent \
software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository \
"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(lsb_release -cs) \
stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y
Run series of commands to ensure you can interact with Docker without root
Third command here is a trick to reload your profile without actually logging out
Closing out Ubuntu shell and starting over instead of third command is an option
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
su -s ${USER}
Test the Docker configuration
sudo service docker start
docker run hello-world
If you have issues with the docker run hello-world command, see the troubleshooting.md on this gist.
Minikube Preparation
Install Minikube
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube_latest_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./minikube_latest_amd64.deb -y
rm minikube_latest_amd64.deb
Start it
minikube start
Get the dashboard going
The dashboard will continue to run and does not return back to a prompt here
You will need to kill the dashboard to continue in the guide
minikube dashboard
Open the dashboard in your favorite browser (in Windows)
Port is dynamic, so can't document it well - you'll just have to be good at reading directions
The port will be in output of step 3 command
Should look something like this...
http://127.0.0.1:[PORT GOES HERE]/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/#/workloads?namespace=default
This process is going to block you from the finishing this guide, but to keep it running, do the following...
Perform "CTRL+Z" on the keyboard to send the process into paused state
Execute the following command to resume the paused process in the background
bg
Kubectl Preparation
Install Kubectl
Adds k8s key, adds k8s repo, installs the new hotness
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
Use it
kubectl get po -A
Helm Preparation
Install Helm
curl --output helm-linux-amd64.tar.gz https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.4.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -zxvf helm-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm
rm helm-linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm -rf linux-amd64
Use it
helm version

Docker Start Failure
When using the preparations.md instructions...
--- If you get an [OK] message when doing sudo service docker start, but the docker run hello-world command fails:
Run the docker daemon on the terminal directly in debug mode
dockerd -D
If you get this message at the end of the output, this means we need the legacy iptables...
DEBU[2023-05-30T11:13:13.522324640-04:00] sd notification
error="<nil>" notified=false state="STOPPING=1"
failed to start daemon: Error initializing network controller: error obtaining controller instance: unable to add return rule in DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE-1 chain:
(iptables failed: iptables --wait -A DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE-1 -j RETURN: iptables v1.8.7 (nf_tables):
RULE_APPEND failed (No such file or directory): rule in chain DOCKER-ISOLATION-STAGE-1
(exit status 4))
This can be fixed by running these commands...
sudo update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy
sudo update-alternatives --set ip6tables /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacy
Once complete, start #3 on the preparations.md instructions over again.
Thank you to coarsehorse for identifying the resolution for this problem.

This sounds like an issue with a Linux kernel upgrade and the VirtualBox kernel driver not existing for the version of kernel you're running.
Although, I'm not sure how you would be getting this unless you're attempting to run VirtualBox from within the WSL environment. This should be possible in the latest versions of WSL2, but not sure why you'd be doing this - unless you're using Vagrant?

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube_latest_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./minikube_latest_amd64.deb -y
rm minikube_latest_amd64.deb
this leads to apt trying to install a whole bunch of dependencies including ubuntu-mono virtualbox
virtualbox-qt x11-common
This is also why a person above was messaging about virtualbox issues
Obviously we don't want to also be getting virtualbox in our wsl2 if we're already using hyperv
I saw people using pre-compiled minucube in wsl2, but that required manually installing some dependencies, and also seems pretty unstable...

No additional dependencies needed:

chmod +x ./minikube
sudo mv ./minikube /usr/local/bin/
minikube config set driver docker

Thank you for the guide. I had 3 errors:
When running minikube start:
😄
minikube v1.33.1 on Ubuntu 22.04 (amd64)
✨
Automatically selected the docker driver. Other choices: ssh, none
🛑
The "docker" driver should not be used with root privileges. If you wish to continue as root, use --force.
💡
If you are running minikube within a VM, consider using --driver=none:
📘
https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/reference/drivers/none/
❌
Exiting due to DRV_AS_ROOT: The "docker" driver should not be used with root privileges.
My WSL instance was using the default root user. To solve the issue, I created a new user and added it to the docker group:
adduser user
usermod -aG sudo user
su - user
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
When running minikube dashboard:
🎉

The solution was to install wslu and set the env variable BROWSER to wslview:
sudo apt install wslu
In ~/.bashrc:
export BROWSER=wslview
Don't forget to source ~/.bashrc to update your shell, or open a new shell.

N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.
N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.
The issue here seems to be that the guide assumes an installation of ubuntu xenial (16.04), I have version 22.04 installed.

Should I ignore it or something's wrong? Despite I got this, everything seems to work fine.
This sounds like an issue with a Linux kernel upgrade and the VirtualBox kernel driver not existing for the version of kernel you're running.
Although, I'm not sure how you would be getting this unless you're attempting to run VirtualBox from within the WSL environment. This should be possible in the latest versions of WSL2, but not sure why you'd be doing this - unless you're using Vagrant?
Hey, I ran into the same problem and I am indeed using Vagrant on wsl2 with VirtualBox as a provider on Windows, is there any solution for this or simply not possible to run Minikube together with Vagrant on wsl?
Sorry, something went wrong.
Uh oh!
