/ CoW_podman-docker_mounted_volume.md
Created
September 3, 2024 20:41
reflink can directly work with mounted volumes if the volumes are on the same host partition
reflink in mounted volume
podman run -v /data/devspace/dummy/test/A:/mnt/A:Z -v /data/devspace/dummy/test/B:/mnt/B:Z --rm -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash
following works fine
root@68ec02c9b450:/mnt# cp --reflink=always A/test10M.bin A/reflinked.bin
[dummy@host test]$ xfs_io -r -c 'fiemap' A/reflinked.bin

XFS reflinks vs btrfs snapshots
XFS reflinks vs BTRFS snapshots
reflinks in XFS
reflinks can be used as CoW mechanism for XFS since 4.17.0-2.el8
This feature enables two or more files to share a common set of data blocks. When either of the files sharing common blocks changes, XFS breaks the link to common blocks and creates a new file.
so with cp --reflink we can create CoW blocks already. This is similar to btrfs CoW.
We can simply do following to mimic the snapshot:
find /root -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -not -name "backup" -exec cp -r --reflink {} /root/backup/$(date)/ ;

docker just do not get along with libvirt, iptables, nptables, firewalld, etc
why my container isolation comes and gos? iptables, nptables, firewalld, who did what?!
there is almost NOT legacy iptables command (iptables) on modern OS (RHEL8, ubuntu22, etc)
there can still be some lagecy ip_tables module loaded:
lsb_release -d; lsmod | grep tables; iptables -V

how to autowrap the text in excel when export from pandas dataframe styler
The styler gives us a easy way to format the dataframe and maintain the format across different kind of output: html, excel, etc.
However, one of my friends has spot a problem of it, the styler.to_excel() output some how supressed some advanced formating of XlsxWriter. Here is an example:
import pandas as pd
data = pd.DataFrame({"A":list(range(10,12)), "B":["abcdefgafafadf", "afbafafafafadfadfadf"]})
with pd.ExcelWriter("/tmp/test.xlsx") as writer:
data.style.apply(lambda x: ['background-color: red']*2 if x['A']==11 else [None]*2, axis=1).to_excel(writer, index=False)
writer.sheets["Sheet1"].write(3, 1, "Some long text to wrap in a cell")
