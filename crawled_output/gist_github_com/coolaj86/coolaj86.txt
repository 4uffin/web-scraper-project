Fix Civ VI Crashing on macOS Apple Silicon
Updates
2025-01-27: Quite unexpectedly, it seems that just setting Memory to minimum will work
(unexpected because the error I get is about threads - CPUs)
Quick Fix
The "Performance Impact" has dozens of options. One or more of them is buggy on macOS and causes Civ VI to crash every few minutes.

AiScript Engineer (GPT)
Goal
Create a GPT that can assist me.
It should be able to write code in my style.
Write a "Hello World"-style REST API that uses reCAPTCHA for validation before allowing access to other API routes.

A Simple Demo using Google reCAPTCHA with Express, lovingly coaxed out of GPT4o with a heavy hand.
const express = require('express');
const AsyncRouter = require('@root/async-router');
const fetch = require('node-fetch'); // For making external API requests
const app = AsyncRouter.Router();
// Secret key for reCAPTCHA
const RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY';
app.post('/api/process-payment', async (req, res) => {

Notes on PCI Compliance
Copied from https://github.com/bnnanet/bnna-payment-gateway.js/issues/5 for the immediate benefit of others,
to be available as a Public gist until we make the whole repo public (once it's useful).
Key Takeaways
We should limit stored data to what's required for a specific, known business purposes
(not "just in case it's useful")
We may, for internal use, salt and hash the full credit card number (with per-vendor salts)
We MUST NOT expose that salt or hash via API
We may create a 1:1 mapping with a random (or otherwise unrelated) key and the salted hash
This is the user-facing identifier
