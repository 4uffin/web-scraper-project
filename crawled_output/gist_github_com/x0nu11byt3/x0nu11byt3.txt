In c, you could subtract 1 and do a bitwise-and. to make the calculation equivalent to the modulo.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main ( int argc, char** argvs ) {
int a = -127;
int b = 4;
int mod_ = a % b;
int mod_alt_a = a - b * ( a / b );
// mod_alt works as alternative to modulo
int mod_alt = a & ( b - 1 );

Harekaze mini CTF 2020
I played Harekaze Mini CTF 2020 for about 3 hours this weekend. The pwn challenges were nice (I especially enjoyed nm-game-extreme). Here are some short writeups.
shellcode
The program just tells you to provide shellcode that will execute execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL). It gives you the address of the "/bin/sh" string, so you just create shellcode to do the job and send it:
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import *
