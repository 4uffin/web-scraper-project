It's not very busy here, because I moved to GitLab. But I do still hang out in the Hub.

How to use Sonic Pi Snippets
Sonic Pi has an experimental, undocumented feature to support snippets, which autoexpand with the TAB key.
Here's the issue:
sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi#587
Specifically, Sam's comment:
sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi#587 (comment)
... [T]o play with it now (with the caveat that it all may drastically change) you just need to create a file with the contents of your snippet with an .sps extension in a directory somewhere on your machine. You might want to create a snippets directory for your own personal snippets. The name of the file doesn't matter. You then load all the snippets in a given directory with:
load_snippets("/path/to/snippets/dir")

Minecraft Pi Edition Python Coords vs Minecraft Debugging Coords
To fix your Minecraft world so that the coordinates displayed on the F3 debugging screen match what the MCPI API tells you with player.getPos() or player.getTilePos(), issue this Command in the game (requires Multiplayer, or a World generated with Cheat Codes enabled):
/setworldspawn 0 0 0
(to do this, press T or / and then type /setw followed by the TAB key, and then 0 0 0.
For some reason you can't type this command out in full on the Talk window.)
