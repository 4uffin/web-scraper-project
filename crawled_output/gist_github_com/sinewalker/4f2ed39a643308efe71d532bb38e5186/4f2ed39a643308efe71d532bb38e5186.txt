How to import pub/sec PGP keys from keybase to your local GPG keyring.

Import Keybase PGP to GPG
After installing the keybase command-line tool onto a new / fresh computer,
you may want to import your PGP key to the local keyring so that you may use the
keys with GPG.
Import your PUBLIC PGP key:
keybase pgp export|gpg --import -
For your SECRET PGP key, you have to be more assertive:
keybase pgp export -s|gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import -
You will then want to trust the keys as your own, so that GPG can be "sure"
they're safe to use
gpg --edit-key you@keybase.io

Seems to be a typo: gpg --edit-key you@keybase.io. However great material I always struggle to remember the Keybase dead simple syntax. ðŸ™‰

Thanks for this.
I needed to add export GPG_TTY=$(tty) to avoid error Inappropriate ioctl for device
