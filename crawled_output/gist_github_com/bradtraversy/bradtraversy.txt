Prostore Vercel Hobby Tier Fix
Vercel Hobby Tier Fix
If you are using the free "hobby" tier for Vercel, you may at some point get the following error:
Error: The Edge Function "middleware" size is 1.01 MB and your plan size limit is 1 MB. Learn More: https://vercel.link/edge-function-size
I had made a post to try and fix this by swapping out bcrypt for a custom password encrypt script, but it turns out that wasn't the best fix and didn't work in some cases. If you already did that, that's absolutely fine, but it's not needed.

Deploying To Vercel Hobby Tier
I did not realize this at the time of recording, but the full project is too large for Vercel's hobby plan. That is one of the drawbacks of having such a large course project, is there can be limitations for free hosting. If you deploy to the hobby plan, you may see the following message:
Error: The Edge Function "middleware" size is 1.01 MB and your plan size limit is 1 MB. Learn More: https://vercel.link/edge-function-size
One solution that we found is to remove the bcrypt-ts-edge package and use the built-in web crypto API to hash passwords. There are quite a few changes that we need to make, so you can follow along if you want to be able to deploy to the free teir of Vercel.
