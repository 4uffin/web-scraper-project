I usually have two nested byobu sessions, then I don't know how to send FX key commands to the second sessions. I tried with ctrl+a+a and the FX key but it doesn't work, any idea? thanks.

Try maybe with Shift-F12 to turn off the byobu in focus' keybindings ?
I suppose then the underlying byobu would receive them ?
If I end up in a nested session, for example a local byobu-session and one in an ssh session, I open a new ssh-session and do a byobu detach (either by firing up byobu and pressing Ctrl-a D or running byobu -d)

I almost always have to rely on Ctrl-a + [?] commands, as I don't seem to be able to use the function key shortcuts. Is there a list anywhere showing how to execute these commands using Ctrl-a rather than function keys?

Most important question:
After entering the Mondrian squares game.... how do you actually play it?
Doesn't seem to work.
Also, doesn't seem like an actual Mondrian squares game.
Inquiring minds really want to know.
How else are we supposed to waste time?

@sdeastham Ctrl-a + ? gives a list of current bindings. Use / to search through the many commands.

@dmp1ce Thanks for this! It also led me to the excellent menu resulting from Ctrl+>, which I recommend to anyone (like me) who can never remember exactly how to shift their panes around...

I am not able to Toggle f-keys on and off. I need to press F6 during kernel to save config, but everything I do detaches the session. I've tried shift+F12, and then ctrl+a+!
Shift+F12. How can I Toggle off F-keys so I can use F6 key without detaching a session?
Byobu tmux as backend.

For some reasons, from some terminals Shift + F12 works for me, in others it doesn't but F6 does work, so yes, very annoying. I had a look in the list of defined keybindings: ctrl+a : list-keys. There is reveals how the S-F12 works and you can "emulate it":
with ctrl+a,: you switch to command mode in tmux
and then you enter:
source-file /usr/share/byobu/keybindings/f-keys.tmux.disable
To later re-enable shortcuts (they are handy!)
ctrl+a : source-file /usr/share/byobu/keybindings/f-keys.tmux

Thanks for the reply, and it might be useful for someone, but this got me to using actual tmux, and now I'm not sure why I didn't just start off that way. Soo much documentation, and plugins out there from for tmux community that it's a lot easier to use actually...and best part, no F-key issues.
