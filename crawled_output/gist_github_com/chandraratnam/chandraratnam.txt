Mutt + isync mbsync + gmail + multiple accounts.
Mutt + isync multiple accounts Unfinished
This is the setup that I use for mutt, I have two google domain account (read as gmail) and an institution where I work and study account. This means I have two gmail accounts and one outlook 365 account that i want to sync and read via mutt.
I want to store all my email locally as I travel a lot and will be in countries without easy internet access. For this I use mbsync (iSync). As it can handle multiple account types easily and efficently.
The setup works this way
[Remote Mail Servers] <= mbsync => [Local Mail Folders]
