<title>Take this photo and enhance it into a professional LinkedIn headshot.
- Preserve the subject‚Äôs exact face shape, hairstyle, expression, and proportions‚Äîdo not alter or slim the body or features.
- Retain the natural hairstyle (messy is fine), just make it look clean and intentional with good lighting.
- Adjust the background to a neutral blurred studio style (light gray, soft white, or LinkedIn-blue tones).
- Improve lighting and sharpness so it looks like it was shot on a DSLR, with soft daylight on the face.
- Smooth out harsh shadows or blemishes slightly, but do not airbrush or change identity.
- Crop to square with shoulders and upper chest visible in natural proportions.
- Keep clothing natural to the original image‚Äîjust slightly enhance colors and contrast so they look sharp.</title>
