Retry failed emails sent by Wordpress
Wordpress plugin to retry failed emails
When using Wordpress wp_mail() function, there is no easy way to schedule retries, when the email fails to be sent.
There is probably a few plugins available that could handle this, but I didn't find any that would just do that.
And so, I decided to code it myself.
Of note: I added this code to a custom (unpublished) plugin I maintain. If you don't have your own plugin to add this to, either Google how to create your own Wordpress plugin, or use one of the numerous available plugins that allows you to inject (PHP) code in your Wordpress installation. As a last resort, you could add this code in your functions.php

Export TOTP tokens from Authy
Exporting your 2FA tokens from Authy to transfer them into another 2FA application
IMPORTANT - Update regarding deprecation of Authy desktop apps
Past August 2024, Authy stopped supported the desktop version of their apps:
See Authy is shutting down its desktop app | The 2FA app Authy will only be available on Android and iOS starting in August for details.
And indeed, after a while, Authy changed something in their backend which now prevents the old desktop app from logging in. If you are already logged in, then you are in luck, and you can follow the instructions below to export your tokens.
If you are not logged in anymore, but can find a backup of the necessary files, then restore those files, and re-install Authy 2.2.3 following the instructions below, and it should work as expected.
