DELETE FROM users WHERE location = 'IRAN';
Hi! I am an Iranian Software Engineer, and in this torn paper note, I want to talk about
some funny moments I had online related to the fact that I was spawned in this specific region of the world: Iran.
Microsoft deleted my app, ignored my mails
Back when I was a student, I got access to the Microsoft Imagine, and as a result, I got
access to the Microsoft Store as a developer. This inspired me write one of my open-source projects called EyesGuard
and publish it on Microsoft Store. However, one day, somebody told me that they can no longer find EyesGuard on the store.
I came to the realization that Microsoft deleted my app, my developer account, and all those comments on my app supporting me and suggesting
ideas on how to improve the program. I tried to contact the support and email whoever I could, but I was ghosted.
Nobody ever explained to me why, but I assume it's because of the sanctions.
Notion wiped me out of existence
Notion is a great product, and it was the primary tool I used to manage my personal notes. Not until they suddenly decided to
wipe out every data related to the users residing in Iran. Hopefully, they actually responded to my support message:
It was because of sanctions. However, they told me that they will not restore the data, even if I leave Iran someday:
That said, I am very happy with my own self-hosted Siyuan now.
Mike Cardwell kindly asked me to fuck off
I read hackernews on a daily basis and I visit lots of different websites regularly. I am almost always on my VPN as I am internally firewalled by
the government and externally shooed because of the sanctions, so I am probably missing some of these heart-warming messages:
Iranian IPs are blocked here, due to your decision to arm Russia with drones so that they can indiscriminately massacre civilians.
My VPN turned off, and opening https://www.grepular.com showed me this message. I actually do not blame the people who do this. I think there is
a fundamental misconception that people think because "Islamic Republic" has the word "Republic" in it, it must be a government of people in charge. That's not the case. I have yet to see anyone who actually supports Russian aggression in my real life in Iran.
Funny enough, Iran's history is full of backstabs by the Russian government.
I tried contacting the author by sending this email:
Hi Mark,
I hope this message finds you well.
While browsing HackerNews, I came across your website but was greeted with this message:
> Iranian IPs are blocked here, due to your decision to arm Russia with drones so that they can indiscriminately massacre civilians.
I wanted to clarify that the decision to support Russia does not represent the Iranian people. That "your decision" refers to the regime, a theocratic minority that rules Iran without democratic legitimacy. The people of Iran have long protested and revolted against this regime, but unfortunately, they face brutal suppression while unarmed.
In my experience, most Iranians around me, including myself, stand firmly with Ukraine and against Russian aggression.
I’m not asking you to reconsider the IP restriction, you have your reasons and I respect that. I simply wanted to share this perspective and express my solidarity with Ukraine.
Slava Ukraini!
Best regards,
Avestura
I got no replies from them, and I actually didn't expect one.
GitHub freaked me out
I woke up to the news that GitHub has removed the access of Iranians to their private repositories. Well, that was not good. I tried to launch my own self-hosted instance of Gitea to reduce the damage. However, later, GitHub announced that github is now available in Iran by securing a license from the US government, and we're now good. You see? The weather is good, the birds are singing, GitHub is free again. Fantastic!
GitLab freaked me out
Similarly, GitLab banned every account that once accessed from an Iranian IP, however, to this day, they never lifted the
ban, even on public repositories. I guess they couldn't secure a license from the US government, or they simply never cared.
Good luck to them in either case, though. GitLab is an amazing software. One can always self-host it.
List goes on
The list goes on, and almost all of the services you probabelly heard of is banned here: Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, ...),
Educational platforms (coursera, udemy, etc), Payment software (stripe, paypal, ...).
Lessons Learned for me
I don't think any of these companies have bad intentions towards any group of people. They are a business after all. They don't hate their customers; they are just playing the game, and the game has such rules.
But if someday some law or government forces me to prevent my services from a group, I'll think twice before writing those if statements. I'll try to have more empathy. People behind those screens are more important than just some rows in my tables.
Footnote
ImportantIn this text, I am NOT asking for the removal of
the sanctions targeted at the Islamic Republic of Iran. I am merely remembering some moments on top of my head.
For the record, I do not support
the actions of the Islamic Republic, and on the contrary, I am in favor of the movements that release the people from such
a mafia-like cult ruling a country with thousands of years of history.
The actions of the group in charge of Iran are not defensible, and as a matter of fact,
the people of Iran are the first layer of victims. Some examples are listed here.
I especially feel it differently, as regime thugs put a gun to the throat of a dear person to me, and threatened to kill him if he showed up in
protests.
By the way, did you know you could return 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons instead of 403 Forbidden when you're going to ban me next time?

I am sorry you had to experience the hypocrisy of the genocidal west.
All the love for the iranian people, hope that you will one day be liberated from your authoritarian regime.
PS: The US unfortunately also took the decision to arm and support Israel with bombs that indiscriminately massacre civilians. But i don't think its fair to use wording that blames anyone from a US ip address for the actions of their government.

This is mind-blowing. Well of-course if these open-source platforms are regulated by the government in someway, that much is to be expected. I apologize for the experience you had, buddy. I just can't imagine the gravity of such actions on the countries affected. I hope this doesn't continue.

He open-sourced an Eyes Guard software eight years ago, which is enough to prove that he is a real person. You may feel no compassion, but please do not kick him when he is down.

the people of Iran are the first layer of victims
This is only true if you view the problem from the inside, which is not the position most people would ever take.
From the perspective of your adversaries, every productivity you've gained, every achievement you've reached, is a threat, since it directly or indirectly contributes to the strength of the nation that you are living in. It's just that simple.
No right or wrong, nothing ideological, just cold blooded calculation, us as a whole v.s. them as a whole, that's all.
The sooner you realize this, the sooner you'll make peace of the world, at least you'll be less confused about it.

Hi Avestura,
I’m from Hong Kong, and I really resonate with your experience. Our situation is not exactly the same, but it feels similar in some ways.
When Hongkongers live in mainland China, we are not really welcomed. Locals treat us as outsiders. But when we use VPN to go online, the outside world usually just sees us as “mainlanders.” And in the eyes of the Chinese government, we’re not treated as locals either — more like “foreigners” inside our own home.
It’s a strange in-between space: not fully accepted inside, and misunderstood outside. That feeling of having no clear belonging, just because of politics and where you were born, is something I strongly relate to in your story.
Stay strong — you’re not alone in this. Respect from Hong Kong.

The economy is bullshit here, and it did hit me hard enough to not love my country anymore. I sold my laptop a while ago to get a new one, and guess what, the prices went high like a jet. Now I'm stuck because with the money I saved, now I can like get the same or even something more low level then my previous one. It is sure hard to experience this here, and then realize that every person outside the world judges us by the things we didn't do or even support.

Rise up. Yeah, rise up like you do for women, right? Like I already said, most of the IT junk rolling out of Iran is crawling with rats. Don’t believe me? Go peek at any cracked game you can find — it’s a circus of scams.
Bro, when your whole country is a breeding ground for scammers, what do you expect? The West to welcome you with cake and flowers? Please. The IT world has already split into three poles — the West, Russia, and Asia. Stop whining, stop crying about being “treated unfairly,” and just move your stuff to whichever pole you think you can actually survive in.

This is the consequences of supporting terrorism.
Dont get me wrong, im an iranian living in isfahan, most of Iranian people support state terrorism and public executions.
In those 12 days war between mullahs and israel we saw how oppositions of ayatollahs lick their boots and spread anti-semitism. Iranian people dont deserve more.

As an Iranian, I want to clarify something. People often assume sanctions against Iran started because of recent events like the Russia–Ukraine war, but most of these sanctions are decades old and rooted in much deeper political issues.
And as someone from Isfahan — the same city as my friend who made abow comment — I have to ask, what exactly is a “terrorist” that I’m supposed to be one too? :))

From what we’ve seen in our lifetime, “terrorism” isn’t defined by how many crimes someone commits — it’s only when they threaten U.S. interests that they suddenly get labeled a terrorist. (Al-Julani is just one example.)

So sorry for your predicament.
That is all I can do, for I cannot give you support, nor can I give you a solution.
Coming from Nigeria denial of service just based on region is all too common, just victim of circumstance.
But if someday some law or government forces me to prevent my services from a group, I'll think twice before writing those if statements I'll
try to have more empathy.
On this, I do not think you are having more empathy on the companies, for it cannot go against the law of the country where it resides, there is no thinking twice about that.
Somehow, survive, and good luck.

When you decided to refuse friendship with israel (the only democracy in the middle east) and spend all the oil money to the idea of killing all the jews (as your supreme leader said: final solution), when you fund houthies to make Bab al-Mandab Strait insecure for Shipping, when you use diplomatic immunity to ship Fenethylline across countries. When you want to be against world's tranquility.
When you threat the U.S. interests it can label you terrorist and dont exchange any goods with you. What is wrong with this logic? You threaten its citizens and its interests for 5 decades, why the U.S. should behave better than this with this failing nation?

thats the problem, maybe you should see beyond your lifetime. there is these things called HISTORY BOOKS and when you read those suddenly you are gifted the vision which can see a lot bigger than before bro at least first learn about the history of your country's so called politics then start criticizing others
The whole these anti-imperialism BS started after islamic revolution when islamists wanted to show toodeh party's followers (biggest communist party at the time) that we are more anti-imperialist than toodeh 🤡.
Even when U.S. and israel supplied weapons to iran against iraq in "iran contera" deal and wanted to be friend with mullahs, people started protesting and prevented mullahs to do so.

I really feel you man. Nothing we can do but wish ourselves the best and use open source tools as much as possible.
For people who say "Just leave Iran", I have to say one thing and one thing only. It is not as easy as you may think it would bee.
By the way, I've had similar experiances befor and even now.
I've got a braille display from somebody and this display is infact pritty old(from 2012). This display has a cell board problem which means that the hole cell board (where it displays everything in braille) had an overcurrent ran through it. Now I can't send it to South Korea (which is the only producer for the hims company that made these displays) to be able to either repeare it or get a riplacement for this display. That's how ... this country is.

I’m Sorry to inform you that the only fictional part in the words you wrote is most probably yourself:
You probably are a bot if you are supporting an authoritarian totalitarian regime that has been, is and will continue now even more brutally than ever as they are finding stronger allies to mass murder and keep suppressing more opposing forces without any code of morality!
You are unable to hold your attention to one subject too long because you are addicted to typing out comments just to have them out there even if you don’t know anything about the subject at hand.
In any case I find it disturbing enough: Comments like yours would be even filtered out by any logical bot algorithm as it will in the long and short term, significantly reduce its success rate in applying any engineered mass social media “gray area” campaigns!
Sorry, something went wrong.
