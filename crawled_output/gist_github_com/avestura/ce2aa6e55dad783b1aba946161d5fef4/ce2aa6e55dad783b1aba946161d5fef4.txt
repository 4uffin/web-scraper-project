DELETE FROM users WHERE location = 'IRAN';
Hi! I am an Iranian Software Engineer, and in this torn paper note, I want to talk about
some funny moments I had online related to the fact that I was spawned in this specific region of the world: Iran.
Microsoft deleted my app, ignored my mails
Back when I was a student, I got access to the Microsoft Imagine, and as a result, I got
access to the Microsoft Store as a developer. This inspired me write one of my open-source projects called EyesGuard
and publish it on Microsoft Store. However, one day, somebody told me that they can no longer find EyesGuard on the store.
I came to the realization that Microsoft deleted my app, my developer account, and all those comments on my app supporting me and suggesting
ideas on how to improve the program. I tried to contact the support and email whoever I could, but I was ghosted.
Nobody ever explained to me why, but I assume it's because of the sanctions.
Notion wiped me out of existence
Notion is a great product, and it was the primary tool I used to manage my personal notes. Not until they suddenly decided to
wipe out every data related to the users residing in Iran. Hopefully, they actually responded to my support message:
It was because of sanctions. However, they told me that they will not restore the data, even if I leave Iran someday:
That said, I am very happy with my own self-hosted Siyuan now.
Mike Cardwell kindly asked me to fuck off
I read hackernews on a daily basis and I visit lots of different websites regularly. I am almost always on my VPN as I am internally firewalled by
the government and externally shooed because of the sanctions, so I am probably missing some of these heart-warming messages:
Iranian IPs are blocked here, due to your decision to arm Russia with drones so that they can indiscriminately massacre civilians.
My VPN turned off, and opening https://www.grepular.com showed me this message. I actually do not blame the people who do this. I think there is
a fundamental misconception that people think because "Islamic Republic" has the word "Republic" in it, it must be a government of people in charge. That's not the case. I have yet to see anyone who actually supports Russian aggression in my real life in Iran.
Funny enough, Iran's history is full of backstabs by the Russian government.
I tried contacting the author by sending this email:
Hi Mark,
I hope this message finds you well.
While browsing HackerNews, I came across your website but was greeted with this message:
> Iranian IPs are blocked here, due to your decision to arm Russia with drones so that they can indiscriminately massacre civilians.
I wanted to clarify that the decision to support Russia does not represent the Iranian people. That "your decision" refers to the regime, a theocratic minority that rules Iran without democratic legitimacy. The people of Iran have long protested and revolted against this regime, but unfortunately, they face brutal suppression while unarmed.
In my experience, most Iranians around me, including myself, stand firmly with Ukraine and against Russian aggression.
I’m not asking you to reconsider the IP restriction, you have your reasons and I respect that. I simply wanted to share this perspective and express my solidarity with Ukraine.
Slava Ukraini!
Best regards,
Avestura
I got no replies from them, and I actually didn't expect one.
GitHub freaked me out
I woke up to the news that GitHub has removed the access of Iranians to their private repositories. Well, that was not good. I tried to launch my own self-hosted instance of Gitea to reduce the damage. However, later, GitHub announced that github is now available in Iran by securing a license from the US government, and we're now good. You see? The weather is good, the birds are singing, GitHub is free again. Fantastic!
GitLab freaked me out
Similarly, GitLab banned every account that once accessed from an Iranian IP, however, to this day, they never lifted the
ban, even on public repositories. I guess they couldn't secure a license from the US government, or they simply never cared.
Good luck to them in either case, though. GitLab is an amazing software. One can always self-host it.
List goes on
The list goes on, and almost all of the services you probabelly heard of is banned here: Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, ...),
Educational platforms (coursera, udemy, etc), Payment software (stripe, paypal, ...).
Lessons Learned for me
I don't think any of these companies have bad intentions towards any group of people. They are a business after all. They don't hate their customers; they are just playing the game, and the game has such rules.
But if someday some law or government forces me to prevent my services from a group, I'll think twice before writing those if statements. I'll try to have more empathy. People behind those screens are more important than just some rows in my tables.
Footnote
ImportantIn this text, I am NOT asking for the removal of
the sanctions targeted at the Islamic Republic of Iran. I am merely remembering some moments on top of my head.
For the record, I do not support
the actions of the Islamic Republic, and on the contrary, I am in favor of the movements that release the people from such
a mafia-like cult ruling a country with thousands of years of history.
The actions of the group in charge of Iran are not defensible, and as a matter of fact,
the people of Iran are the first layer of victims. Some examples are listed here.
I especially feel it differently, as regime thugs put a gun to the throat of a dear person to me, and threatened to kill him if he showed up in
protests.
By the way, did you know you could return 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons instead of 403 Forbidden when you're going to ban me next time?

I feel very concerned that these companies are censoring users and deleting their work because of their nationality.I hope they do something similar about wars happening in other regions of the world
People are being killed and starved every day in Gaza, but no actions are being from companies in the IT industy

@neyuki Russia did zero for Iran when american bombers recently bombed nuclear sites and while israeli airforce wiped out air defence all over Iran. Zero. For all the Shakheds and ballistic missiles and support that Iran's government expressed for Putin's war.
For the "concrete list of examples" it's insightful to talk to LLMs (Alice or ChatGPT or even Deepseek).

We live in bad times, being ruled by weak people. New war starts every month. What can we do? P.S. Iranian people beware, US and Israel are planning a new war against your country soon.
Against your regime you meant, right? And you are not blaming Israel for trying to defense itself with preventive actions before THE regime gets nuclear, right, @kshcherban ?
Of course @jvmlet , against regime for the good, but they will kill hundreds of thousands of civilians. Just a collateral damage, nothing personal.
I guess Russian propaganda tells that they are fighting against Ukrainian regime, bla, bla.

As an Iranian developer who has just begun the journey of migration, I have some bad news for you.
This issue isn’t only about geography or location. Even after leaving Iran, you still face many similar problems.
Even when it comes to basic life necessities—like having a bank account or simply opening a personal account on different services—you’ll encounter problems. Of course, there are workarounds, but with my Iranian identity, I’ve still experienced the same difficulties. While others can access basic services with just a few clicks, Iranians often have to struggle for days or even months and still look for ways to bypass restrictions.

One more reason why we should own ALL OF OUR DATA that is stored in the company DB's. Thats why ideas like Solid (Social Linked Data) and Pods ("Personal Online Datastores") should be the norm in future.
Someone doesn't want you on their servers? Good, I'll just find someone else and give them the access to that particular data, and move on.

I loved the post and let me tell you, I left Iran more than 4 years ago (it's way harder to leave than you can imagine) and my initial spawn point still haunts me to this day.
I cannot go to the US and that's just normal, I've already accepted it, also that blows away all the possible work oppurtunities there.
I've already said goodbye to loans/mortgages because I've been denied many times solely based on my citizenship, and I've learned to be a good sport about it and usually crack a joke because I understand for many people it's hard to say the 4 bitter words "because you are Iranian".
It gets tiring to explain everytime that the views of those who issued my passport does not reflect mine. Also I always get randomly selected for a search in border control at the airports and according to them, it's totally random, which is not.
I've got a fun story too, some years ago I ordered a binance card and stupidly, lost it, asked for a new one and only then they understood that somehow my account should not have been made in the first place, let alone having a card, thankfully they let me extract the funds!
Anyway, tough luck I guess.

Yes, people suffer from the decisions their government makes.
If this becomes intolerable, it's up to them to create a new governance. The people of Iran have yet to do it, or honestly really show very much will for it to happen, even. I don't have the sympathetic bandwidth for a people that don't even seem to want to help themselves. As a whole (in general), the people of Iran have sat back and watched as their evil government spreads terror and hate throughout the world. No popular sustained backlash. You even have a well known Iranian who is ready, willing, and able to take charge, and yet you don't hear a peep from Iranian people about it.
I hope for a different future, but I'm not going to hold my breath. It's up to you guys.

In theory yes and actually that's one of the better things you can do, but everything's good until it isn't. Also it's not exactly applicable in many cases.

Essentially your ruled out of the free world tools, services. Cause these tools cannot detect your intent, do you work for the regime or not.
The idea is also this pushses more people more against their regime (no more western wodka for russia), which is often a bit of a simple thought as people starring into a gun cannot reject commands. At least the regime (even if your not into it) cannt make use of it. As for running offgrid you might organize and use meshtastic it wont be easy to let the regime fall, same for russia, north korea, and trump, dictators are a weird breed on this planet sadly and hard to get rid off. As people we're not against people in the regime's we're against their dictators.
She at a punishment to your regime but dont take it personally, maybe it makes you feel better neither your regime can use it.

Free to leave if
We have the money to do so. We have the weakest currency in the world: https://www.madisontrust.com/information-center/visualizations/strongest-and-weakest-currencies-in-world-compared-to-us-dollar/ and mind you the data is not up to date, since right now more than 1 million Rial is equal to 1 Dollar. Even rich guys can't leave that easily, much less your average citizen.
We get a visa. Not only we have one the weakest passports in the world (97th): https://www.henleyglobal.com/passport-index/ranking but also due to sanctions, etc, many countries are not even willing to give a visa. That includes things like job seeker visa, student visa, etc.
Even if you leave :
You are not getting any skilled job and even cannot pursue your studies either. I know, since I am an Iranian who went to Germany, studied my Master and my PhD applications was rejected, on the basis of export control against Iranian. Out of over 80 job application, I didn't get a single interview. And this is not just me, other Iranians are treated no differently. Europe is open, indeed!
