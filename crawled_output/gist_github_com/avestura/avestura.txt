DELETE FROM users WHERE location = 'IRAN';
DELETE FROM users WHERE location = 'IRAN';
Hi! I am an Iranian Software Engineer, and in this torn paper note, I want to talk about
some funny moments I had online related to the fact that I was spawned in this specific region of the world: Iran.
Microsoft deleted my app, ignored my mails
Back when I was a student, I got access to the Microsoft Imagine, and as a result, I got
access to the Microsoft Store as a developer. This inspired me write one of my open-source projects called EyesGuard
and publish it on Microsoft Store. However, one day, somebody told me that they can no longer find EyesGuard on the store.

Test yara rules
YARA Rules Tests
We have two folders called:
yararules: here we put our custom yara rules
yararules.test: here we put the test cases for the yararules custom yaras
For each .yar file inside the yararules folder, we should create a folder with the same name as the yara file inside the yararules.test/testcases folder.
If the test case file starts with ok-* it means that the file should not match the yara file.

Written by @trgwii, not me:
Why Go is bad?
"If Go wasn't made by Google, what would be bad about it?" Stafn asked.
And this is the response from Thomas:
