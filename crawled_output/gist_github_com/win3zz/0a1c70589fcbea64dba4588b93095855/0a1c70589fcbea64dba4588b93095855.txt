GitHub Search Syntax for Finding API Keys/Secrets/Tokens
As a security professional, it is important to conduct a thorough reconnaissance. With the increasing use of APIs nowadays, it has become paramount to keep access tokens and other API-related secrets secure in order to prevent leaks. However, despite technological advances, human error remains a factor, and many developers still unknowingly hardcode their API secrets into source code and commit them to public repositories. GitHub, being a widely popular platform for public code repositories, may inadvertently host such leaked secrets. To help identify these vulnerabilities, I have created a comprehensive search list using powerful search syntax that enables the search of thousands of leaked keys and secrets in a single search.
Search Syntax:
(path:*.{File_extension1} OR path:*.{File_extension-N}) AND ({Keyname1} OR {Keyname-N}) AND (({Signature/pattern1} OR {Signature/pattern-N}) AND ({PlatformTag1} OR {PlatformTag-N}))
Examples:
1. OpenAI API keys
(path:*.xml OR path:*.json OR path:*.properties OR path:*.sql OR path:*.txt OR path:*.log OR path:*.tmp OR path:*.backup OR path:*.bak OR path:*.enc OR path:*.yml OR path:*.yaml OR path:*.toml OR path:*.ini OR path:*.config OR path:*.conf OR path:*.cfg OR path:*.env OR path:*.envrc OR path:*.prod OR path:*.secret OR path:*.private OR path:*.key) AND (access_key OR secret_key OR access_token OR api_key OR apikey OR api_secret OR apiSecret OR app_secret OR application_key OR app_key OR appkey OR auth_token OR authsecret) AND ("sk-" AND (openai OR gpt))
Update: We can use following refined regular expression to filters out most dummy keys:
... AND (/sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{48}/ AND (openai OR gpt))
Special thanks to @fkulakov for the insightful contribution.
Screeenshot:
2. Github OAuth/App/Personal/Refresh Access Token
(path:*.xml OR path:*.json OR path:*.properties OR path:*.sql OR path:*.txt OR path:*.log OR path:*.tmp OR path:*.backup OR path:*.bak OR path:*.enc OR path:*.yml OR path:*.yaml OR path:*.toml OR path:*.ini OR path:*.config OR path:*.conf OR path:*.cfg OR path:*.env OR path:*.envrc OR path:*.prod OR path:*.secret OR path:*.private OR path:*.key) AND (access_key OR secret_key OR access_token OR api_key OR apikey OR api_secret OR apiSecret OR app_secret OR application_key OR app_key OR appkey OR auth_token OR authsecret) AND (("ghp_" OR "gho_" OR "ghu_" OR "ghs_" OR "ghr_") AND (Github OR OAuth))
3. Slack Token

5. Square OAuth/access token
(path:*.xml OR path:*.json OR path:*.properties OR path:*.sql OR path:*.txt OR path:*.log OR path:*.tmp OR path:*.backup OR path:*.bak OR path:*.enc OR path:*.yml OR path:*.yaml OR path:*.toml OR path:*.ini OR path:*.config OR path:*.conf OR path:*.cfg OR path:*.env OR path:*.envrc OR path:*.prod OR path:*.secret OR path:*.private OR path:*.key) AND (access_key OR secret_key OR access_token OR api_key OR apikey OR api_secret OR apiSecret OR app_secret OR application_key OR app_key OR appkey OR auth_token OR authsecret) AND (("sq0atp-" OR "sq0csp-") AND (square OR OAuth))

For openai api_keys, you can use this regular expression to filter out most dummies:
AND (/sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{48}/ AND (openai OR gpt))
instead of
AND ("sk-" AND (openai OR gpt))

Create a list of the leaked secret keys and then run them through this function to quickly check which ones are valid.
keys = [
secret keys here...
]
for key, i in zip(keys, range(len(keys))):
try:
client = OpenAI(api_key=key)
chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
messages=[
{
"role": "user",
"content": "Say this is a test",
}
],
model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
)
print("response",i, chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
except Exception as e:
print("error", i, str(e))
continue

Here’s a Node.js script that takes a list of your keys, checks each against the OpenAI models API, and prints whether each key is VALID or INVALID:
import fetch from "node-fetch";
const keys = [
"xyz1234567890abcdefg", // Replace with your actual API keys
"abc9876543210fedcba", // Add more keys as needed
];
async function verifyKey(apiKey) {
try {
const res = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/models", {
method: "GET",
headers: {
Authorization: Bearer ${apiKey}
}
});
if (res.status === 200) {
return { key: apiKey, status: "✅ VALID" };
} else if (res.status === 401) {
return { key: apiKey, status: "❌ INVALID" };
} else {
return { key: apiKey, status: `⚠️ ERROR: ${res.status}` };
}
} catch (err) {
return { key: apiKey, status: ⚠️ ERROR: ${err.message} };
}
}
(async () => {
console.log("Checking API keys...\n");
for (const key of keys) {
const result = await verifyKey(key);
console.log(${result.key} -> ${result.status});
}
})();
