Bypass disable-devtool
Bypass disable-devtool
(Working as of 2025-02-09)
There are websites that use disable-devtool to prevent you from opening or using devtools. They typically prevent you from right clicking or using the keyboard shortcut to open devtools. Even if you successfully do so, they detect it and redirect you elsewhere. You can bypass this by using one of the following ways.
Opening devtools
If the shortcut F12 on Windows or Option + ⌘ + I on Mac do not work. Press the three vertically aligned dots in the top right corner of your Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge window. Under the section "More Tools", you'll see the option to select "Developer Tools" which opens the toolkit in your window.
