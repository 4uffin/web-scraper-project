Move your BTRFS /home subvolume to a new disk
Move your BTRFS /home subvolume to a new disk
Or in my case, to many disks. I have 4x Samsung 990 Drives that I want to setup in RAID10 with BTRFS and move my /home directory over to these disks. Here are the steps I took to get everything setup and moved over. I went with RAID10 on BTRFS, but you can use this guide to move any subvolume to a new disk, whatever the setup might be.
All of this was done on Fedora 38 workstation. Your millage may vary.
WARNING: BACKUP YOUR DATA BEFORE DOING THIS!
Seriously, back up your data first if you care about it. I use restic and my fancy restic-systemd-units to take incremental backups to my TrueNAS Scale server and to a local secondary hard drive in my workstation. I will probably be moving to incremental local backups with snapper in the future.
