Using these keys in a production environment is like driving a stolen car right by a police station. Can it be done? Yes. Is it legal? Absolutely not.
I occasionally use these keys for tasks in my home lab for personal use, that's it.

I think the problem will not come from vmware, as you always can use firewalls to stop the vmware telemetric trafic, but if you have any kind of inspection in yous business... it's another kind of big problem
