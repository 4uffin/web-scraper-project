putty experience
---------------------------------------------------------
You’re on Windows 11, using PuTTY and mRemoteNG.
With PuTTY: your saved session works fine → passwordless login succeeds.
With mRemoteNG: using the same saved PuTTY session, you get:
Connection failed!
Access is denied
That means the issue isn’t on CentOS anymore (since PuTTY proves the key login works). The problem is on the Windows client side, specifically how mRemoteNG handles PuTTY sessions and authentication.

kill-chain model
============================================================================
The kill-chain model, originally developed by Lockheed Martin as the Cyber Kill Chain, is a framework that helps Security Operations Center (SOC) engineers analyze cyberattacks in a structured way. It breaks down an attack into stages, allowing SOC engineers to understand, detect, and respond effectively.
How a SOC Engineer Uses the Kill-Chain Model
SOC engineers use the kill-chain model to:
Detect Threats Earlier: By recognizing attack patterns at different stages, they can stop an attack before it progresses.
Improve Incident Response: Helps prioritize threats based on their progression within the chain.

xdr cheat sheet
#======================================================================
To make an informed decision on purchasing an XDR product, you need a structured approach to evaluating vendors and ensuring the solution meets your security needs. Here's how you can organize the process effectively:
1. Define Evaluation Goals & Success Criteria
Establish clear objectives for adopting an XDR solution (e.g., better threat detection, improved response automation).
Identify key security gaps that need addressing.
Define measurable success criteria for the evaluation (e.g., ease of integration, accuracy of threat detection, response time).
