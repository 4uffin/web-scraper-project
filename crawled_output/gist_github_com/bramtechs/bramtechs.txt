Add Debian 12 to 13 contribution
Upgrade Debian 9 (current WSL) to Debian 12 (bookworm testing)
Note: I do not maintain this gist anymore, but people report that it still works. Please check the comments for any revisions or extra things you should take into consideration.
As of writing, the Debian distro for WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is quite old.
You can get more up-to-date package managers, text-editors and compilers by upgrading WSL to Debian 12 (current testing).
Root required
Use at your own risk, preferably on a fresh installation.
