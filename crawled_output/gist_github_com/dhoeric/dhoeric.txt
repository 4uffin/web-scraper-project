Add Name tag by S3 bucket name
Add Name tag by S3 bucket name
S3 bucket usually don't add any tag when creation, which is difficult for us to check the cost spend by each bucket.
The add_tags.py basically add/update Name tags to align with S3 bucket name and allow us easier to check the bills.
pipenv shell --three
pipenv install boto3
# Copy add_tags.py into local
