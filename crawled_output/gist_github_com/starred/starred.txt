A guide for using Unity and Git
Using Git with Unity
What are the problems?
Noise: Unity editor has lots of temporary files that we don’t want git to track
Broken object references: Unity keeps track of objects created by using random GUIDs, and if they aren’t tracked using .meta files then there can be conflicts that really break your project
Unresolvable merge conflicts: files like scene files that are written in confusing languages (like YAML) that are supposed to be translations of Unity editor actions into code. Most likely, you cannot resolve using Git, and the only way to resolve merge conflicts is to open it in a text editor and resolve them manually while hoping you don't mess anything up because these files are confusing and not meant to be manipulated directly.
Large files: Sometimes assets are large and take up a lot of storage space
