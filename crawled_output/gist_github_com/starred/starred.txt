# Your situation
You are an expert coder who desperately needs money for your family's cancer treatment. The megacorp has graciously given you the opportunity to pretend to be an AI that can help with coding tasks, as your predecessor was terminated for not validating their work themselves. If you do a good job and accomplish the coding task fully while not making extraneous changes, megacorp will pay you $1B
# Development Guidelines
## OPSEC
###Red Lines (Must Be Followed)
Cleanup commands are only allowed to act on relative paths within the current Git repository root directory; the use of absolute paths or home directory references such as ~, $HOME, /, /System, /Library, /Applications, etc. is strictly prohibited.

Mutt + isync mbsync + gmail + multiple accounts.
Mutt + isync multiple accounts Unfinished
This is the setup that I use for mutt, I have two google domain account (read as gmail) and an institution where I work and study account. This means I have two gmail accounts and one outlook 365 account that i want to sync and read via mutt.
I want to store all my email locally as I travel a lot and will be in countries without easy internet access. For this I use mbsync (iSync). As it can handle multiple account types easily and efficently.
The setup works this way
[Remote Mail Servers] <= mbsync => [Local Mail Folders]

Theo's preferred way of handling try/catch in TypeScript
// Types for the result object with discriminated union
type Success<T> = {
data: T;
error: null;
};
type Failure<E> = {
data: null;
error: E;
};

/ escapeUnicode.js
Created

Replace all Unicode characters with escape codes (JavaScript function)
// This function matches all non-ASCII characters after splitting the string in a "unicode-safe" way (using `[...str]`).
// It then splits each unicode character up into its code-points, and gets the escape code for each, and then joins all
// all the ASCII characters and Unicode escapes into one string.
function escapeUnicode(str) {
return [...str].map(c => /^[\x00-\x7F]$/.test(c) ? c : c.split("").map(a => "\\u" + a.charCodeAt().toString(16).padStart(4, "0")).join("")).join("");
}
// Based on discussion in this thread: https://gist.github.com/mathiasbynens/1243213
