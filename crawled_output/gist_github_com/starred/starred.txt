DELETE FROM users WHERE location = 'IRAN';
Hi! I am an Iranian Software Engineer, and in this torn paper note, I want to talk about
some funny moments I had online related to the fact that I was spawned in this specific region of the world: Iran.
Microsoft deleted my app, ignored my mails
Back when I was a student, I got access to the Microsoft Imagine, and as a result, I got
access to the Microsoft Store as a developer. This inspired me write one of my open-source projects called EyesGuard
and publish it on Microsoft Store. However, one day, somebody told me that they can no longer find EyesGuard on the store.

Mark GitHub notifications as read
I've needed to do this several times to combat "ghost" notifications. These occur when a discussion is created and then deleted (e.g. for spam) before the notofication is read. You may see something like "1-0 of 4" at the bottom of the notifications page.
You can use the GitHub API client to show these notifications:
gh api notifications
To mark all notifications as read, send the API request below with curl. (Update the last_read date as needed.)
