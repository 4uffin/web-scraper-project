Segmentation fault (core dumped): how to diagnose and fixing?
Here the good methodologies to find and fix segmentation fault errors
Compile you program using the -g -O0 gcc-switch, or add options to string CFLAGS and/or CXXFLAGS in Makefile.
Then use gdb (if need - pass command argument using --args option): gdb --args ./proxmark3 /dev/ttyACM0
Use some gdb magic:
(gdb) run
<segfault happens here>
(gdb) backtrace
