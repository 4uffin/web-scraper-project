Raw
README.md
This is just a dump of some interesting undocumented features of webOS (3.8 specifically, on early 2018 4k LG TV) and other development-related tips.
Homebrew app ideas
OpenVPN frontend (OpenVPN itself is easily buildable and runs on webOS TVs: https://discord.com/channels/407937994037919756/835489130967859251/906943542457401395)
App autostart manager - dynamically update arbitrary app config and register it as input (see Registering an app as an input)
webos-vncserver frontend with autostart option
Package hyperiond into Piccap directly
Quick Screenshot (expose HTTP port that just returns PNG of current screen contents)
Custom IR remote codes editor/updater/blaster
Input auto-switcher with fallback display, display auto power on/off on input
Receiving DIAL/SSDP
Any installed application can receive DIAL start requests by adding "dialAppName": "NAME" in its appInfo.json.
YouTube and Netflix apps have some special handling, but they still can be overriden by an unofficial app.
IMPORTANT: official YouTube app has "dialAppName": "youtube". Installed apps are (or rather seem to be) ordered lexicographically based on their IDs - when multiple apps declare the same dialAppName the last one will be the one triggered via DIAL. (com.youtube.adfree < youtube.leanback.v4 < youtube.leanforward)
TV Input embedding
Web apps can embed connected inputs surface in their DOM:
<video autoplay style="width:50%;height:50%">
<source type="service/webos-external" src="ext://hdmi:1"></source>
</video>
Supported sources: ext://hdmi:1, ext://hdmi:2, ext://hdmi:3, ext://hdmi:4, ext://comp:1, ext://av:1, ext://av:2.
Additionally TV stream can be embedded with src="tv://" and type="service/webos-broadcast"
Seems like only a single external input can be displayed at the same time. (at least on my TV, equivalent to multiview limitations)
Registering an app as an input (can be used to autostart an app)
Following needs to be added to appinfo.json:
"supportGIP": true
largeIcon needs to be set (otherwise eim just crashes)
When starting up an app following call needs to be executed to register it:
webOS.service.request("luna://com.webos.service.eim", {
method: "addDevice",
parameters: {
"appId": "org.webosbrew.hbchannel", // your application ID, required
"pigImage": "", // required, preview image rendered in "All inputs", relative to main application directory, can be just an empty string
"mvpdIcon": "", // required on webOS <3.x
"type": "MVPD_IP", // optional, no idea (can be MVPD_IP or MVPD_RF)
"showPopup": true, // optional, shows a toast with info that default input has been changed to label
"label": "application name", // optional, used in toast message only
"description": "testing", // optional, description rendered in "All inputs"
},
onSuccess: function (res) { console.info('success:',res); },
onFailure: function (res) { console.info('failure:', res); }
});
luna://com.webos.service.eim/deleteDevice {"appId":"..."} call can be used to unregister an app.
This also works over luna-send-pub for any app, as long as its appinfo.json is properly set up, in case anyone wants to debug this manually. (source app ID is not verified)
Userscripts in apps
Userscript present in webOSUserScripts/userScript.js will be loaded as a userscript in app webviews / frames. (including frames in origins outside of app root)
Example app: https://github.com/FriedChickenButt/youtube-webos
WebAppMgr User-Agent change
Add the following to appinfo.json:
{
"vendorExtension": {
"userAgent":"$browserName$/$browserVersion$ ($platformName$-$platformVersion$), _TV_$chipSetName$/$firmwareVersion$ (LG, $modelName$, $networkMode$)"
},
"trustLevel": "netcast"
}
Note: No idea what trustLevel actually means - it seems to somewhat change supported web APIs and makes window.PalmServiceBridge unavailable. (launch params are in window.launchParams)
WebAppMgr - Disabling CORS enforcement
In order to disable CORS enforcement use:
{
"vendorExtension": {
"allowCrossDomain": true
},
"trustLevel": "netcast"
}
Invisible apps
Apps with "visible": false can be launched and have their services accessed, but they don't show up on main screen.
Note: LG Content Store is periodically queried for software updates of all installed applications (including homebrew/developer and system apps, app ids and versions are transmitted)
Multiview app
At least on my TV multiview doesn't seem to be officially supported anywhere in the UI.
Yet still - it can be launched via telnet when rooted: /usr/bin/com.webos.app.multiview.
This can possibly be wrapped in a proper app.
State monitoring
# Suspend / resume
luna-send -i 'luna://com.webos.service.tvpower/power/getPowerState' '{"subscribe":true}'
# Currently running application
luna-send -i 'luna://com.webos.applicationManager/getForegroundAppInfo' '{"subscribe":true}'
Injecting mitmproxy CA
Note: see Filesystem overlays below, /usr/share/ca-certificates/sdp + /etc/ssl/certs
mkdir -p /tmp/overlayfs/upper /tmp/overlayfs/work && mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=/etc/ssl/,upperdir=/tmp/overlayfs/upper/,workdir=/tmp/overlayfs/work/ overlay-ssl /etc/ssl/
cd /etc/ssl/certs
curl http://mitm.it/cert/pem > mitmproxy.crt
ln -s mitmproxy.crt $(openssl x509 -in /etc/ssl/certs/mitmproxy.crt -subject_hash_old -noout).0
cat mitmproxy.crt >> trusted_cas.crt
cat mitmproxy.crt >> ca-certificates.crt
# Also TODO: /usr/share/ca-certificates/sdp
Extra note: TVs have their own (Multiple) Client Keys (and certificates), that are used for mutual TLS authentication by some remote services. They are stored securely, and there's no way to Read them.
Disable "Wedge" / "My Content" / promotion bar on home screen
luna-send -n 1 -f luna://com.webos.service.config/setConfigs '{"configs":{"com.webos.service.favoriteservice.enableWedge": false}}'`
(note: this only persists, if *.lgtvsdp.com traffic is blocked)
Increase pmlogd logging
By default pmlogdaemon logs only topics listed in /etc/PmLogDaemon/whitelist.txt. To enable all logging use:
luna-send -n 1 -f 'luna://com.webos.pmlogd/setdevlogstatus' '{"recordDevLogs":false}'
luna-send -n 1 -f 'luna://com.webos.pmlogd/getdevlogstatus' '{}'
# After enabling all devlogs specific contexts can be adjusted using PmLogCtl
PmLogCtl set '*' 'debug'
# Newer webOS:
luna-send -n 1 -f luna://com.webos.service.config/setConfigs '{"configs": {"system.collectDevLogs": true}}'
luna-send -n 1 -f luna://com.webos.service.config/getConfigs '{"configNames":["system.collectDevLogs"]}'
(note: you most probably want to disable rdxd first, as per rootmytv immutable mounts...)
(also: i got a tip this doesn't work anymore on newer webos/pmlogd versions)

# List connected clients

todo: research what's the actual encoding scheme
When enabling magic remote IR control of appliances LG's services are accessed to download new keycodes. These are then stored in /mnt/lg/user/irdbmanager (oss_audio_append_db.txt and setting/oss_setting_info_audio.txt). Some default codes are also present in /usr/share/irdbmanager.
Nice potentially hackable apps
My starter (triggered by pressing clock on home screen) → /usr/palm/applications/com.webos.app.mystarter/qml/main.qml
Screensaver (fireworks) → /usr/palm/applications/com.webos.app.screensaver/qml/main.qml
Home screen layout → seems like all .qml files are bundled in surface-manager-starfish (managed to extract it without filenames with binwalk - someone needs to make some qt resources unpacker) - but it also accepts an env variable with custom .qml startup file.
Custom Magic Remote cursors
Cursors are rendered by surface-manager-starfish (surface-manager upstart service), and are loaded from /usr/share/im.
cursorTypeAszMstN.png is the default "idle" medium-sized cursor. S/M/L in that filename is cursor size. /usr/share/im needs to be mounted/overlaid early on in the boot process (needs testing), or surface-manager needs to be manually restarted after applying the patch. Stays on between suspends when Quick Start+ is enabled. Filesystem overlay like below can be used.

luna-send -i -f luna://com.webos.appInstallService/dev/install '{"id":"com.limelight.webos","ipkUrl":"/media/internal/downloads/app.ipk","subscribe":true}'
App launch via shell
luna-send -n 1 -f luna://com.webos.service.applicationManager/launch '{"id":"com.webos.app.screensaver"}'
Screenshot
luna-send -n 1 -f 'luna://com.webos.service.tv.capture/executeOneShot' '{"path":"/tmp/capture.png","method":"DISPLAY","format":"PNG"}'
# Supported formats: BMP, JPG, PNG, RGB, RGBA, YUV422
# Supported methods: SCREEN/DISPLAY (alias?), SCREEN_WITH_SOURCE_VIDEO, VIDEO, GRAPHIC, SOURCE/SCALER (alias?)
# Note: com.webos.service.tv.capture above has been renamed to com.webos.service.capture on some devices, call signature is the same.
(Note: this is also available over SSAP as: ssap://tv/executeOneShot - returns imageUri attribute with HTTP link)
Factory mode / instart / instop...
Don't fuck with this. You WILL most probably brick your TV.
# -> binwalk -e /usr/bin/surface-manager-starfish && grep -Ri factory *.extracted

# Alternative irKeys: powerOnly, inStart, ezAdjust, inStop, pCheck, sCheck, tilt
# ezAdjust is service menu 1
# inStart is service menu 2
# inStop is factory reset (?)
# pCheck will override some picture settings for lcd testing
# sCheck will boost sound to test audio
# tilt opens white screen that does nothing and locks remote buttons, goes away after a reboot
# Also, rather obviously, this can be triggered over SSAP as well... :)

"Host Diagnostics" view
Go to settings → Programmes → Hover "Programme Tuning & Settings" and press "1" button five times.
Disable 15 minute no-signal auto power off
luna-send -n 1 luna://com.webos.settingsservice/setSystemSettings '{"settings":{"autoOff15Min":"off"},"category":"time"}'
Accessing devmode SSH without full webOS SDK
tv=10.11.12.13
# 1. Enable devmode
# 2. Enable keyserver
# 3. Download key and decrypt using Passphrase displayed on a screen
openssl rsa -in <(curl http://$tv:9991/webos_rsa) > webos_rsa && chmod 600 webos_rsa
# 4. just ssh
ssh prisoner@$tv -i webos_rsa -p 9922 bash -i
Tip: @webosose/ares-cli NPM package is sufficient to play with webOS TV development. (ares-package, ares-install, ares-launch...) A quick tip on how to configure everything is available here: FriedChickenButt/youtube-webos#13 (comment)
Using sshd after deploying RootMyTV
Note: dropbear sshd is now bundled by default with Homebrew Channel app. If you've rooted Your TV using https://rootmy.tv you may already have it, you just need to enable it in Homebrew Channel Settings view.
Run this manually in telnet session:
mkdir -p /var/run/sshd && /media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/services/com.palmdts.devmode.service/binaries-armv71/opt/openssh/sbin/sshd -o StrictModes=no -f /media/cryptofs/apps/usr/palm/services/com.palmdts.devmode.service/binaries-armv71/opt/openssh/etc/ssh/sshd_config -h /var/lib/devmode/sshd/ssh_host_rsa_key -o PasswordAuthentication=yes -o PermitRootLogin=yes -o PermitUserEnvironment=yes -o AuthorizedKeysFile=/media/developer/.ssh/authorized_keys -D -p 9922
Afterwards, SDK needs to be reconfigured to use root username:
ares-setup-device -m DEVICE -i "username=root"
SSH public key can be added to: /media/developer/.ssh/authorized_keys
Inspector for development apps is present on: http://TV_IP:9998
Running native app in jailer
jailer -d -t native_devmode -p /media/developer/apps/usr/palm/applications/com.limelight.webos/ -i com.limelight.webos $(which id)

Any way to replace the existing screen saver images?
Any way to just turn off the screensaver?
or even change the timeout to a longer period before it comes on?
I use streaming apps that have their very own screensavers built in and they are much more pleasant the the LG screensaver.

Block the following domains on your router or DNS resolver:
snu.lge.com
su.lge.com
su-ssl.lge.com
snu-ssl.lge.com
snu-dev.lge.com
su-dev.lge.com
nsu.lge.com
It seems you can do nothing inside your TV to prevent this popup, because the update check is already performed when the Homebrew Channel starts and overrides hosts file.

Using luna-send to create a pop-up message with buttons to download from 2 sources and save to a custom folder.
You can do that:
luna-send -n 1 -f -a com.webos.service.secondscreen.gateway luna://com.webos.notification/createAlert '{
"message":"PPLGPwn djavuln<br/><br/>Please Select your HEN",
"buttons":[
{"label":"GoldHen", "focus":true, "onclick":"luna://com.webos.service.downloadmanager/download", "params":{"target":"https://github.com/llbranco/PPLGPwn/raw/main/install.sh", "targetDir":"/media/internal/downloads/PPLGwn", "targetFilename":"goldhen.sh"}},
{"label":"PS4Hen-VTX", "focus":false, "onclick":"luna://com.webos.service.downloadmanager/download", "params":{"target":"https://github.com/llbranco/PPLGPwn/raw/main/install_vtx.sh", "targetDir":"/media/internal/downloads/PPLGwn", "targetFilename":"vtx.sh"}}
]}'
I don't know why, but you can't download directly to the USB drive "/tmp/usb/sda/sda1/".
If you use curl or wget instead, you can actually do it.
I still haven't figured out how to run shell commands or shell scripts using luna-send.

yeah, pop up messages, with buttons
there is a way to use variables inside buttons, with buttons dynamically expandable

But if i currently screen mirror my devices screen, the cursor will be black and white color. But, if i use YouTube instead, the cursor will be pink. customCursor.png sometimes will replace with the new one. Retroarch app is hiding the system cursor, shows the cursor image, pretending to be custom cursor.
