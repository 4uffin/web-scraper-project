awesome-hardware/awesome-bluepill/awesome-rp2040 bullshit
This is a quick list of cool payloads that can be pushed onto some common MCU boards to turn these them into actually useful everyday hacking tools.
STM32F1 / Bluepill
blackmagic probe - SWD + UART adapter - https://medium.com/@paramaggarwal/converting-an-stm32f103-board-to-a-black-magic-probe-c013cf2cc38c - also a tip on how to use native UART bootloader
bluepill_ch341a - CH341A-compatible device (SPI EEPROM + UART)
i2c-star - I2C adapter (i2c-tiny-usb clone)
versaloon - JTAG stuff
DirtyJTAG - JTAG stuff
RP2040 / RPi Pico
rp2040-i2c-interface - i2c-tiny-usb interface
pico-usb-io-board - general purpose USB to SPI/I2C/ADC/GPIO interface

Ghidra script to extract wayland protocols definition from wayland-scanner generated client library. Run this on an (opened and analysed) libwebos-*-client.so library.
# This Ghidra script will attempt to extract wayland protocol/interfaces
# definitions xml from wayland-scanner-generated built client library.
#
# This should properly handler interfaces, methods and events, and their arg
# types and order. Argument names or descriptions cannot be extracted.

# Looks for matching libraries in current project and automatically assigns to current program.
# "Link existing project libraries" doesn't seem to fully work when using bulk import, and this
# pretty much reimplements this.
#
# After running this script you will probably want to use FixupELFExternalSymbolsScript.java too.

Advanced Recursive Diffingâ„¢
Ever needed to diff two trees of files, while doing some preprocessing on
modified files? Well - we've got a solution for you. Or rather... our long
friend git has.
Turns out it's perfectly legal to just use git diff --no-index on directories
outside of (any) git repository. With that, we can (ab-)use built in git diff
per-path/extension preprocessing feature.

Let's Encrypt fix for webOS. Tested on 3.8 only, put this into /var/lib/webosbrew/init.d and you should be probably done.
#!/bin/sh
# Directory to store overlays in (one directory structure is created per overlay configured down below)
OVERLAY_BASE=/var/lib/webosbrew/customca
overlay() {
set -e
overlay_id="$(echo $1 | sed 's;/;__;g')"
unset TARGET SOURCE FSTYPE OPTIONS
eval $(findmnt -P $1)
