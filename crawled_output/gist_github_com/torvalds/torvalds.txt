Not involved with any fishy crypto fishy business
I'm told that there are people claiming to "tokenize" my git repositories with my approval.
I just want to clarify that that is not the case. I do not believe in monetizing my repositories.
If you believe crypto-currencies are anything but a scam, I have a bridge to sell you.
But I'm not selling source code.
