Fix AMD GPU high idle power MCLK (vram / memory clock) stuck at 96 MHz / 1000 MHz for high refresh rates on Arch Linux Wayland & Xorg
On certain resolutions & refresh rates or multi-monitor setups, you might have noticed that your GPU MCLK (vram / memory clock) is stuck at the highest clock frequency (1000 MHz) [1] [2] causing higher GPU idle power draw.
On Linux kernel 6.4.x, AMDGPU MCLK (vram/memory) clocks at the lowest, causing major FPS drops while gaming [1] [2]. This is likely due to a monitor not using Coordinated Video Timings (CVT) with a low V-Blank value for the affected resolutions & refresh rates.
The higher clocking behavior is due to:
[Well, the reason the clocks get forced to max in some cases is to avoid the flickering you are seeing.
There is a certain latency r
