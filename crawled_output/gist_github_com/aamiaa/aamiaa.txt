Revert New Discord Layout
The original snippet no longer works!
On 02/09/2024 at around 8pm UTC, Discord flipped an experiment (2023-09_mobile_redesign_override_toggles) which ignores the layout toggle that this script relied on.
If you want to continue using the old layout, you can either use a modded mobile client (such as Vendetta) to disable that experiment, or downgrade to an old version of the app.
Method 1 - Downgrading (Android)
TipUse this one if you want a fast, beginner-friendly solution and don't mind using a version from November 2023
Download version 205.15 of Discord mobile app from ApkMirror
