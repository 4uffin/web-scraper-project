Created

### hostapd configuration file, loosely based on http://pisarenko.net/blog/2015/02/01/beginners-guide-to-802-dot-11ac-setup/
### for Realtek RTL8812AU via driver https://github.com/abperiasamy/rtl8812AU_8821AU_linux
### and hostap 2.5
### Operates at 135 Mbps in 802.11n/ht mode. iperf measures ~8.00 MBytes/sec
67.1 Mbits/sec
### I was not able to get 802.11ac/vht mode with additional side-channels configured with the driver.
