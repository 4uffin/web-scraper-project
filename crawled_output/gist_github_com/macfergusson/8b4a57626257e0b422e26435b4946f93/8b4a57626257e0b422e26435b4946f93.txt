What aspect of SQL, Data, Analytics etc should I concentrate on?
This is exactly why it's best to "dabble around" at first and feel out the different aspects of working with data, so you can find where you would most like to spend your time and efforts later.
You won't discover that until you get your hands on a little bit of everything.
Learn a little DBA stuff, some database design stuff, some ETL, how to use tools like Excel and PowerBI, how transactional systems differ in needs from analytical systems, make reports, charts, hell make an application in python or VB or something that connects to the database and reads some data out.
Read a lot. Ask questions. Touch things. Break them. Fix them.
You will come out on the other side knowing who you are and where you want to go next.
For now, just jump in the pool somewhere.
