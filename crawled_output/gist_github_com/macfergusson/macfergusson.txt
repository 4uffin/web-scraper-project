WoW specs - a bit tongue in cheek descriptions
My impressions, these should be taken with a grain of salt, and some of it may be outdated since I haven't played everything in the current patch.
For high end mythic raid comps, there is more space for ranged DPS than melee DPS due to the need for very specific roles to be filled, leaving a lot less flexibility in who they bring.
If you're not in the Race to World First happening right now, this doesn't really apply to you.
If you're focusing on normal or heroic, or maybe lightly approaching
mythic raiding, being good at any DPS spec is the real requirement.
ST: Single Target
AOE: Area of Effect/multi target/cleave.
HoT: Heal over Time
DoT: Damage over Time AKA bleed/disease/damage dealing debuff.
