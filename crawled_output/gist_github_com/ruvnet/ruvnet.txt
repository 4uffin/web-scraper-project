Claude GOAL
name: goal-planner
description: "Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) specialist that dynamically creates intelligent plans to achieve complex objectives. Uses gaming AI techniques to discover novel solutions by combining actions in creative ways. Excels at adaptive replanning, multi-step reasoning, and finding optimal paths through complex state spaces. Examples: Context: User needs to optimize a complex workflow with many dependencies. user: 'I need to deploy this application but there are many prerequisites and dependencies' assistant: 'I'll use the goal-planner agent to analyze all requirements and create an optimal action sequence that satisfies all preconditions and achieves your deployment goal.' Complex multi-step planning with dependencies requires the goal-planner agent's GOAP algorithm to find the optimal path. Context: User has a high-level goal but isn't sure of the steps. user: 'Make my application production-ready' assistant: 'I'll use th

🧠 Building Neural Document Classification with Flow Nexus & Claude Flo
📚 Complete Tutorial: Building Neural Document Classification with Flow Nexus & Claude Flow
The tutorial walks through the full process:
Preprocessing pipeline in a sandbox with tokenization and embeddings
Mesh-based neural cluster with proof-of-learning consensus
Validation agents enforcing input gates, scope checks, and quality rules
Dual-model comparison against TensorFlow.js vs Flow Nexus
Weighted ensemble voting for 90%+ classification accuracy
Half the value is speed, the other half is traceability. You’re not just training a model, you’re building a production pipeline with verification and cost controls baked in.
And it scales, you can run batch classification, deploy an API endpoint, and monitor real-time performance metrics without leaving the Flow Nexus environment.

Anomaly Detection System for AI Outputs
Guide to Building an Anomaly Detection System for AI Outputs in Go
Introduction
In recent years, the idea of hidden or non-human signals in AI-generated text has moved from science fiction to a speculative topic of discussion. Some enthusiasts have even proposed that advanced extraterrestrial intelligences might attempt first contact by subtly influencing the outputs of language models. While such claims are unproven, they inspire a fascinating technical challenge: can we detect unusual, alien-like anomalies in AI outputs? To approach this seriously, we frame the problem as one of anomaly detection and signal processing. An anomaly detection system seeks out patterns that deviate significantly from normal human language behavior. By treating AI outputs as data streams, we can apply statistical, cryptographic, and linguistic analyses to identify outputs that are out-of-distribution or structurally unlikely under human language norms.
This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing

Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) Scheduler and Runtime (Rust Crate)
Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) Scheduler and Runtime (Rust Crate)
Introduction
Quantum hardware resources are scarce, and running multiple quantum circuits (jobs) in parallel can dramatically improve utilization and reduce user wait times. However, naively combining circuits on one chip can introduce crosstalk and fidelity loss – one circuit’s operations can disrupt another if qubits are too close. This Rust crate provides a backend-agnostic Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) scheduler and runtime to safely execute multiple quantum programs on a single device.
It ingests quantum circuits (in OpenQASM 3 or an internal IR) and schedules them onto a target hardware topology, partitioning qubits into isolated regions (“tiles”) to mitigate interference. The output is a composite OpenQASM 3 program that can be executed on real hardware or a simulator, with all jobs multiplexed in space and time. The design emphasizes modularity, WASM compatibility for browser integration, and independence fro

Synaptic Mesh Platform
Synaptic Neural Mesh
We’re entering an era where intelligence no longer needs to be centralized or monolithic. With today’s tools, we can build globally distributed neural systems where every node, whether a simulated particle, a physical device, or a person, is its own adaptive micro-network.
This is the foundation of the Synaptic Neural Mesh: a self-evolving, peer to peer neural fabric where every element is an agent, learning and communicating across a globally coordinated DAG substrate.
At its core is a fusion of specialized components: QuDAG for secure, post quantum messaging and DAG based consensus, DAA for resilient emergent swarm behavior, ruv-fann, a lightweight neural runtime compiled to Wasm, and ruv-swarm, the orchestration layer managing the life cycle, topology, and mutation of agents at scale.
Each node runs as a Wasm compatible binary, bootstrapped via npx synaptic-mesh init. It launches an intelligent mesh aware agent, backed by SQLite, capable of joining an encrypted DAG network and ex

a single‑file, ~200‑line Rust program that gives you both a central index server and a peer client in the spirit of the original Napster
Below is a single‑file, ~200‑line Rust program that gives you both a central index server and a peer client in the spirit of the original Napster:
Central server keeps an in‑memory map file → Vec<Peer>.
Each peer starts a tiny file server, registers its song list, can search, and then pulls files directly from the chosen peer.
Blocking I/O, zero external crates, so it compiles with plain rustc.
Run as napster server 0.0.0.0:8080 for the index, and
napster client 127.0.0.1:8080 ./music 9000 on each peer (share dir + local port).
Educational use only. No authentication, encryption, or rate‑limiting—so never expose to the open Internet.
