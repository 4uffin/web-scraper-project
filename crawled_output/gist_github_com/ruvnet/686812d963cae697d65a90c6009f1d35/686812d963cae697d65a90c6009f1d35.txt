🔧 Optimization Recommendations
Immediate Optimizations (Priority: High)
1. Sandbox Lifecycle Management
Issue: E2B sandboxes completing lifecycle during extended operations
Solution:
// Implement sandbox persistence and recreation
const maintainSandbox = async (sandboxId) => {
const status = await mcp.sandbox_status({ sandbox_id: sandboxId });
if (status.status !== 'running') {
return await mcp.sandbox_create({
template: status.template,
name: `${status.name}_renewed`,
env_vars: status.env_vars
});
}
return sandboxId;
};
2. Memory Optimization
Issue: 38.6% memory growth over extended duration
Solution:
// Implement memory cleanup routines
const optimizeMemory = async () => {
if (global.gc) {
global.gc();
}
// Clear unused neural network weights
await mcp.neural_cluster_optimize({
cluster_id: clusterId,
optimization: "memory_cleanup"
});
};
3. Real-Time Stream Optimization
Issue: Potential stream backlog during high load
Solution:
// Implement stream batching and buffering
const optimizeStreaming = {
batch_size: 100,
buffer_timeout: 1000,
max_buffer_size: 10000,
compression: true
};
Medium-Term Optimizations (Priority: Medium)
1. Neural Network Efficiency
Implement model pruning for reduced memory usage
Add quantization for faster inference
Optimize WASM compilation for specific architectures
2. Workflow Orchestration
Add workflow dependency optimization
