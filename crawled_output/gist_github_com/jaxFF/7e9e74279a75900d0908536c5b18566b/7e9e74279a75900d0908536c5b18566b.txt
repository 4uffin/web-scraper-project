Uh oh!
There was an error while loading. Please reload this page.
NOP out the comparison of eax from GetTickCount()
Replaces JNE with a JMP so that the program branches to the condition where the 12-hour time limit has not yet been met
I might write an actual patcher for the executable so that this works for newer versions based on the pattern of instructions, however, I don't feel like it currently and likely won't be updating my HWiNFO64 install.
Sorry, something went wrong.

Hello, tried to patch the executables but it seems the offsets aren't correct?

Hey there! I made a quick 5-minute patch that doesn't modify the exe which should work with most HWiNFO versions. Keep in mind this only works for the 64-bit version, and I have only tested this on version 8.16-5600 and 8.24-5700 (current stable version from the website).
To install, just download the HWiNFOSharedMemBypass.­zip archive from the link above and extract the files into the HWiNFO64 folder (where the main exe is located) and then launch the app (or relaunch it if it was already running).
If there is any suspicion about the DLLs, I've included the full source code for the patch in the HWiNFOSharedMemBypass-source.­zip archive in the link above. I think it does more or less the same thing as shown in this post, it nops out the last timer check from the function related to shared memory support.
Sorry if the code is a bit messy, it's something I threw together quickly using code from previous projects of mine.

I don't see the HWiNFOSharedMemBypass-source.­zip in the link you've given, just the one with the DLLs. Would you mind reuploading it?

I'll reupload the source when I get home or later if I don't forget. It doesn't get downloaded often and it keeps getting deleted unfortunately, I don't know where else to host the files right now.
