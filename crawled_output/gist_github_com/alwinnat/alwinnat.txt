# Ein kleines Python-Skript, um Bit-Felder zu interpretieren.
#
# 1 Word = 16 bits = 2 Bytes
# int = 16 bits = 2 Bytes
# uint = 16 bits = 2 Bytes
# udint = 32 bits = 4 Bytes
# Für Entität "Control status" schreiben wir uns erstmal Methoden, um die Werte übersetzen zu können.
#
# Für Zero flow (Bit 0)
