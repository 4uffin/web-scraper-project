Obsidian custom checkbox snippet
Raw
README.md
Custom checkboxes for Obsidian! It's like deathau's snippet except updated to work really well in Live Preview mode in Obsidian 1.0.
Simply edit the x inside checkboxes to >, ?, etc. to see styling like below!
Editing
Live Preview
Viewing
Installation:
Download the checkbox.css file on this page
In Obsidian, open Settings > Appearance > CSS snippets
Click the folder icon to open the snippets folder (your_vault/.obsidian/snippets/, a hidden folder)
Copy checkbox.css there
Reload Obsidian
Go back to the CSS snippets settings and enable the checkbox option

checkbox.css
/*
Obsidian styled checkboxes snippet (Oliver's version)
See https://github.com/deathau/obsidian-snippets#checkboxes for a demo.
This supports live preview editor mode and reading mode.
Tweaks: search this file for "tweak" to find places for common customizations.
Based on:
* https://github.com/deathau/obsidian-snippets/blob/main/checkbox.css (works with reading mode only)
* https://forum.obsidian.md/t/5-checkbox/35758 (works with live preview editor only)
This snippet combines both of the above snippets and irons out some inconsistencies.

Hey mate,
This is really useful! I've been using it for a few days now, and I'm really enjoying it.
I've been trying to change one thing though, and I can't seem to get it to work. I want to rotate the chevron to point downwards as when I use it it means that the nature of the task has changed or it has been completed and lead to another task. i.e. "Check company vehicles service stickers" changes to "Organise service for vehicles x, y, z".
Any ideas?
Hess

@OliverBalfour - Thanks for this. It's nice to have a simple snippet that gets the job done.
I have added one type - waiting - to track things I am waiting for others to complete. Due to the simplicity of the CSS, it was easy to accomplish.
I do have a minor issue and would appreciate your feedback. It's related to the visuals. I'm getting black checkmarks over the expected view. A picture is attached. I'd appreciate any guidance.

This is very useful, except that I do not want to show strike through for done tasks. I modified as following, but it doesn't work. Could you please advise?
/* Not show strikethrough for done tasks */
.HyperMD-task-line[data-task="x"],
.markdown-preview-view ul>li[data-task="x"] {
color: var(--checklist-done-color);
text-decoration: none;
}

Unfortunately this also removes strike-through from custom checkmarks.
Here's a fixed code:
.HyperMD-task-line[data-task="x"],
.markdown-preview-view ul>li.task-list-item[data-task="x"] {
text-decoration: none;
color:var(--text-normal);
}
Note: This doesn't work in live preview mode.

This doesn't seem to work in callouts when in live mode. Is there way to edit it so it works?

Use .markdown-rendered to make it work in Live Preview callouts too. Like this:
/* remove strikethrough for checkboxes */
.HyperMD-task-line[data-task="x"],
.markdown-rendered ul>li[data-task="x"],
.markdown-preview-view[data-task="x"] {
text-decoration: none;
color: var(--text-normal);
}
