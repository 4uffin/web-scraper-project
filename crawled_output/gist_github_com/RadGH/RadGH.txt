WooCommerce Membership Discount
<?php
// Posted for Stack Overflow:
// @see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77198717/temporary-global-sale-price-discount-for-all-products-in-woocommerce
// Note this code supports WooCommerce Subscriptions.
// If you aren't using that, you need to remove the references to WC_Subscriptions_Product and the related functions.
// 1. Custom function that should return true if the user is a member.
// Modified to just check if you are an admin, but you could change this to look at your previous subscriptions
