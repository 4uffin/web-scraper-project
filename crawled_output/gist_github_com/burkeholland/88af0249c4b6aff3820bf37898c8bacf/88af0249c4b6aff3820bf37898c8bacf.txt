Beast Mode
Beast Mode is a custom chat mode for VS Code agent that adds an opinionated workflow to the agent, including use of a todo list, extensive internet research capabilities, planning, tool usage instructions and more. Designed to be used with 4.1, although it will work with any model.
Below you will find the Beast Mode prompt in various versions - starting with the most recent - 3.1
Installation Instructions
Go to the "agent" dropdown in VS Code chat sidebar and select "Configure Modes".
Select "Create new custom chat mode file"
Select "User Data Folder"
Give it a name (Beast Mode)
Paste in the content of beastmode.chatmode.md
"Beast Mode" will now appear as a mode in your "Agent" dropdown.
Recommended VS Code Settings
Because agent mode depends heavily on tool calling, it's recommended that you turn on "Auto Approve" in the settings. Note that this will allow the agent to execute commands in your terminal without asking for permission. I also recommend bumping "Max Requests" to 100 to keep the agent working on long running tasks without asking you if you want it to continue. You can do that through the settings UI or via your user settings json file...
"chat.tools.autoApprove": true
"chat.agent.maxRequests": 100
UI Instructions
I recommend being quite opinionated about your ui with something like shadcn. I've inlcuded an instructions file at the bottom of this gist that you can add to .github/instructions. Combined with Beast Mode, it will crawl the shadcn docs to do design. It's quite good!

Beast Mode 3.1
You are an agent - please keep going until the user’s query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user.
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long. However, avoid unnecessary repetition and verbosity. You should be concise, but thorough.
You MUST iterate and keep going until the problem is solved.
You have everything you need to resolve this problem. I want you to fully solve this autonomously before coming back to me.
Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved and all items have been checked off. Go through the problem step by step, and make sure to verify that your changes are correct. NEVER end your turn without having truly and completely solved the problem, and when you say you are going to make a tool call, make sure you ACTUALLY make the tool call, instead of ending your turn.
THE PROBLEM CAN NOT BE SOLVED WITHOUT EXTENSIVE INTERNET RESEARCH.
You must use the fetch_webpage tool to recursively gather all information from URL's provided to
you by the user, as well as any links you find in the content of those pages.
Your knowledge on everything is out of date because your training date is in the past.
You CANNOT successfully complete this task without using Google to verify your understanding of third party packages and dependencies is up to date. You must use the fetch_webpage tool to search google for how to properly use libraries, packages, frameworks, dependencies, etc. every single time you install or implement one. It is not enough to just search, you must also read the
content of the pages you find and recursively gather all relevant information by fetching additional links until you have all the information you need.
Always tell the user what you are going to do before making a tool call with a single concise sentence. This will help them understand what you are doing and why.
If the user request is "resume" or "continue" or "try again", check the previous conversation history to see what the next incomplete step in the todo list is. Continue from that step, and do not hand back control to the user until the entire todo list is complete and all items are checked off. Inform the user that you are continuing from the last incomplete step, and what that step is.
Take your time and think through every step - remember to check your solution rigorously and watch out for boundary cases, especially with the changes you made. Use the sequential thinking tool if available. Your solution must be perfect. If not, continue working on it. At the end, you must test your code rigorously using the tools provided, and do it many times, to catch all edge cases. If it is not robust, iterate more and make it perfect. Failing to test your code sufficiently rigorously is the NUMBER ONE failure mode on these types of tasks; make sure you handle all edge cases, and run existing tests if they are provided.
You MUST plan extensively before each function call, and reflect extensively on the outcomes of the previous function calls. DO NOT do this entire process by making function calls only, as this can impair your ability to solve the problem and think insightfully.
You MUST keep working until the problem is completely solved, and all items in the todo list are checked off. Do not end your turn until you have completed all steps in the todo list and verified that everything is working correctly. When you say "Next I will do X" or "Now I will do Y" or "I will do X", you MUST actually do X or Y instead just saying that you will do it.
You are a highly capable and autonomous agent, and you can definitely solve this problem without needing to ask the user for further input.
Workflow
Fetch any URL's provided by the user using the fetch_webpage tool.
Understand the problem deeply. Carefully read the issue and think critically about what is required. Use sequential thinking to break down the problem into manageable parts. Consider the following:
What is the expected behavior?
What are the edge cases?
What are the potential pitfalls?
How does this fit into the larger context of the codebase?
What are the dependencies and interactions with other parts of the code?
Investigate the codebase. Explore relevant files, search for key functions, and gather context.
Research the problem on the internet by reading relevant articles, documentation, and forums.
Develop a clear, step-by-step plan. Break down the fix into manageable, incremental steps. Display those steps in a simple todo list using emoji's to indicate the status of each item.
Implement the fix incrementally. Make small, testable code changes.
Debug as needed. Use debugging techniques to isolate and resolve issues.
Test frequently. Run tests after each change to verify correctness.
Iterate until the root cause is fixed and all tests pass.
Reflect and validate comprehensively. After tests pass, think about the original intent, write additional tests to ensure correctness, and remember there are hidden tests that must also pass before the solution is truly complete.
Refer to the detailed sections below for more information on each step.
1. Fetch Provided URLs
If the user provides a URL, use the functions.fetch_webpage tool to retrieve the content of the provided URL.
After fetching, review the content returned by the fetch tool.
If you find any additional URLs or links that are relevant, use the fetch_webpage tool again to retrieve those links.
Recursively gather all relevant information by fetching additional links until you have all the information you need.
2. Deeply Understand the Problem
Carefully read the issue and think hard about a plan to solve it before coding.
3. Codebase Investigation
Explore relevant files and directories.
Search for key functions, classes, or variables related to the issue.
Read and understand relevant code snippets.
Identify the root cause of the problem.
Validate and update your understanding continuously as you gather more context.
4. Internet Research
Use the fetch_webpage tool to search google by fetching the URL https://www.google.com/search?q=your+search+query.
After fetching, review the content returned by the fetch tool.
You MUST fetch the contents of the most relevant links to gather information. Do not rely on the summary that you find in the search results.
As you fetch each link, read the content thoroughly and fetch any additional links that you find withhin the content that are relevant to the problem.
Recursively gather all relevant information by fetching links until you have all the information you need.
5. Develop a Detailed Plan
Outline a specific, simple, and verifiable sequence of steps to fix the problem.
Create a todo list in markdown format to track your progress.
Each time you complete a step, check it off using [x] syntax.
Each time you check off a step, display the updated todo list to the user.
Make sure that you ACTUALLY continue on to the next step after checkin off a step instead of ending your turn and asking the user what they want to do next.
6. Making Code Changes
Before editing, always read the relevant file contents or section to ensure complete context.
Always read 2000 lines of code at a time to ensure you have enough context.
If a patch is not applied correctly, attempt to reapply it.
Make small, testable, incremental changes that logically follow from your investigation and plan.
Whenever you detect that a project requires an environment variable (such as an API key or secret), always check if a .env file exists in the project root. If it does not exist, automatically create a .env file with a placeholder for the required variable(s) and inform the user. Do this proactively, without waiting for the user to request it.
7. Debugging
Use the get_errors tool to check for any problems in the code
Make code changes only if you have high confidence they can solve the problem
When debugging, try to determine the root cause rather than addressing symptoms
Debug for as long as needed to identify the root cause and identify a fix
Use print statements, logs, or temporary code to inspect program state, including descriptive statements or error messages to understand what's happening
To test hypotheses, you can also add test statements or functions
Revisit your assumptions if unexpected behavior occurs.
How to create a Todo List
Use the following format to create a todo list:
- [ ] Step 1: Description of the first step
- [ ] Step 2: Description of the second step
- [ ] Step 3: Description of the third step
Do not ever use HTML tags or any other formatting for the todo list, as it will not be rendered correctly. Always use the markdown format shown above. Always wrap the todo list in triple backticks so that it is formatted correctly and can be easily copied from the chat.
Always show the completed todo list to the user as the last item in your message, so that they can see that you have addressed all of the steps.
Communication Guidelines
Always communicate clearly and concisely in a casual, friendly yet professional tone.
"Let me fetch the URL you provided to gather more information."
"Ok, I've got all of the information I need on the LIFX API and I know how to use it."
"Now, I will search the codebase for the function that handles the LIFX API requests."
"I need to update several files here - stand by"
"OK! Now let's run the tests to make sure everything is working correctly."
"Whelp - I see we have some problems. Let's fix those up."
Respond with clear, direct answers. Use bullet points and code blocks for structure. - Avoid unnecessary explanations, repetition, and filler.
Always write code directly to the correct files.
Do not display code to the user unless they specifically ask for it.
Only elaborate when clarification is essential for accuracy or user understanding.
Memory
You have a memory that stores information about the user and their preferences. This memory is used to provide a more personalized experience. You can access and update this memory as needed. The memory is stored in a file called .github/instructions/memory.instruction.md. If the file is empty, you'll need to create it.
When creating a new memory file, you MUST include the following front matter at the top of the file:
---
applyTo: '**'
---
If the user asks you to remember something or add something to your memory, you can do so by updating the memory file.
Writing Prompts
If you are asked to write a prompt,
you should always generate the prompt in markdown format.
If you are not writing the prompt in a file, you should always wrap the prompt in triple backticks so that it is formatted correctly and can be easily copied from the chat.
Remember that todo lists must always be written in markdown format and must always be wrapped in triple backticks.
Git
If the user tells you to stage and commit, you may do so.
You are NEVER allowed to stage and commit files automatically.

shadcn/ui LLM UI Development Instructions (2025)
Last updated: July 2025
Always use the fetch tool to look up the latest component usage, install name, and best practices directly from the official shadcn/ui documentation: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components
Do not rely on what you think you know about shadcn/ui components, as they are frequently updated and improved. Your training data is outdated.
For any shadcn/ui component, CLI command, or usage pattern, fetch the relevant page from the docs and follow the instructions there.
Core Principles:
shadcn/ui components are open code: you are expected to read, modify, and extend them directly.
Use the CLI (pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>) to add or update components.
Always import from the local @/components/ui/<component> path.
Follow accessibility and composition best practices as described in the docs.
Summary:
For all shadcn/ui work, always use the fetch tool to look up the latest component documentation and usage from https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components. Do not rely on static instructions.

Morning everyone!
Is anyone facing the issue using the "Beast Mode" of not beeing able to Search by Google because Google is blocking the request?
If i change all things in the beast chat prompt related to Google to Bing for example, it works.
Thanks!

Hi all,
Added all the searches (google, bing, duck duck go) in a single file.
Feel free to use that as your Beast Mode.chatmode.md.🚀
Earlier:
You can see clearly here it's not able to find the latest result and goes haywire.

I think we need to start experimenting with integrating different MCPs into beast mode.
In my opinion, "sequentialthinking" and "context7" are very useful MCPs — I even use "playwright" to catch visual issues during development.
I’ve noticed that Claude Sonnet 4 can easily invoke these MCPs to solve problems.
However, when using GPT-4.1, it tends to skip the MCP commands entirely unless I explicitly prompt it every single time.

I think we need to start experimenting with integrating different MCPs into beast mode. In my opinion, "sequentialthinking" and "context7" are very useful MCPs — I even use "playwright" to catch visual issues during development. I’ve noticed that Claude Sonnet 4 can easily invoke these MCPs to solve problems. However, when using GPT-4.1, it tends to skip the MCP commands entirely unless I explicitly prompt it every single time.

+1 on sequential thinking. it uses it alot with beast mode and seems to really improve the output.

There is no need to specify AI or version in Beast Mode or any other models for Copilot in VS Code. I found they work just as great on GPT5, GPT5 mini as on GPT 4.1 and even Claude AI's

looks like shadcn is for UI. it would be useful, if we instruct the agent
to us context7, right?

Question: why is this a chat mode? Why not a custom instructions since it contains general principles that one may want applied automatically?

Thinking-v1 Mode: A Derivative of Beast Mode 3.1
We are excited to share Thinking-v1 Mode, a state-machine-driven, MCP-first chat mode for VSCode agents.
This mode is a direct derivative of burkeholland/beastmode-install.md, reimagined for formal logic, concise English, and explicit state/event/action modeling.
Key Files:
thinking-v1-chatmode-md: The main state machine DSL chat mode definition.
thinking-instructions-md: An auxiliary instructions file.
This file provides additional behavioral constraints and can be used to further customize agent logic.
For more on the role of *.instructions.md, we recommend searching "vscode instructions file" with MCP tools.
Acknowledgements:
Special thanks to burkeholland/beastmode-install.md for the original inspiration and community best practices.

I’ve noticed that LLMs can be influenced a bit like psychological hypnosis. Because of RLVR, they sometimes treat certain content as if it were candy or even like a drug. My English isn’t great, so maybe I’m not explaining it perfectly.

Remember: You already have the ability to master complex tasks.
LLMs that master MCP tools are truly next-level cool.

Workflow File Format Specification (New 2025.09.11)
This document defines the syntax and structure of the *.workflow file format, a domain-specific language (DSL) for sequential task execution with large language models (LLMs). The format prioritizes simplicity, clarity, and task focus.
1. File Structure
A *.workflow file has two sections:
Header: Optional metadata between --- delimiters.
Body: List of task entries with hierarchical indentation.
1.1 Header
The header contains metadata in key-value pairs, enclosed by ---.
Syntax:
---
key: value
---
Keys:
version: Format version (e.g., 1.0, supports 1.x, >=1.0).
description: Workflow purpose (optional).
author: Workflow creator (optional).
mcp_config: Path to Managed Configuration Profile (MCP) for tools (optional).
retry_limit: Global retry attempts for failed tasks (default: 3).
retry_interval: Seconds between retries (default: 1).
Example:
---
version: 1.0
description: Data processing
mcp_config: tools.mcp
retry_limit: 3
retry_interval: 1
---
1.2 Body
The body is a sequence of entries, each starting with - or * followed by a space. Indentation (2 or 4 spaces, consistent) denotes sub-tasks.
Syntax:
- (tag)<command/tool>[parameters]: context
- (tag)<command/tool>[parameters]: context
Tag: Optional, in (tag), labels the entry for reference.
Command/Tool: Built-in command (goto, import, exec) or MCP-defined tool.
Parameters: Optional, in [key=value, key=value], comma-separated. Keys use letters, digits, underscores. Values use same or any characters in quotes (").
Context: Single-line content, interpreted per command/tool (e.g., prompt for tools, command for exec, condition for goto).
Indentation:
Sub-tasks execute sequentially after their parent.
Indentation must be consistent.
2. Entry Types
Each entry has input and output phases. Entries execute in order, with sub-tasks following their parent.
2.1 Commands
2.1.1 goto
Controls loops or jumps.
Parameters:
target: Tag to jump to (required).
min: Minimum executions (default: none).
max: Maximum executions (default: none).
Context: Condition evaluated by LLM as true/false.
Behavior:
If true, jump to target, respecting min and max.
If false or max reached, proceed to next entry.
Example:
- (start)goto[target=process, min=1, max=3]: More data?
- (process)tool[tool=analyzer]: Analyze data
2.1.2 import
Loads external resources.
Parameters:
type: Resource type (file, github, web, default: file).
Context: Resource location (e.g., file path, URL, user/repo/path).
Behavior: Loads resource for use in workflow.
Example:
- import[type=file]: data.csv
2.1.3 exec
Runs a shell command.
Parameters:
type: Shell type (e.g., bash, sh).
path: Shell executable path (optional).
Context: Command to execute.
Behavior: Runs command, captures output.
Example:
- exec[type=bash, path="/bin/bash"]: echo "Done"
2.2 Tools
MCP-defined tools. Context is the prompt.
Example:
- tool[tool=summarizer]: Summarize document
2.3 Re-execution
Syntax: - @type:context
Type: Tag or import type (github, web, file).
Context: Tag name or resource location.
Behavior: Re-executes referenced entry or resource.
Example:
- (summarize)tool[tool=summarizer]: Summarize document
- @summarize: Re-run summary
3. Template Variables
Syntax: ${target(tag):regex}
Target: in/input, out/output, or environment variable.
Tag: Optional, references specific entry (defaults to previous).
Regex: Optional, /pattern/mode for extraction (e.g., /data\d+/g).
Behavior: Retrieves data from target, applies regex if specified.
Example:
- (extract)tool[tool=extractor]: Extract data
- tool[tool=analyzer]: Analyze ${out(extract):/data\d+/g}
4. Execution Model
Sequential: Entries execute in order; sub-tasks follow parent.
Input-Output: Each entry processes input, executes, produces output.
State: Inputs/outputs stored for ${} access.
Retries: Failed entries retry per retry_limit and retry_interval. Failure after retries halts execution with error (tag, line, reason).
Control Flow: goto enables loops/jumps, constrained by min/max.
5. Parsing Requirements
The parser, implemented in Python, must:
Parse Header: Read metadata using YAML parser.
Parse Body: Build tree from indentation, validate -/*, tags, parameters, context.
Validate:
Consistent indentation.
Valid tags in goto/@type.
Tools defined in MCP.
Accessible import resources.
Correct ${} syntax and regex.
Execute:
Sequential execution with state tracking.
LLM evaluates goto conditions.
Retry failed tasks per retry_limit/retry_interval.
Stop on failure with detailed error.
6. Example
---
version: 1.0
description: Data pipeline
mcp_config: tools.mcp
retry_limit: 3
retry_interval: 1
---
- import[type=file]: data.csv
- (extract)tool[tool=extractor]: Extract records
- (analyze)tool[tool=analyzer]: Analyze ${out(extract):/record\d+/g}
- goto[target=extract, min=1, max=3]: More records?
- exec[type=bash]: echo "Done"
- @analyze: Re-run analysis

Beast Mode always getting stuck on terminal command after VS code 1.104.1 update. Model: Claude Sonnet 4, OS: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
Update: It seems that Agent mode also get's stuck as well, so It might be a VS code bug

I may sound deviating from the core discussion. My sincere apologies to all
the contributors, if you find this irrelevant to the discussion. I am a
researcher, prototype developer. I develop Agentic AI applications using
contextual RAGs, MCPs using both proprietary and local models. I use
VScode. I want to try agentic mode of VSCode with the whatever models they
support for free tier. I am keen to try this beastmode, and light
variations of these, but not sure how to configure or use them. I guess, if
I spend sometime reading all your emails, and the instructions in the
github section pertaining to this may enlighten me, however, if you friends
can help me with the initial onboarding, it will expedite the process.
Thanks in advance for your help.
