/ NUMA node problem.md
Created
May 7, 2024 01:25
‚Äî forked from zrruziev/NUMA node problem.md
Fixing "successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero" problem
What is NUMA (Non-Uniformed Memory Access)
Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) is one of the computer memory design methods used in multiprocessor systems, and the time to access the memory varies depending on the relative position between the memory and the processor. In the NUMA architecture, when a processor accesses its local memory, it is faster than when it accesses the remote memory. Remote memory refers to memory that is connected to another processor, and local memory refers to memory that is connected to its own processor.
In other words, it is a technology to increase memory access efficiency while using multiple processors on one motherboard. When a specific processor runs out of memory, it monopolizes the bus by itself, so other processors have to play. , and designate 'access only here', and call it a NUMA node.
