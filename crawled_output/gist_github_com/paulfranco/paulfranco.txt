Android Interview Questions
Q1: Explain activity lifecycle ☆☆
Answer:
As a user navigates through, out of, and back to your app, the Activity instances in your app transition through different states in their lifecycle.
To navigate transitions between stages of the activity lifecycle, the Activity class provides a core set of six callbacks: onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy(). The system invokes each of these callbacks as an activity enters a new state.
