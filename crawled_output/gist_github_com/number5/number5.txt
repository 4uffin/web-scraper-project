Coding Rules and Instructions
Test-Driven Development (TDD) with pytest: Always write a failing test before writing implementation code (Red-Green-Refactor). Use pytest and pytest-fixtures for test setup, execution, and teardown.
KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Favor the simplest solution that meets the requirements.
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoid code duplication. Extract reusable logic into functions or classes.
Standard Libraries and Tools: Utilize standard Python libraries (like datetime for date/time, requests for HTTP requests, and logging) and external libraries, including BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing, to avoid reinventing the wheel.
Favor well-maintained and widely-used libraries.
YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It): Don't implement features or functionality unless they are currently required.
SOLID Principles & Extensibility: Adhere to SOLID principles, promoting maintainability, testability, and future extension. Consider potential future requi

NixOS configs for reference
Based on https://discourse.nixos.org/t/collection-of-nixos-repositories/20941?u=number5 but changed git submodules to git clone.
Example updating script (zsh)
# Nix collections
for d (/nix-collections/*/.git(/)) {
echo "Updating ${d:h:t}..."
command git -C "${d:h}" pull --ff --recurse-submodules --depth 1 --rebase --autostash

Temporary workaround to install awscli/boto3 with Homebrew Python 3.7 (before PyYAML fix their python3.7 releases)
pip3 install awscli boto3 (this step will fail but will install all deps exclude pyyaml for us)
pip3 install pyyaml==4.2b4
pip3 install --no-deps awscli boto3
See yaml/pyyaml#193 for what's happening with pyyaml
