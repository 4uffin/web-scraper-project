SSH and FIDO ssh authentication
# SSH and FIDO authentication in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
The following section demonstrates how users can generate new key types and use them to perform authentication. First, users have to attach a device to the system. Next, they need to generate a new key and specify one of the new types. During this process users will get prompted to tap the token to confirm the operation.
user@client:~$ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk
Generating public/private ecdsa-sk key pair.
You may need to touch your authenticator to authorize key generation.

/ NGINX Self-Signed Cert with 301 redirect (and reverse proxy).md

NGINX Self-Signed Cert with 301 redirect (and reverse proxy)
First, generate your cert. Make sure your FQDN is matching your url. This is the easy way, if production you should also get yourself a DH-key and make some other changes to your SSL configuration. More reading here.
$ sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
Once you're done filling all cert-information, add certs and the 302 redirect (from http to https) to the nginx configuration. Here's a sample.

Allow or block GeoIP in Nginx on Ubuntu 20.04
GeoIP Block NGINX Ubuntu 20.04
Block or filter IPs based on location in Nginx (tested on 1.18.0) on Ubuntu 20.04.
Install Nginx modules
To make use of the geographical filtering, we must first install the Nginx GeoIP module as well as the GeoIP database containing the mappings between visitors’ IP addresses and their respective countries. To do so, let’s execute:
$ sudo apt install libnginx-mod-http-geoip geoip-database

/ Move docker data directory to another location on Ubuntu.md
Created

Move docker data/volumes directory to another location on Ubuntu
The standard data directory used for docker is /var/lib/docker, and since this directory will store all your images, volumes, etc. it can become quite large in a relative small amount of time.
Here's a guide how to change that folder to another location, for example another disk.
Stop docker daemon
$ sudo service docker stop
