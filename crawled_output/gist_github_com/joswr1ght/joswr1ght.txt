Relay WebAuthn/Passkey Helper Code
/*
* WebAuthn Assertion Relay Helper
*
* Usage:
* 1. From your attacker session at https://target-rp.tgt/login,
* capture the "publicKey" JSON challenge the RP sends.
* 2. Send that JSON blob (as text) to the victim browser console as publicKeyJSON.
* 3. Paste this helper, then call: getAssertion(publicKeyJSON).
* 4. Copy the printed output (JSON with base64url fields) back
* to your attacker machine.

Callie Sparkes
I'm sorry to say that Callie Sparkes is not a real person.
Also, she has a terrible password.
Headshot by thispersondoesnotexist.com.
For getting to this page though, I will impart some wisdom that may be useful for the CTF.
A common persistence mechanism on Windows is to deploy a service that runs a process automatically.
You can use `Get-Service` from PowerShell to get a list of services.
Alternatively, you can run `sc query` to list services from a Command Prompt.

Resolve NLTK utlopen error to work in offline mode
# NLTK makes the assumption that users are online when importing the library.
# This is partly to automate the download or corpus files and other aassets,
# but if those files already exist then offline mode is problematic. `import nltk`
# will still work, but it takes a while to timeout, producing errors:
#
# [nltk_data] Error loading averaged_perceptron_tagger: <urlopen error
# [nltk_data]
[Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution>
# [nltk_data] Error loading punkt: <urlopen error [Errno -3] Temporary
# [nltk_data]
failure in name resolution>
# [nltk_data] Error loading stopwords: <urlopen error [Errno -3]
