Charlie Kirk, a conservative political activist and ally of US President Donald Trump, was fatally shot Wednesday while speaking to thousands of people at Utah Valley University. The assassination sent shockwaves across the political spectrum, with Republicans and Democrats calling for an end to political violence at a time of heightened concern about deadly attacks and the targeting of public officials.Kirk, 31, was a prominent supporter of Trump who courted young voters and used his network of nonprofits to turn out voters on campuses and churches in 2024. Trump has credited Kirk with galvanizing and mobilizing the youth vote for him.The president called Kirk’s killing “a dark moment for America” in a four-minute video released Wednesday night.“I am filled with grief and anger at the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk on a college campus in Utah,” Trump said from the White House Oval Office. “Charlie inspired millions and tonight all who knew him and loved him are united in shock and horror.”On Friday morning, authorities announced that they had taken a 22-year-old suspect into custody.Here are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
