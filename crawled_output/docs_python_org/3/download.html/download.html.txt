Unpacking
Unix users should download the .tar.bz2 archives; these are bzipped tar
archives and can be handled in the usual way using tar and the bzip2
program. The Info-ZIP unzip program can be
used to handle the ZIP archives if desired. The .tar.bz2 archives provide the
best compression and fastest download times.
Windows users can use the ZIP archives since those are customary on that
platform. These are created on Unix using the Info-ZIP zip program.
