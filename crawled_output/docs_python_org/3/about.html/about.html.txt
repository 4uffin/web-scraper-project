About this documentationÂ¶
Pythonâs documentation is generated from reStructuredText sources
using Sphinx, a documentation generator originally created for Python
and now maintained as an independent project.
Development of the documentation and its toolchain is an entirely volunteer
effort, just like Python itself.
If you want to contribute, please take a
look at the Dealing with Bugs page for information on how to do so.
New
volunteers are always welcome!
Many thanks go to:
Fred L. Drake, Jr., the creator of the original Python documentation toolset
and author of much of the content;
the Docutils project for creating
reStructuredText and the Docutils suite;
Fredrik Lundh for his Alternative Python Reference project from which Sphinx
got many good ideas.
Contributors to the Python documentationÂ¶
Many people have contributed to the Python language, the Python standard
library, and the Python documentation.
See Misc/ACKS in the Python
source distribution for a partial list of contributors.
It is only with the input and contributions of the Python community
that Python has such wonderful documentation â Thank You!
