Monday’s announcement by ABC and its parent, the Walt Disney Company, that he will return to the air Tuesday displayed the potential power that the administration’s opponents can wield against those efforts.The Kimmel confrontation spotlighted the two distinct tactics President Donald Trump and his allies are using to weaken any institution that they view as an impediment to their agenda. These dual approaches — one creating pressure from the top down, the other from the bottom-up —converged quickly to topple Kimmel last week. And just as early capitulations by major law firms and universities emboldened Trump to make further demands on those sectors, the TV host’s fall emboldened the administration to push harder against media companies. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr threatened last week that there will be more actions to come, and industry insiders worried that other network programs conservatives consider too liberal, such as The View or the Sunday talk shows, could be next.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
