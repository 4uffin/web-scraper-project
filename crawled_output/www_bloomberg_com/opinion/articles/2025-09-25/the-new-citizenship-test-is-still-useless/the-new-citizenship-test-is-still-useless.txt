So, it’s no surprise that the White House is now reinstating an expanded citizenship exam.Those who submit applications on or after Oct. 20 must answer 12 of 20 civics questions correctly (up from six out of 10), drawn from a list of 128 (previously 100). Adding 28 questions without raising the 60% pass rate may not yield the sweeping change the administration wants, but the intent is unmistakable. The president wants to make it harder for immigrants to clear the final hurdle of the naturalization process.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
