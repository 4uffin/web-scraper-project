Its 13-member board includes seven appointees of the state government, some of whom have been known to express strong opinions in public.In Spring 2022, the board hired Nicole Musicco to convert Calpers to a Canadian-style pension portfolio and boost returns. She exited in less than two years. In Spring 2024, it turned to Stephen Gilmore to replicate his success at New Zealand’s sovereign wealth fund. This month, he formally recommended Calpers adopt the total portfolio approach, popular with sovereign funds including Australia’s Future Fund, where Gilmore was previously chief investment strategist.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
