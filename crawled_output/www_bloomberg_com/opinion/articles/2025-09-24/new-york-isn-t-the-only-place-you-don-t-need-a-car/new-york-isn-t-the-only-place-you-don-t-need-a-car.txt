That is, everywhere else in the country, most households have at least one car, van or truck, and in New York City most don’t. Citywide, 56.7% of households had zero vehicles in 2024, according to data released this month from the Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey. The cities that ranked second and third nationally are just across the Hudson River in New Jersey, and nine of the top 25 are in the New York-Newark-Jersey City metropolitan area (more New York City suburbs would make the list but don’t have the minimum of 65,000 inhabitants required for the Census Bureau to release single-year ACS data).1In the boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx and Brooklyn, the zero-vehicle share is higher than the city’s. Even not-very-urban Staten Island had the 17th-highest car-free household percentage in 2024 among US counties with 65,000 or more inhabitants — although it’s well below No. 6 Hudson County, New Jersey, sometimes referred to as the sixth borough.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
