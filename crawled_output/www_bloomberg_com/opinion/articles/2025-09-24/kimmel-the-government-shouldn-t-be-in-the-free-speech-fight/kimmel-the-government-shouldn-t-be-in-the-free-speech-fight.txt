Carter, ColumnistThe Proper Role for Government in Free Speech Fights: SilenceFCC Chair Brendan Carr shouldn’t have uttered a word about Jimmy Kimmel’s monologue.

Carter is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist, a professor of law at Yale University and author of “Invisible: The Story of the Black Woman Lawyer Who Took Down America’s Most Powerful Mobster.”FacebookXLinkedInEmailLinkGiftExpandBack on the air but probably not the last word.Photographer: Randy Holmes/Getty ImagesFacebookXLinkedInEmailLinkGiftGift this articleContact us:Provide news feedback or report an errorSite feedback:Take our SurveyNew WindowFacebookXLinkedInEmailLinkGiftBookmarkSave With Jimmy Kimmel’s return to the air on Tuesday night, one might dare to hope that we’re past the kerfuffle over insensitive remarks he made in his monologue following Charlie Kirk’s murder.
