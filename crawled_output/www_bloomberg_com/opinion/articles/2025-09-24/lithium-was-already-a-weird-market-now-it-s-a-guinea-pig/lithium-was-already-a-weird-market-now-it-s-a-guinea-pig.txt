Lithium Americas Corp., which is developing a mine atop the biggest lithium deposit in the US, is the guinea pig. By extension, a grand experiment may be about to begin in the the already weird lithium market.Toward the end of former President Joe Biden’s administration, Lithium Americas received a $2.3 billion loan commitment from the Department of Energy to fund the majority of developing the first phase of its Thacker Pass project in Nevada. At the same time, General Motors Co. took a stake in the project (having already taken a direct equity stake in Lithium Americas itself) and expanded an offtake agreement for the mine’s output. This all fit with Biden’s push to reshore critical mineral supply chains ceded to China and encourage domestic production of batteries and electric vehicles.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
