Bloomberg Businessweek , where executives from around the world tell us how they manage their time in and out of the office. Among the topics they’ve discussed are their favorite ways to optimize sleep, their favorite TV shows and go-to podcasts, and their preferred fashion uniforms.This month we asked 10 bosses across the US, the UK and Europe for their top productivity hacks. Their answers are wide-ranging: Maximizing the morning—from workouts to breakfast meetings—is a popular strategy; the power of a list is another; and then there’s the sheer brain-clearing appeal of a good walk while taking time to check in with their team.
