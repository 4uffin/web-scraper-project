It’s been wielded against, among others, Russian prison authorities, officers in Myanmar’s military, prominent South African business leaders, and Chinese government officials responsible for the Xinjiang region. On Sept. 22, the administration of President Donald Trump used the law to sanction Viviane Barci de Moraes, the wife of Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The judge was targeted under the act in July for his role in the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. A political ally of Trump’s, Bolsonaro was convicted on Sept. 11 of plotting a coup and sentenced to 27 years in prison.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
