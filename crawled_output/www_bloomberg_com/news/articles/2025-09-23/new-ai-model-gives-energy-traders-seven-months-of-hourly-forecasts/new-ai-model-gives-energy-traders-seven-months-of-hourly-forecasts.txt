That will provide energy traders a new view compared to 15-day weather projections and broad seasonal outlooks. To do so, Amperon Holdings Inc. is leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a range of hourly demand for this extended period that’ll be updated upon the daily release of global weather models created by Europe's biggest forecasting center, said Sean Kelly, a former power trader who co-founded Amperon in 2018. The firm’s customers will start receiving these forecasts on Wednesday in addition to the typical 15-day outlook Amperon offers.
