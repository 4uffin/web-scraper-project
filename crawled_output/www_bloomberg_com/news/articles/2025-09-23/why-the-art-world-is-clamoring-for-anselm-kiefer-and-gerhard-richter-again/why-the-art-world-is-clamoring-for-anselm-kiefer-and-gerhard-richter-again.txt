Born in Germany in 1945, he grew up under the weight of his country’s recent history. His landscapes of sinister forests, photographic self-portraits depicting him doing a Nazi salute and books made from scraps of his own burnt oil paintings hit audiences like a bucket of ice water.For some time, Kiefer’s art was both fresh and weighty for a jaded contemporary milieu. “I have been going to the press views of museum shows for more than thirty years, and I’ve never seen anything to equal the solemnity of this one,” wrote the critic Hilton Kramer after attending the Art Institute of Chicago’s 1987 retrospective. And as such, his art was sought out by collectors and museums around the world for decades.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
