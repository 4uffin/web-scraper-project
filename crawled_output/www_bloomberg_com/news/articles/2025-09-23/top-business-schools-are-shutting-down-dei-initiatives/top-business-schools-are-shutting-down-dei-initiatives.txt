Founded in 1966 by a business school professor at Washington University in St. Louis, the Consortium recruits underrepresented minorities to member schools with a streamlined application and sharply reduced fees. It has grown rapidly in the past five years; 25 schools participated in the application cycle for enrollment this fall. According to the Consortium’s website, the organization “recruited” 854 students to those schools, the most in its history.But early in July, prospective applicants got word that, for the admissions cycle for fall 2026, only 24 schools would participate. “Due to recent changes in state and federal policies,” the Consortium said in an email, McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin “has notified us that they will be ending our formal partnership.” The email, which a recipient posted to Reddit, suggested that McCombs was leaving reluctantly: “UT Austin has made clear that this decision is purely driven by regulatory compliance requirements, not by any dissatisfaction with our partnership or mission.” (A spokesperson for McCombs did not respond to multiple requests for comment.)HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
