Trump didn’t cite scientific evidence to support his recommendation, and there is no clear connection between the use of Tylenol during pregnancy and adverse neurobehavioral or developmental outcomes such as autism. On the same day as Trump’s remarks, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a notice to physicians about what the Trump administration said were the risks of Tylenol during pregnancy, while noting that a “causal relationship has not been established” between autism and acetaminophen, Tylenol’s active ingredient.
