The country has updated the methodology it uses to calculate the Gini coefficient to measure income inequality, now taking into account other sources like rental income and investments, Wong said in a keynote speech to parliament following general elections in May. Previously, Singapore’s Gini coefficient was measured based only on income from employment.
