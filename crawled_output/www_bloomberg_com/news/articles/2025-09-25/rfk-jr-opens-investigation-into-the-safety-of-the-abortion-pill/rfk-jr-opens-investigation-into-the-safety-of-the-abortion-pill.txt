Kennedy Jr. opened an investigation into the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone, as the antiabortion movement continues to push the administration to restrict access through lawsuits and policy. Kennedy and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would conduct its own review “relating to the safety and efficacy of the drug” in a letter to 22 Republican attorneys general. The letter, dated Sept. 19, was a response to a request from the attorneys general in July for a new safety study.
