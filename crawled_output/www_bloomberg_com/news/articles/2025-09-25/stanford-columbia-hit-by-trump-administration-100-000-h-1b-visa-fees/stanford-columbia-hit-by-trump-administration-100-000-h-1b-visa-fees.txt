It also deals another financial blow to universities already battered by the administration's crusade against top colleges. The White House's attempt to overhaul the H-1B visa system has sowed chaos in tech and finance, with Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Citigroup Inc. among the biggest users of the program.
