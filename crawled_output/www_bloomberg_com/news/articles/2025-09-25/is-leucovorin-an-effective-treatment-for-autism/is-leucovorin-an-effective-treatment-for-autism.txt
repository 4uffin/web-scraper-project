Leucovorin is a relatively inexpensive generic drug derived from folic acid, which is also known as folate or vitamin B9. Approved by the FDA decades ago, it’s currently used to blunt the side effects of chemotherapy for some cancer patients. Folic acid, on the other hand, is commonly given to pregnant women in prenatal supplements to support healthy fetal development.
