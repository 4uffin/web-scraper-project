Its products have relentlessly captured both the imagination and paychecks of consumers the world over, with new iterations of the ubiquitous iPhone reliably dispatching one rival after the next. But nothing lasts forever, and the little company from Cupertino may finally have met its match. The irony is that Apple’s big problem isn’t another company, but a technology: artificial intelligence.A combination of caution and missteps in the face of a $1.5 trillion flood of rival investments has left Apple in a delicate position. The star-crossed rollout of an iPhone update touting yet-to-be-realized AI features (an upgraded Siri being the most infamous) certainly didn’t help. In the Bloomberg Originals mini-documentary Why Apple Still Hasn’t Cracked AI?, we show how the company got to this point and what it’s doing to get back in the race.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
