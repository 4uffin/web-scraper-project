A federal judge ruled Monday that developer Orsted A/S can resume work on Revolution Wind while a lawsuit proceeds through the courts. Local agencies and federal officials are now pursuing a deal to prevent another blow to the project off the coast of Rhode Island, according to Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association.
