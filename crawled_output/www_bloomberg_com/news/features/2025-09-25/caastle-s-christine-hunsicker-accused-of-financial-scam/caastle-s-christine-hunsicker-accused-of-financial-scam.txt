As a kid in rural Pennsylvania, her family wasn’t particularly wealthy, yet she was always playing dress-up in outfits, like a penguin-print maxi dress or a shimmering sequin skirt, made by her seamstress aunt. A clothing-rental subscription company could be a blockbuster business, she thought. She even had a name for it, inspired by a character from a book she’d once imagined but never wrote: Gwynnie Bee.Hunsicker was obsessed with Rent the Runway—the startup that had sparked the clothing-rental category two years earlier. Gwynnie Bee would essentially be the same idea, just for a different crowd.
