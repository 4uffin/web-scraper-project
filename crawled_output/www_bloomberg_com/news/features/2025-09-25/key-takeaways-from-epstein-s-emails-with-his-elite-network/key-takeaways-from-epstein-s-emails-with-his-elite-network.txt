Those emails also reveal new details about academics, attorneys and media specialists who helped him—in different ways and to varying degrees—just as his life threatened to spin out of control.The emails, which span 20 years but mostly were exchanged between 2005 and 2008, shine new light on an elite network whose members defended Epstein in public and private, deflected harsh questions, offered coaching and countermessaging, and polished his reputation. The support, taken together, helped extend not just Epstein’s freedom but his influence.
