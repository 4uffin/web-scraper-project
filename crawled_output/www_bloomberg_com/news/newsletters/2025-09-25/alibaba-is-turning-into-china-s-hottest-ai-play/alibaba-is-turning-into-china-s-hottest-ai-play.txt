In New York, where the depositary receipts trade under the BABA ticker, it’s soared 31%.With the Internet giant planning to spend more than more than
380 billion yuan ($53 billion) on AI
and inking a new partnership with Nvidia, investors are starting to see the stock as more than just an e-commerce company.“I wouldn’t say there’s a ‘best AI stock,’ but Baba is the best parallel to the US hyperscalers,” said Xin-Yao Ng, a fund manager at Aberdeen Investments. “Among the large cloud players in China, they are also the most aggressive.”Chinese investors have bought a combined HK$61 billion ($7.8 billion) of Alibaba shares, on a net basis, via trading links between the mainland and Hong Kong in September. That’s the most for any month so far this year.HomeBTV+Market DataOpinionAudioOriginalsMagazineEventsNewsMarketsEconomicsTechnologyPoliticsGreenCryptoAIWork & LifeWealthPursuitsBusinessweekCityLabSportsEqualityManagement & WorkMarket DataStocksCommoditiesRates & BondsCurrenciesFuturesSectorsEconomic CalendarExploreNewslettersExplainersPointed News QuizThe Big TakeGraphicsSubmit a TipAbout UsTerms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
