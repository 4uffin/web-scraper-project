Agents discovered more than 300 SIM card servers and 100,000 SIM cards at several locations within a 35-mile radius of New York City, according to a statement on Tuesday. An attack could have severely disrupted New York at a time when world leaders are gathering in the city for a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.
