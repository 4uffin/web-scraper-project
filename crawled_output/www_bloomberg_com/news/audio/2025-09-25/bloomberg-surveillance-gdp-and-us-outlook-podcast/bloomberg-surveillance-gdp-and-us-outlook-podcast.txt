September 25th, 2025
Featuring:
1) Marta Norton, Chief Investment Strategist at Empower, Jordan Rochester, Head: FICC Macro Strategy at Mizuho EMEA, and David Katz, President and CIO of Matrix Asset Advisors, react to GDP and today's eco data and discuss the US economic outlook.
2) Win Thin, Chief Economist at Bank of Nassau, joins for an extended discussion on US growth concerns, splits across the Fed, and whether there's contagion risk from Argentina. US equities remained on the back foot after two days of losses as traders waited for new drivers to guide the market’s next move.
3) Ethan Bronner, Israel Bureau Chief with Bloomberg News, joins to discuss the war in Gaza. US envoy Steve Witkoff predicted a breakthrough in the Israel-Hamas conflict in the coming days after President Trump presented a plan to regional leaders.
4) Lisa Mateo joins with the latest headlines in newspapers across the US, including a Financial Times story on the billion-dollar quest to live beyond 100, and a Business Insider story on Costco getting a traffic boost from opening early for executive members.Sep 25, 2025SubscribeWhere to Listen:SpotifyApple PodcastsShare This Episode:Terms of ServiceDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTrademarksPrivacy PolicyCareersMade in NYCAdvertiseAd ChoicesHelp©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
