This gives him so much credibility in the European dressing room.He's only played in one Ryder Cup but he's just beaten 11 of the players he will be with in two weeks' time.

He's so likeable.He works his socks off. I love the way he plays golf. I'm really pleased for him. At 43 years of age, two tournament wins in his past three starts - just exceptional!

Here's the Swede talking to Sky Sports: "I have so many emotions right now. I wasn't laying up (in the play-off). I thought I hit (my second shot) in the water and then I got a good break with my ball sitting nicely. "I hit my iron shots way better the first three days, I was struggling a bit today. Sometimes it comes easy and sometimes you've got to fight. He was better tee to green today."And when asked if he's going to be taking his clubs to the Ryder Cup in case he's needed as an injury replacement, he says he will do, but only because he needs to take them back to his home in Florida and that other players are more deserving of the opportunity to play.

It's been quite the end to the summer for Alex Noren. He missed a big chunk of the Ryder Cup qualification period with an injury but then picked up his first win in seven years at the British Masters three weeks ago.And a second BMW PGA Championship title, eight years after his first. If only the Ryder Cup wildcard picks were being made this week...

And Alex Noren knocks in the short putt. He's the champion for a second time.

You feel like Adrien Saddier has to hole this to force another play-off hole.His ball is nestled on the edge of the fringe and a collar of rough. He trundles it down the hill but that's not threatening the hole. And it's still him to play.Must make. And he does. Over to you Alex. A putt to win the BMW PGA Championship.

Let's hope Alex Noren is not offering too much advice to his fellow Europeans on the Ryder Cup team in a couple of weeks! That did not seem like a sensible shot.Anyway... Adrien Saddier up first. A chip over the stream, plenty of green to work with but he's a bit heavy handed there and his ball flies a good 20-25 feet past the hole and into the fringe, leaving a downhill putt.Noren plays his third shot more delicately, landing the ball 20 feet short and allowing it to release up to kick-in range. Big advantage to the Swede.

Extraordinary shots.I have never seen two players with fairway woods coming up so short of the target that they were aiming for.I think they're both OK - it's just playing so much longer in these conditions.

This is slightly comical. After almost matching drives, they end up in almost matching positions short of the green.Alex Noren is looking anxiously after his ball as it flies down the left side too, thankfully for him it takes a soft bounce in the rough and stays there.A chip-off out of the cabbage coming up...

I'm not quite sure what Adrien Saddier ended up doing there. Maybe he ended up mis-hitting it slightly. But his ball screwed out a bit left and ended up plunging into rough short of the stream that protects the green.Oh wow. This is catching. Here comes Ryder Cup vice-captain Alex Noren with a fairway wood from the rough... 254 yards for the Swede...

Adrien Saddier is up first. He's got 258 yards to the flag. Into the wind. And he's going for it again.This is a brave, brave shot.

Interesting dynamic now.Adrien Saddier has a decision to make. He can place his ball but Alex Noren can't because he's off the fairway.It's a game of chess. Go first and possibly give the advantage to the guy behind? I think he'll have another crack at it.

The two protagonists have been given a lift back to the 18th tee on separate buggies and Alex Noren is teeing off first.He misses the fairway but his ball comes to rest in the rough, avoiding the bunkers.Adrien Saddier follows Noren but his ball is about five yards shorter in length and that means he's on the fairway. And with lift, clean and place in operation, he's certainly got the advantage.

Well, it's perhaps not the big British or Ryder Cup names we were hoping to see shine through a gloomy Sunday in Surrey but you cannot argue that Alex Noren and Adrien Saddier have served up a real treat this afternoon.They have gone toe-to-toe all day and Saddier's bogey-free round in these conditions has been sublime.

Here's Adrien Saddier with a putt to win the PGA Championship. Straight up the hill. Don't leave it short sunshine... the ball isn't stopping short... but it misses left edge. Par.And Alex Noren tidies up for his par from a couple of feet.Play-off.

Alex Noren first out with the putter. And he's walking after his ball as soon as he hits it. Never on line.

Ah, here's Tyrrell. Hatton is on the green in three and has a 30-footer or so for a closing birdie.He's wasting no time, not wanting to get in the way of the two duking it out for the title. It's a two-putt par to finish. No huge surprise there given how his putter has been today.

Adrien Saddier's ball is actually not in a bad lie, he's just got a massive tree trunk in front of him. It's right in his line, he's maybe got to miss the trunk by six inches.The Frenchman is not hanging round here. He flicks the ball off the bare lie and his ball takes a couple of hops left and leaves himself a 20-footer for birdie.Alex Noren has already played his second. His wedge was a little wayward, pin-high but 25 feet right of the hole.

His ball has ended up among the crowd.I'm going to call that advantage Noren.
