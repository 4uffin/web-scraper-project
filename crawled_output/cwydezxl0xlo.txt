knowing it would be challenging."There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence," he said. EPA/ShutterstockAssistant Commissioner Twist said officers had suffered broken teeth, concussion, a prolapsed disc, a head injury and a possible broken nose.The arrests were "just the start," he added as the Met vowed to identify those involved in disorder.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned "those who have attacked and injured police officers"."Anyone taking part in criminal activity will face the full force of the law," she added.Around mid-afternoon, the two demonstrations were divided on Whitehall by lines of police officers.While the rally began largely peacefully, the Met said some officers had been attacked while trying to keep the two groups apart.The Unite the Kingdom protest had "exceeded the estimates of organisers", the force said, which meant there was not enough space for them all in Whitehall and Parliament Square.Large crowds ignored police directions and tried to get into secure areas and spots occupied by those participating in the Stand Up To Racism protest."When officers intervened to block their path they were assaulted with kicks and punches," the Met said, adding that riot police, horses and dogs were used to keep the opposing groups apart.People scaled fencing and scaffolding around Whitehall which put "themselves and others in danger", the Met added. PA MediaThe Met Police estimated around 110,000 were in Whitehall for the Tommy Robinson event and 5,000 for the counter-protestAt one point, a glass bottle appeared to smash against a horse, causing the animal and rider to stagger backwards.Scuffles broke out as police used batons to try and push back Robinson supporters gathered on the top of Whitehall and Trafalgar Square.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, addressed the crowds at the "freedom of speech festival" where he criticised politicians for "parroting" his ideas.He also claimed UK courts had decided the rights of undocumented migrants superseded those of the "local community".Last month, the Court of Appeal overturned an injunction blocking asylum seekers being housed at The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex.Aerial video shows scale of ‘Unite the Kingdom’ protestMaking a surprise appearance via videolink, Musk spoke about "massive uncontrolled migration" and called for a "change of government" in the UK."Something's got to be done," Musk said, as he was interviewed by Robinson."There's got to be a dissolution of Parliament and a new vote held."TV presenter Katie Hopkins also spoke on stage after earlier appearing alongside Robinson, former actor Laurence Fox and TV personality Ant Middleton at the front of the march near Waterloo station.Rhiannon and Sharon had travelled from south Wales to attend the Stand Up To Racism counter-rallyNearby, at the Stand Up To Racism rally, independent MP Diane Abbott told demonstrators: "We know racism and violence and fascism is not new. "But you know what? We have always defeated that racism and violence."People had travelled from across the country to attend the counter-protest. Rhiannon and Sharon, from south Wales, told the BBC it was "the right thing to do".Another rally attendee said they were worried about the "narrative of hate being peddled by the other side", whilst another added they had come to show "we [London] are not a fascist city".Robinson brought his stage events to a close just after 18:30 and promised another such event.The 42-year-old was released from prison earlier this year after being jailed in October for ignoring an order not to repeat false claims about a Syrian refugee, who had successfully sued him for libel.Stand up to Racism counter protesters gathered in LondonAdditional reporting by Daniel Sandford, Nick Johnson and Maia Davies.Elon MuskTommy RobinsonLondonRelatedWho is Elon Musk and what is his net worth?Larry Ellison briefly becomes world's richest personTesla proposes $1tn award for Musk if he hits targetsMore from the BBC13 hrs agoNational Gallery gets £375m donations for new wingThe gallery is launching an architectural contest to design a new wing for its expanded collection.13 hrs ago13 hrs agoHome's energy rating downgraded despite £60k spendThe government is being urged to change the methodology assessors use to work out energy ratings.13 hrs ago13 hrs agoOn patrol with the company recovering stolen bikesJust 0.6% of bike thefts in London this year have led to a charge, prosecution or caution.13 hrs ago13 hrs agoTaxi driver saves passengers from falling treeTerry Williams averted disaster by his quick thinking when a tree fell into the path of his taxi.13 hrs ago1 day agoWestfield shopping centre evacuated after fireSeveral vehicles were alight on an upper level of the car park, London Fire Brigade say.1 day agoBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBritBoxBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoBBC.com Help & FAQsContent IndexCopyright 2025 BBC.
