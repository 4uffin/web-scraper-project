A new generation is falling in love with a centuries-old game. These womenÂ 65 and older cleanÂ local ponds by diving for trash (and have a blast doing it). She lost her dad in the Twin Towers â but the FDNY made sure he was still part of her wedding day. A doctor was told he would die, but he found a treatment for his disease everyone else had missed. Plus, the music program that teaches kids jazz and so much more.Â
