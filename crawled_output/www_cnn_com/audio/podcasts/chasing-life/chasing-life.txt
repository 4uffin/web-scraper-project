Public health is, in the words of this weekâs guest, âthe organized actions of society to make people safer and healthier.â Unfortunately, to some, it feels like the country is waging a war against the very institutionsÂ entrusted to carry out that mission. Dr. Sanjay Gupta sits down with public health expert and former CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden about the critical and often-invisible role of public health, and what he hopes to accomplish with his new book, The Formula For Better Health.
