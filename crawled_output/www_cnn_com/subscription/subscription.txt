frequently asked questions
Why do I have to pay to read articles on CNN?
Users get a limited number of articles for free, but subscribers get unlimited articles and bonus content. By subscribing, you also help support the trusted journalism you rely on daily.
I already pay to watch CNN on my TV/mobile device. Do I also have a subscription to CNN.com?
The CNN TV channel is only available through your cable or streaming provider. Unlimited access to website content is a separate feature available with a CNN subscription.
I registered for a free account to access articles? Why do I need to subscribe?
Unlimited access to articles is now a subscriber-only benefit. Registered CNN users still have access to a limited number of free articles as well as newsletters, follow topics, and article commenting.
Can I pause or cancel my subscription?
While you can’t pause a subscription, you can cancel it at any time. The Help Center has information about how to cancel a subscription.
