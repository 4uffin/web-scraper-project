Fall sweaters under $50 quick picks
Cashmere sweater: Quince Mongolian Cashmere Crewneck Sweater Bell-sleeve sweater: Beverly & Beck Chloe Bell-Sleeve SweaterMerino wool sweater: Uniqlo Merino SweaterCardigan sweater: Uniqlo Extra Fine Merino Wool Cardigan
Sweaters are by far one of the most worn items in my fall wardrobe, and like most closet staples, the styling potential of a quality sweater is unmatched. When paired with slacks or a good pair of jeans, and comfortable, arch-supportive footwear, I have a fail-proof outfit that works perfectly for the office or a day of running errands.
This year, some of the sweater trends we can expect to see, according to personal stylist and founder of The Closet Compass Sabrina Morin, include textured knits (think cable knits and waffle weaves), oversized fits and retro-inspired patterns. Also trending this season, according to Morin and stylist and content creator Nena Evans? Stripes. “Stripes will have a major comeback this fall,” Evans said. “We’re going to see the full spectrum here, from sleek, vertical pinstripes to bold, oversized horizontal patterns.”
Ahead of the official start of the new season, we tapped multiple stylists for their insights on what to look for when shopping for sweaters, along with their recommendations on what sweaters to buy for $50 or less.

Best fall sweaters under $50
BP. Oversized Cozy V-Neck Sweater
Nordstrom
According to personal stylist and style coach Samantha Dawn, this oversized V-neck sweater can easily be worn off the shoulders or layered with a button-down. It ranges in size from XXS to XL, comes in three colors — gray, ivory and purple — and features ribbed cuffs and a hem. Reviewers say it runs quite large, so consider sizing down.
$50 at Nordstrom
Topshop Exposed Seam Sweater
Nordstrom
Stylist and global business and celebrity strategist Nina Lato recommends checking out Topshop for a variety of affordable sweaters. “I love this cropped one that you can style with a skirt and boots or high-waisted jeans,” she said. “It is perfectly in-season, stylish and super easy to wear. A great go-to closet staple.”
$50
$20 at Nordstrom
Quince Mongolian Cashmere Crewneck Sweater
Quince
Quince is known for its affordable yet high-quality cashmere and wool pieces, which is what makes it a go-to brand among editors like myself. This cozy-looking crewneck sweater was recommended by two of our experts: Dawn and Evans. The sweater is made from an ultra-soft Mongolian cashmere that will keep you warm on chilly days, and it’s available in several colors. Dawn recommends layering this sweater over a button-down for a more professional feel.
$50 at Quince
Urban Outfitters Out From Under Clarity Cozy Knit Off-the-Shoulder Top
Urban Outfitters
“I love that this sweater is more of a cozy knit that falls off the shoulder,” Dawn said. “It feels relaxed with a bit of a subtle, sexy vibe.” Featuring a wide boatneck, this pullover could easily be paired with lounge pants for a comfy, work-from-home look. For an elevated look, Dawn recommends pairing this sweater with a structured skirt.
$49 at Urban Outfitters
Beverly & Beck Chloe Bell-Sleeve Sweater
Pacsun
If you’re looking for a lightweight, statement-making sweater, Morin recommends this one from Beverly & Beck. “Featuring dramatic bell sleeves, this sweater taps into fall 2025’s sculptural knitwear trend,” she said. “The flared sleeves add volume and movement, balanced by a relaxed body.”
$43
$39 at PacSun
Universal Thread Women’s Short-Sleeve Crewneck Pullover Sweater
Target
Target isn’t just a prime retailer to shop for seasonal decor. Case in point, this cream, striped Universal Thread sweater. “Its breathable knit is perfect for early fall layering or wearing solo in warmer climates and it pairs well with denim or skirts for an easy transitional outfit,” Morin said. She also recommends checking out this long-sleeved option.
$25 at Target

Uniqlo Washable Knit Ribbed Polo Sweater
Uniqlo
Uniqlo is a personal favorite of mine for affordable basics, and as it turns out, the brand is a popular choice among the stylists we interviewed too. This sweater, which comes in five colors, is made from a soft and stretchy rayon, polyester and nylon blend. “I love the polo detail that makes this sweater feel more professional,” Dawn said. She suggests styling it with a vest on top.
$50 at Uniqlo
Ardene Cable-Knit V-Neck Sweater
Ardene
“This chunky, cable-knit V-neck [sweater] channels heritage prep with a modern cropped cut,” Morin said. “The deep neckline is perfect for layering over button-downs or turtlenecks and the textured cable stitch adds visual richness at an affordable price point.”
$35 at Ardene
ASOS Loose Knit Collar Henley Sweater
Asos
For those wanting a more elevated, everyday sweater, Evans recommends this one from ASOS, which features a partial button placket. “The open weave gives it a breathable texture, perfect for those in-between fall days,” she said.
$38 at ASOS
Uniqlo Merino Sweater
Uniqlo
Don’t underestimate the value of incorporating a simple merino wool sweater into your wardrobe. “It's a timeless classic, perfect for wearing on its own, with dandy, gold jewelry or as a layering piece, as the weather cools,” Raquel Macias, a luxury wardrobe stylist with over 10 years of experience, said of this Uniqlo pick. The sweater comes in nine colors, but Macias recommends the off-white option.
$40 at Uniqlo
Forest Field Fashion Elegant Metal Button Short Cardigan
Forest Field Fashion
The gold metallic buttons on this Forest Field cardigan that Morin recommends instantly elevate the piece, making this cardigan a great option for a weekend look. “The fitted shape works beautifully over dresses or high-waisted trousers, fitting the season’s micro-cardigan trend for layering versatility,” Morin said.
$43
$39 at Forest Field Fashion
Cotton On Cotton Crewneck Sweater
Cotton On
If you’re looking for a timeless option that’s suitable for several occasions, Lato recommends Cotton On’s crewneck, which she described as cozy, comfortable and flattering. Though this knit sweater comes in several colors, Dark Oak is the perfect way to embrace brown for the fall.

ASOS Oversized Sweater With Balloon Sleeves in Buttermilk
Asos
“Oversized proportions and voluminous balloon sleeves give this knit a fashion-forward silhouette,” Morin said. “The creamy Buttermilk hue aligns with fall’s warm neutral palette, and the ribbed cuffs subtly rein in the volume for easy styling.”
$40 at ASOS
Uniqlo Extra Fine Merino Wool Cardigan
Uniqlo
If you don’t already have a cardigan in your closet, consider this your official sign to pick one up this season. Stylist and creative, fashion and art director Julie Matos recommends this one from Uniqlo, which is made from an extra-fine merino wool. “It’s the cardigan you’ll keep on the back of your chair because it looks as good in the boardroom as it does at brunch,” she said.
$50 at Uniqlo
Zara Ribbed Knit Sweater
Zara
Though I’m currently swooning over Zara’s suede pieces, the brand has a lot to offer in the sweater department too. This boatneck sweater, recommended by Dawn, comes in a gorgeous olive color that’s perfect for fall. According to the stylist, the textured knit detail is a great way to add dimension and interest to any outfit.
$50 at Zara
Cider Knit V-Neck Solid Contrasting Binding Long-Sleeve Top
Cider
Morin recommends this sweater from Cider, which has “bold contrast binding along the neckline and cuffs for a preppy, defined finish.” According to Morin, its streamlined fit makes it ideal for wearing with pleated skirts or tucking it into tailored bottoms for a collegiate-inspired look.
$33 at Cider
How to choose the best sweaters for fall
Material
Dawn recommends figuring out which fabrics you prefer, whether it’s cotton or wool, before thinking about the desired shape and fit of your sweaters. Since climate also plays a role in the material you opt for, it makes sense that Lato suggests factoring that into your decision as well. “If you’re in super-cold climates, you will want to look for heavier sweaters with fabrics like wool to keep you super warm,” Lato said. “You will want to skip sheer sweaters, lightweight cotton sweaters or sweaters with larger gaping in the fabric, which can let too much airflow in.”
Fit
Fit and structure are other factors you’ll want to keep in mind. Determining whether you plan to wear the sweater on its own or layered with other pieces will help you decide on fit and whether you want something that’s oversized, tailored or cropped, Lato said. According to Morin, vests and lightweight knits “let you build or adjust your fall outfit easily.” She also recommends opting for cropped vests or cardigans, if you’re looking for something that will help define your waist. Oversized vests or drop-shoulder sweaters, on the other hand, are great for adding softness and volume.

Design
Aesthetics are also important to consider. Morin recommends opting for sweaters with a bit of texture. “Seek visible stitches or mixed yarns — like crochet, ribbing or waffle textures — to create richness even at a lower price.” She also recommends leaning into patterns and prints, like horizontal stripes, retro prints and argyle designs. Color-wise, Morin suggests sticking to neutral colors like taupe and cream or a jewel-tone color, like ruby or sapphire.
FAQs
The following FAQs have been answered by stylists Nena Evans, Nina Lato and Sabrina Morin.
What style of sweater is best for fall?
According to Evans, a relaxed-fit crewneck or a half-zip are essential for the season, as they’re easy to layer and versatile. “Look for subtle details like ribbing, dropped shoulders or soft stripes to add a little polish,” she said.
What material is best for a fall sweater?
“Cotton blends and lightweight wool are perfect for transitional weather,” Evans said. She recommends looking for sweaters that are equal parts breathable and cozy for all day comfort.
What should I wear with a fall sweater?
According to Evans, styling your sweaters with accessories, like belts and bold earrings, is one way to instantly upgrade your look. The shoes you wear with your sweaters can also make a difference, according to Lato. If you want to elevate your whole look, throw on a pair of boots or heels. Going for a more laid-back look? Sneakers are the way to go, she said.
For office dressing, Morin recommends opting for “a fine-knit or ribbed sweater with clean lines and subtle detailing like buttons at the wrist or a mockneck.” She also recommends tucking your sweaters into tailored pants or a midi skirt and layering a blazer over your outfit, if your office environment is more formal.
For ultimate coziness for a casual weekend, choose oversized and drop-shoulder sweaters in soft knits or marled textures. “Pair with leggings, joggers or relaxed-fit jeans and finish with chunky sneakers or Ugg-style boots,” Morin said. “Look for details like half-zips, V-necks or polo collars to give shape. A baseball cap or beanie and an oversized tote bring comfy off-duty energy.” For extra warmth and dimension, you can also try layering a thin, long-sleeve top underneath.
Can you wear cashmere sweaters in the fall?
Yes! According to Evans, fall is an ideal time to break out the cashmere, since it’s lightweight and insulating, making it ideal for layering or wearing on its own. “Cashmere can be on the pricier end, but if you go for a classic cut in a neutral tone, you’ll wear it on repeat all season,” she said.
