For the wine aficionado: In Good Taste 2025 Wine Advent CalendarFor people obsessed with fancy chocolate: Dandelion Chocolate 2025 Advent CalendarA perennial crowd-pleaser: Bonne Maman 2025 Limited-Edition Advent CalendarFor Potterheads of all ages: Lego Harry Potter Advent Calendar 2025For the person whose home always smells good: Voluspa Heritage 12-Day Advent Calendar
As CNN Underscored’s gift guide editor, I usually start thinking about the holiday season in July, if not earlier. But now that it’s officially fall, it’s finally socially acceptable for everyone to start thinking about gift-giving, and that includes Advent calendars.
In my opinion, Advent calendars are the best way to get into the holiday spirit. Who doesn’t want to count down the days until Christmas with a little treat? And even though it’s only September, many of our favorite brands’ calendars are already available for purchase. That means you can beat the rush and stock up now before they start selling out. (Trust me, all the best Advent calendars tend to sell out sooner than you’d expect.)
On this list, you’ll find Advent calendars that will surprise and delight people of nearly every interest, whether you’re shopping for a Lego enthusiast, a dog parent or a snack lover. And as we get our hands on the latest releases for 2025, I’ll be sure to update this story with more of our team’s favorite Advent calendars.

Reader Favorite
Bonne Maman 2025 Limited-Edition Advent Calendar
A perennial crowd-pleaser
Bonne Maman
Readers go nuts for Bonne Maman’s jam-filled Advent calendar every year, and it’s easy to see why. Those mini jars, complete with the brand’s iconic gingham lids, are irresistible! Each calendar features 24 limited-edition preserves and spreads, like Fig With Cardamom and Milk Caramel With Madagascar Vanilla (my favorite so far), housed inside reusable boxes. This calendar always sells out, so I suggest stocking up on a few for last-minute gifts.
$55 at Amazon

Papier 24 Days of Desk Delights
For the stationery obsessed
Papier
I've been a fan of Papier's stationery products for years; its notebooks, planners, calendars and cards are some of my favorites. For 2025, the brand's Advent calendar includes 24 days' worth of desk accessories, plus paper products like a Gratitude Journal and a Daily Planner. It sold out the past two years, so don't dillydally if you want one.
$175 at Papier

SmartBones Furry Christmas Advent Calendar
For your four-legged friend
Amazon
Even though this Advent calendar for dogs isn’t new for this year, it’s a favorite of editorial coordinator Stephanie Luna’s pup. “My dog, Stitch, is usually a picky eater, but he loved the treats in this calendar,” she said. “Since the treats are quite chewy, they kept him entertained for a few minutes, and once he finished eating, he started rubbing his face against the couch — his telltale sign that he just ate something delicious!”

Charlotte Tilbury Beauty Treasure Chest
A calendar full of beauty editor-approved goodies
Charlotte Tilbury
When I asked beauty and fashion editor Sophie Shaw about the best beauty Advent calendars she's seen this year, she flagged Charlotte Tilbury's Treasure Chest as a definite standout. It comes with five full-size items (including iconic Pillow Talk lip products) and seven minis, all in a gorgeous chest that can be reused as a jewelry box.
$220 at Charlotte Tilbury
Flaviar 2025 Whiskey Advent Calendar
For the whiskey connoisseur
Flaviar
I tried Flaviar’s Advent calendar last year, and even though I wasn’t able to finish the entire thing, I was impressed by the creative packaging and the whiskeys I tasted. This year's theme is air travel, and each day’s compartment holds a 50-milliliter vial of whiskey. You’ll also get two Glencairn glasses, a booklet with tasting notes and a membership to Flaviar Black that gets you discounts on and exclusive access to bottles.
$270
$260 at Flaviar
Fly By Jing 2025 Limited Edition Advent Calendar
For anyone who loves trying new flavors in the kitchen
Fly By Jing
I always look forward to Fly By Jing's new drops, whether it's a limited-edition spicy ketchup or a holiday gifting bundle. Perhaps its most exciting yearly launch, though, is this 12-day Advent calendar, which hides a surprise selection of products including sauces, noodles and more. The beautifully festive box is perfect for gifting, but if you love all things umami, be sure to get a calendar for yourself too.
$98 at Fly By Jing
Laithwaites 2025 Wine Advent Calendar
An Advent calendar that includes a bottle of bubbly
Laithwaites
"I was gifted this wine Advent calendar last year, and I loved it so much, I bought myself one for 2025," managing editor Rachel Quigley said. "I was absolutely thrilled when I saw the adorable holiday-themed box it comes in, so festive and whimsical. There are 24 different mini bottles of wine from all over the globe and even a bottle of prosecco to pop open on (spoiler alert) Dec. 24." You can preorder the calendar for $25 and pay the rest when it ships (for free). Quigley said it's the perfect gift for the wine lover in your life or even yourself.
$160 at Laithwaites
Williams Sonoma Peppermint Bark Advent Calendar
A nostalgic candy that will take you back to childhood
Williams Sonoma
I’ve always had a love-hate relationship with minty chocolate, but Williams Sonoma’s Peppermint Bark is the real deal. This 24-day calendar comes with the beloved crunchy peppermint bark in four holiday-themed shapes, like snowmen and toy soldiers. I recently got an early taste of the new Peppermint Bark Flurries, and I’ll just say I really hope those make their way into an Advent calendar one day too.
$37 at Williams Sonoma
Anthropologie The 24 Days of Beauty Advent Calendar
For the skin care and fragrance enthusiast
Anthropologie
I was so excited to get my hands on this beauty Advent calendar from Anthropologie, which features 24 days' worth of goodies from top brands like Caudalie, L’Occitane, Kopari and Peter Thomas Roth. I found that the calendar has a good mix of my tried-and-true favorites (like a mini bottle of my favorite sunscreen from Supergoop!) and products I’ve been hoping to try (including Vacation’s Shimmer Oil). There are even quite a few fragrance samples in it, which is perfect because I’ve been trying to find a new perfume.
$98 at Anthropologie

Dandelion Chocolate 2025 Advent Calendar
For people obsessed with fancy chocolate
Dandelion Chocolate
I have a major sweet tooth, and this is hands down the best chocolate Advent calendar I’ve tried. Everything from the high-end packaging (each day’s box doubles as an ornament!) to the uniquely flavored chocolates inside screams luxury. My favorite part is that you have the option to order a two-person version so each day has two pieces of chocolate. This makes it so much easier to share the experience with a loved one.
From $198 at Dandelion Chocolate

Lego Harry Potter Advent Calendar 2025
For Potterheads of all ages
Lego
Lego just released a bunch of new Advent calendars for 2025, but this Harry Potter version might be my favorite. Designed for ages 7 and up, this 278-piece calendar includes 24 buildable figures you’ll recognize from the Wizarding World, like Hedwig, the Sorting Hat and Harry Potter himself in a Hogwarts Christmas sweater.
$45 at Lego
Straightaway Cocktails 12 Nights of Cocktails
For mixed drinks in a flash
Straightaway Cocktails
You don't need a fully stocked bar to enjoy craft cocktails every once in a while. Straightaway's Advent calendar comes with 12 ready-to-drink cans, ranging from Bee's Knees to Paper Plane to Espresso Martini. Associate testing writer Carolina Gazal raved about the canned Negronis from Straightaway Cocktails last summer, stating that they "taste just like the real deal."
$60 at Straightaway Cocktails
Voluspa Heritage 12-Day Advent Calendar
For the person whose home always smells good
Voluspa
Voluspa’s 2025 Advent calendar is pretty similar to last year’s, but that doesn’t make me any less excited for it as someone who loves scented candles. Inside, you’ll find 12 votive candles, each of which has a burn time of about 25 hours, in scents from the brand’s bestselling and holiday collections (think: Crushed Candy Cane, Forbidden Fig and White Cypress). You’ll also get a gold wick trimmer — always trim wicks before each burn to make candles last longer!
$175 at Voluspa
Vahdam Classic Advent Calendar
For a cozy cuppa each day leading up to Christmas
Vahdam
I'm more of a coffee person, but I know plenty of tea lovers who would be delighted to open up one of Vahdam's loose-leaf blends every day. There are 24 servings inside, including black, oolong and herbal tea blends with varying levels of caffeine.

In Good Taste 2025 Wine Advent Calendar
For the wine aficionado
In Good Taste
Quigley gifts herself In Good Taste’s wine Advent calendar every year. She likes this version that comes with 24 6-ounce bottles of reds, whites and rosés, all crafted by the brand's in-house winemaker. And if you prefer just reds or just whites and rosés, In Good Taste has dedicated wine Advent calendars you'll enjoy too.

Uncommon Goods Through the Window Puzzle Advent Calendar
For anyone trying to reduce their screen time
Uncommon Goods
Uncommon Goods has so many unique Advent calendars that it was hard to narrow down the list, but I think this one makes such a cozy gift for the homebody. I love the idea of completing a mini puzzle every day leading up to Christmas. The puzzles showcase the different holiday traditions of each family in an apartment building. At the end, you can put all the mini puzzles together to create one big picture.
$28 at Uncommon Goods
Walker's Shortbread Advent Calendar
For fans of simple sweets
Amazon
I was so excited to bring this Advent calendar home from work because my husband loves Walker’s Shortbread. We ate a couple cookies on the couch (delicious as expected), but when I woke up the next morning, I was shocked to find out he had eaten the rest after I went to bed! Hopefully you have more self-control around shortbread cookies than we do.

Insight Editions Wicked: Premium Advent Calendar
For anyone who has the ‘What Is This Feeling?’ dance memorized
Amazon
“Wicked: For Good” comes out in November, and I cannot wait to see it in theaters. Luckily, you don’t have to wait that long to get your hands on the official Wicked Advent calendar. (It’s currently available for preorder and will be released on Sept. 30 — but I imagine it will sell out quickly.) The premium version comes with a keepsake box inspired by the Emerald City, and inside, you’ll find 12 collectibles like a metal bookmark, a key chain and a notebook. If you want to spend less, the regular version is under $40.

Compartés Winter Fox Chocolate Advent Calendar
An editor-loved chocolate calendar with limited-edition flavors
Compartés
We’re big fans of Compartés chocolates here at CNN Underscored. The brand’s gourmet chocolate truffles have unique flavors that melt in your mouth, and this year’s Advent calendar includes some limited-edition offerings that you won’t find anywhere else. The Salted Caramel Bomboloni and Black Forest Gateau are calling my name.
$120 at Compartés
Uncommon Goods Advent Shower Steamer Set
For people who need to prioritize self-care
Uncommon Goods
Shower steamers are such a treat, especially in the winter when you don't want to get out of the shower because it's so cold in the bathroom. This set of 24 steamers is scented with seasonal essential oils (think: peppermint and clove) that will turn your everyday routine into something that feels more luxurious.
$98 at Uncommon Goods
Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025
For anyone who considers May 4 a holiday
Lego
More of a Star Wars fan? Anyone ages 6 and up can still get in on the Lego fun while counting down the days until Christmas with this calendar. As you open the doors each day, you’ll get to put together 14 kinds of droids, festive figures (like BB-8 as a snowman!) and more mini Star Wars-themed builds.

How to choose the best Advent calendar
Choosing an Advent calendar is as easy as picking one out that suits your (or the recipient’s) interests. If you’ve got a major sweet tooth, then you’ll probably be drawn to one of the chocolate or candy Advent calendars on our list. If you’re shopping for a teenager obsessed with musicals, they’d probably be head over heels for the official Wicked Advent calendar.
You should also look at whether the Advent calendar has 24 or 12 days’ worth of surprises so you can set your expectations. If you start your countdown on Dec. 1 but then don’t have enough to get you to Christmas Eve, you’ll probably be left disappointed. Similarly, it’s a good idea to consider the overall value of an Advent calendar. If you don’t care about spoilers, take a look at the list of products included and see how many are miniature or full-size. This will help you determine if the cost of the calendar is worth it to you. Even if you’re not getting the best deal out there, I still think an Advent calendar could be worth buying because of the novelty factor.
FAQs
What is an Advent calendar used for?
Advent calendars are designed to count down the days until Christmas, so they typically have 24 or 25 openings filled with treats or small surprises. In that case, you’d open the first one on Dec. 1 so you can spread the holiday cheer throughout the beginning of the month.
Other Advent calendars have only 12 days (for the 12 days of Christmas), which means you open the first door on Christmas Day. However, some people choose to start those 12-day countdowns on Dec. 13 instead. I’ve done it both ways, so the choice is yours!
What can you put inside a DIY Advent calendar?
You can put in anything that fits inside the Advent calendar’s drawers or boxes, so the options are practically endless. Here are some ideas to get you started.
Lip balms
Jewelry
Candy
Fidget toys
Pet treats
Keychains
Travel-size skin care products
Bag charms
Specialty coffee and tea
Mini fragrance bottles
Fun socks
Handwritten notes
