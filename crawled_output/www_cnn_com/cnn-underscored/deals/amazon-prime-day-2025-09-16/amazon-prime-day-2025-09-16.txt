Why trust CNN Underscored
Amazon has officially announced the dates for its upcoming October Prime Day sale. The mega-retailer is officially returning to kick off the holiday shopping season this fall with its third annual Prime Big Deal days event. Official dates await below, alongside some early chances to save on Amazon deals.
Keep reading for everything you need to know about Prime Big Deal Days, and even get some chances to score the year’s best prices on Crest Whitestrips, beloved Bissell carpet cleaners and more.
When is October Prime Day?
Amazon’s 2025 Prime Big Deal Days sale will officially go live on Tuesday, Oct. 7. The whirlwind 48-hour event will carry over through the end of Oct. 8. On the East Coast, the deals begin at 3 a.m. ET, while West Coasters can start shopping at midnight PT. This is a departure from Prime Day proper back in July, which marked Amazon’s first-ever four-day shopping event. Now, the brand is returning to its usual two-day format with the third-ever October Prime Day.
Amazon deals to shop ahead of time
Just because Prime Big Deal Days is weeks away doesn’t mean that you can’t already save. Some of the best discounts I have tracked this year are live on bigger purchases, alongside some rare price cuts on everyday essentials and everything in between.
Crest 3D Whitestrips Sensitive White Kit, 18-Pack
Amazon
Our editors and readers alike know to stock up on these whitening strips when they go on sale, because they help visibly brighten teeth after one use. While they're a bit pricey at full cost, today's offer takes $13 off. Or, buy two of the 18-packs to take a stackable $5 off your order.
$50
$37 at Amazon
Bissell Little Green Multipurpose Portable Carpet and Upholstery Cleaner
Bissell
When it comes to lifting stains from carpet or upholstery, there's nothing that does a better job than the Little Green machine. Our review takes a closer look at that performance, but the main takeaway is that it's worth buying, even at full price. Luckily, you won't have to pay that now that Amazon is taking $24 off with this rare markdown.

Apple MagSafe Charger
Apple MagSafe Charger
Target
Whether you have a new iPhone 17 series smartphone on the way or one of Apple's older handsets, the company's official MagSafe charger is an essential way to refuel. Featuring a magnetic snap-on design, it supports up to 25W charging and is compatible with iPhones 12 and newer. Score a rare Amazon discount on either cable length, starting at $33.

Ego Power+ LB6504 Cordless Leaf Blower
Ego
This editor-favorite electric leaf blower is seeing a rare price cut just in time to tackle autumn's biggest chore. When we tried it out for ourselves, our tester noted it could be held for long periods of time without strain. Its rechargeable lithium-ion battery also lasted longer than the competition, even on the highest speed level.

Editor Favorite
TP-Link Tapo Matter Smart Plug
Amazon
Save 33% on this smart plug that works with all of the major platforms. That means you can control this with your smartphone, Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa and other services while it's down to the best price of the year. I use one of these in my own smart home and love its quick responsiveness.
$15
$10 at Amazon
Roborock Q7 M5+ Robot Vacuum and Mop
Amazon
The best robot vacuum money can buy won't cost you its full price tag. The upgraded version of our best overall robot vacuum pick is seeing a $150 discount on Amazon in the build-up to the Prime Big Deal Days event. Our best-tested model only fell short on mopping, but the Q7 series fixes that with dual cleaning capabilities.

Apple AirPods Pro 2 With USB-C
Amazon
I've been using Apple's AirPods Pro 2 practically every single day since they launched in 2022. The new AirPods Pro 3 may replace these in my daily listening setup, but I'd be remiss not to recommend the older version now that they're $50 off. If you don't need the absolute best ANC on the market, the Pro 2 are an easy way to enjoy many of the same features for less.

Anker Nano II 65W USB-C Charger
Amazon
This three-port charger from Anker has enough juice to simultaneously power up smartphones, smartwatches and MacBooks. It has 65 watts of power shared between the dual USB-C ports and single USB-A slot, and now at $4 less than its deal last August, it's at its lowest price in months.

Cuisinart 14-Cup Coffee Maker
Amazon
This coffee maker features a 14-cup glass carafe that brews enough cups of joe for the whole family. It's on sale for $30 off in the classic stainless steel or black/stainless steel finish. That's even less than what you'll find with the MSRP on the other styles listed at Amazon.
$120

Grace & Stella Retinol Under-Eye Patches, 24-Pack
Grace & Stella
After we tested over a dozen alternatives, Grace & Stella prevailed as our best budget under-eye patches pick. This pack swaps the energizing ingredients of our top-tested pick for a retinol formula designed to firm, plump and reduce oil.
$22
$16 at Amazon
Dyson Ball Animal Total Clean Upright Vacuum
Amazon
This Dyson upright vacuum comes with just about every tool you could want. Its corded design offers a prolonged runtime for cleaning larger spaces, while its versatile attachments allow you to vacuum stairs, clean spaces between couch cushions and more — all for $211 off.

Apple AirTag, 4-Pack
Apple AirTags, 4 Pack
Amazon
A four-pack of Apple's beloved Bluetooth trackers is now down to the best price in months. Outside of Prime Day, this is one of the better discounts so far, with the $24 price cut dropping each of the AirTags down to $19 each. That makes it even more affordable to place one inside luggage and another in your backpack, car and other locations.

Dreo Tower Heater 718
Amazon
Our best-tested space heater is going on sale just before temperatures drop for fall. It's down to the second-best price of the year at $13 off. The elegant aesthetic, impressive heating capability and slick design made from high-quality materials impressed our team of professional product testers.

Rare Deal
Anker Nano MagGo Slim Power Bank

One of the very first price cuts on Anker's new MagGo power bank is here. This slim MagSafe accessory pops onto the back of your iPhone to offer portable power in a sleek design that I loved upon trying. Today's offer brings its second discount, which is $1 below the launch price cut from July.

Philips Sonicare 4100 Electric Toothbrush
Amazon
Our pick for best overall electric toothbrush is joining in on the early Prime Big Deal Days savings with a 20% discount in some colors. It's the second-best offer of the year and a rare chance to save on a toothbrush that we've found as reliable as it is affordable.

With emergency prep top of mind this time of year, a portable power station can be a lifesaver, and EcoFlow makes some of our favorites. The compact River 2 is ideal for powering small electronics and, at $150 off, delivers enough capacity to last several days.

Duracell Coppertop AA Batteries, 20-Pack

Why these early Prime Day deals are worth shopping
I’m constantly tracking price cuts across multiple online storefronts to ensure the deals are as good as the retailers say. The rest of t﻿he deals team and I dive into each product’s price history while cross-referencing reviews and guides from other CNN Underscored editors to determine if it’s worth your cash.
FAQs
The following FAQs were answered by senior deals editor Rikka Altland, based on reporting and research she conducted.
What is Prime Big Deal Days?
What we affectionately call October Prime Day here at CNN Underscored is officially deemed Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Days. Don’t let its name fool you: This really is just another multi-day savings event. If you shopped any of our curated deals guides back in March for Amazon’s Big Spring Sale, this is just more of the same from Amazon, albeit scaled down from the likes of the Black Friday festivities to come later on in the year.
How long is Prime Big Deal Days?
Amazon’s 2025 October Prime Day sale will take place over two days on Oct. 7 and 8.
Which retailers participate in October Prime Day?
Amazon may be the one setting the October savings event fanfare in motion, but that doesn’t mean it will be the only retailer to launch a sale. Previous sales like Prime Day, the Big Spring Sale, and last year’s Prime Big Deal Days all went live alongside shopping events from competitors like Best Buy, Target and Walmart. I’m expecting much of the same for the upcoming 2025 sale.
Who has the best October Prime Day deals?
It entirely depends on what you’re shopping for! There’s sure to be plenty of overlap between the retailers, but odds are the online storefronts will all fight to offer the best price cuts. Amazon will set the pace, given that this is its event in the first place, but expect to see other major stores dish out deep discounts of their own. Luckily, you can leave it to us at CNN Underscored to scour the internet and report back so you’re not left checking everything yourself.
The rest of the deals team and I are constantly researching all the season’s best deals. That carries over to events like this upcoming sale, so you can cut right to the chase and save. Each team member, including Underscored’s deals editor Jacqueline Saguin and associate deals editor Elena Matarazzo, is dialed into specific beats to help surface the best of the best deals.
How to get the most out of October Prime Day
First things first: Make sure you have an Amazon Prime membership. You can sign up for a 30-day free trial, after which your membership will cost $15 per month or $139 per year. In addition to fast, free two-day shipping, you’ll have access to Prime Video, ad-free music streaming, unlimited photo storage and unlimited Prime Reading. Many of Prime Day’s best deals, including Lightning Deals, are only available to Prime members.
Once your membership is squared away, take time to confirm your payment methods, including 1-Click settings and default delivery, are up to date so that you can snag your desired deals in a timely fashion.

Our goal here is to save you money, and by considering the entire journey of a product, we can offer better thoughts on whether it’s worth your cash. Altland has been doing just that for nearly a decade, and that kind of experience extends to the rest of our deals team.
