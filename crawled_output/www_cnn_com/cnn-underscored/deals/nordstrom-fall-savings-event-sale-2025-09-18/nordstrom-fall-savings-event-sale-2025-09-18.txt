Nordstrom
We’ve nearly turned the corner into fall, and with it comes one of the most anticipated shopping events of the season: Nordstrom’s Fall Savings Event. Layer up with fall sweaters like cardigans before the temperatures really drop. Through Sept. 24, you can save up to 25% on fall-ready apparel, including sleek Levi’s jackets, cozy Free People sweaters and Hunter outer layers.
The savings don’t stop at apparel. Nordstrom’s Beauty Savings Event is happening at the same time, offering 15% off luxe skin care favorites like La Mer and fragrances from Jo Malone London. Just note: These weeklong fashion deals are as fleeting as fall itself, so take advantage before they disappear.
