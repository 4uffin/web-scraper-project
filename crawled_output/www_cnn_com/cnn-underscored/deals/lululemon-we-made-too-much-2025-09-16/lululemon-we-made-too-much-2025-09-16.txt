Why these Lululemon finds are worth shopping
Why trust CNN Underscored
If you’re scouting Lululemon gear for fall, the We Made Too Much section is the place to shop for every type of workout. This hidden corner of the site is filled with finds for runners, yogis and more, including everything from fan-favorite Align leggings and belt bags to seasonal pieces like fleeces, joggers and zip-ups. Hundreds of Lululemon finds are a lot to sift through, so as someone who covers fashion deals and sales for a living, I rounded up the section’s best workout clothes for women and men ahead.
Lululemon women’s clothing finds
Lululemon Scuba Oversized Full-Zip Hoodie
Lululemon
The Scuba Oversized Full-Zip Hoodie is the kind of off-duty essential that earns a permanent spot in your rotation. With its soft fleece, slouchy silhouette and generously sized hood, it delivers just the right mix of comfort and cool. Reach for the layer whenever you’re heading to the studio or just parking it on the couch.

Lululemon Groove Nulu Fold-Over-Waist Flared Pants
Lululemon
With a nostalgic nod to early-2000s style, the Groove Nulu Fold-Over-Waist Flared Pants bring a modern edge with their soft Nulu fabric and "barely there" feel. The fold-over waistband lets you adjust the rise to suit your mood, while the flared leg adds a flattering finish. Whether you're stretching or lounging, this pair moves with you and looks good doing it.
