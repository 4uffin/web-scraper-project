When it comes to your home office, incorporating a good desk mat into your current setup is a simple way to personalize and improve your workspace.
“Beyond protecting the desk from scratches and stains, the right desk mat provides a comfortable writing or typing surface and helps visually define your workspace,” said Isfira Jensen, the CEO and principal designer at Jensen & Co. Interiors. “It can act like an area rug does in a living space, grouping the elements on its surface [and] creating a defined zone for a task.”
To help you find the best desk mats for your at-home workspace, we spoke with experts who shared their insights into what to look for and their recommendations.

Satechi Vegan Leather Premium Desk Mat
Satechi
For those wanting a vegan leather option, this expert-approved desk mat from Satechi is a great pick. “This is a fantastic option for those looking for a sleek, modern look,” Jensen said. “As an added bonus, the easy-to-clean surface is ideal for everyday use.”

Aothia Faux-Leather Desk Pad
Amazon
CNN Underscored’s home and gifts editor Amina Lake Patel used this faux-leather desk mat for two years and was impressed by how durable it was, especially given the price. “My desk at the time scratched super easily, but this mat did a great job of protecting the surface,” she said.

Orbitkey Desk Mat
Orbitkey
“If you often find yourself juggling papers and cables across your desk, Orbitkey’s desk mat might be the right choice for you,” said Ljubomir Bardžić, a freelance product designer who spends a lot of time on the computer and uses desk mats. “Underneath the top vegan leather layer, there is a felt paper hideaway compartment, and you also get a magnetic cable organizer that you can place along the groove that stretches across the top of the mat.”Chiropractor Mark El-Hayek also recommends this desk mat, which he said is ideal for daily desk and mouse use. “[It] has slightly more padding, which helps support the forearms, reducing direct tension and shoulder fatigue,” he said.

TopJob Grove Dual-Surface Desk Mat
TopJob
“I’ve been impressed with this option from TopJob over the last few months,” CNN Underscored’s editorial director, Chelsea Stone, said. “Details like the stitching around the mat’s border make it feel a bit more elevated, and while I use it vegan-leather-side up, it’s also reversible, with a cork surface option on the reverse side.”

Logitech Desk Mat Studio Series
Amazon

Twelve South DeskPad
Twelve South
“When I'm not covering my desk in some anime-inspired mousepad, I am relying on the gorgeous leather-like finish offered by Twelve South's DeskPad,” Rikka Atland, our senior deals editor, said. "It has a premium vegan leather material that's so convincing, it feels more like my genuine leather Herman Miller chair than it does a synthetic option. I also love the extended [design] that has plenty of room for all my accessories.”

Leatherology Modern Desk Pad
Amazon
If you’re looking for an elevated, minimalist option for your desk, you can’t go wrong with Leatherology’s Modern Desk Pad. It’s lightweight, slim and comes in three different styles, including an extra-long length, which is what I went with for my desk. I wanted a light, neutral color that would tie in well with the rest of my desk decor, so I got this mat in Dove, but it’s available in several other colors too. Though it’s on the pricier side at $140, between the luxe leather top, microsuede-lined bottom and all the gorgeous color options, I think it's well worth the money.

Ysagi Leather Office Mat
Amazon
El-Hayek recommends this desk mat from Amazon because it has a nonslip backing that provides stability when using your keyboard and mouse. He also likes that it has a large surface area so your forearms and wrists can be kept in a neutral position with no shoulder elevation.

Grovemade Leather Desk Pad
Grovemade
“This luxe mat is a great choice for those who are looking for fine craftsmanship,” Jensen said. “Each piece is hand-finished for a unique result every time. Its premium leather provides an exceptional feel underhand and brings plenty of luxury to any workspace.” (She also recommends this similar leather option from West Elm.) I have a non-leather desk mat from Grovemade — the matte desk pad — that I absolutely love for its simplicity and how well it ties my desk together. Mine comes in five different sizes; I have it in large, which covers the entire surface of my Ikea desk.

Trader Brag Stock Trader's Desk Mat
Etsy
Looking for a desk mat with a bit of character? Karen Aronian, an education design and parenting expert at Aronian Education Design LLC, recommends this one. “I love this durable old-school neoprene pad for its smooth, attention-grabbing cheat sheet for stock traders,” she said.

Grovemade Matte Studio Pad
Grovemade
“If you like the organization that the Orbitkey Desk Mat provides but would prefer natural materials, you will probably want to take a look at Grovemade’s Studio Pad,” Bardžić said. It has a full-length wooden tray at the top of the mat that provides a spot for smaller desk items, like pens and paper clips, and cord slots to keep your cables from tangling. This desk mat also features a fingerprint-resistant matte finish.

How to choose the best desk mat
Rikka Altland/CNN Underscored
Consider the size of the mat and your desk
While some desk mats are just large enough to fit under your keyboard and mouse, others are big enough to fit under your computer monitor too. “Decide whether you want the mat to cover the entirety of the desk or just the main work area, this choice will influence the size and style you select,” Jensen said. According to Bardžić, besides material, size should be one of your first considerations since it will also inform aesthetics and price.

Think about material and texture
If you’re looking for a desk mat that can handle day-to-day use, opting for one made from full grain leather or high-quality faux leather is your best bet, thanks to their durability and ease of care, according to Lindsey Zborowski, a design manager at Wayfair. “Felt mats offer a soft look but are prone to staining and wear with heavy use, so they’re better suited for light, decorative setups,” she said.
Because some surfaces are better for certain tasks than others, Jensen said you’ll want to think about its intended use. She recommends selecting a slightly cushioned mat with a smooth surface if you frequently jot down notes or sketch while you’re at your desk and a low-friction material for mouse users.
Since the material will also determine the level of care required, Jensen recommends taking that into consideration too. She said leather offers a timeless look but will need to be conditioned occasionally, while felt is a great way to add warmth to your workspace but is prone to collecting dust and lint. While synthetic options are spill-resistant, Jensen also said they may show signs of wear sooner than other materials.
Take aesthetics into account
Selecting a desk mat that reflects your sense of style is key to creating a workspace that feels true to you, whether you love a pop of color or prefer a more toned-down look. For minimalists, Zborowski said neutral tones like black, charcoal, beige and soft gray will pair well with most decor and work well to complement the space. “Modern matte finishes in muted earth tones, warm browns or even deep green can add subtle personality without feeling cluttered,” she said.
Being true to your aesthetics doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice practicality either. “Balancing visual appeal with practicality comes down to finding a piece that elevates the desk space without compromising on comfort or durability,” Jensen said. “It should be cohesive with the design of the remainder of the office in terms of color, texture and style, but it should also stand up to daily wear and tear.”
Assess how your desk mat will impact keyboard and mouse use
If your desk is where you’ll be doing the majority of your typing, you’ll want to ensure the mat doesn’t force you to lift your shoulders and allows your forearms to rest without having to bend your wrists, El-Hayek said. “For mouse use, it needs to let the arm move freely, so you’re not overusing the smaller wrist muscles to control every movement,” he said. In relation to typing, he said soft mats can cause the keyboard to feel unstable, while thick mats can cause the forearms to be slightly raised. According to El-Hayek, this elevates the shoulders and progressively places tension in the muscles at the base of your neck.

FAQs
The following FAQs have been answered by interior designer Isfira Jensen and include reporting by associate editor Rachel Dennis.
What is the best way to clean a desk mat?
The best way to clean your desk mat depends on the type of material it’s made of. For example, vegan leather options can be wiped clean with a damp cloth or paper towel. Fabric desk mats can also often be wiped with a damp cloth, depending on whether they have a spill-resistant surface or not.
Leather is a bit more complicated. Leatherology recommends spot cleaning its leather Modern Desk Pad with a damp cloth for the exterior and a soft, dry cloth for the suede interior. Jensen recommends conditioning most leather mats occasionally to keep the material supple. That said, it’s best to check individual care instructions, as certain brands (including Leatherology) recommend against conditioning their products. Ultimately, refer to the brand’s care instructions to ensure you clean your desk mat properly.
