Here’s a breakdown of Trump’s historic state visit to Britain and what's next
From CNN staff

US President Donald Trump arrived at Windsor Castle Wednesday for his second state visit — a rarity as second-term US presidents aren’t typically afforded the pomp of two official trips.
Here’s how the day unfolded and what to expect next:
The procession: The day began with King Charles III and Trump setting off on a carriage procession through the Windsor estate, riding together in the Irish State Coach. Queen Camilla and first lady Melania Trump followed behind in the Scottish State Coach. The procession route was lined with members of the armed forces and three military bands that played the US and British national anthems.
A private lunch: The Trumps and the royal couple then attended a private lunch inside Windsor Castle’s State Dining Room.
Exhibition viewing: Afterward, the king and queen accompanied the Trumps to the castle’s Green Drawing Room, where a specially curated exhibition of items relating to the US was displayed.
The Beating Retreat: In the afternoon, some 200 military musicians assembled on the castle’s East Lawn for the Beating Retreat — a ceremony which dates to 17th century England and symbolizes the end of the day. The ceremony concluded with a flypast of the Red Arrows, the Royal Air Force’s aerobatic team, displaying trails of red, white and blue smoke.
State banquet: The day concluded with a snazzy state dinner in Windsor Castle’s largest room: St. George’s Hall. Before dinner was served, the king made a speech, hailing the historic bond between the UK and the US and praising Trump’s efforts to “find solutions” to world conflicts. Trump also made a toast in which he called his second state visit “one of the highest honors of my life.”
Other happenings today: Trump and the first lady made their way to St. George’s Chapel, where they laid a wreath at Queen Elizabeth’s crypt. Also, the Prince and Princess of Wales met with the Trumps.
Protests: Thousands of people made their way down the streets of London today, hoisting colorful signs, flying flags and carrying banners to make their opposition to Trump known.
Looking ahead: Tomorrow Trump will travel to Chequers — UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s country house in Buckinghamshire — for a bilateral meeting. The two leaders will be joined by a host of technology CEOs, who will be on hand for new tech partnership announcements, according to a US official.
CNN’s Tori B. Powell, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Christian Edwards, Maureen Chowdhury, Niamh Kennedy, Kevin Liptak, Elise Hammond, Sinclair Scott, Max Foster, Kara Fox, Kaitlan Collins and Adam Cancryn contributed reporting.

The giant metal centerpiece that loomed over Trump and King Charles

President Donald Trump and King Charles III delivered their toasts beneath an imposing piece of metalwork: a 170-pound candelabrum featuring an arched Saint George slaying his dragon.
The massive centerpiece, cast in silver-gilt and holding 12 lights, is part of the more-than-4,000-piece Grand Service originally commissioned for King George IV.
The center depicts a twisted ivy-entwined oak tree, with the dragon at its base. Saint George holds his spear aloft to kill the beast, as putti — a child-like depiction of an angel — watches from the branches above.
For Wednesday’s banquet, the gleaming candelabrum made for a dramatic detail as each man offered warm words to begin the meal — which was served on silver-gilt pieces from the same collection.

Trump hails second UK visit as "one of the highest honors of my life"

US President Donald Trump delivers his speech as King Charles III and the Princess of Wales listen.

President Donald Trump called his second state visit to the UK “one of the highest honors of my life” during a banquet toast Wednesday night that hailed the close historic relationship between the US and Britain.
Standing next to King Charles III in the Windsor Castle dining hall, Trump praised the royal family and thanked them for the invitation to the U.K., joking at one point that he hopes he’s the last president for some time to be granted two state visits.
“It’s a singular privilege,” Trump said. “This is truly one of the highest honors of my life, such respect for you and such respect for your country.”
Trump marveled at the castle’s architecture and complimented Prince William as a “remarkable son.” And he alluded to the recovery of Catherine, Princess of Wales, from cancer treatment, calling her “so radiant and so healthy.”
In his brief speech, the president also emphasized the bond between the US and UK, saying the “special relationship” between the countries “does not begin to do it justice.”
And while he largely steered clear of partisan politics, Trump did return to one of his favorite boasts, calling the US “the hottest country.”
“We had a very sick country one year ago,” he said. “Today, I believe we’re the hottest country anywhere in the world.”

Delicate hand-embroidered roses with couched gold cording, accented with French knots and satin-stitched blooms, are featured on the coat.
Kate finished her look with a little sparkle, wearing the Lover’s Knot Tiara and earrings that belonged to the late Queen Elizabeth II.

Charles praises Trump’s efforts to "find solutions" to world conflicts
From CNN's Christian Edwards
As head of the British state, King Charles III must remain apolitical. With his speech moving onto thornier issues, Charles is treading carefully.
“As tyranny once again threatens Europe, we and our allies stand together in support of Ukraine to deter aggression and secure peace,” Charles said, without mentioning Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Charles also praised US President Donald Trump’s “personal commitment to finding solutions to some of the world’s most intractable conflicts in order to secure peace.”

First lady Melania Trump makes bright choice with state banquet gown

Aaron Chown/Pool/Reuters
First lady Melania Trump’s sartorial choices have run the gamut on Wednesday – from a hat meant to deflect attention to a luminous bright yellow gown that put the focus squarely on her.
When she arrived at Windsor Castle Wednesday, the first lady wore a charcoal Dior suit with skirt and a wide-brimmed, eggplant hat. The hat blocked visibility of much of Trump’s face, reminiscent of her Inauguration Day look that was all business.
But the tone decidedly shifted in the evening, as she took center stage in a custom off-the shoulder, long sleeve belted Carolina Herrera gown.
A spokesperson for the first lady did not respond to CNN’s request for comment, but a White House official had previously told CNN that Trump spent months planning her outfits for the state visit, particularly this evening’s state banquet.
Particularly at events where the principals will be seen and not heard, the message they send through their wardrobe choices is a significant one, and those details are often communicated in advance through diplomatic channels.
“We were pretty forthright, calling and saying, ‘Is she wearing blue today? And what shade of blue is it?’ And then we would wear navy if she was wearing sky blue. We definitely don’t want to clash – we want to complement,” a source familiar with state visit planning said.

King Charles hails historic bonds between UK and US
From CNN's Christian Edwards
All the guests have taken their seats, and King Charles III is giving a speech before dinner is served.
“As we approach the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence next year, it is remarkable to think just how far we have come. I cannot help but wonder what our forebears of 1776 would make of this friendship today,” Charles said.
The king said that George Washington, who famously vowed never to set foot on British soil, and King George III – Charles’ five-times-great-grandfather – would have struggled to imagine the bond between their two nations today.

Guests are gathering for the centerpiece of the state visit: The opulent state banquet hosted by King Charles and Queen Camilla.
The meal is held in Windsor Castle’s largest room – St George’s Hall, which features a spectacular ceiling studded with the coats of arms of every Knight of the Garter since the order was founded in 1348.
The British sovereign, who oversees every single element involved in staging the event, visited the hall on Wednesday afternoon for final checks.
Tonight’s room has been decorated with handpicked seasonal flowers and herbs from the gardens at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and the Savill Garden in nearby Windsor Great Park.
The seasonal flowers have been arranged in silver-gilt centerpieces taken from the Grand Service, a dinner service comprised of 4,000 items originally made for George IV and first used at a banquet in 1811, according to the Royal Collection Trust.
Tonight’s music will feature fanfares by the State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry and performances by the Duchess of Edinburgh’s String Orchestra, which was formed in 2014.
Captain Alexandra Nixon, the orchestra’s director of music, has selected several songs that make regular appearances on Trump event playlists, including “Nessun Dorma,” “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” and “Tiny Dancer.”
The banquet traditionally opens with the King and his honored guest delivering speeches.

The CEOs of some of the US’ biggest tech companies are dining at Windsor Castle, a day after the UK and US agreed a $42 billion tech pact to mark President Donald Trump’s state visit.
Sam Altman of Open AI and Jensen Huang of NVIDIA are among those attending Wednesday’s state banquet, along with King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
The UK and US on Tuesday unveiled the “Tech Prosperity Deal” to boost ties in AI, quantum computing and nuclear energy.
“This comes as America’s top technology and AI firms – like Microsoft, NVIDIA, Google, OpenAI and CoreWave – commit a combined £31 billion ($42 billion) to boost the UK’s AI infrastructure,” the British government said in a statement.

There's also a special cocktail on the menu tonight
From CNN’s Lauren Said-Moorhouse
One fun tradition at state banquets is that often a bespoke cocktail is created for each event. For tonight’s soiree, the royal household has done their take of a classic whiskey sour, calling it a “Transatlantic Whiskey Sour.”
Adding a UK-US twist to the drink, their version features Johnnie Walker Black with the bright citrus of marmalade. It is crowed with a pecan foam and garnished with a toasted marshmallow resting on a star-shaped biscuit, which the palace says is to evoke “the warmth of a fireside S’more.”

Donald Trump will likely turn down the gesture at the extravagant feast because he does not drink. Trump said in 2018 that he’s “not a drinker” and that he has “never had a glass of alcohol.”
“Can you imagine if I had? What a mess I would be. I would be the world’s worst. I never drank, OK?” he said in response to a question from CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.
Trump has also previously opened up about his older brother, Fred Trump Jr.’s struggles with alcoholism.

The US President and his wife, Melania, are wrapping up their first day in the UK with a glittering state banquet thrown by his host King Charles and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle.
Around 150 guests are attending a magnificent state banquet within St. George’s Hall at Windsor Castle. For those wondering what’s on the menu tonight, we’ve got you covered:
Written in French, which is customary for state dinners, the menu includes:
Panna Cotta de Cresson et Oeufs de Caille sur Sablé de Parmesan (Hampshire Watercress Panna Cotta with Parmesan Shortbread and Quail Egg Salad)
Ballotine de Poulet Fermier en Robe de Courgettes (Organic Norfolk Chicken Ballotine wrapped in Courgettes, with a Thyme and Savoury Infused Jus)
Bombe Glacée Cardinal (Vanilla Ice Cream Bombe with Kentish Raspberry Sorbet interior with lightly poached Victoria Plums)
Meanwhile, on the wine list: Wiston Estate, Cuvée, 2016; Domaine Bonneau de Martray, Corton-Charlemagne, Grand Cru, 2018; Ridge Vineyards, Monte Bello, 2000; Pol Roger, Extra Cuvée de Réserve, 1998.
Post-dinner digestif: Following the meal, guests will be served Warre’s 1945 Vintage Port – a nod to Trump first term as the 45th president. Also available, a Hennessy 1912 Cognac Grande Champagne has been selected in recognition of the president’s mother’s birth year and a Bowmore Queen’s Cask 1980, a gift to the late Queen Elizabeth II in 1980, and bottled for her Golden Jubilee in 2002.

Rupert Murdoch attends Windsor Castle dinner with Trump amid legal battle

When President Donald Trump enters St. George’s Hall for the grand finale of his state visit at Windsor Castle Wednesday night, someone he is suing will be seated at the end of the dinner table: Rupert Murdoch.
Murdoch, a familiar face at state dinners in the past, is currently locked in a major legal battle with Trump, who is suing the powerful owner of the Wall Street Journal after it reported on a suggestive birthday letter given to Jeffrey Epstein bearing Trump’s name. Trump has denied that it’s his signature and said at the time of the report that he personally warned Murdoch he’d sue if the newspaper published it.
The Journal did so anyway, and Trump subsequently filed a lawsuit seeking $20 billion in damages and Murdoch’s testimony.
Despite that, according to a preview of the dinner given to reporters, Murdoch and his fifth wife Elena will be present at Windsor Castle Wednesday night. They are part of an intimate guest list that includes only about 160 guests, according to royal officials, and was compiled by the Royal Family and the White House.
It is the Royal Family that designates the seating arrangement. Trump will be seated in between King Charles III and Catherine, Princess of Wales, while first lady Melania Trump will be across the table next to Queen Camilla and William, Prince of Wales.

Q&A: How protesters are hoping to leverage social media during Trump's visit
From CNN's Elise Hammond
President Donald Trump was welcomed to Windsor Castle earlier today with a carriage procession — one that notably did not include public onlookers.
That is an intentional move by British government officials, who have been working to keep the thousands of people protesting in London out of Trump’s view.
CNN field producer Vasco Cotovio, who is on the ground in the middle of the protests in the capital, provided some more insight:
Q: Why is it significant that UK officials are keeping the public away from Trump today? How are the protesters reacting to that?
A: It’s obviously very significant because Trump is not going to be personally impacted by the disruption. It also indicates that this was a well-planned visit. Officials in the UK are conscious that Donald Trump might not be the most popular of American presidents, especially in a city like London, and so you could argue that the decision to prevent him from coming into the city was part of a plan.
At the same time, when you’ve asked protesters, they say that they understand why Trump was kept from coming into the capital. But in this day and age, that doesn’t necessarily matter.
They know the US president is an avid follower of everything that goes on television and social media, so they’re hoping that through both traditional and new forms of communication, Trump is going to hear about this demonstration and see the messages people here have for him.

Meanwhile, back in DC, Cassidy says he'll reserve judgment on RFK Jr. until the secretary testifies before his panel
From CNN's Arlette Saenz and Morgan Rimmer
GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy refused to say if he still has confidence in Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after ousted CDC Director Susan Monarez appeared before the committee he chairs, telling reporters he wants to reserve judgment until the secretary has testified before the panel.
Cassidy also told reporters that parents should not have confidence in the vaccine advisory panel if they change their recommendations.
“I think he needs the opportunity to speak to this, and I plan to hold any judgment until we have the opportunity to hear Secretary Kennedy,” Cassidy told reporters. “I will compliment him; he has echoed President Trump’s call for radical transparency and so I’m confident that he’ll come and confident that he’ll share his perspective.”
Cassidy wouldn’t say if he’d vote to confirm Kennedy again if the vote was held today. “I am steadfastly not judging until we have a chance to hear the secretary’s perspective,” he replied.
He added that Monarez and former CDC Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry’s testimony can “speak for itself.”
What Sen Paul said: Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul — who has previously said he was glad that Monarez was out of the CDC — sparred with her during the hearing about the childhood vaccine schedule.

Q&A: What it’s like at the anti-Trump protests in London
From CNN's Elise Hammond
Demonstrators hold placards protesting the state visit of US President Donald Trump in London on September 17.
Hannah McKay/Reuters
Thousands of people are making their way down the streets of London, hoisting colorful signs, flying flags and carrying banners to make their opposition to US President Donald Trump known.
“Immigrants welcome. Trump not welcome,” one sign says. “No to racism. No to Trump,” another reads.
CNN field producer Vasco Cotovio is on the ground and describes what it’s like:
Some of the answers have been edited for length and clarity.
Q: You are in the middle of the protests against Trump’s state visit today. How many people are there and what is the mood like? What are some of the protesters telling you?
A: I would say at least a few thousand people. This is a march that makes its way through central London and finish at Parliament Square, in front of the British Parliament. Usually with these demonstrations, a lot of people just head straight to the end point, so we’ll get a better sense of how many are there once we get to that final location.
In terms of the mood, protesters look quite cheerful, they are fired up, they believe it’s important for them to be here. Obviously, this is an anti-Trump rally, they’re protesting the US president’s visit, but they’re here for a lot of reasons. You see flags calling for the end of the war in Gaza and Palestinian flags. We also see allusions to Trump’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and mentions of Trump’s allies like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Elon Musk and Nigel Farage.
There’s also criticism of some of Trump’s rhetoric, with protesters accusing him of being racist — and promoting racism — and fascist as well.
Q: Are there any counterprotests or visible support for Trump?
A: We have seen a handful of pro-Trump protesters. Obviously at a day like this, police would have tried to keep a significant counterprotest at bay.
Q: What is expected to happen the rest of the day and into tomorrow when Trump has his meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer?
A: The rally at Parliament Square will continue for a few more hours. Tomorrow, Trump heads to Chequers for a meeting with Starmer at his official countryside residence. That location is even further from London than Windsor is, so we are not expecting further protests in the capital. However, there have been other gatherings across the country, and those may continue.
