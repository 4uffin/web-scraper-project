Trump speaks on continuing Kirk's vision after leaving memorial service
From CNN's Piper Hudspeth Blackburn and Audry Jeong
President Donald Trump spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One as he traveled back to Washington, DC, from Arizona following Charlie Kirk’s memorial service.
Trump touched on continuing Kirk’s vision, his relationship with Elon Musk and more. Here’s what he said:
Continuing Kirk’s vision: Asked what he would do to ensure that Kirk’s vision would be carried forward over the next few years, Trump said, “It’ll be automatic,” adding that he thinks “Turning Point is going to be a very big factor,” referring to the organization Kirk co-founded.
Relationship with Musk: Trump and Elon Musk, the former “first buddy” who had a public falling-out with the president in recent months, were spotted talking together at the memorial. Asked whether Kirk brought Musk and him back together, Trump said, “Well Elon came over and said hello,” adding they “had a very good relationship.”
Investigation into Kirk’s killing: “For an investigation that’s ongoing, I think they’ve done an incredible job,” Trump said of the probe into Kirk’s assassination.
Praise for Erika Kirk: Trump praised Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, whom he embraced during the memorial. “Charlie always used to say she’s very smart; you don’t necessarily say that about a lot of people,” he told reporters. “She’s got a shot of making it even more special if you think about it, she’s going to do good,” he said of her taking over as CEO of Turning Point after her husband’s death. In reference to the emotional speech she made earlier today, Trump called it a “hard thing to do.”

Trump remembers Kirk — with some detours. Here's a recap of his speech
From CNN’s Kevin Liptak, Zoe Sottile and Maureen Chowdhury

President Donald Trump was welcomed to cheers today as he paid tribute to longtime supporter Charlie Kirk, the slain conservative activist who Trump said he counted as a personal friend.
In remarks for a packed house at Kirk’s memorial service in Arizona, the president characterized the assassination as an assault on all conservatives’ ideals.
“The gun was pointed at him, but the bullet was aimed at all of us. That bullet was aimed at every one of us,” Trump said.
Kirk had enjoyed a direct line to the president, who credited the late organizer for mobilizing the youth vote for him and helping propel him to victory in the 2024 election.
Here are some more key lines from the president’s speech:
Slamming suspected shooter: Trump was among the only speakers to make any direct reference to Kirk’s suspected killer, who he called a “radicalized, cold-blooded monster.”
Breaking with Kirk on rivalries: “He was a missionary with a noble spirit and a great, great purpose. He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them,” Trump said, before diverting from his script. “That’s where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent,” he said. “And I don’t want the best for them.”
Kirk’s will to “fight”: Trump received hearty applause after celebrating
Kirk’s “will to ‘fight, fight, fight,’” an allusion to the moments immediately after the president survived his own assassination attempt.
Detours: Trump’s speech took a detour into previewing an announcement on Monday about a purported autism breakthrough. Trump also linked Kirk to his crime crackdown and spoke on plans for Chicago, saying, “We’re going to have Charlie very much in mind when we go into Chicago, and we’ll get that one straight.” Kirk grew up in the suburbs of Chicago. The president also took shots at his predecessor and talked about crowd size.

Key lines from Erika Kirk’s emotional remarks remembering late husband

In an emotional speech, Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, paid tribute to the life of her late husband while also pledging to keep his movement alive.
These are key moments from her remarks:
Forgiving shooter: Kirk said she forgives the man who allegedly shot and killed her husband, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd. “I forgive him,” she said, quoting Jesus on the cross by saying: “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.”
Grief and heartbreak: Kirk described the shock and anguish she felt seeing her husband in the hospital after he was assassinated, but also said she felt an overwhelming sense of comfort knowing he did not suffer.
The American family: Kirk said her husband “died with incomplete work, but not with unfinished business,” declaring his greatest cause was his efforts to revive the American family under conservative Christian values.
Carrying on with the mission: Kirk said she was honored to be named the new CEO of the organization her husband founded, Turning Point USA, vowing that thousands of new chapters would be created and that the campus events that Kirk had mounted would continue.
Advice from second lady: Kirk said the day after her husband was shot, she was aboard Air Force Two and, while holding Usha Vance’s hand, she told the second lady, “Honestly, I do not know how I am going to get through this.” Kirk said with a smile that Vance told her the moment is like the last 15 minutes of a plane ride with your kids — words she needed to hear.

President Donald Trump received hearty applause after celebrating Charlie Kirk’s “will to fight, fight, fight” at the conservative organizer’s memorial service Sunday.
“The lesson of Charlie’s life is that you should never underestimate what one person can do with a good heart, a righteous cause, a cheerful spirit and the will to fight, fight, fight,” Trump said, echoing the words he shouted after surviving an assassination attempt in 2024.
“We’re saving our country,” he went on. “And Charlie’s a big factor.”

Trump's speech strikes stark contrast with rest of the program at Kirk's memorial
From CNN's Kevin Liptak in Glendale, Arizona
President Donald Trump’s speech couldn’t be more different than the powerful address that preceded him from Erika Kirk — or most of the other speakers at today’s event.
While Mrs. Kirk, evoking Christian teaching, said she forgave her husband’s killer, Trump adopted an altogether different tone.
“God willing, he will receive the full and ultimate punishment for his horrific crime,” Trump said, noting the suspect in Kirk’s killing has been charged with capital murder.
After a day when most speakers sought to convey messages of resolve and religious faith, Trump diverted at several moments into some of his more political themes, including criticism of his predecessor and boasting about crowd sizes.
He used the moment to touch on some divisive cultural touchpoints.
“Some of the very people who call you a ‘hater’ for using the wrong pronoun were filled with glee at the killing of a father with two beautiful young children,” he decried.
He read at points from a teleprompter, but it was evident when he was choosing to ad-lib. After each tangent, he sought to tie it back to Charlie Kirk.
While the crowd was enthusiastic to hear the president of the US speak, they were notably less engaged during his speech than they were during Mrs. Kirk’s. Some were on their phones, and others left early as the service was nearing its conclusion.

Musk shares image of himself and Trump at the memorial, captioned "For Charlie"
From CNN's Danya Gainor
Elon Musk shared an image of himself and President Donald Trump speaking at Charlie Kirk’s memorial on social media, captioned, “For Charlie.” The meeting appears to mark the first time Trump and Musk have been seen together publicly in months after their falling out.
The one-time government employee was honored earlier this year by the president at the conclusion of his service with the Department of Government Efficiency, which was followed by a closely-watched public spat on social media.
Kirk was somewhat of a mediator between Musk and Trump after their falling out. He remained in touch with Musk, often texting him, including to tell him that his negative rhetoric about the president’s major policy bill would harm Trump’s overall agenda, a source previously told CNN. Musk was receptive to Kirk and his feedback, the source said.
CNN’s Betsy Klein and Kristen Holmes contributed to this report.

Trump says Kirk will be "very much in mind" for Chicago crime crackdown
From CNN's Zoe Sottile
Speaking at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service Sunday, President Donald Trump raised again the idea of cracking down on crime in Chicago.
“I’m so proud of Washington, DC, and now we’re going into Memphis, and we’ll get that one straightened out fast,” the president said. “And then we’re going into some others, but we’re going to go do Chicago, and we’re going to have Charlie very much in mind when we go into Chicago, and we’ll get that one straight.”
Kirk grew up in the suburbs of Chicago.
Some context: In August, the president announced a federal takeover of the Washington, DC, police department, part of what he framed as an effort to combat crime in the nation’s capital. Trump said he’d put a similar focus on the Windy City, regardless of the staunch opposition by Democrats, including the city’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.

Trump says bullet was "aimed at all of us"
From CNN's Kevin Liptak in Glendale, Arizona
President Donald Trump said Charlie Kirk’s assassination was an assault on all conservatives’ ideals.
“The gun was pointed at him, but the bullet was aimed at all of us. That bullet was aimed at every one of us,” Trump said.
“Charlie was killed for expressing the very ideas that virtually everyone in this arena and most other places throughout our country, deeply believed in,” Trump said.
Trump has sought to harness anger after Kirk’s assassination into a clamp-down on left-wing groups he accuses of fomenting violence against conservatives.
He said today the assassin hadn’t silenced Kirk’s movement.
“The assassin failed in his quest because Charlie’s message has not been silenced. It now is bigger and better and stronger than ever before,” he said.

Trump, breaking with Kirk, says: "I hate my opponent"

President Donald Trump broke with Charlie Kirk in one regard during his speech, saying he found it difficult to empathize with his rivals.
“He was a missionary with a noble spirit and a great, great purpose. He did not hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them,” Trump said, before diverting from his script.
“That’s where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponent,” he said. “And I don’t want the best for them.”
Offering a shrugging apology to Erika Kirk, Trump said it just wasn’t in his DNA.
“Erika, you can talk to me and the whole group, but maybe they can convince me that that’s not right, but I can’t stand my opponent,” he said.

Trump detours into preview of Monday autism announcement
From CNN's Kevin Liptak in Glendale, Arizona
President Donald Trump’s speech took a detour into previewing an announcement he plans to make from the Oval Office on Monday about autism.
“I think you’re going to find it to be amazing,” he told the crowd. “I think we found an answer to autism.”
The stadium, which has spent the last several hours listening to remembrances of Charlie Kirk, responded politely with applause.
Trump, without revealing what he planned to say about autism, said his administration “won’t let it happen anymore.”
“I think it’s going to be one of the most important news conferences I’ll ever have, and I look so forward to it,” he said, adding he believed Kirk would have also looked forward to the event.

President Donald Trump is among the only speakers to make any direct reference to Charlie Kirk’s suspected killer, who he called a “radicalized, cold-blooded monster” in the opening moments of his speech.
He was speaking a few minutes after Erika Kirk declared from the podium that she forgave the alleged assassin.
Trump said Kirk was killed “for speaking the truth that was in his heart.”
“He was violently killed because he spoke for freedom and justice, for God, country, for reason, and for common sense,” Trump said.
Some background: Here’s what we know about the suspect in Kirk’s killing, who has been accused of aggravated murder and six other charges.

NOW: President Trump speaks at Charlie Kirk’s memorial service
From CNN staff
President Donald Trump is taking the stage at the massive public memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Kirk had a personal relationship with Trump and a direct line to the president to discuss key policy issues. Trump credited the late organizer for mobilizing the youth vote for him and helping propel him to victory in the 2024 election.
The president considered Kirk a part of his extended family, a source told CNN, and his death was met with horror, shock and grief in Trump’s inner circle.
The administration has also targeted left-wing groups and threatened to crack down on critical media in the wake of the activist’s killing.
CNN’s Jeff Zeleny, Kristen Holmes, Fredreka Schouten and Betsy Klein contributed reporting to this post.

From CNN's Piper Hudspeth Blackburn

Erika Kirk said she was honored to be named the new CEO of the organization her husband Charlie Kirk founded, Turning Point USA, vowing that thousands of new chapters would be created and that the campus events that Kirk had mounted would continue.
“The world needs Turning Point USA,” Erika Kirk said.
“It needs a group that will point young people away from the path of misery and sin. It needs something that will lead people away from hell in this world and in the next. It needs young people pointed in the direction of truth and beauty, and so I promise you today every part of our work will become greater.”
“Charlie and I were united in purpose. His passion was my passion, and now his mission is my mission,” Kirk added. “Everything that Turning Point USA built through Charlie’s vision and hard work, we will make 10 times greater through the power of his memory.”

Erika Kirk appeared overcome when she said she forgives the man who allegedly shot and killed her husband, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd.
“I forgive him,” she says, in what has been the most powerful moment of the service so far.
Kirk quoted Jesus on the cross, saying: “Father, forgive them, for they not know what they do.”
It was a statement that resonated across the stadium, bringing the crowd of tens of thousands to its feet.
“I forgive him because it is what Christ did,” she said, without naming the suspect, Tyler Robinson. “The answer to hate is not hate.”
She said her husband’s mission had been to save young men from unfulfilling lives “consumed with resentment, anger and hate.”
“He wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life,” she said, her voice breaking.
