Trump declares “justice in America” after former FBI director's indictment
From CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo
President Donald Trump is celebrating after former FBI Director James Comey — a longtime Trump antagonist — was indicted by a federal grand jury.
“JUSTICE IN AMERICA! One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post a short time ago.
“Today he was indicted by a Grand Jury on two felony counts for various illegal and unlawful acts. He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation,” the president added.
Earlier today, Trump said he thought he’d “be allowed to get involved if I want” in whether his Justice Department should pursue an indictment against the former FBI director, but said he was leaving that determination to DOJ officials.
Some context: Comey’s indictment marks an extraordinary escalation in Trump’s effort to prosecute his political enemies.
He has been charged with giving false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding, according to the Justice Department, in connection with testimony he gave relating to the 2016 investigation into Russian interference in the US presidential election.

Former Trump White House lawyer says the Comey indictment is "what every law student is told is not possible"
From CNN's Aditi Sangal
As President Donald Trump’s prosecution against his political enemies unfolds, the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey is “what every law student is told is not possible,” Ty Cobb, former Trump White House lawyer, told CNN.
“This is unprecedented. It’s what every law student is told is not possible, and what distinguishes us from dictatorships around the world; that, you know, the the executive branch does not dictate … to prosecutors who will and will not be charged,” Cobbs said.
It may be a wake-up call for Americans, Cobb added.
“I think this is a very, very possible tipping point for Americans to finally acknowledge — the people who have been in constant denial about the damage that Trump is doing and the freedoms that are being eroded — I think this is an opportunity for those people to wake up and take it seriously,” Cobb said.

What it was like inside the courthouse as James Comey was indicted
From CNN's Aileen Graef
Magistrate Judge Lindsey Vaala received the indictment returned by the grand jury in a proceeding in the 6 p.m. hour at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia.
During that brief hearing, the judge announced the new case against former FBI Director James Comey and said publicly that 14 jurors agreed to indict him on counts of false statements in the jurisdiction of a congressional proceeding and obstruction of a congressional proceeding.
The judge said there was a third count presented to the grand jury, which it did not approve for the indictment.
Acting US Attorney Lindsey Halligan spoke with the judge during the court appearance. At least one other prosecutor, Maggie Cleary, the first assistant in the Eastern District of Virginia prosecutors’ office, was also in the courtroom.
Halligan’s team refused to answer reporters’ questions as they left the courtroom.
A male family member of Comey was also at the courthouse, and at one point spoke to the judge privately in chambers for about 30 minutes before the indictment was handed up to the judge.

"No one is above the law": Trump administration officials react to James Comey indictment
From CNN's Tori B. Powell

Trump administration officials are reacting to the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, emphasizing the importance of accountability.
“No one is above the law,” Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote in a post on X. “Today’s indictment reflects this Department of Justice’s commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people. We will follow the facts in this case.”
FBI Director Kash Patel repeated Bondi’s sentiment in his own post.
“Today, your FBI took another step in its promise of full accountability,” Patel wrote on X. “For far too long, previous corrupt leadership and their enablers weaponized federal law enforcement, damaging once proud institutions and severely eroding public trust. Every day, we continue the fight to earn that trust back, and under my leadership, this FBI will confront the problem head-on.”

Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted by a federal grand jury, an extraordinary escalation in President Donald Trump’s effort to prosecute his political enemies.
Comey, a longtime adversary of the president, is now the first senior government official to face federal charges in one of Trump’s largest grievances: the 2016 investigation into whether his first presidential campaign colluded with Russia.
Comey has been charged with giving false statements and obstruction of a congressional proceeding, the Justice Department said in a statement.
The news release confirmed the two charges, which both relate to his September 30, 2020, testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
This post has been updated with additional details about the charges.

Catch up on Trump's comments from the Oval Office today

President Donald Trump makes comments in the Oval Office at the White House, on Thursday, in Washington, DC.
Alex Brandon/AP
President Donald Trump signed several executive actions in the Oval Office today and took questions from reporters on a wide range of topics.
Here’s a debrief:
TikTok: The president signed an executive order to advance the sale of TikTok’s US assets to a consortium of mostly American investors, though hurdles remain for the final deal.
Middle East talks: After speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, Trump said he would not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. The president also suggested a Gaza ceasefire deal may be close after discussions with other Middle East leaders.
Government shutdown: There “could be” a government shutdown next week, Trump acknowledged. He called Democrats in Congress “crazed,” because they won’t back a two-month funding extension over concerns on health care subsidy cuts.
Military officers meeting: The president downplayed the Defense Department’s sudden summoning of hundreds of US generals and admirals to Virginia next week, asking, “Why is that such a big deal?” Trump said he didn’t know what the meeting was about.
Meeting with Turkish president: Trump said he believes Turkey may stop buying oil from Russia, a few hours after pressuring Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to make the move during a sitdown in the Oval Office. He was also noncommittal on if he would make a deal on the American-made F-35 fighter jets that Turkey is currently banned from buying.
Death penalty: Trump signed a presidential memorandum seeking to reinstate the death penalty in Washington, DC. Attorney General Pam Bondi added that the Justice Department will be seeking capital punishment across the country.
Comey indictment: Both Trump and Bondi declined to weigh in on if there will be an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey. “We can’t comment on that,” Bondi said.
Political violence: Another presidential memorandum signed by Trump aims to intensify efforts across the government to identify organizations backing violence perpetrated by what officials called “radical, politically motivated groups.”
Another foreign visit: Today’s busy schedule also features a White House visit by Pakistan’s prime minister, who Trump said he would meet with immediately after the signings.

Trump calls Soros a “likely candidate” for investigation
From CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo
President Donald Trump said Thursday that billionaire Democratic donor George Soros is a “likely candidate” for investigation, while Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters “everything is on the table.”
In the Oval Office on Thursday, they were asked about New York Times reporting about a push at the Justice Department to investigate Soros’ foundation and whether that was part of the memorandum Trump signed ordering probes of groups he claims aid political violence.
“I’m not going to comment on whether there is or is not a pending investigation, but everything’s on the table right now,” Bondi said.
“I don’t think anybody has to ask,” Trump said. “If you look at Soros, he’s at the top of everything,” he added. “He’s in every story that I read, so I guess he’d be a likely candidate.”

Both President Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi declined to say Thursday if there will be an indictment against former FBI Director James Comey.
“I don’t know — I know it’s going on because I read the papers just like you do, I don’t know,” Trump, pressed on if his administration was preparing to indict Comey, told reporters in the Oval Office Thursday, before turning to Bondi.
“We can’t comment on that,” Bondi added.
Earlier Thursday, the president signaled that Bondi, Lindsey Halligan, his former personal attorney and the newly appointed top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche were mulling the decision.
“You have very professional people headed up by the attorney general, Todd Blanche and Lindsey Halligan, who’s very smart, good lawyer, very good lawyer, they’re gonna make a determination. I’m not making that deter — I, I think I’d be allowed to get involved if I want, but I don’t really choose to do so,” he said.

Trump signs memorandum ordering probes of groups aiding "political violence"
From CNN's Adam Cancryn
President Donald Trump on Thursday sought to ramp up investigations of groups his administration suspects of supporting political violence, signing a presidential memorandum that critics worry will be used to target his political enemies.
The directive aims to intensify efforts across the government to identify organizations backing violence perpetrated by what officials called “radical, politically motivated groups” in the wake of the killing earlier this month of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
“We’re going to get out there and we’re going to do a pretty big number on those people,” Trump said from the Oval Office, claiming there are “wealthy people” funding political violence.
The memorandum comes as Trump has blamed the “radical left” for Kirk’s killing and other recent violent incidents, including a fatal shooting on Wednesday at an ICE facility in Dallas. The White House previously designated Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, despite the fact that it lacks a centralized organizational structure or defined leadership.
Asked what other groups the administration might target under Thursday’s order, Trump and other officials would not identify any specific organizations.
“Any organized group who is committing these crimes,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said of their targets.
But Trump did later single out prominent liberal donors George Soros and Reid Hoffman as people he’s “hearing” about, remarks that are likely to intensify fears the memorandum will be used to investigate Trump’s political opponents.
“There is an entire system of feeder organizations that provide money, resources, weapons,” senior Trump official Stephen Miller said. “It is all carefully planned, executed and thought through. It is terrorism on our soil.”

Trump signs memo seeking death penalty in DC
From CNN's Alayna Treene
President Donald Trump signs a presidential memorandum on the death penalty in the District of Columbia in the Oval Office at the White House, on Thursday, in Washington, DC.
Alex Brandon/AP
President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a presidential memorandum seeking to reinstate the death penalty in Washington, DC, as Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the Justice Department will be seeking capital punishment across the country.
“The death penalty in Washington,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “You kill somebody, or if you kill a police officer, law enforcement officer — death penalty. And hopefully they won’t do that.”
The memo specifically directs Bondi and US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro “to fully implement the death penalty here in Washington, DC, where the evidence and facts of the case indicate that the death penalty should be used,” White House staff secretary Will Scharf said.
Bondi, who stood beside Trump in the Oval Office, announced: “Not only are we seeking it in Washington, DC, but all over the country, again.”
The attorney general added that the Justice Department is also in the process of placing inmates who had been moved off death row by former President Joe Biden into maximum security facilities.
“We’re moving them to Supermax facilities where they will be treated like they’re on death row for the rest of their lives,” Bondi said.
The presidential memo, and Bondi’s comments, come after Trump said last month that he would seek the death penalty in the nation’s capital, characterizing capital punishment as a “very strong preventative” measure. States, he said at the time, “are going to have to make their own decision.”
The move could could run into significant obstacles with city juries, CNN previously reported.

Trump says there "could be" a government shutdown next week, blaming Democrats
From CNN's Donald Judd
President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office at the White House,
on Thursday.
Alex Brandon/AP
President Donald Trump acknowledged Thursday that there “could be” a government shutdown next week, calling Democrats in Congress “crazed,” because they won’t back a two-month funding extension over concerns on health care subsidy cuts.
The president brushed off the fact that Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, instead laying the blame for a looming government shutdown at the feet of Democrats.
“When you say control – so we need 60 votes for this, and we have 53 Republicans, so we need seven Democrats,” Trump said.
Democrats have said they will not vote to fund the government unless expensive health care changes are included, such as extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.
But on Thursday, Trump said Democrats instead “want to have the border open so that criminals can pour in,” claiming that, rather than extend ACA subsidies, he believes Democrats are actually seeking free health care for undocumented immigrants.
“What they’re really asking for is they want to pay for illegal aliens that have come into our country by the millions and get onto the rolls, and they want to pay – and our people don’t want to do that,” Trump said.

From CNN's Aditi Sangal
President Donald Trump said he will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank.
“I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. Nope, I will not it. It’s not going to happen,” he said today in the Oval Office.
He acknowledged he had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
today on the topic.
“Yeah, but I’m not going to allow it. Whether I spoke to him or not —I did it — but I’m not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. It’s been enough. It’s time to stop now,” he added.

Trump says if Mamdani wins, it will be “the greatest thing” for Republicans
From CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo
President Donald Trump said today that it would only benefit the GOP if Zohran Mamdani wins the New York City mayoral race.
“Can I be honest? I think it’s the greatest thing to ever happen to the Republican Party. I really do,” Trump said, after taking a jab at the democratic socialist and dubbing him “a communist.”
“I think if a communist takes over New York City, I think that’s a gift to the Republican Party. It’s sad for New York, but it’s a gift, and New York will recover,” Trump said.
The president said sometimes you need “a shot like that to straighten out,” and reiterated that politically, if Mamdani was to win, it “is probably a very good thing.”

Trump says he believes Turkey may stop buying Russian oil
From CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo
President Donald Trump said from the Oval office Thursday he believes Turkey may stop buying oil from Russia, at his request, after a bilateral meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at the White House a couple of hours earlier.
“I don’t want to say, but if I wanted to, yes,” Trump said. “”I believe he will stop it.”
Asked if he would make a deal on the American-made F-35 fighter jets that Turkey is currently banned from buying, Trump was quick to respond: “I will be able to easily if I want.”
“We may do that, yes. It depends. If he does something for us,” he added.
Trump earlier said he hoped Turkey will stop buying oil from Russia during his meeting with Erdogan.
“I’d like to have him stop buying any oil from Russia while Russia continues its rampage against Ukraine, and they’ve been fighting,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “They’ve lost millions of lives already, and for what, you know, for what? Disgraceful.”
Trump went on to praise the Turkish president and the military power he has built.

Trump downplays Hegseth's sudden move to gather senior military officers in Virginia
From CNN's Adam Cancryn
President Donald Trump speaks after signing an executive order
in the Oval Office at the White House, on Thursay.
Alex Brandon/AP
President Donald Trump downplayed the Defense Department’s sudden summoning of hundreds of US generals and admirals to Virginia, even as he professed not to know what the meeting planned for next week was about.
“Why is that such a big deal?” Trump asked from the Oval Office today. “You act like this is a bad thing, isn’t it nice that people are coming from all over the world to meet?”
The president added that he would attend that gathering if asked, but openly questioned why the summit at Quantico was notable. Vice President JD Vance similarly dismissed questions about the purpose of the meeting, calling it “not particularly unusual.”
“It’s actually not unusual at all and I think it’s odd that you guys have made it into such a big story,” Vance said.
The sudden order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth today was nevertheless seen as curious within the military, especially given the lack of explanation for requiring high-ranking officers from around the globe to travel to Virginia on short notice.
Neither Trump nor Vance offered an explanation for the meeting or what would be on the agenda.

Trump says he spoke with Netanyahu today and deal on Gaza is "pretty close"

Alex Brandon/AP
President Donald Trump said he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today on the war in Gaza, and signaled that “a deal” is “pretty close.”
The US president also said he spoke to other leaders in the Middle East, without offering specifics.
“We spoke with Bibi Netanyahu today and we spoke to all the leaders in the Middle East, who are great people, and we’re getting pretty close to having a deal on Gaza and maybe even on peace,” Trump said from the Oval Office.
Trump said he discussed releasing hostages still being held in Gaza with the Israeli prime minister, adding the situation in the enclave is “very bad.”
Earlier today: Trump suggested today that Israel and Hamas are “close to getting some kind of a deal done” on a potential ceasefire. He touted his meetings with leaders from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emerites and Jordan on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly earlier this week.

Trump signs executive order on TikTok deal

Kevin Lamarque/Reuters
President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order to advance the completion of a deal to sell TikTok’s US assets to a consortium of mostly American investors.
“I had a very good talk with President Xi” of China, Trump said at an Oval Office event, speaking of a Friday phone call between the two leaders. “And we talked about TikTok and other things, but we talked about TikTok and he gave us the go-ahead” for the deal.
The order is an important step toward the final sale, but the process is not yet complete. The deal will still likely require regulatory approvals from both countries.
And major questions remain unanswered, such as whether US-based users will need to download a separate app.
The sale comes after a US law went into effect in January that bans the app unless parent company ByteDance divests approximately 80% of its US assets to non-Chinese investors. Trump has repeatedly delayed enforcement of the law.

Trump has had a big foreign policy week. Catch up on today's developments
From CNN's Aditi Sangal
When US President Donald Trump met with Turkish President Tayyip Erdoğan at the White House this morning, he told reporters that he was “very disappointed” in Russian President Vladimir Putin for prolonging the war.
Here’s what else we’ve heard regarding Trump and US foreign policy today:
On Russian oil: Trump says he hopes Turkey will stop buying oil from Russia and that Erdoğan is “very neutral” and likes being neutral. “But he’s somebody that, if he got involved, the best thing he could do is not buy oil and gas from Russia.” Erdoğan didn’t directly address these comments, but said he’s looking forward to discussing Turkish-American relationships.
On Middle East: Trump suggested that Israel and Hamas are “close to getting some kind of a deal done” on a potential ceasefire. Meanwhile, as a follow up on Trump administration’s 21-point peace plan that was proposed on Tuesday,
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said today that Arab leaders are grateful that the US is focused on ending the war in Gaza, and that he believes Trump understands “very well the risks and dangers of annexation in the West Bank.” He added that annexation risks not just “the potential of peace in Gaza, but also to any sustainable peace at all.”
Meanwhile, lawmakers meets Zelensky: A bipartisan group of lawmakers met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after his address to the United Nations General Assembly. Bipartisan pressure for congressional leadership to hold votes on sanctions resolutions has been growing for months, but Republican leaders have indicated that they are waiting for the White House to give them the green light.

Fed governor warns Supreme Court of "chaos" if Trump is allowed to fire her

Lisa Cook testifies during a Senate Banking nominations hearing on June 21, 2023 in Washington, DC.
Drew Angerer/Getty Images
Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook urged the Supreme Court today to deny a request from the Trump administration allowing the president to fire her while her lawsuit works its way through lower courts, saying such a move would risk “chaos and disruption.”
Cook framed President Donald Trump’s appeal, which the justices are expected to decide in coming weeks, as a test of the court’s commitment to a Federal Reserve that can set monetary policy free from White House pressure.
If Trump is successful in dismissing Cook, it would mark the first time a Fed governor was fired by a president in the central bank’s 111-year history.
Remember: Trump fired Cook on August 25 after a member of his administration alleged that she had committed mortgage fraud by reporting two different homes as her primary residence — a practice that can yield better loan terms. Other documents have subsequently revealed that Cook sometimes declared the second property as a “vacation home.” Cook called those charges “manufactured” in her brief today and said no court has fully reviewed the facts.
A federal court on September 10 blocked Cook’s dismissal, asserting that Trump had not “identified anything related to Cook’s conduct or job performance as a board member that would indicate that she is harming the board or the public interest.” A federal appeals court declined to put that order on hold, and Trump quickly filed at emergency appeal at the Supreme Court.

"Get lost": Jeffries says Democrats won't be intimidated by threat of layoffs under a potential shutdown
From CNN’s Morgan Rimmer and Arlette Saenz
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries meets with reporters at the Capitol in Washington, DC on Thursday.
J. Scott Applewhite/AP
House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries insisted that the Trump administration’s threat of layoffs under a potential shutdown will not change Democrats’ strategy, with five days to go until the government funding deadline.
Jeffries said the Office of Management and Budget “has been illegally shutting down parts of the government throughout the entire year.” He said all Russell Vought, the director of the agency, has done is “send a message to voters in Virginia and across the country that Republicans are determined to hurt the American people.”
“Donald Trump and the administration have been engaging in mass firings that we deem illegal throughout the year. We will continue to push back against any effort to undermine federal civil service protections that exist in the United States of America as a negotiating tactic. Our response to Russ Vought is simple: get lost,” Jeffries said.
The Democratic leader said that he is still in Washington and ready to speak with President Donald Trump and Republican congressional leadership at any point. Trump canceled his meeting with Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that was originally scheduled for today.
Meantime, Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said federal employees “should not be treated as pawns” in the fight over government funding.
“We must pass a clean, short-term continuing resolution to prevent a harmful government shutdown and allow Congress time to complete the annual funding bills. Federal employees dedicate themselves to serving the public, and they should not be treated as pawns amid a needlessly partisan impasse,” Collins said.
