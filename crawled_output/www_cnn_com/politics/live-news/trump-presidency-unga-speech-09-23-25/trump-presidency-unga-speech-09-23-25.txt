What we covered here
• Trump’s shift on Russia: US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Ukraine is now in position to “fight and WIN” back its original borders in its war against Russia, escalating his rhetoric against Moscow. He also indicated he believes NATO member countries should shoot down Russian aircraft if they enter their airspace.
• UN speech: The US president earlier lambasted the United Nations and countries around the world during an nearly hourlong speech at the UN General Assembly.
Trump admonished the UN over what he views as its ineffectiveness. He said some countries “are going to hell” over their immigration policies, and he blasted climate change as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”
• Global conflicts: Meanwhile, as a growing number of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, Trump framed it as a “reward” for Hamas.

Syria and Israel are pursuing a de-escalation agreement backed by US, Trump administration official says

Syria and Israel are pursuing a de-escalation agreement with the backing of the US that would serve as a first step toward a security agreement between the two countries, Tom Barrack, US special envoy for Syria, told reporters on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday.
Under the agreement, Israel would halt attacks on Syria, and Syria would stop moving machinery, artillery and planes near the Israeli border, Barrack said.
The agreement would offer a win for the Trump administration, which has been working behind the scenes with both sides toward a security agreement, Barrack said. But it is not clear when the agreement will be struck — especially with the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah this week, which has slowed negotiations.
“I think everybody is approaching it in good faith,” Barrack said. “I’m hopeful.”
But the two nations have been longtime enemies, and finalizing a comprehensive security agreement will be complex. Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa spoke earlier in the day about Israel’s aggressive posturing and said that Syria remains scared of the neighboring country. He also said that Syria is looking to “calm down” relations with all countries in the region, during an event hosted by the Middle East Institute.
Al-Sharaa will address the UN General Assembly on Wednesday, marking the first such address of a Syrian president since 1967.
The address comes four months after Al-Sharaa, a former jihadist who until recently had a $10 million US bounty on his head, met US President Donald Trump in Riyadh following toppling of the half-century-old Assad regime. After that meeting, Trump announced that the US would be lifting sanctions on Syria. But US officials recognize that Congress would need to repeal the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, which put severe sanctions mechanisms into place for the country, in order to clear the way for unhindered global investment in Syria.

Rubio will meet with Russia's foreign minister on Wednesday
From CNN's Jennifer Hansler
Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York Wednesday, according to Rubio’s public schedule.
The meeting comes after President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he believed Ukraine could win back its territory lost to Russia in the invasion — a significant shift in Trump’s previous attitude toward Moscow.
Rubio and his Russian counterpart last met on the margins of the ASEAN meeting in Kuala Lumpur in July, where he relayed Trump’s “disappointment and frustration” during a “frank conversation.”
Their meeting on Wednesday is scheduled for noon ET.

UN spokesperson releases statement after White House calls for investigation following escalator incident
From CNN's Jennifer Hansler

A United Nations spokesperson said that “a built-in safety mechanism” on the escalator was triggered, causing it to stop when US President Donald Trump and first lady Melanie Trump attempted to use it earlier today.
Stephane Dujarric, UN Secretary General spokesperson, explained in a statement Tuesday evening that the mechanism may have been triggered by a videographer in the US delegation.
The White House called for an immediate investigation into the escalator incident, and Trump spoke out about it during his speech at the UN General Assembly
“President Trump, accompanied by the First Lady and delegation, arrived at the UNHQ building this morning, and entered through the Delegate’s entrance. After passing through the security gates, President Trump and the First Lady approached the escalator,” Dujarric described. “In an effort to document their arrival, a videographer from the US delegation stepped on to the escalator ahead of the President and First Lady.”
“As the videographer, who was traveling backwards up the escalator reached the top , the First Lady, followed by President Trump, each mounted the steps at the bottom. At that moment (9:50 a.m.), the escalator came to a stop,” he said.
“Our technician, who was at the location, reset the escalator as soon as the delegation had climbed up to the second floor,” Dujarric continued.
“A subsequent investigation, including a readout of the machine’s central processing unit, indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism on the comb step was triggered at the top of the escalator,” Dujarric said.
“The safety mechanism is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing. The videographer may have inadvertently triggered the safety function described above,” he said.

Airspace incursion was "Russian imperialism," Polish president says

Eduardo Munoz/Reuters
Polish President Karol Nawrocki said a drone incursion into his country’s airspace earlier this month was an example of Russian “imperialism.”
“When Russia attacked Georgia, it was not clear to everyone that this was only the beginning of the Kremlin’s new imperialism,” Nawrocki told the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, referring to Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008. “Unfortunately, the wind of history which we know and understand so well in Poland is beginning to blow again. “
“A dozen or so drones violated my country’s borders deliberately,” the Polish leader said. “This was not a coincidence. It happened on orders issued in the capital of a country which is a permanent member of the Security Council.”
Nawrocki said that the incident prompted Poland to open fire on hostile objects for the first time since World War II.
“And rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, as commander in chief of the armed forces and as President of Poland, that Poland will always react adequately and it stands ready to defend its territory,” he added.
“Holding Russia accountable should be our common duty,” the Polish president said.

Colombian president calls for criminal proceedings against Trump for strikes in the Caribbean
From CNN's Hira Humayun
Colombian President Gustavo Petro addresses the 80th United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday.
Eduardo Munoz/Reuters
Colombian President Gustavo Petro has called for US officials including President Donald Trump to face “criminal proceedings” over recent US strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean.
Trump had “allowed the shooting of missiles against these young people who were simply trying to escape poverty,” Petro said of the strikes, which have killed more than a dozen people.
“Was it really necessary on unarmed poor young people in the Caribbean?” Petro asked during his speech at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, adding that while those targeted “might have had a certain amount of drugs, (they) were not drug traffickers.”
Petro tore into the US’s anti-drug policy, claiming it was aimed at propping up “a policy of domination.”
“The anti-drug policy is not meant to stop cocaine that is coming to the United States. The anti-drug policy is (meant) to dominate the peoples of the South as a whole,” the Colombian president told the assembly.
Remember: Earlier this month, the Trump administration said Colombia had “failed demonstrably” in its obligations to fight drug trafficking but said it would continue to provide funding to the South American country.

France’s Macron says the world is “breaking down” due to isolationism

French President Emmanuel Macron said Tuesday that the “world is breaking down” while advocating for greater cooperation to address global challenges in his speech at the UN General Assembly.
“We’re isolating ourselves. There’s more and more divisions, and that’s plagued the global order,” Macron said in his address in New York. “The world is breaking down, and that’s halting our collective capacity to resolve the major conflicts of our time and stopping us from addressing global challenges.”
Following US President Donald Trump’s criticism of the United Nations earlier Tuesday, Macron said that France is “proud to be among the people of the United Nations” and said that the organization “cannot be replaced.”
“It is for this reason that those that are its harshest critics are also those that want to change the rule of the game because they want to exert domination. And these are people that do not want the common good to prevail. They want to serve their interests,” Macron said.
Speaking about Russia’s recent incursions of European airspace, the French leader said that Moscow’s actions are “proof that all European people are also challenged by threats of Russian destabilization.”
He concluded his speech with a rallying call for unity.
“We have one responsibility, (and) that is to act together, build this multilateralism once again with the same faith, with the same resolve as the founding fathers of this assembly. We need to do that with even more effectiveness, but with the same will,” he said.

Ukrainians lining up "to die in the pointless slaughter": Russia to UN Security Council
From CNN's Hira Humayun

Ukrainians are lining up to die for the “advancement of Western geopolitical interests,” a Russian representative told a United Nations Security Council meeting on the war in Ukraine Tuesday.
Russia’s deputy ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyanskiy accused Kyiv of using civilians as human shields and “placing air defense systems in direct proximity to residential areas” leading to “tragedies linked to wreckage falling on homes from errant air defense missiles.”
The Russian representative also condemned what he called “unsubstantiated allegations” about the incursion of Russian drones and jets into Estonia and Poland.
Estonian President Alar Karis told the Security Council the recent violations of Polish, Romanian and Estonian airspace “are yet another escalation and a stark reminder that Russia’s aggression threatens not only Ukraine but the security of the entire region.”
Remember: NATO fighter jets shot down Russian drones that violated Polish airspace during an attack on Ukraine earlier this month, marking the first time shots were fired by the military alliance since the start of the Ukraine war. Days later NATO intercepted three Russian jets that violated Estonian airspace. Both Estonia and Poland have requested NATO Article 4 consultations, the mechanism that allows any member to formally bring an issue to the attention to the alliance’s principle political decision-making body. Earlier this month Romania also alleged that a Russian drone breached its airspace during an attack on Ukraine.

Rubio says war in Ukraine "cannot end militarily"

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said today that the war in Ukraine “cannot end militarily” just hours after US President Donald Trump said he believed Ukraine could continue to fight and win.
“It will end at a negotiating table,” Rubio said at a United Nations Security Council meeting on Ukraine. “That’s where this war will end.”
“The United States remains as committed as it’s ever been to a peaceful resolution to this dangerous conflict,” he told the UN body. He said the US may conclude that there is no peaceful resolution. He said he urged the council, including Russia, to “do everything their power” to “bring this war to an end.”
The top US diplomat warned of the toll that will continue the longer the war rages on.
Rubio’s comments seem to run counter to the Trump’s post saying that Ukraine should continue the fight.
“Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,” Trump said earlier today after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Rubio noted that the “war has to end, and we have done everything we possibly can and will continue to do everything we possibly can to bring it to an end.” He said “very generous offers” had been made to resolve the conflict, including a ceasefire on the current lines.
Rubio noted that the war was not only stagnant, but appeared to be escalating, citing the Russian jet and drone incursions into NATO airspace.

President Donald Trump reiterated that the United States would give Ukraine security guarantees after the war ends, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said, but said Ukraine doesn’t know all the details.
“We don’t have specific things, details on the paper,” Zelensky said.
“I don’t know, but good that we will work on some types of it, and some types of drones, and sometimes of some types of weapon, what we need for security guarantees” as well as what Ukraine needs more immediately, he said.
“I’m not President of the United States. I can’t tell you that President Trump will do everything what we want or what we need, I don’t know, but he was looking positively on the topics what we shared,” Zelensky said.

Dismantling Hamas "doesn't work," says France's Macron

French President Emmanuel Macron stressed that Gaza needs more than just a military solution and there needs to be a focus on the enclave’s future.
“Nobody forgets the seventh of October,” Macron stressed at a bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, adding that French people were killed in the attack.
“But after almost two years of war, what is the result? Once again, they kill the top leaders of Hamas. It works. This is a great achievement, but at the same time, you have as many Hamas fighters as you had the first day. So it doesn’t work to dismantle Hamas,” he said.
“This is not the right way to proceed,” Macron said, adding that a “full-fledged process” is needed for Gaza, underscoring the need for a plan for the enclave the “day after.”
The French president stressed that all hostages need to be released, a ceasefire must be reached, humanitarian aid needs to enter Gaza, and the enclave needs to be stabilized.
Remember: Macron co-hosted a summit with Saudi Arabia on Monday on a two-state solution. But after nearly two years of bloodshed in Gaza, and the proliferation of Israeli outposts in the occupied West Bank, fears are mounting that Palestinian statehood is a fading prospect.
“And we need a political perspective, and this is why we took this decision,” Macron said, referring to France’s recognition of a Palestinian state alongside a number of Western countries on Monday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday that he expects the United States’ actions to “push Russia toward peace” in Ukraine.
“I met with President (Donald) Trump just now, and we spoke about how to finally bring peace, and we discussed a few good ideas, and I hope they will work,” Zelensky said at a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York.
“We expect America’s actions to push Russia toward peace. Moscow fears America and always pays attention to it,” he added.
The Ukrainian leader said Russian President Vladimir Putin sends delegates abroad on his behalf “who cannot and don’t want to stop the bloodshed.”
“When he (Putin) appears abroad in Beijing or somewhere else, it’s only to buy more time for killing,” Zelensky said, adding that the Russian leader “only cares about using every meeting, every chance, to keep the war going.”
Zelensky also took aim at China, calling on the “powerful nation” to do more to stop the fighting in Ukraine. “If China truly wanted this war to stop, it could compel Moscow to end the invasion. Without China, Putin’s Russia is nothing. Yet too often China stays silent,” he said.

President Donald Trump held a multilateral meeting with a number of leaders from Arab nations and others, including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Indonesia, Turkey, and Pakistan at the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, calling it his “most important meeting” of the day.
“This is my most important meeting. I’ve had important meetings. I don’t want to insult anybody that we’ve met with,” Trump said.
“We’ve had 32 meetings here, but this is the one that’s very important to me, because we’re going to end something that should have probably never started,” the president said.
Trump was seated at the head of a conference table with the rest of the leaders seated down the sides.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and special envoy Steve Witkoff were also in the room.
Before entering the room, the president told reporters he was having “a very important meeting” on Gaza.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said US President Donald Trump’s post about the war today was “a big shift,” calling the US leader “a game changer.”
“This post of Trump, it’s a big shift,” Zelensky said at a news conference at the United Nations General Assembly this afternoon.
Zelensky told reporters that he briefed Trump “on what’s going on,” and Trump “agreed with” him about the situation on the battlefield.
“I think that president is — he knows some details. And I think he knows more details … than before. And I am happy with this, and I’m thankful for him, or maybe also for him, for his people who briefed him,” Zelensky said.
Trump wrote on Truth Social that he thinks “Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.” Trump had previously suggested Ukraine would need to give up some of its territory in order to secure a peace deal.
Asked if it’s “game changer” that Trump believes Ukraine can win, Zelensky replied, “Trump is a game changer by himself.”
Zelensky also voiced optimism that China’s President Xi Jinping would put pressure on Russia if he doesn’t have the support of the US or Europe.

White House calls for investigation after escalator malfunction during Trump’s UN visit
From CNN's Alejandra Jaramillo and Kristen Holmes

The White House is calling for an immediate investigation after an escalator at the United Nations reportedly stopped while President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump used it during their arrival for the UN General Assembly.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt raised concerns over whether the incident was intentional in a social media post.
“If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately,” Leavitt said on X.
To support her claim, Leavitt shared a screenshot of an article from the British newspaper The Times published two days earlier that stated: “To mark Trump’s arrival, UN staff members have joked that they may turn off the escalators and elevators and simply tell him they ran out of money, so he has to walk up the stairs.”
During his speech at the UN General Assembly, President Trump himself referenced the malfunction, joking about the less-than-smooth welcome.
“These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,” Trump said.

French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Donald Trump meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday.
Evan Vucci/AP
President Donald Trump and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, met Tuesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, where they discussed differing views on the future of Gaza and Palestinian statehood.
Trump opened the bilateral meeting by praising Macron’s diplomatic efforts, claiming the French leader has helped him prevent global conflicts.
“Emmanuel has actually helped me with a couple of the wars,” Trump said, in response to Macron’s recent remark that if the US president wants a Nobel Peace Prize, he should “put an end to the war in Gaza.”
When asked about Palestinian statehood, and his latest remarks it would be a “gift to Hamas,” Trump again pushed back strongly.
“Well, I think it honors Hamas, and you can’t do that because of October 7. You can’t do that. But we want our hostages back,” Trump said.
“You always have to remember, people forget October 7 was one of the most savage days in the history of the world,” the US president said.
In response, Macron, seated beside Trump, emphasized that recognizing a Palestinian state does not mean ignoring Hamas’ October 2023 attacks on Israel.
Some context: France and several other Western nations formally declared their recognition of a Palestinian state at the United Nations on Monday in a move that deepens Israel’s international isolation.

South Africa's president says trade being used as a “weapon”
00:38
South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa said Tuesday that trade is being used as a “weapon” against several countries around the world in his speech at the UN General Assembly.
Although Ramaphosa’s comments on trade did not explicitly mention the policies of US President Donald Trump, South Africa faces one of the steepest tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, at 30%.
“It is concerning that global geopolitical shocks and unprecedented policy volatility are destabilizing the global economy and jeopardizing a critical source of development finance. In fact, trade is now being used as a weapon against a number of countries in the world,” Ramaphosa said in his New York address.
The South African leader added that the World Trade Organization remains the “only multilateral body that is capable of managing differences and coordinating positions in global trade.”
Remember: Earlier this year, Trump ambushed Ramaphosa in front of the world’s press in the Oval Office, screening a video he claimed was evidence for his false suggestion that White South Africans are being subjected to persecution and “genocide.”

Richard Drew/AP
Several of the world leaders slated to address the United Nations General Assembly today have already spoken.
US President Donald Trump was among the first to address the General Assembly, where he criticized the UN and boasted about US achievements in largely off-script and lengthy remarks.
Here are key moments from other world leaders who have spoken:
Brazil’s president takes aim at US: Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva criticized recent efforts by his US counterpart to punish his country for prosecuting former President Jair Bolsonaro, saying attacks on the judiciary are “unacceptable.”
Qatar’s emir says Israel is a “state hostile to its environment:” Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani strongly criticized Israel in his speech, saying that it is “not a democracy in a hostile environment, as its leaders claim. It is, in reality, a state hostile to its environment.”
South Korean president on “peaceful coexistence” with North Korea: South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said he would like to restore “mutual respect” with North Korea during his address.
CNN’s Billy Stockwell, Heather Law and Max Saltman contributed to this report.
Correction: This post has been updated to correct the translation of the Qatari emir’s words.

Trump urges Ukraine to keep fighting Russia in abrupt shift from bid to broker peace
From CNN's Adam Cancryn
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy meets with US President Donald Trump during the 80th United Nations General Assembly, in New York, on Tuesday.
Alexander Drago/Reuters
President Donald Trump predicted Ukraine is now in position to “fight and WIN” the war against Russia, marking a sharp turnaround after pressing the nation for months to seek a peace deal on the argument that it could not prevail.
“After getting to know and fully understand the Ukrain/Russia Military and Economic situation and, after seeing the Economic trouble it is causing Russia, I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday.
The post came shortly after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly — and amid Trump’s mounting frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin over his resistance to peace talks.
Trump’s comments represents the first time since taking office that he has suggested Ukraine could win back all of the territory that Russia has taken since 2014. He had previously suggested Ukraine would need to give up some of its territory in order to secure a peace deal.
Kyiv has consistently rejected giving up territory, and any arrangement under which Ukraine would agree to cede land Russia took by force would be illegal under international law.
Trump in his Truth Social post mocked Russia for “fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win,” and claimed that the ongoing conflict was weighing on the Russian economy.
“With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option,” Trump wrote.
He also pledged to continue supplying weapons to NATO, adding that NATO could “do what they want with them.”
