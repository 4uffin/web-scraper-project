What we're covering
• NOW: US President Donald Trump is addressing the United Nations General Assembly. He began by boasting of the accomplishments of his first term in office while also criticizing the efficacy of the United Nations.
• War in Gaza: While a growing number of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, Trump framed it as a “reward” for Hamas as he reaffirmed calls for a ceasefire and end to the Gaza conflict. On Ukraine, the US leader admonished European countries for not ending their purchases of Russian oil.
• Network threat thwarted: Meanwhile, the US Secret Service has dismantled a vast network of more than 300 SIM servers in the New York area that could have significantly disrupted the General Assembly, according to authorities.

"We had excellent chemistry.” Trump discloses he briefly met Brazil's Lula amid rift and they will talk again
From CNN's Betsy Klein
US President Donald Trump said he spoke briefly with Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and the two agreed to meet next week amid a major rift between the two countries.
Trump imposed a whopping 50% tariff on Brazil that went into effect August 1. Trump had threatened the tariffs if Brazil did not end its trial against right-wing former president and Trump ally, Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro was subsequently convicted of plotting a coup and sentenced to over 27 years in prison.
“Brazil now faces major tariffs in response to its unprecedented efforts to interfere in the rights and freedoms of our American citizens and others, with censorship, repression, weaponization, judicial corruption and targeting of political critics in the United States,” Trump said in his address to the United Nations.
He offered a caveat, saying that he had briefly met with Lula just before taking the podium. The Brazilian leader was the first head of state to speak at the General Assembly today.
“I have a little problem saying this, because I must tell you, I was walking in, the leader of Brazil was walking out. We saw him, and I saw him, he saw me, and we embraced,” Trump said.“We actually agreed that we would meet next week. We didn’t have much time to talk, like about 20 seconds.”Trump said that Lula “seemed like a very nice man.“He liked me. I liked him, but I only do business with people I like. …“But we had, at least for about 39 seconds, we had excellent chemistry. It’s a good sign.”
Ahead of that meeting, Trump called on Brazil to work with the US on trade: “I’m very sorry to say this, Brazil is doing poorly and will continue to do poorly. They can only do well when they’re working with us. Without us, they will fail just as others have failed.”

Trump goes off-script — and over time — with various digressions
From CNN's Kevin Liptak

Spencer Platt/Getty Images
President Donald Trump’s speech, which began without a teleprompter, turned mostly off-script.
He went into tangents about his crime reduction efforts in US cities, Barack Obama’s carbon footprint, his own stymied efforts to renovate the UN’s headquarters, and the efficacy of windmills.
“We don’t want cows anymore. I guess they want to kill all the cows,” he said at one point, without explanation.
If there is a through line, it is his criticism of how most of the world — and the UN itself — is handling matters, and an accounting of how his approach is better.
Even for Trump, the digressions have been striking.
“In Asia, they dump much of their garbage right into the ocean,” he intoned at one point.
His audience of global delegates didn’t offer any audible reaction, beyond laughing at his description of meeting Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva backstage.
He went well beyond the 15-minute limit for leaders’ speeches, though many of his counterparts also extend past their slotted time.

Trump falsely claims renewable energy is more expensive than fossil fuel
From CNN's Angela Fritz
In today’s speech at the United Nations, President Donald Trump derided what he called the “green energy scam,” claiming renewable energy sources like solar and wind are more expensive than fossil fuel energy.
On the contrary, renewables have driven down the cost of electricity in the US.
An annual cost-of-energy report published in June concluded solar and wind are the “most cost-effective forms of new-build energy on an unsubsidized basis (i.e., without tax subsidies). As such, renewable energy will continue to play a key role in the buildout of new power generation in the U.S. as the lowest-cost and quickest-to-deploy generation.”
Because of these economics, Trump’s policies to re-invigorate the fossil fuel industry will lead to higher costs for customers, according to a recent analysis from Energy Innovation. Red states, including Missouri, Kentucky and South Carolina, could see 13% to 14% higher energy costs by 2035 than what they would have been without Trump’s policies.

Trump highlights counter-cartel mission, warning, "We will blow you out of existence"
From CNN's Betsy Klein
US President Donald Trump addresses the 80th United Nations General Assembly.
Mike Segar/Reuters
US President Donald Trump used his remarks today to the United Nations General Assembly to highlight his administration’s counter-cartel mission in waters around Latin America.
“We’ve recently begun using the supreme power of the United States military to destroy Venezuela terrorists and trafficking networks led by Nicholas Maduro,” Trump said, referring to the president of Venezuela.
The US military has deployed more than 4,000 Marines and sailors to the waters around Latin America and the Caribbean as part of a ramped-up effort to combat drug cartels.
Trump offered a warning to what he described as “every terrorist thug smuggling poisonous drugs into the United States of America.”
“Please be warned that we will blow you out of existence,” the president said.
Earlier this month, a US military strike earlier this month killed 11 people in the Caribbean allegedly tied to the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang. Last Friday, Trump announced another lethal military strike on an alleged drug-trafficking vessel in international waters that he said was affiliated with a designated terrorist organization.

Trump accuses UN of funding "uncontrolled migration" and creating problems for Western nations
From CNN’s Maureen Chowdhury
US President Donald Trump addresses the 80th United Nations General Assembly.
Shannon Stapleton/Reuters
President Donald Trump accused the United Nations of funding the migration crisis during his address to the General Assembly.
“Not only is the UN not solving the problems it should, too often it’s actually creating new problems for us to solve,” Trump said. “The best example is the number-one political issue of our time: the crisis of uncontrolled migration.”
“Your countries are being ruined,” Trump added. “The United Nations is funding an assault on Western countries and their borders.”
Trump claimed that UN assistance for migrants helped people illegally enter the US, “and then we have to get them out. The UN also provided food, shelter, transportation and debit cards to illegal aliens.”
Trump said the UN is supposed to protect countries from “invasions” and “not create them and not finance them.”
“In the United States, we reject the idea that mass numbers of people from foreign lands can be permitted to travel halfway around the world, trample our borders, violate our sovereignty, cause unmitigated crime and deplete our social safety net,” he said.

Trump warns countries they're "going to hell" because of migration policies

In an increasingly digressive speech, President Donald Trump is criticizing other nations’ immigration policies and accusing the UN of “funding an assault on Western countries” by migrants.
“It’s time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now,” Trump told the General Assembly. “I’m really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell.”
Trump touted his own efforts at stemming migration, which he said foreign leaders would be wise to adopt.
Otherwise, he said, “your countries are being ruined.”

Trump announces international effort to enforce Biological Weapons Convention through AI verification system

US President Donald Trump speaks at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Jeenah Moon/Reuters
President Donald Trump announced his administration will lead “an international effort to enforce the Biological Weapons Convention” through an artificial intelligence verification system.
Trump said the convention, which bans the development, production and acquisition of biological weapons, will meet with “top leaders of the world” and pioneer “an AI verification system that everyone can trust.”
“As we seek to reduce the threat of dangerous weapons today, I’m also calling on every nation to join us in ending the development of biological weapons once and for all,” Trump told the UN General Assembly, also pushing for “a cessation of the development of nuclear weapons.”
“I look at weapons that are so powerful we just can’t ever use them. If we ever use them, the world literally might come to an end,” Trump said. “There would be no United Nations to be talking about. There would be no nothing.”

"What is the purpose of the United Nations?": Trump says he ended multiple wars without the UN's help
From CNN's Aditi Sangal
US President Donald Trump addresses the 80th United Nations General Assembly.
Shannon Stapleton/Reuters
US President Donald Trump in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly today repeated his claim of ending seven wars and said that he never received help from the United Nations, questioning the purpose of the intergovernmental organization.
He listed conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan; Cambodia and Thailand; Israel and Iran; India and Pakistan; Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Egypt and Ethiopia; and Serbia and Kosovo.
Analysis: According to analysis from CNN’s Stephen Collinson, some of these “deals are closer to ceasefires than peace agreements that permanently end generational disputes.”
“The president’s team is scanning the globe looking for fires to extinguish to claim quick wins for his transparent campaign for a Nobel Peace Prize,” Collinson writes.
Just a short while ago, Trump touched on his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in this speech, too, claiming that “everyone” thinks that he deserves one.
The president claimed the UN didn’t try to help in his efforts.
“I ended seven wars, dealt with the leaders of each and every one of these countries, and never even received a phone call from the United Nations offering to help in finalizing the deal,” he said. “All I got from the United Nations was an escalator, that on the way up, stopped right in the middle.”
“And then a teleprompter that didn’t work,” he lamented.
“That being the case, what is the purpose of the United Nations? The UN has such tremendous potential,” he asked. “But it’s not even coming close to living up to that potential. For the most part, at least for now, all they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up. It’s empty words, and empty words don’t solve war.”

Trump dresses down European nations for purchasing Russian energy
From CNN's Kevin Liptak
US President Donald Trump dressed down European nations during his speech at the UN.
Jeenah Moon/Reuters
US President Donald Trump dressed down European nations for continuing to purchase Russian oil and gas, declaring he wouldn’t move to apply new punishment on Moscow for the war in Ukraine until they cut off their purchases.
“It’s embarrassing to them, and it was very embarrassing to them when I found out about it,” Trump said. “They have to immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia. Otherwise, we’re all wasting a lot of time.”
European nations have dramatically reduced their oil purchases from Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, but continue to purchase natural gas. Two countries, Hungary and Slovakia, make up the bulk of European purchases of Russian oil.
Trump did identify China and India as the “primary funders of the ongoing war by continuing to purchase Russian oil,” but accused European nations of also contributing.
Trump said the US was “fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs” on Russia if it doesn’t agree to a peace deal, but said European nations “would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures.”
Trump acknowledged sarcastically that European leaders would be “thrilled” to hear his public chastisement, “but that’s the way it is.”
Earlier, Trump said he thought the Ukraine war would have been easier to resolve “because of my relationship with President Putin, which had always been a good one.”
More background: The US has imported $755 million worth of Russian uranium and plutonium so far this year, up from $624 million last year during the Biden administration.
Asked about this, Interior Sec. Doug Burgum told CNN aboard Air Force One on Sunday, “American buying uranium from Russia is not acceptable. And so we’re working very hard… to make sure that we’ve got a plan so that the United States can back into domestic enriched uranium production as soon as possible.”

Trump says momentum for recognition of a Palestinian state is a "reward" for Hamas
From CNN's Betsy Klein

President Donald Trump framed the growing momentum for a two-state solution at the United Nations General Assembly as a “reward” for Hamas as he reaffirmed calls for a ceasefire and end to the conflict in Gaza.
“As if to encourage continued conflict, some of this body is seeking to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. The rewards would be too great for Hamas terrorists for their atrocities,” Trump said during his address to UNGA leaders.
Trump’s remarks marked a direct response to multiple European countries’ announcement of recognition of a Palestinian state during a summit at the UN General Assembly on Monday. The largely symbolic move deepened Israel’s international isolation and does not have US support.
Recognizing a Palestinian state, Trump said, “would be a reward for these horrible atrocities, including October 7, even while they refuse to release the hostages or accept a ceasefire.”
Trump offered an alternative diplomatic tact: “Instead of giving in to Hamas’ ransom demands, those who want peace should be united with one message: Release the hostages now, just release the hostages.”
He added, “We have to stop the war in Gaza immediately. We have to stop it. … We have to negotiate immediately. Have to negotiate peace. We got to get the hostages back.”

In mention of Nobel Peace Prize, Trump says he doesn't care about "winning prizes" but saving lives

President Donald Trump touched on his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, claiming that “everyone” thinks that he deserves one through his efforts brokering peace across the globe.
“Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize for each one of these achievements,” Trump said, earlier repeating his assertion that he’s ended multiple wars. “But for me, the real prize will be the sons and daughters who live to grow up with the mothers and fathers, because millions of people are no longer being killed in endless and glorious wars.”
“What I care about is not winning prizes, it’s saving lives,” Trump continued.

Broken equipment underscores Trump's complaints about the UN's efficacy
From CNN's Kevin Liptak

Stefan Jeremiah/AP
US President Trump is using a broken escalator and an inoperable teleprompter to underscore his deeper complaints about the United Nations.
“These are the two things I got from the United Nations, a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,” he said.
When he was arriving to the UN building on New York’s East River earlier today, the escalator stopped as he was riding up.
”If the first lady wasn’t in great shape, she would have fallen, but she’s in great shape,” he said.
Trump’s gripes with the UN went well beyond its malfunctioning equipment.
“What is the purpose of the United Nations?” he asked during his speech to the General Assembly. And he added later: “For the most part, at least for now, all they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up. It’s empty words, and empty words don’t solve war.”
Later, Trump recalled his failed bid to renovate the UN headquarters in the 2010s, bemoaning they went with terrazzo floors rather than the marble he proposed.
“They still haven’t finished the job,” he said, returning to the broken escalator.

Among those at the UN General Assembly for President Donald Trump’s speech and meetings today are his youngest daughter, Tiffany, and her husband, Michael Boulos.
Michael Boulos, who was born in Lebanon, played a role in Trump’s reelection effort. His father, Massad Boulos, was appointed in April as senior adviser for Africa, and also serves as senior adviser to the president on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs.
First lady Melania Trump is also in attendance and is expected to launch a new coalition, titled “Fostering the Future Together,” when she speaks at an event with other spouses of heads of state Tuesday.

Trump begins speech with boasts on domestic achievements

US President Donald Trump addresses the 80th United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday.
Mike Segar/Reuters
President Donald Trump began his address to the United Nations boasting of the accomplishments of his first term in office, including on the economy and curbing illegal border crossings.
“Today, just eight months into my administration, we are the hottest country anywhere in the world, and there is no other country even close,” Trump said at the beginning of his speech.
“America is blessed with the strongest economy, the strongest borders, the strongest military, the strongest friendships and the strongest spirit of any nation on the face of the earth,” he went on. “This is indeed the golden age of America.”
Similar boasts during his 2018 UN speech drew laughter from the delegates, but Trump has so far been met with only quiet attention from his audience.

Brazil's president takes aim at United States in UN speech

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took aim at recent efforts by his US counterpart to punish his country for prosecuting former President Jair Bolsonaro, saying attacks on the judiciary are “unacceptable.”
“There is no justification for unilateral and arbitrary measures against our institutions and our economy,” Lula da Silva told the United Nations General Assembly.
“The aggression against the independence of the judiciary, branch of power is unacceptable. This interference in domestic affairs is aided by a subservient far right who is nostalgic of past hegemonies.”
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva
Some context: The US applied high tariffs to Brazilian imports in response to the prosecution of Bolsonaro, who was convicted earlier this month on charges related to an attempted coup. The White House even imposed personal sanctions on one of the judges in that case and revoked US visas for him, his colleagues, and their families.
US President Donald Trump has weighed in personally numerous times, branding the case a “witch hunt” in a letter to Brazilian authorities in July and comparing Bolsonaro’s predicament to his own experience after Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in 2021.
Lula da Silva defended the Bolsonaro prosecution in his speech, calling the process “meticulous” and noting that the former president was able to defend himself in court.
“Brazil sent a message to all aspiring autocrats and those who support them,” Lula da Silva said. “Our democracy, our sovereignty, are non-negotiable.”

“I can only say that whoever is operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,” he said.
A few minutes into his speech, Trump appeared to be reading from a printed copy of his remarks.

NOW: Trump is addressing the UN General Assembly
From CNN staff
US President Donald Trump speaks at the United Nations General Assembly.
UNTV
US President Donald Trump is now addressing the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
The scene is quite different from when he gave an address during his first term as president. Then Trump brought his trademark braggadocio to the UN’s rostrum, when he was met with an unfamiliar-for-him response from the delegates: mocking laughter.
Now, few could imagine the scene repeating itself. Once the object of skepticism and open derision by his foreign counterparts, Trump arrived at the UN General Assembly today as an avatar of a changing world order that has little use for global institutions like the one he’s speaking at.
War in Gaza: The US position on Israel’s war in Gaza also leaves Trump isolated, as a number of countries have recognized a Palestinian state and denounced Israel’s actions in the enclave. Meanwhile, the US continues to provide Israel with consistent political cover and military support.
Trump arrived at the UN this morning with first lady Melania Trump.

Melania Trump to launch children's coalition with other first spouses
From CNN's Betsy Klein
First lady Melania Trump is expected to launch a new coalition, titled “Fostering the Future Together,” when she speaks at an event with other spouses of heads of state Tuesday.
It is not related to her “Fostering the Future” initiative, which centers on opportunities for children in foster care.
The new effort is being framed as a “global coalition of nations that is committed to enhancing the well-being of children worldwide through the promotion of education, innovation, and technology to ensure that every child has the skills and resources to flourish in the digital era,” according to the office of the first lady. Its membership will be a group of first spouses.
The mission of the group is vague, but it is said to center around “the personal development of our children,” to “collaborate with private sector to provide access to innovative education technology, including artificial intelligence, robotics, and blockchain,” and to “exchange solutions surrounding advantages and risks of artificial intelligence.”
Marc Beckman, a senior adviser to the first lady, described it as a “think tank” that will be branded “throughout the world.”
“Each participating nation will be able to use fostering the future together as a brand. So think in terms of Fostering the Future Together Canada, Fostering the Future Together Spain, Fostering the Future Together Italy,” he told Fox News’ “FOX & Friends,” adding that it “will really create this incredible movement that prioritizes children over everything.”
The first lady has showed an interest in the well-being of children and responsible AI. At an appearance earlier this month, she highlighted the opportunities and perils of the emerging technology.
Melania Trump is expected to host the coalition for its inaugural meeting at the White House in early 2026.

Melania Trump will greet Ukrainian first lady to be “polite”
From CNN's Betsy Klein

An adviser to first lady Melania Trump downplayed the significance of an upcoming greeting between the first lady and her Ukrainian counterpart, Olena Zelenska, saying Tuesday that Trump is meeting with Zelenska to be polite.
Trump and Zelenska are expected to have an informal hello while both women are in New York City around the UN General Assembly.
“It’s an interesting back story, actually, Ainsley. The truth is that Mrs. Zelenska has reached out to Melania several times to set up a meeting, but there’s no bilateral meeting,” Marc Beckman, a senior adviser to the first lady, said during an appearance on Fox News’ “FOX & Friends.”
“There’s nothing formal. As our first lady is very polite, she’s going to say hello today, but there’s no sitdown substantive conversation set, no meeting set.”
Zelenska wrote a letter to the first lady, hand-delivered to President Donald Trump by her husband, President Volodymyr Zelenksy, last month.
It came after Melania Trump penned her own letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin that obliquely referenced the “darkness” around children impacted by war. She did not specifically name Ukraine, but thousands of Ukrainian children have allegedly been abducted by Russia since the war began.
The first lady is expected to speak at an event with other spouses of heads of state later Tuesday, where she is expected to launch a new coalition, titled “Fostering the Future Together.”

UN secretary-general warns that the global body's principles are "under siege"

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addresses the 80th United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday.
Mike Segar/Reuters
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the global body’s principles are “under siege” as the General Assembly’s high-level debate began on Tuesday.
“We have entered into an age of reckless disruption and relentless human suffering,” Guterres told diplomats from the dais in New York. “Look around. The principles of United Nations that you have established are under siege.”
“Let’s be clear: international cooperation is not naivete,” Guterres continued. “It is hardheaded pragmatism…no country can stop a pandemic alone, no army can stop halt rising temperatures, no algorithm can reveal trust once it is broken.”
The Secretary-General also addressed current events in the Middle East, emphasizing that the “scale of death and destruction” in the Gaza Strip has exceeded any other conflict in his tenure as the UN’s top official.
Guterres ended by calling for further funding for the UN’s humanitarian work, saying that “those who depend on the United Nations must not be made to bear the cost.”
Some background: The US has contributed to the UN’s funding crisis by ceasing payments toward the UN budget. US President Donald Trump has cut funding for foreign humanitarian aid and peacekeeping operations, leaving the institution stretched financially.
