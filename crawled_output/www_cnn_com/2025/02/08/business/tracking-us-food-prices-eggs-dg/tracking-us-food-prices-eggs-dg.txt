The cost of food in the US increased significantly amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the steep inflation that followed. While prices have stabilized more recently, avian flu drove up the cost of eggs earlier this year, and the price of coffee has continued an upward trajectory for several months now, because of extreme weather. The cost of steak is also on the rise for a variety of factors.
President Donald Trump’s ongoing, chaotic global tariff rollout has also threatened to increase prices for other common household foods.
CNN is tracking price trends for various household staples each month. Select a product below to see how its costs have shifted over time.
The costs for some products could remain volatile, but the overall trend shows prices have largely stabilized. For example, government economists also track inflation for foods Americans eat at home to better understand price trends across all products at the grocery store.
That measure, a subset of the broader Consumer Price Index, shows that food inflation overall has come down significantly since the Covid-19 peak, with more recent rates closer to historical norms.
The graphics on this page will automatically update as new data becomes available each month.
