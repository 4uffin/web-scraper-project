Why Uji’s matcha is the world’s most coveted green tea

To trace matcha to its source, CNN Seasons host Hikari Mori travels to Uji, Japan’s most prestigious tea-growing region. Here, centuries-old techniques and meticulous cultivation produce ceremonial matcha of extraordinary quality. With global demand soaring and top grades fetching up to $4,000 per kilo, matcha is revealed as more than a wellness trend — it’s a seasonal, sensory art form at the height of its prestige.
