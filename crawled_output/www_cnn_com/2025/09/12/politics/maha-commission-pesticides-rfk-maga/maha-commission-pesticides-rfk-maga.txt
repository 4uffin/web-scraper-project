Why pesticides could threaten a MAGA-MAHA political divorce

Pesticides are a big business in the United States — a billion pounds of insect and weed killers can be used in a year, mostly to blanket acres of corn, soybeans, spinach, and wheat grown by America’s massive agriculture industry.
Banning or heavily restricting certain pesticides has been a core tenet of the ‘Make America Healthy Again’ movement, and supporters expected the Trump administration, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as its Health and Human Services secretary, to deliver.
But a much-touted strategy report by the MAHA Commission — a Trump-mandated group led by Kennedy that is supposed to tackle the drivers of chronic disease in America — emerged this week with little to show on the issue.
Now, some of the most politically engaged MAHA faithful have a warning: They aligned with the Make America Great Again Republican Party in the last election but are not afraid to abandon it.
“We will be actively campaigning to get people into office coming in the midterms that will protect our children, and we are not beholden to political parties,” Zen Honeycutt, founder of grass-roots advocacy group Moms Across America, said outside the HHS building after an event unveiling the report Tuesday.
Politicians in Washington discount how many people could be motivated to vote on this issue, said David Murphy, founder of United We Eat and Kennedy’s former presidential campaign
finance director.
“The reality is, the more times you miss on your base, the more times you deny them on major key issues and campaign promises, the less likely they are to turn up to vote in a midterm election,” he said.
The decades-long pesticides battle
Pesticide use in America soared in the 1970s and 1980s alongside a boom of industrial agriculture, but using the office of the health secretary to address it in policy is an emblem of the MAHA influence.
The US Environmental Protection Agency regulates pesticide chemicals, with a mandate to balance protecting billions of pounds of produce a year against their potential toxicity for
the environment and people.
The US Department of Agriculture oversees farming policy and monitors overall pesticide use; Kennedy’s department, HHS, is limited to various health agencies that fund research and track exposures, but has no legal authority over pesticides.
Nevertheless, after dropping out of the presidential race and endorsing Donald Trump, Kennedy issued a promise to his supporters.
“We’re going to ban the worst agricultural chemicals that are already prohibited in other countries,” Kennedy said in an October 2024 YouTube video, calling the plan part of a “win-win strategy I will be pushing in the Trump administration.”
When Trump tapped him to lead HHS, he was on board with Kennedy’s biggest plans. “HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives,” Trump wrote in an X post shortly after the election.
Hearing a president-elect talk about these issues helped draw her and others into the MAGA fold, Honeycutt said.

Calls for more pesticide regulations have united an expansive coalition of environmental advocates, concerned mothers and wellness influencers. The movement has also pulled in farmers who argue that broad use of these chemicals is killing their soil and harming their own health.
They are particularly concerned about two widely used weedkillers — glyphosate and atrazine. These chemicals had also been the focus of some of Kennedy’s environmental legal work prior to joining the government. (In 2017, Kennedy and his legal partners sued Monsanto, the maker of RoundUp, a glyphosate product, on behalf of a client who alleged that exposure led to his non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and won.)
Yet the United States’s largest corn and soybean producers rely heavily on these products, and major farming groups have warned that suggestions their pesticide practices are harmful to health would destabilize confidence in the food supply.
So from the beginning, Kennedy’s promises on pesticides were going to be hard to keep.
“If we lose the farmers, the MAHA agenda is bankrupt,” he told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.
In May, the MAHA Commission, which is made up of Kennedy, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and other officials, issued its first report outlining potential drivers of chronic diseases in America. It cited both glyphosate and atrazine, and mentioned studies suggesting their links to cancer, liver complications and reproductive disorders.
But Tuesday’s follow-up, which outlines policies for how to address the issues cited in the May report, does not put forward any bans, reforms or mandates for warning labels addressing alleged harms caused by pesticides.
Some advocates are pragmatic about the limits of what can be accomplished on pesticide chemicals. “This is not about ‘we’re gonna ban glyphosate tomorrow.’ This is about creating an offering, creating a pathway to prosperity that doesn’t require you to use so many chemical inputs,” said Charles Eisenstein, an environmental activist and former senior adviser to Kennedy’s campaign.
Even by modest measures, though, advocates found its pesticide contents toothless. The report “echoes the pesticide industry’s talking points,” Ken Cook, co-founder of the Environmental Working Group
, a public health nonprofit, said in a statement.
The commission’s plan includes an effort to “ensure that the public has awareness and confidence in EPA’s pesticide robust review procedures.”
The agency has long upheld glyphosate and atrazine’s approval and maintained there is no found link to cancer, though it has, over the years, revoked approvals or rejected new pesticides.
“We can ensure the safe use of the chemicals EPA regulates,” Zeldin said on Tuesday, pointing out that the agency has already rejected six herbicides this year.
That does not cut it for some of MAHA’s most vocal supporters.
“Basically, what they’re saying is that the EPA is going to do better propaganda,” said Honeycutt.

Taking it to the polls
Larger battles loom.
Congress will soon consider farming legislation that could hamstring future pesticide regulations, including by limiting states’ abilities to bolster pesticide labels or shielding pesticide manufacturers from lawsuits alleging harm caused by
their products.
Anti-pesticide activists have beseeched Trump to publicly oppose these provisions, particularly the liability shields, which are written into Republican-backed bills. This summer, more than 350 organizations and advocates signed a letter to the president led by Murphy’s United We Eat.
“If Republicans do not lead, they risk losing both moral ground and political support,” the letter warned.
The fight, to MAHA voters, mirrors a longtime crusade against vaccine makers who are protected from certain liabilities.
It’s “very activating” to the MAHA base “because it mirrors the vaccine liability shield that so many of us take issue with,” said Eisenstein. Kennedy and his supporters have long argued that vaccine manufacturers should not be protected from patient lawsuits either — though, to date, neither Trump nor Kennedy, as HHS secretary, have publicly spoken about pesticide liability shields.
That means the battle over either of the pesticide measures, as well as shaping broader pesticide policy, looks like an opportunity for new allies to step into the MAHA-verse, according to Eisenstein. “I think that there’s an opportunity in the midterms for both Republicans and Democrats, oddly enough, especially for Democrats,” he said.
Others put it more starkly.
“I’m willing to help Republicans lose ten seats in the House if they go through with this,” said Murphy.
“This is my life’s work,” he said. “When do our politicians, elected officials, stand up and do the right thing?”
