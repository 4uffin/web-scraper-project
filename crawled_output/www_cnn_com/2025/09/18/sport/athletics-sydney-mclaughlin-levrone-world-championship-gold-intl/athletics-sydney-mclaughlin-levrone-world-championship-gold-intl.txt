American track star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone won gold in the women‚Äôs 400m at the World Athletics Championships on Thursday, running the second-fastest time ever.
McLaughlin-Levrone ‚Äì who typically runs hurdles ‚Äì completed the race in a world championship record 47.78 seconds in rainy conditions in Tokyo, surpassing the previous mark of 47.99 seconds set by Jarmila Kratochv√≠lov√° in 1983.
The 26-year-old‚Äôs time was just 0.18 seconds shy of the world record in the event, set by Marita Koch. The German set the mark of 47.60 seconds in 1985 in Canberra, Australia. McLaughlin-Levrone has already set numerous world records in the women‚Äôs 400m hurdles.

McLaughlin-Levrone, who is a two-time Olympic gold medalist and the 2022 world champion in the women‚Äôs 400m hurdles, looked at ease in the final despite being a newcomer in the event and facing the top three in the women‚Äôs 400m at last year‚Äôs Summer Olympics in the form of Marileidy Paulino, Salwa Eid Naser and Natalia Bukowiecka.
Having already broken the US record for the race in the semifinals, she exploded off the starting blocks with a purpose.
As the runners rounded the bend onto the final straight, McLaughlin-Levrone, Paulino and Naser were almost side-by-side until a powerful burst from the American star saw her build herself a lead.
Although Paulino attempted to pip McLaughlin-Levrone to the finish line, it was not to be as she added yet another gold medal to her already-full trophy cabinet.

Dominican Republic‚Äôs Paulino claimed silver in a national record 47.98 seconds while Naser of Bahrain earned bronze, running 48.19 seconds.
McLaughlin-Levrone and Paulino‚Äôs times in the final are the third and fourth instances ever that a woman has run the 400m in less than 48 seconds. The first two times that happened both came in the 1980s.
