Four Army soldiers are believed to be dead after a Black Hawk helicopter crashed near a military base in Washington state late Wednesday evening, according to a spokesperson from the US Army Special Operations Command Public Affairs Office.
“The U.S. Army Special Operations Command confirms that the four Soldiers assigned to the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) involved in the Sept. 17 aircraft mishap are believed to be dead,” the spokesperson said in a statement on Friday.
The identities of the four service members have not yet been released.
“Our hearts are with the families, friends, and teammates of these Night Stalkers,” Lt. Gen. Jonathan Braga, USASOC Commander said in a statement. “They were elite warriors who embodied the highest values of the Army and the Army Special Operations, and their sacrifice will never be forgotten.”
The spokesperson said “the cause of the mishap is under investigation.”
“On site law enforcement, fire fighters, and specialty personnel from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, are conducting recovery efforts,” the spokesperson said.
In a social media statement early Thursday morning, the Thurston County Sheriff’s Office said that the adjoining county’s deputies “have been dispatched to reports of a possible helicopter crash in the Summit Lake area. Deputies have located what is believed to be the scene.”
Summit Lake is located west of the base in an area southwest of Tacoma.
“We have been advised that the military lost contact with a helicopter in the area, and we are working closely with JBLM to deploy any resources needed to assist,” the office wrote.
CNN has reached out to JBLM for comment.
