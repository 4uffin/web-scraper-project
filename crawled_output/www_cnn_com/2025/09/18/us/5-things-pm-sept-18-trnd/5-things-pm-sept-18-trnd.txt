1Ô∏è‚É£ Hoping for the best
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time this year, which could provide some relief for households in the US. But the top 20% of American earners are keeping the economy alive, and that‚Äôs not a good sign.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Flag jacking
Chelsea Metzger didn‚Äôt set out to fake her nationality ‚Äî until a bar fight and a taxi rejection in the Dominican Republic pushed her there. Some American travelers are hiding behind the maple leaf, and Canadians are livid.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Deadly disease explained
Six people have died of rabies in the US since last September, and 14 potential outbreaks are being tracked across 20 states. So what is it, how is it transmitted and do we have a vaccine yet? An expert breaks it down.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Concern from the Vatican
Pope Leo XIV recently sat down for his first major interview since his election, where he voiced concern over ‚Äúsome things‚Äù happening in the US. Although not engaging in partisan politics, he seeks to work with bishops in the country.
5Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄòThe Summer I Turned Pretty‚Äô
Everything magical happens during the summers in the hit TV drama ‚Äî and for fans, it continues even after the series finale. Join us (spoilers ahead!) as we unpack this pop culture phenomenon.
