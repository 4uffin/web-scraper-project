👋 Welcome to 5 Things PM! If you’ve ever felt like you have to pee but can’t, you’re not the only one. A urologist explains what could be happening and what you should do about it.
Here’s what else you might have missed during your busy day.

1️⃣ Hoping for the best
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Wednesday for the first time this year, which could provide some relief for households in the US. But the top 20% of American earners are keeping the economy alive, and that’s not a good sign.
2️⃣ Flag jacking
Chelsea Metzger didn’t set out to fake her nationality — until a bar fight and a taxi rejection in the Dominican Republic pushed her there. Some American travelers are hiding behind the maple leaf, and Canadians are livid.
3️⃣ Deadly disease explained
Six people have died of rabies in the US since last September, and 14 potential outbreaks are being tracked across 20 states. So what is it, how is it transmitted and do we have a vaccine yet? An expert breaks it down.
4️⃣ Concern from the Vatican
Pope Leo XIV recently sat down for his first major interview since his election, where he voiced concern over “some things” happening in the US. Although not engaging in partisan politics, he seeks to work with bishops in the country.
5️⃣ ‘The Summer I Turned Pretty’
Everything magical happens during the summers in the hit TV drama — and for fans, it continues even after the series finale. Join us (spoilers ahead!) as we unpack this pop culture phenomenon.
