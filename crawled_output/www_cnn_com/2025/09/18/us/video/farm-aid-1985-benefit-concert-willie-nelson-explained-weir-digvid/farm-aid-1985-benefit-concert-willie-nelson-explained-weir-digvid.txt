Farm Aid’s founding fathers focus on building healthy food chains
Link Copied!
American farmers set a record number of foreclosures and suicides after crop prices crashed in 1985. That’s when country icon Willie Nelson deputized fellow music legends to create the Farm Aid benefit concert. CNN’s Bill Weir breaks down the back story, explaining how an off-hand comment made on stage by Bob Dylan led to raising more than $20 million to support the cause. “Farm Aid 40" airs live on Saturday, September 20 at 7p ET on CNN.
