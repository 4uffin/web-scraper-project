—
Britain, Canada and Australia announced formal recognition of the state of Palestine on Sunday, in an attempt to pile pressure on Israel as it presses on with its campaign in Gaza despite international outrage.
The three – all strong allies of Israel for decades – also expressed deep frustration at the lack of progress towards a two-state solution.
Later on Sunday, Portugal announced that it too had formally recognized a Palestinian state, adding that a two-state solution was the “only path to a just and lasting peace.”
France and several other countries are expected to follow suit at the United Nations General Assembly this week, deepening Israel’s isolation and putting them at odds with Israel’s key partner, the United States.
In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that “there will be no Palestinian state.”
“I have a clear message to those leaders recognizing a Palestinian state after the horrific massacre of October 7th: you are giving a massive prize to terror,” Netanyahu said in a statement on Sunday.
“The response to the latest attempt to force a terror state upon us in the heart of our land will be given after my return from the United States. Wait for it,” Netanyahu added.
Israel’s President Isaac Herzog added to this criticism, saying the move will “not help one Palestinian, it won’t help free one hostage, and it will not help us reach any settlement between Israelis and Palestinians.”
“This is a sad day for those who seek true peace,” Herzog said in a post on X.
More than 140 other members of the UN already recognize Palestine, a number that has grown in the face of mounting alarm over Israel’s offensive in Gaza.
In the first of a series of apparently coordinated announcements Sunday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said on X his country “recognises the State of Palestine and offers our partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the state of Palestine and the State of Israel.”
“The Palestinian Authority has renounced violence, has recognized Israel and is committed to the two-state solution,” a senior Canadian government official told CNN shortly before the announcement. “We are recognizing the State of Palestine in order to empower those who seek peaceful coexistence and marginalize Hamas.”
Carney had said in July that his country would recognize the State of Palestine at the UNGA, drawing immediate condemnation from Israeli officials and the US, with President Donald Trump saying it could hurt Canada in trade talks.
The announcement by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer makes good on his pledge in July to recognize a Palestinian state unless Israel met certain conditions, which included agreeing to a ceasefire and committing to the prospect of a two-state solution.
Since Starmer issued his ultimatum, Israel has moved to take control of Gaza City and expand Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and has repeated its opposition to a two-state solution. Netanyahu on Sunday said that Israel has “doubled Jewish settlement” in the occupied West Bank, adding “we will continue on this path.”

“In the face of growing horror in the Middle East, we are acting to keep alive the possibility of peace,” Starmer said in a video address. Britain’s Foreign Office travel advice webpage was updated on Sunday to reflect Starmer’s announcement, changing mentions of the “Occupied Palestinian Territories” to “Palestine.”
French President Emmanuel Macron was the prime mover in July, calling for countries to join France in announcing their recognition at UNGA.
In an interview with CBS News aired on Sunday, Macron confirmed France’s intention to recognize a Palestinian state on Monday, while stating that the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza will be a requirement “before opening, for instance, an embassy in Palestine.”
Belgium, Luxembourg and San Marino are among other governments planning to recognize a Palestinian state this week.
Israel has furiously condemned the moves, saying they will reward and embolden Hamas for its October 7, 2023, terror attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another roughly 250 taken hostage.
Israel’s subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 65,000 Palestinian people, according to the territory’s health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. A growing number of international scholars and bodies say Israel’s war constitutes genocide, an accusation that the Israeli government has vehemently denied.
Far-right members of the Israeli government responded to the announcements Sunday by urging Netanyahu to annex the occupied West Bank.
Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the UK’s announcement was an “important and necessary step towards achieving a just and lasting peace.”
According to Abbas, the move would pave the way for the implementation of the two-state solution, “allowing the State of Palestine to live side by side with the State of Israel in security, peace, and good neighborliness.”
Basem Naim, a senior member of Hamas’ political office, told CNN that today’s move by the UK, Canada and Australia is a “welcomed step,” but must be accompanied by “practical measures on the ground.”
Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, a leading figure in Palestinian politics, said the move by several countries to recognize a Palestinian state signals “a sea change in the world,” and there are many “courses of action open to these states to stop the genocide & take punitive measures against Israel. The test lies in whether they will.”

Western recognition won’t change the reality on the ground: A Palestinian state has never seemed further away
Despite the growing momentum to recognize Palestine, there are roadblocks to it becoming a full UN member.
The path to become a full member requires at least nine of the 15 members of the Security Council to vote in favor, and none of the five permanent members – Britain, China, France, Russia and the US – to veto it. The US would be expected to wield its veto power if the issue came before the Security Council.
Because China and Russia recognized a Palestinian state in 1988, the US may soon be left as the only permanent Security Council member not to recognize a Palestinian state, reinforcing how Washington increasingly stands as a bulwark between Israel and growing international isolation.
And other countries, too, have shown no sign of recognizing Palestinian statehood. Canada and the UK are the first G7 countries to recognize Palestine, but fellow members Japan, Italy and Germany oppose the move.
