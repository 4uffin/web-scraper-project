Hurricane Gabrielle rapidly intensified in warm water in the central Atlantic far from land Monday morning, becoming the second major hurricane of the 2025 season.
Major hurricanes are Category 3 or stronger. Gabrielle was a Category 4 hurricane with 140 mph winds Monday afternoon. It’s expected to start to gradually lose strength Tuesday and Wednesday as it turns east.
Gabrielle’s winds increased by 55 mph in 24 hours as of Monday morning, far exceeding the baseline for rapid intensification of a 35 mph increase over the same time period. Rapid intensification has become far more common in recent years as the planet warms due to fossil fuel pollution.
The hurricane was just under 200 miles southeast of Bermuda Monday afternoon and moving north-northeast, sending rough surf along with potentially some rain and wind to the island, but avoiding a direct impact.
Gabrielle could also cause “life-threatening surf and rip current conditions from North Carolina northward” along the US East Coast through the early part of this week. Beachgoers should check local marine forecasts before heading into the water this week.
The next two storms?
Even though Gabrielle isn’t a direct threat to land, the storm might have some company in the coming days that could come closer to it.
Two areas of stormy weather in the central Atlantic are being tracked by the National Hurricane Center for potential to become the next named storm.
The National Hurricane Center has outlooked two areas to watch for tropical development in the coming days as Gabrielle churns east of Bermuda Monday morning.
CNN Weather
The stormy area furthest east in the central Atlantic is steadily organizing and has a high chance of strengthening into a tropical depression or tropical storm Wednesday or Thursday.
Conditions in the atmosphere and ocean around it are becoming more favorable for development, making it likely to become the next named system of the season.
The next names on the Atlantic season’s 2025 list are Humberto and Imelda.
The other area of showers and thunderstorms is about 300 miles east of the Lesser Antilles and is weaker and less organized. It has a medium chance to develop into a tropical depression late this week near the Bahamas. It could sweep across the Leeward Islands early this week with bursts of gusty rain and wind before it has a chance to become a bonafide tropical system.
It’s incredibly difficult to pinpoint where these potential systems could track before they organize, but weather models are hinting at some options.
The area with the high chance to develop could ultimately take a curved path similar to Gabrielle that brings it near Bermuda next week. The area with the medium chance to develop is more of a wildcard, with several potential track options. If it does develop, it could become a short-lived system near the Bahamas, or it could survive longer and adopt a Hurricane Erin-like track paralleling the US East Coast.
September is the traditional peak of Atlantic hurricane season and activity often ramps up quickly this time of year. But the season has had a much slower start than anticipated.
About four or five hurricanes typically have roamed the Atlantic at this point in the season, but there have only been two so far this year: Erin and Gabrielle. Both have been major hurricanes, but Gabrielle’s arrival as one Monday is also a little late for the second major hurricane.
Still, with the new flourish of activity, the Atlantic is showing us that the season is far from over.
