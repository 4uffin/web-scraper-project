The US Commerce Department said Wednesday that it had opened new national security investigations into the import of personal protective equipment, medical items, robotics and industrial machinery.
The “Section 232” investigations, which were opened on September 2 but not publicly disclosed previously, could be used as a basis for even higher tariffs on a wide swath of medical and industrial goods including imported face masks, syringes and infusion pumps, as well as for robotics and industrial machinery like programmable computer-controlled mechanical systems and industrial stamping and pressing machines.
The probe asks companies to detail projected demand for robotics and industrial machinery and the extent to which “domestic production of robotics and industrial machinery, and their parts and components can meet domestic demand,” as well as the role of foreign supply chains in meeting US demand.
The US Commerce Department is particularly interested in the role of major exporters like China in meeting US medical needs and the “impact of foreign government subsidies and predatory trade practices.”
The potential tariffs could also cover surgical masks, N95 respirators, gloves, gowns and other medical and surgical instruments and supplies including IV bags, gauze/bandages, sutures, wheelchairs, crutches and hospital beds.

The probe also covers pacemakers, insulin pumps, coronary stents, heart valves, hearing aids, prosthetics, blood glucose monitors, orthopedic appliances, computed tomography scanners and magnetic resonance imaging machines.
Pharmaceuticals including prescription drugs, as well as drones, are part of separate 232 probes.
The robotics probe includes machine tools for cutting, welding and handling workpieces, autoclaves and industrial ovens. Laser and water-cutting tools and machinery are also included.
The department has opened numerous probes into the national security ramifications of imports of wind turbines, airplanes, semiconductors, heavy trucks, polysilicon, copper, timber and lumber and critical minerals.
