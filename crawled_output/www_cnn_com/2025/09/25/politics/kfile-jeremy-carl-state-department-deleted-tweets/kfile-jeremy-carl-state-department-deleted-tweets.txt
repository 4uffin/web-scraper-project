‘We either win or die’: Trump State Dept. nominee tried to erase thousands of tweets, many inflammatory

Jeremy Carl, a top Trump State Department nominee, deleted thousands of social media posts, many demonstrating a history of inflammatory commentary— including incendiary posts about race, claims that “peaceful coexistence” with Democrats is impossible, and even a call for a political opponent to face the death penalty.
But a CNN KFile investigation suggests that Carl wasn’t thorough enough in scrubbing his account, as thousands of deleted posts remain visible on the internet archive website the Wayback Machine.
Carl, President Donald Trump’s nominee to be assistant secretary of state for international organizations, is currently under consideration by the Senate to fill a high-ranking job at the State Department overseeing US policy for the United Nations and other multinational bodies and managing more than 100 diplomats around the world.
Sometime before his nomination, Carl deleted at least 5,000 tweets from his account on X, formerly known as Twitter, including posts expressing sympathy for rioters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 — whom he repeatedly described as “political prisoners.”
In a post from May 2023, Carl claimed the Capitol riot defendants had it worse than Black Americans in the Jim Crow South. A week later, Carl further escalated his rhetoric, writing that “if the U.S. were a serious nation,” American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten would be “tried for crimes against America’s children and would get the death penalty.”
Anyone can delete their social media activity, but Carl made the unique step of asking to remove his posts from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, a tool used to save snapshots of webpages.
While Carl’s current X username – “realjeremycarl” – was wiped from the Wayback Machine, his previous username handle – “jeremycarl4” – is still accessible. That handle was active until January 2024. Both “realjeremycarl” and “jeremycarl4” share the same unique ID – proving they are the same account.
The account was also made private in the fall of 2020 through January 2021 – making it impossible to see archived posts from that time period.
The unearthing of Carl’s posts comes amid a new national debate over incendiary rhetoric following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk — and as the administration signals a tougher stance on prosecuting so-called left-wing “hate speech.”
In a statement from the White House, spokesperson Anna Kelly told CNN, “Jeremy Carl did great work during President Trump’s first administration, and he is highly qualified to serve as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations. The administration stands by our nominees.”
CNN reached out to Carl directly for comment and received a statement from State Department deputy spokesman Tommy Pigott defending Carl. “He’s never called for political violence. We look forward to Jeremy Carl’s contributions in support of the America First foreign policy agenda where he will ensure we are bringing international organizations back to their core mandates,” Pigott said.
A history of strident rhetoric
If confirmed, Carl would oversee the Bureau of International Organization Affairs, which shapes US policy at the United Nations and other multilateral bodies, managing more than 100 diplomats across missions in Geneva, Montreal, Nairobi, New York, Paris, Rome and Vienna.

A former deputy assistant secretary at the Interior Department during Trump’s first-term, Carl is now a senior fellow at the conservative Claremont Institute and previously worked at Stanford’s Hoover Institution. He graduated from Yale University in 1995, where he was the president of the Yale Political Union, and received his master’s in public administration from Harvard University.
His writings have appeared in Newsweek and conservative outlets such as the American Conservative and Revolver News, a January 6 conspiracy website.
Carl has in the past urged the Trump administration to ignore court rulings. In 2019, Carl wrote that the administration should “stop whining and complaining about judicial supremacy and start ignoring illegal judicial rulings.” The post was in response to a federal judge restoring a nationwide injunction blocking a Trump policy that restricted asylum claims for migrants who passed through another country first.
Among the rioters at the US Capitol he referred to as “political prisoners” was Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the extremist group the Oath Keepers. Rhodes was convicted of seditious conspiracy, obstructing an official proceeding and evidence tampering over his participation in the attack on the Capitol. His sentence was later commuted by President Trump in January.
Just two days after the riot, Carl declared, “The real coup was against Trump not by Trump,” and accused then–House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of attempting a “military coup” and declaring that she “must be prosecuted.”
Carl repeatedly called the Democratic Party the “treason party” and its members and policies “evil.” He once wrote, “Dems R [sic] the real fascists.”
He framed the fight against his political opponents as an existential battle between conservatives and liberals. “There is no ‘peaceful coexistence’ we are going to have when our opposition is led by people like this. We either win or die,” he wrote in June 2021, responding to a tweet from then-Rep. Cori Bush, which lamented that, “incarcerated Black people are still in bondage.”
He also called for the imprisonment of prominent Democrats including then-President Joe Biden, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, former Attorney General Merrick Garland, and “Soros prosecutor[s]” – prosecutors elected with support from PACs or nonprofits supported by George Soros, the philanthropist and frequent target of the far-right over his support for left-wing causes.
Comments on race and religion
Carl’s deleted posts also frequently trafficked in incendiary rhetoric around race and religion.
In March 2021, he railed against what he described as the “total absence” of White Protestants in President Biden’s administration, calling the group’s exclusion “a huge story” and expressed disbelief it was not being covered. Days later, he accused Democrats of bigotry for “entirely exclud[ing] America’s largest ethnoreligious grouping.”
Biden’s cabinet did have one White Protestant: Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. He was raised Catholic but identifies as Episcopalian.
He also derided the creation of Juneteenth as a federal holiday, dismissing it as “race hustling and white-shaming,” and referred to “self-hating white people” as “mentally ill.”
“If you’re a white person celebrating Juneteenth, you’ve already surrendered,” Carl wrote in July 2021.
Carl also repeatedly wrote about the “Great Replacement,” a conspiracy theory that posits there is a plot to intentionally bring non-White immigrants into Western countries to “replace” White populations.
“Imagine thinking the Great replacement is a conspiracy theory,” he wrote in September 2021.
In a post from May 2023 referring prosecutions of Capitol riot defendants, Carl wrote, “I would rather be a black man on trial for the assault of a white man in 1930s rural Mississippi than I would be a right-winger in DC today on trial for political crimes,” Carl wrote shortly after members of the far-right Proud Boys were convicted of seditious conspiracy for their role in the attack.
In a string of posts following Derek Chauvin’s conviction for the murder of George Floyd, Carl repeatedly attacked Floyd as a “violent felon” and “thug,” writing that Floyd was “looking up from hell.” He also retweeted that any “statues in his honor are a disgrace and an embarrassment to our country.”
“I’m sorry, from the first moment, the #GeorgeFloyd case has been pure [clown face emoji] world. He was a violent felon, drug addict, and thug, who resisted lawful arrest and, like many of that description, met an unfortunate end,” he wrote in one of his April 2021 posts.
Floyd was convicted of felony armed robbery in Texas in 2007 and sentenced to five years in prison for the offense.
Carl also wrote dismissively about having to be “outraged” for Black men killed by law enforcement.

“The next criminal killed by police who I am supposed to be outraged for (but am not) is named Winston Smith, and all I’m going to say is 2021 needs to hire better scriptwriters,” he wrote in early June 2021.
Smith, a 32-year-old Black man, was killed by police officers in Minneapolis who were trying to arrest him on a state arrest warrant for possession of a firearm by a felon. A Hennepin County prosecutor twice declined to press charges against the officers who found they were justified in using deadly force.
Carl wrote similarly about Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, who was killed by a police officer.
“I didn’t think I could care less about a death than I did about that of violent drug addicted felon #GeorgeFloyd but gangster #DaunteWright may change my mind,” he wrote.
The police officer, Kim Potter, was later convicted of first-degree manslaughter and second-degree manslaughter at a jury trial and served 16 months in prison.
