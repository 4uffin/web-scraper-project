1Ô∏è‚É£ Drone dilemma
The US excels at building large, expensive weaponry, but most American soldiers lack the know-how for fighting with unmanned systems. That‚Äôs why the most advanced military in the world is playing catchup on the modern battlefield.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Youth movement
The Catholic Church is no stranger to resurrection. After decades of declining attendance and dwindling faith in much of the Western world, Roman Catholicism could be witnessing a revival, and it‚Äôs coming from an unexpected source.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Tackling insomnia
Sleep difficulties are common, but getting a good night‚Äôs rest isn‚Äôt just a matter of avoiding afternoon fatigue ‚Äî it could help protect against brain aging in the future, new research suggests.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Vision for the future
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a bold claim that people without smart glasses may one day be at a ‚Äúsignificant cognitive disadvantage.‚Äù His vision could come into focus during the Meta Connect conference, where the tech giant announces new products.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Nuns on the run
Three octogenarian nuns defied their diocese, ran away from a nursing home and returned to their former convent in Salzburg, Austria. The old residence no longer had electricity or running water, so supporters brought them supplies.
