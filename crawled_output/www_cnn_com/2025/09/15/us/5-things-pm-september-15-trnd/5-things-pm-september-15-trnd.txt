1️⃣ Drone dilemma
The US excels at building large, expensive weaponry, but most American soldiers lack the know-how for fighting with unmanned systems. That’s why the most advanced military in the world is playing catchup on the modern battlefield.
2️⃣ Youth movement
The Catholic Church is no stranger to resurrection. After decades of declining attendance and dwindling faith in much of the Western world, Roman Catholicism could be witnessing a revival, and it’s coming from an unexpected source.
3️⃣ Tackling insomnia
Sleep difficulties are common, but getting a good night’s rest isn’t just a matter of avoiding afternoon fatigue — it could help protect against brain aging in the future, new research suggests.
4️⃣ Vision for the future
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a bold claim that people without smart glasses may one day be at a “significant cognitive disadvantage.” His vision could come into focus during the Meta Connect conference, where the tech giant announces new products.
5️⃣ Nuns on the run
Three octogenarian nuns defied their diocese, ran away from a nursing home and returned to their former convent in Salzburg, Austria. The old residence no longer had electricity or running water, so supporters brought them supplies.
