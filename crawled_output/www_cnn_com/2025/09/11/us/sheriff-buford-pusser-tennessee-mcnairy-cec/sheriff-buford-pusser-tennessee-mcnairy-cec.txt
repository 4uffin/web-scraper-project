Movie hero or cold-blooded killer? A Tennessee county faces dark questions about its famous sheriff

Dennis Hathcock never believed the legend of Sheriff Buford Pusser – not for a second, he said.
In southwest Tennessee’s McNairy County, where he’s lived all his life, many hail the sheriff as a folk hero. But not Hathcock.
He never bought into the image of a fearless Pusser battling corruption and organized crime in this rural county near the Mississippi border. Nor did he buy the Hollywood version of Pusser as a righteous, club-wielding sheriff in the hit 1973 movie “Walking Tall” and its sequels.
“Never. Never,” said Hathcock, 75. “I knew Buford. A lot of things people say about him are movie fabrications. Well, except that he was big and tall.”
Over the years, the line between Pusser’s real life and the movie versions have blurred, making it difficult to separate fact from fiction, Hathcock said. More than 50 years after his death, Pusser remains a prominent presence in his hometown of Adamsville, Tennessee, where a museum displays artifacts from his life and an annual festival celebrates his legacy.
That’s why a bombshell revelation last month has left the community shaken. State investigators allege that Pusser staged an August 12, 1967, pre-dawn ambush that killed his wife, Pauline.
At the time, Pusser told authorities that gunmen angry over his crime crackdown pulled alongside his Plymouth Fury on a country road and opened fire at him and his wife. Pauline Mullins Pusser was fatally shot, and Pusser suffered a bullet wound to his jaw.

Now, investigators say that version of events is not true. At a news conference, prosecutors said they believe Pusser shot his wife and then staged his own injuries.
“This case is not about tearing down a legend. It’s about giving dignity and closure to Pauline and her family,” District Attorney Mark Davidson said at the news conference. “Truth matters. Justice matters, even 58 years later. Pauline deserves both.”
Pusser’s once-towering image is crumbling. Hathcock says he wasn’t surprised by the allegations.
But in McNairy County, residents now face a tough question: When your hero suddenly turns into a villain, do you rewrite history?

Before he wore a sheriff’s badge, Pusser was already larger than life. At 6-foot-6, he wrestled professionally in Chicago as “Buford the Bull.”
He met his wife during one of his bouts at the Buccaneer Club in Chicago, where he moonlighted as a bouncer, said Pauline’s cousin, Oakley Dean Baldwin.
“They dated for about six or eight months and got married,” he said.

After his wrestling career ended, the couple moved to Adamsville, where Pusser served as police chief and then at 26 became the county’s youngest-ever sheriff.
Pusser launched a war against moonshiners, gamblers and others who brought organized crime to the county, said Steve Sweat, a lifelong county resident and the state’s honorary Buford Pusser historian.
“Someone asked me how I became interested in Buford Pusser at such a young age, and I said it wasn’t any problem,” Sweat said. “Because every week, there was a new Buford story in a newspaper about moonshine-busting or catching robbers. He had a knack for being at the right place at the right time … like a comic book hero or something.”
But Hathcock, who was 16 when Pauline died, said he rode his motorcycle to the scene of the shooting that night. He called Pusser’s pattern of always being at the center of heroic violence too good to be true.
“There was never a witness to none of the big episodes that he got involved in,” he said, citing several residents who died in alleged confrontations with Pusser.
Hathcock said his late father was also embroiled in a bitter feud with the sheriff over a nightclub that he owned – among the various businesses Pusser targeted for alleged criminal activities.

But to Hollywood, Pusser’s defiant story was irresistible. “Walking Tall,” the 1973 action movie starring Joe Don Baker as Pusser, became a cult hit. Two sequels followed.
Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson starred in a 2004 remake loosely based on Pusser’s story, although the location and the character’s name were changed.
Pusser died in August 1974 after driving his Corvette off the road at a high speed. But the attention from Hollywood has made him a household name ever since in McNairy County, and especially in Adamsville.
Each May, an annual festival named after him draws crowds to the town of roughly 2,100 people, where his brick, ranch-style home – still filled with his furniture, photos and clothes – is preserved as a museum. It also features Pusser’s mangled Corvette, a rusting relic of his complicated legacy.
More than 50 years later, authorities re-examined the evidence around Pauline’s death
At a news conference last month, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said the case of Pauline Pusser’s killing remained cold for nearly six decades. No autopsy was conducted after her death in 1967.
But investigative efforts intensified in spring 2023 after authorities got a tip about a possible murder weapon in the case.
“That potential homicide weapon was provided to us … and really kind of took the investigation in a new direction with new vigor,” TBI director David Rausch said at last month’s news conference.
Investigators exhume Pauline Pusser's body in 2024. Authorities didn't conduct an autopsy after she was killed in 1967.

Last year, investigators exhumed Pauline Pusser’s body for an autopsy. Modern forensic work concluded that her husband’s account was not consistent with the physical evidence, authorities said. Rausch declined to provide details on whether the weapon matched autopsy results, saying that information will be disclosed when the case file is made public.
The blood spatter in Pusser’s car did not match the details of what he said happened, and ballistics suggested the crime scene was staged, investigators said. Pusser’s jaw wound appeared self-inflicted, and his wife had a fractured nose consistent with domestic abuse, they said.
Baldwin said his family had always wondered why the sheriff brought his wife on a late-night disturbance call. With that question apparently answered by the investigation, he wrote to the TBI last month on behalf of their relatives.
Davidson, the prosecutor, read the message at the press conference. “Thank you for giving Pauline a voice from her grave, ” it read.
“If he were alive today, we would present an indictment against Buford Pusser for the murder of his wife,” said Davidson, who oversees McNairy County.
Hathcock and Sweat both attended the news conference. But their reactions were remarkably different.
For Hathcock, the news was an answered prayer.
“I have waited for this day since I was 16 years old — the day when the truth would come out about Buford Pusser,” he said.
But Sweat dismissed investigators’ findings, calling them an “opinion” that would not change his view of Pusser.

“Since August 12, 1967, I’ve heard every kind of opinion and theory you can think of,” he said.
Sweat acknowledged Pusser’s flaws but emphasized what he said was his positive impact on the community and beyond.
“Buford Pusser worked hard to serve the people of McNairy County,” he said. “There are a lot of people in law enforcement today because of the ‘Walking Tall’ movies. Buford wasn’t perfect. … he was no saint. But he was a legend. He took his job seriously.”
Sweat said he keeps mementos of Pusser in a safe at his home, including a Bible that was in his Corvette when he died and shell casings from one of his crime scenes. He’s also built a replica of the sheriff’s car used in the first “Walking Tall” movie, he said.
With Pusser’s story back in the headlines, Sweat said he plans to launch tours. Visitors will see the spot where the ambush happened, Pusser’s old office, the cemetery where Pusser is buried and even the spot where his Corvette crashed and burned, he said.
As for which version of the story Sweat will tell? He’s not sure yet. What he does know is that it’ll be his truth: “The things that I know about, the truths of what I know,” he said.
Now the county is caught between honoring an old legend and accepting a new reality
Adamsville also hasn’t quite decided which version of Pusser’s story to tell.
Pusser’s legacy is a significant part of the town’s history, Adamsville Mayor Jackie Hamm told CNN.
“We approach these new findings with the seriousness and respect they deserve,” he said.
Hamm said he plans to host a community town hall to review and discuss the investigative findings.
“We want to be diligent and not make any hasty decisions until all findings have been carefully examined, and the community has had a chance to provide input. Only after this dialogue has taken place will I provide a formal statement on behalf of the city,” he said.

The Pusser museum posted on Facebook that it plans to continue operating as usual. Staffers there did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
But others, like Baldwin, a distant cousin of Pauline’s, have already started revising history.
Baldwin, a retired sheriff in North Carolina’s Wake County, said he began researching her death a decade ago. He interviewed witnesses and relatives and dug into court documents. He published an e-book in 2021, “Murder of Ms. Buford Pusser,” based on his findings.
“We were just looking for justice for Pauline,” he said. “I thought the TBI did a very shoddy investigation back in ‘67. But also they didn’t have the techniques that they have today with forensics and DNA.”
Last week, Baldwin released a new edition of his e-book with the latest findings about Pusser. He didn’t have to change much, he said.
“I just explained how I believe that he was involved,” he said. “I can say it now. Before, I was more insinuating.”
At last month’s press conference, Pauline’s brother, Griffon Mullins, thanked investigators for giving his family answers at last.
“If I only known now what I knew then, she would have never went back to Tennessee (with Pusser). She would have been right here with me,” said Mullins, who lives in Louisville, Kentucky. “I’m not totally shocked… I finally got closure after 57 years.”
For the Mullins family, the uncertainty is over. But for McNairy County, the questions are just beginning.
